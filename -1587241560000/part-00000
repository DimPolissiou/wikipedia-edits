Won by Hagler by third round knockout, the fight is considered by many to be among the finest boxing matches in history, due to its constant action, drama, and violent back-and-forth exchanges.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/apr/15/boxing-hagler-hearns-30-years-on</ref> \n\n==Background==\nBy 1985, \"Marvelous\" Marvin Hagler had been the undisputed champion of the middleweight division since September 27, 1980, after having been widely regarded as the No. 1 challenger for much of the late 1970s. His first two shots at the world middleweight title resulted in controversy: the first was an unpopular draw against then-champion [[Vito Antuofermo]] in 1979 (allowing Antuofermo to retain the title), and the second was a three-round technical [[knockout]] (TKO) of [[Alan Minter]], in London, which led to a riot by Minter's fans. The hard road to the middleweight championship, however, may have helped motivate Hagler to remain dominant during his reign.  Hagler was renowned for his conditioning and durability, suffering only one official knockdown in his career, against [[Juan Roldan|Juan Domingo Roldan]], an incident Hagler always insisted should have been ruled a slip.  By the time he fought Thomas Hearns, he had defended the title ten times, winning all but one by knockout; the sole Hagler defense that went the distance was a 15-round decision victory over [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]].  Hagler was then approaching the middleweight record of 14 title defenses, held by [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]].\n\nWhen Hagler vs. Hearns took place, Hearns had recently moved up from the welterweight to the junior middleweight to the middleweight  division.  Hearns was regarded as one of the hardest punchers of all time, winning 30 of his first 32 bouts by knockout. In Hearns's first title shot in 1980, he scored a spectacular second-round knockout over WBA champion [[Pipino Cuevas]]. Hearns defended that title three times before meeting [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] in a thrilling fight dubbed \"The Showdown.\" Hearns lost by technical knockout in the 14th round despite leading on all three scorecards. He then successfully campaigned at junior middleweight, winning the WBC title from [[Wilfred Ben\u00edtez]], and defeating [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]].  Hearns defeated several middleweights during this period, including [[Marcos Geraldo]] by first-round knockout. Geraldo had gone the distance against both Leonard and Hagler.\n\nGiven the pair's renowned punching power and the way both men had won their respective fights coming into the bout, it garnered significant media attention and fan interest around the world. It was held at the [[Caesars Palace]] hotel in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] on April 15, 1985. In the United States and [[Puerto Rico]], it was broadcast by [[Home Box Office|HBO]] (in Puerto Rico, also by [[WAPA America|Wapa canal 4]]) with [[Barry Tompkins]], Sugar Ray Leonard and [[Larry Merchant]], while [[Curt Gowdy]] served as host. [[Al Michaels]] and [[Al Bernstein]] acted as commentators for the closed circuit television for Top Rank. In the UK the fight was shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] with [[Reg Gutteridge]] and [[Donald Curry]] commentating.\n\nHearns received a massage before the fight, much to the chagrin of his trainer [[Emanuel Steward]]. In HBO's ''Legendary Nights: The Tale of Hagler-Hearns'', Steward stated that he felt the massage weakened Hearns' legs during the fight and led him to adopt a more aggressive approach than he normally would have.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n==The fight==\n===Round 1===\nHagler, normally a slow starter, stormed Hearns from the opening bell,  landing with many devastating right hands eventually pinning him to the ropes. Hearns threw his devastating right hand to Hagler's chin, stunning Hagler for a moment before Hagler was able to tie him up in a clinch. Seconds later, however, the two were trading power punches, with Hagler trying to get inside and to pin Hearns to the ropes again. In the process, he succeeded in stunning Hearns with a hard left hand. Hearns tied up Hagler again and tried to slow the pace by boxing rather than trading power punches with Hagler, who was still the aggressor. This lasted for only a moment, however. Before long the two once again started to trade power punches. (During these exchanges Hearns broke his right hand.) The slugfest continued for the better part of the next two and a half minutes as both fighters traded heavy blows with little regard for defense or pacing. Hagler developed a cut on his forehead but didn't slow as he pinned Hearns to the ropes and meted out more punishment, eventually hurting Hearns at the end of the round. Sportscaster Barry Tompkins, doing the blow-by-blow commentary for HBO's broadcast of the fight, yelled out, \"This is still only the first round!\" as the fighters traded heavy shots at round's end. [[Al Bernstein]] remarked, \"Perhaps one of the best opening rounds in middleweight history!\" It is considered by ''The Ring'' magazine to be the greatest round in boxing history, and it won round of the year honors for 1985. In a subsequent HBO broadcast featuring both Hagler and Hearns in studio commenting on the fight, Hearns revealed, \"that first round took everything I had, man.\" When asked in the ring after the bout if he was hurt by Hearns' first right hand, a blow that caused him to step back and then fall into a clinch, Hagler commented, \"He definitely tried to put the bomb on me... . He can punch... .\" The scorecards were split with Reno judge [[Herb Santos]] scoring the round 10-9 for Hagler, along with U.K judge Harry Gibbs while Dick Young of California had Hearns ahead 10-9. It was described as a war zone for both fighters.\n\n===Round 2===\nBy the beginning of the second round, it looked as though Hearns had no legs under him, as he slowed the pace by boxing Hagler. Hearns stumbled several times as he attempted to move around the ring and change direction, prompting HBO commentator Sugar Ray Leonard to note, \"I don't like the way Tommy's moving...a little rubbery-legged.\" In the studio broadcast of the fight, Hearns commented, \"My legs were gone, man. Even before I came out to fight, my legs felt weak.\" Hagler experimented by switching to orthodox style for a moment, but switched back to [[Southpaw (boxing)|southpaw]], as he found more success countering Hearns' [[jab]]. By the end of the round, Hagler pinned Hearns to the ropes, successfully landing a volley of punches. The action in round two had slowed from the blistering pace of round one.  Judges [[Herb Santos]] and Harry Gibbs again scored the round 10-9 for Hagler while judge Dick Young scored the round 10-9 for Hearns.\n\n===Third and final round===\nIn round three, Hearns again tried to set the pace.  About a minute into the round, the cut on Hagler's forehead inflicted in the first round opened up, resulting in a tremendous flow of blood down the middleweight champion's face.  \n\nReferee [[Richard Steele (referee)|Richard Steele]] halted the action to have the ringside physician examine Hagler. He informed Steele, \"No the cut's not bothering his sight, let him go.\"  Facing the new threat of losing the fight via stoppage on cuts, Hagler attacked Hearns with the aggression of the first round. A tremendous overhand left to the head drove Hearns back to the ropes. Hearns backed away, smiling so as to suggest the punch had not hurt him. Hagler landed a hard right hook high on Hearns' head. The blow staggered Hearns, who awkwardly stumbled backwards into the ropes, Hagler running after him in hot pursuit. The champion smashed a vicious right hand to Hearns' chin. Hearns went limp and fell forward, as Hagler landed two uppercuts. As Hearns fell face first to the canvas, Sugar Ray Leonard yelled into his microphone \"He's gone...he's gone!\"  \n\nHearns staggered to his feet at the count of nine, but he was unable to continue. Referee Steele stopped the bout as he held Hearns upright. The image of a blood-soaked Hagler being carried around the ring in victory by his handlers and Hearns being carried back to his corner in semi-consciousness remains to this day a graphic testimony of the intensity of \"The War.\" It was widely regarded as the pinnacle of Marvin Hagler's career and cemented his legacy as one of the greatest middleweights of all time.  At the time of the stoppage, judges [[Herb Santos]] and Harry Gibbs had Hagler ahead 20-18 while judge Dick Young had Hearns ahead 20-18.\n \nIn the immediate aftermath of the fight, [[Donald Curry]] (who was working for British television) was highly critical of the loser. He said \"Tommy fought the wrong fight. He should have started cautiously, lose the first couple of rounds. Don't get into a dogfight, but that's what he did. He got into a dogfight with Marvin and he lost.\"\n\nBritish fight publication [[Boxing News]] called it \"eight minutes of mayhem\", while ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' called the fight \"the most electrifying eight minutes ever,\" and it won [[Ring Magazine fights of the year|fight of the year]] for 1985, despite lasting only three rounds.\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-bef | before=KO3 [[Mustafa Hamsho]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Marvelous Marvin Hagler]]'s bouts\n        | years=April 15, 1985}}\n{{s-aft | after=KO11 [[John Mugabi]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|before=KO3 Fred Hutchings\n|title=[[Thomas Hearns]]' bouts\n|years=April 15, 1985\n|after=KO1 [[James Shuler]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\nReferee:  [[Richard Steele (referee)|Richard Steele]] of Las Vegas, Nevada\nJudges:   [[Herb Santos]] of Reno, Nevada, [[Harry Gibbs (referee)|Harry Gibbs]] of Britain, Dick Young of California.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hagler, Hearns}}\n[[Category:Boxing matches]]\n[[Category:1985 in boxing]]\n[[Category:Boxing in Las Vegas]]\n[[Category:1985 in sports in Nevada]]\n[[Category:April 1985 sports events in the United States]]\n[[Category:Caesars Palace]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Boxing competition}}\n{{more sources|date=March 2011}}\n{{Infobox Boxingmatch\n|fight date=April 15, 1985\n|Fight Name=\"The War\"\n|location=[[Caesars Palace]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]]\n|image=[[File:Hagler vs Hearns.jpg|230px]]\n|fighter1={{flagicon|USA}} Marvin Hagler\n|nickname1=\"Marvelous\"\n|record1=60-2-2 (50 KOs)\n|hometown1=[[Brockton, Massachusetts]], U.S.\n|recognition1=[[World Boxing Association|WBA]]/[[World Boxing Council|WBC]]/[[International Boxing Federation|IBF]]/[[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring]]/[[Lineal championship|Lineal]]<br>Undisputed Middleweight Champion\n|fighter2={{flagicon|USA}} Thomas Hearns\n|nickname2=\"The Hitman\"\n|record2=40-1 (34 KOs)\n|hometown2=[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], U.S.\n|recognition2=[[World Boxing Association|WBA]]/[[World Boxing Council|WBC]]/[[International Boxing Federation|IBF]]<br>#1 Ranked Middleweight\n|titles=<small>[[World Boxing Association|WBA]]/[[World Boxing Council|WBC]]/[[International Boxing Federation|IBF]]/[[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']]/[[Lineal championship|Lineal]] Middleweight Championships</small>\n}}\n'''Marvelous Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns''' (originally billed as \"The Fight\",<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Fight |journal=Caesar's Palace Official Program Magazine |date=April 15, 1985 |at=Cover |publisher=Seidman Productions |location=Lindenwold, NJ}}</ref> referred to afterward as \"'''The War'''\"{{cn|date=January 2018}}), was a world [[middleweight]] championship [[boxing]] match between [[undisputed champion]] [[Marvin Hagler]] and challenger [[Thomas Hearns]], the world junior middleweight champion, who had gone up in weight for the bout.

They decided to have the baby but marriage would be put off until after the Olympics in 1976. Leonard would continue to pursue his Olympic dream while she and the baby, Ray Charles Leonard Jr., lived with her parents. When Leonard boxed in the Olympics, he had a picture of Wilkinson taped to his sock.\n\nShortly before the Olympics, Wilkinson had filed an application to receive $156 a month in child support payments from [[Prince George's County, Maryland]]. She named Leonard as the father and the county's state attorney's office filed a civil suit against Leonard to establish paternity and get support payments for the child. Leonard learned of the suit several days after returning home from the Olympics. The headline in the ''[[Washington Star]]'' read, \"Sugar Ray Leonard Named in Welfare Dept. Paternity Suit\".<ref name= noble />{{rp|33\u201334, 43}}\n\nWilkinson went to the Olympics to watch Leonard box, but she did not tell him about the suit and never asked him for any money. \"I didn't feel like being bothered by all those complications by asking him for any money for support\", she said. Leonard pledged he would support his son, even if he had to scrap plans to attend college.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G-0cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NmcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2051,2385110&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+paternity&hl=en |title= Sugar Ray Admits to 'Little Ray'| work= Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date= August 6, 1976 |via= news.google.com | accessdate= April 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nLeonard had hoped to get lucrative endorsements following his gold medal win, but the negative publicity from the paternity suit chased off any big commercial possibilities. To make matters worse, his father was hospitalized with [[meningitis]] and his mother suffered a heart attack. With neither parent able to work, with his child and the mother of his child to support, and without any endorsement opportunities, Leonard decided to become a professional boxer.<ref name= noble />{{rp|63}}\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Early professional career===\nWhen Leonard decided to turn professional, Janks Morton introduced him to Mike Trainer, a friend of his who was an attorney. Trainer talked 24 of his friends and clients into underwriting Leonard's career with an investment of $21,000 to be repaid within four years at 8% interest. Trainer then made Leonard the sole stockholder in Sugar Ray Leonard, Inc. [[Angelo Dundee]], [[Muhammad Ali]]'s trainer, was brought in to be Leonard's trainer and manager. Many of the people being considered wanted absolute control and a cut somewhere near the manager's traditional 33%. Dundee had a different proposition. Although he would prescribe the training procedures, he would leave the day-to-day work to Dave Jacobs and Janks Morton. He would also choose Leonard's opponents. For his services, Dundee would get 15% of Leonard's purse.<ref name= noble />{{rp|65\u201368}}\n\nLeonard made his professional debut on February 5, 1977 before a crowd of 10,270 at the Civic Center in [[Baltimore]].

Leonard received $1 million and Benitez, a two-division champion with a record of 38\u20130\u20131, received $1.2 million.\n\nIt was a highly competitive and tactical battle. In the first round, Leonard rocked Benitez with a left hook that came off a jab and right cross. Late in the third, Leonard dropped Benitez on the seat of his pants with a stiff left jab. More embarrassed than hurt, Benitez got up quickly. Benitez started improving in the fourth, slipping numerous punches and finding the range with his right hand. \"I wasn't aware I was in a championship early because I hit him so easy\", Leonard said. \"But then he adjusted to my style. It was like looking in a mirror\".\n\nIn the sixth, there was an accidental clash of heads, which opened a cut on the forehead of Benitez. Blood flowed down his forehead and the bridge of his nose but stayed out of his eyes.\n\nLeonard landed the harder punches and had Benitez hurt several times late in the fight, but Leonard couldn't put him away. Benitez was very slick. \"No one, I mean no one, can make me miss punches like that\", Leonard said.\n\nGoing into the final round, Leonard led by scores of 137\u2013130, 137\u2013133, and 136\u2013134.

Dur\u00e1n, the former Undisputed World [[Lightweight]] Champion for 6 1/2 years, had a record of 71\u20131 and was the #1 [[welterweight]] contender and considered the best \"Pound for Pound\" fighter in the world. Dur\u00e1n received $1.5 million and Leonard, working for a percentage of the closed-circuit gate as well as a guarantee, received over $9 million.\n\nAngelo Dundee counseled Leonard to box, to move side to side and not to get caught on the ropes. However, Leonard decided to fight Dur\u00e1n's way. \"Flat-footed\", he said. \"I will not run.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\">{{cite news| first= William |last= Nack |url= https://www.si.com/vault/1980/06/30/824772/right-on-for-roberto-implacable-and-totally-relentless-in-pursuit-of-sugar-ray-leonard-duran-bludgeoned-and-bruised-his-way-to-the-welterweight-title |title= Right on for Roberto |work=Sports Illustrated| date=1980-06-30 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref>\n\nDur\u00e1n forced the issue and took the fight to Leonard, cutting off the ring and denying Leonard space to fight his fight. Dur\u00e1n attacked at almost every turn. Leonard battled back again and again, but he had to work just to find room to breathe and swing, at times simply to survive. In the second, Dur\u00e1n rocked Leonard with a left hook, sending him into the ropes. Leonard started to do better by the fifth round, finding some punching room and throwing numerous multi-punch combinations. The two fought with great intensity throughout the fight. According to Bill Nack:\n\n<blockquote>It was, from almost the opening salvo, a fight that belonged to Dur\u00e1n. The Panamanian seized the evening and gave it what shape and momentum it had. He took control, attacking and driving Leonard against the ropes, bulling him back, hitting him with lefts and rights to the body as he maneuvered the champion against the ropes from corner to corner. Always moving forward, he mauled and wrestled Leonard, scoring inside with hooks and rights. For three rounds Dur\u00e1n drove at Sugar Ray with a fury, and there were moments when it seemed the fight could not last five. Unable to get away, unable to counter and unable to slide away to open up the ring, Leonard seemed almost helpless under the assault. Now and then he got loose and countered\u2014left-right-left to Dur\u00e1n's bobbing head\u2014but he missed punches and could not work inside, could not jab, could not mount an offense to keep Dur\u00e1n at bay.<ref name= \"autogenerated1980\"/></blockquote>\n\nDur\u00e1n was awarded a unanimous decision, although it was mistakenly read as a majority decision in the ring. The scorecard of judge Angelo Poletti was incorrectly added and announced as 147\u2013147. He actually scored it 148\u2013147. In rounds, he had it three for Dur\u00e1n, two for Leonard, and ten even. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' called his scorecard \"a monument to indecision.\" Judges Raymond Baldeyrou and Harry Gibbs scored the fight 146\u2013144 and 145\u2013144, respectively. [[Associated Press]] had it 144\u2013141 for Dur\u00e1n, while ''[[The New York Times]]'' had Leonard ahead 144\u2013142.\n\n\"I did the best I could\", Leonard said. \"I think I pretty much fought from the heart.\" Asked if Leonard was the best he ever fought, Dur\u00e1n thought for a moment and then answered, \"Si, si.\" Dur\u00e1n said. \"He does have a heart.

I knew he would indulge himself, he'd gain 40\u201350 lbs and then sweat it off to make 147.\" Unlike the fight in Montreal, Leonard used his superior speed and movement to outbox and befuddle Dur\u00e1n. \"The whole fight, I was moving, I was moving\", Leonard said. \"And ''Voom!'' I snapped his head back with a jab. ''Voom!'' I snapped it back again. He tried to get me against the ropes, I'd pivot, spin off and ''Pow!'' Come under with a punch.\"\n\nIn round seven, Leonard started to taunt Dur\u00e1n. Leonard's most memorable punch came late in the round. Winding up his right hand, as if to throw a [[bolo punch]], Leonard snapped out a left jab and caught Dur\u00e1n flush in the face. \"It made his eyes water\", Leonard said. He continued to taunt Dur\u00e1n mercilessly. He stuck out his chin, inviting Dur\u00e1n to hit it. Dur\u00e1n hesitated. Leonard kept it up, continuing to move, stop, and mug.\n\nIn the closing seconds of the eighth round, Dur\u00e1n turned his back to Leonard and quit, saying to referee [[Octavio Meyran]], ''\"No M\u00e1s\"'' (English: \"No more\").

They fought before a live crowd of 23,618. Hearns was paid $5.1 million, and Leonard made over $11 million. The fight grossed over $35 million. The live gate was $5.9 million, and the revenue from pay-per-view was $7.5 million.\n\nHearns, 32\u20130 with 30 knockouts, won the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Welterweight Championship in 1980, scoring a second-round knockout of [[Jos\u00e9 Cuevas (boxer)|Jos\u00e9 \"Pipino\" Cuevas]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. He made three successful title defenses, stopping Luis Primera, Randy Shields, and Pablo Baez.\n\nThe fight began as expected, Leonard boxing from a distance and Hearns stalking. Leonard had difficulty with Hearns' long reach and sharp jab. By the end of round five, Leonard had a growing swelling under his left eye, and Hearns had built a considerable lead on the scorecards. Leonard, becoming more aggressive, hurt Hearns in the sixth with a left hook to the chin. Leonard battered Hearns in rounds six and seven, but Hearns regrouped. Hearns started to stick and move, and he started to pile up points again. The roles reversed: Leonard became the stalker and Hearns became the boxer. The fight billed as a classic showdown between a powerful knockout artist and the best boxer/puncher the welterweight division had seen in decades devolved into a tactical and boring fight.\n\nHearns won rounds nine through twelve on all three scorecards. Between rounds twelve and thirteen, Angelo Dundee told Leonard, \"You're blowing it, son! You're blowing it!\".\n\nLeonard, with a badly swollen left eye, came out roaring for the thirteenth round. After hurting Hearns with a right, Leonard exploded with a combination of punches. Hearns' legs were clearly gone and after more pressure from Leonard he was bundled through the ropes, no knockdown was given as it wasn't a punch that sent him there. Hearns managed to rise, but was dropped by a flurry of hard punches near the end of the round.\n\nIn round fourteen, after staggering Hearns with an overhand right, Leonard pinned Hearns against the ropes, where he unleashed another furious combination, prompting referee Davey Pearl to stop the contest and award Sugar Ray Leonard the Unified World Welterweight Championship. Hearns was leading by scores of 124\u2013122, 125\u2013122, and 125\u2013121.\n\nAfter the fight, there was controversy due to the scoring of rounds six and seven. Even though Leonard dominated, hurting Hearns and battering him, all three judges gave both rounds to Leonard by a 10\u20139 margin. Many felt that the [[10-point must system|ten-point must scoring system]] was not properly used and those rounds should have been scored 10\u20138.<ref>{{cite news|first= Pat |last= Putnam |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124814/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, September 28, 1981 |work=Sports Illustrated| date= 1981-09-28 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> Some also considered the stoppage premature.

Leonard came back to stop Howard in the ninth round, but the stoppage was disputed, with some feeling that the referee stopped the fight prematurely. Leonard was ahead on all three scorecards at the time of the stoppage. At the post-fight press conference, Leonard surprised everyone by announcing his retirement again, saying he just didn't have it anymore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O_8KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eVADAAAAIBAJ&pg=7143,2519858&dq=ray+leonard+kevin+howard&hl=en |title= Leonard knocked down, victories, then retires | work= The Courier |agency= UPI |via= news.google.com |date=1984-05-13 |accessdate=2018-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===Leonard vs. Hagler===\n{{main|Marvin Hagler vs. Sugar Ray Leonard}}\nOn March 10, 1986, [[Marvin Hagler]] knocked out [[John Mugabi]] in eleven rounds to retain the Undisputed World [[Middleweight]] Championship for the twelfth time and advance his record to 62\u20132\u20132. \"I was ringside\", Leonard said. \"I'm watching John 'The Beast' Mugabi outbox Hagler. Of all people, John 'The Beast' Mugabi.\" It was then that Leonard decided to come back and fight Hagler. He called Mike Trainer and said, \"I can beat Hagler\".\n\nOn May 1, 1986, Leonard announced on a Washington, D.C. talk show that he would return to the ring to fight Hagler. The announcement generated a lot of controversy because of Leonard's inactivity and eye injuries, yet it also excited many sports fans who had hoped to see them fight years earlier. Hagler took a few months to decide, then agreed to the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-04-05/news/8701220087_1_hagler-and-leonard-marvelous-marvin-hagler-fight |title=After A Year's Prefight, Bell Tolls For These | work= sun-sentinel.com |date=1987-04-05 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>\n\nThe fight, promoted as ''\"The Super Fight\"'' and ''\"The King of the Ring\"'', was scheduled for April 6, 1987, at [[Caesars Palace]] in Las Vegas. Leonard was guaranteed $11 million, and Hagler was guaranteed $12 million. Hagler was a heavy favorite. The odds started at 4\u20131, then settled at 3\u20131. A paying crowd 12,379 generated a live gate of $6.2 million. According to Bob Arum, the fight grossed $78 million (which equates to $170 million in 2016).\n\nThe original fight plan for Leonard was to go toe-to-toe with Hagler and try to cut him, but the plan changed about five days before the fight. Leonard got hit by sparring partner [[Quincy Taylor]] and was badly buckled. \"He almost knocked me out\", Leonard said. After that, Leonard decided to box Hagler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2694437 |title=Leonard's memories the stuff of legends |work= espn.go.com |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>\n\nMany were surprised that Hagler, a natural southpaw, opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance. After the quick and slick Leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards, Hagler started the third round as a southpaw. Hagler did better, but Leonard's superior speed and boxing skill still allowed him to control the fight. Hagler looked stiff and mechanical and missed the speedy Leonard time and again prompting CBS ringside commentator [[Gil Clancy]] to remark \"...and is he ever missing...Leonard isn't doing anything to make him miss, he's just missing!\"\n\nBy the fifth, Leonard, who was moving a lot, began to tire and Hagler started to get closer. Hagler buckled Leonard's knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round, which finished with Leonard on the ropes. Hagler continued to score somewhat effectively in round six. Leonard, having slowed down, was obliged to fight more and move less. However, he was able to outpunch Hagler along the ropes and got the better of several bristling exchanges. Hagler never seized total control of the fight as he had against Thomas Hearns two years earlier, when he brutalized Hearns and scored a third-round knockout. Hagler's punches lacked snap and, although he was scoring solidly to the body, he looked nothing like the powerful fighter who had dominated the middleweight division for the previous five years. Leonard's observation that the Hagler who beat John Mugabi was older and slower proved to be spot on.  In rounds seven and eight, Hagler's southpaw jab was landing solidly and Leonard's counter flurries were less frequent.\n\nRound nine was the most exciting round of the fight. Hagler hurt Leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner. Leonard looked to be in trouble, but he furiously fought his way out of the corner. The action see-sawed back and forth for the rest of the round, with each man having his moments. However, Hagler's moments were more spectacular and one of Hagler's cornermen: Roger Perron (in an interview that took place on an episode of [[HBO]]'s ''Legendary Nights'' episode segments in 2003) later stated that: \"the ninth round was probably Marvin (Hagler)'s, best round\".\n\nRound ten was tame by comparison, as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round but with Hagler having more spectacular moments. Despite Leonard's obvious fatigue, he boxed well in the eleventh. Every time Hagler scored, Leonard came back with something flashier and more eye-catching, if not as effective. But at that point in the fight, Hagler appeared to be slightly more ring-general and clearly more aggressive. Between rounds eleven and twelve, Leonard's trainer: [[Angelo Dundee]], implored Sugar Ray to get up off his stool yelling \"We got three minutes...new champ...new champ!\" Leonard yelled \"Yeah!\" and played to the screaming crowd. Hagler's corner was much more reserved prompting Clancy to comment: \"They're talking to him like it's an IBM meeting or something...no emotion.\" In the final round, Hagler continued to chase Leonard. He hit Leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner. Leonard responded with a furious flurry, landing few punches but whipping the upset-hoping crowd into a frenzy. Hagler backed off, and Leonard danced away with Hagler in pursuit. The fight ended with Hagler and Leonard exchanging along the ropes. At the final bell, even uniformed ringside security rushed into the ring applauding and lauding Leonard's effort.<ref>{{cite news| title= Sugar Ray...Still In Style| first= Nigel |last= Collins| work= The Ring| date= August 1987}}</ref>\n\nLeonard threw 629 punches and landed 306, while Hagler threw 792 and landed 291.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDC1430F93AA35757C0A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print |title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; No Hoosegow for JoJo Guerra| first= Ira| last= Berkow |work= The New York Times |date=1987-04-09 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>\n\nLeonard was awarded a controversial split-decision.

Many felt that Hagler deserved the decision because he was the aggressor and landed the harder punches. Scottish boxing journalist [[Hugh McIlvanney]] wrote that Leonard's plan was to \"steal rounds with a few flashy and carefully timed flurries...he was happy to exaggerate hand speed at the expense of power, and neither he nor two of the scorers seemed bothered by the fact that many of the punches landed on the champion's gloves and arms.\"<ref>{{cite news| first= Hugh |last= McIlvanney |url= https://www.si.com/vault/1987/04/20/115223/the-illusion-of-victory-another-view-of-the-leonard-hagler-decision |title=Sports Illustrated, April 20, 1987 |work=Sports Illustrated|date=1987-04-20 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>\n\nMany others felt that Leonard deservedly got the decision, arguing that Leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship. [[Jim Murray (sportswriter)|Jim Murray]], long-time sports columnist for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', wrote, \"It wasn't even close...He didn't just outpoint Hagler, he exposed him. He made him look like a guy chasing a bus. In snowshoes...Leonard repeatedly beat Hagler to the punch. When he did, he hit harder. He hit more often...He made Hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his career\u2014a brawler, a swarmer, a man who could club you to death only if you stood there and let him.

They fought for Lalonde's WBC [[Light Heavyweight]] Championship and the newly created WBC [[Super Middleweight]] Championship, which meant that Lalonde had to make 168&nbsp;lbs. Many were critical of the fact that Lalonde's light heavyweight title was on the line when the weight limit of the fight with Leonard was at 168 pounds, and critical of Leonard for stipulating that his opponent\u2014a natural 175 pounder\u2014should weigh less than his usual fighting weight, which could possibly weaken him. However, Lalonde later told [[HBO]]'s [[Larry Merchant]] that he didn't have any trouble making weight.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4_LR7s-Ui4] HBO \"Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Donny Lalonde\"</ref>\n\nLalonde, 31\u20132 with 26 knockouts, was guaranteed at least $6 million and Leonard was guaranteed over $10 million.\n\nThis would be Leonard's first professional fight without [[Angelo Dundee]]. For Leonard's fight with Hagler, Dundee worked without a contract and received $175,000, which was less than 2% of Leonard's purse. Dundee was unhappy with that amount. He requested a contract for the Lalonde fight and Leonard refused. \"I don't have contracts. My word is my bond\", Leonard said.

He rose but was soon down again, and the fight was stopped. Judges Chuck Giampa and Franz Marti had Leonard ahead by scores of 77\u201374 and 77\u201375, respectively.

Camacho, a light-hitting southpaw, was a three-time world champion with a record of 62\u20133\u20131. However, Camacho was also considered to be past his prime. Leonard decided to fight Camacho after commentating on Camacho's fight with the 45-year-old [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] the previous year, describing the disputed unanimous decision as \"an early Christmas gift\".\n\nLeonard blamed his poor performance against Norris on lack of motivation, a rib injury, moving down in weight, and divorce, which was being litigated while he was in training. \"It was stupid for me to fight Norris at 154 lbs\", Leonard said. \"This is different. I'm in the best shape possible.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/26/sports/leonard-s-corner-keeps-game-plan-draped-in-secrecy.html |title=The New York Times, February 26, 1997 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1997-02-26 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |first=Clifton |last=Brown}}</ref>\n\nFor the Camacho fight, Leonard had a new trainer, Adrian Davis. \"He's a great trainer, a throwback\", Leonard said. \"He has really helped me get ready.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/27/sports/before-the-first-bell-rings-the-jabbing-begins.html?pagewanted=1 |title=The New York Times, February 27, 1997 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1997-02-27 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |first=Clifton |last=Brown}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1997, it was announced that Leonard had been voted into the [[International Boxing Hall Of Fame]] in [[Canastota, New York]]. The rules state that a boxer must be retired for five years before being eligible for induction.

Camacho applied pressure from the opening bell and started to score well in the third. He continued to score well in the fourth and opened a cut above Leonard's right eye. In the fifth, Camacho dropped Leonard with a right followed by two left uppercuts. Leonard got up, but was unable to ward off Camacho. The referee stopped the fight with Camacho teeing off on a defenseless Leonard on the ropes. It was the only time in Leonard's career that he was knocked out.\n\nAfterward, Leonard retired again, saying, \"For sure, my career is definitely over for me in the ring.\" However, less than a week after the fight, Leonard said he planned to fight again. He blamed his loss on a torn right calf muscle. His doctor suggested that he cancel the fight, but Leonard wanted to go through with it.

Dave Jacobs, a former boxer, and Janks Morton volunteered as boxing coaches. Roger won some trophies and showed them off in front of Ray, goading him to start boxing.\n\nIn 1972, Leonard boxed in the [[featherweight]] quarterfinals of the National [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] Tournament, losing by decision to Jerome Artis. It was his first defeat. Later that year, he boxed in the Eastern Olympic Trials.

They decided to have the baby but marriage would be put off until after the Olympics in 1976. Leonard would continue to pursue his Olympic dream while she and the baby, Ray Charles Leonard Jr., lived with her parents. When Leonard boxed in the Olympics, he had a picture of Wilkinson taped to his sock.\n\nShortly before the Olympics, Wilkinson had filed an application to receive $156 a month in child support payments from [[Prince George's County, Maryland]]. She named Leonard as the father and the county's state attorney's office filed a civil suit against Leonard to establish paternity and get support payments for the child. Leonard learned of the suit several days after returning home from the Olympics. The headline in the ''[[Washington Star]]'' read, \"Sugar Ray Leonard Named in Welfare Dept. Paternity Suit\".<ref name= noble />{{rp|33\u201334, 43}}\n\nWilkinson went to the Olympics to watch Leonard box, but she did not tell him about the suit and never asked him for any money. \"I didn't feel like being bothered by all those complications by asking him for any money for support\", she said.

To make matters worse, his father was hospitalized with [[meningitis]] and his mother suffered a heart attack. With neither parent able to work, with his child and the mother of his child to support, and without any endorsement opportunities, Leonard decided to become a professional boxer.<ref name= noble />{{rp|63}}\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Early professional career===\nWhen Leonard decided to turn professional, Janks Morton introduced him to Mike Trainer, a friend of his who was an attorney. Trainer talked 24 of his friends and clients into underwriting Leonard's career with an investment of $21,000 to be repaid within four years at 8% interest. Trainer then made Leonard the sole stockholder in Sugar Ray Leonard, Inc. [[Angelo Dundee]], [[Muhammad Ali]]'s trainer, was brought in to be Leonard's trainer and manager. Many of the people being considered wanted absolute control and a cut somewhere near the manager's traditional 33%. Dundee had a different proposition. Although he would prescribe the training procedures, he would leave the day-to-day work to Dave Jacobs and Janks Morton. He would also choose Leonard's opponents. For his services, Dundee would get 15% of Leonard's purse.<ref name= noble />{{rp|65\u201368}}\n\nLeonard made his professional debut on February 5, 1977 before a crowd of 10,270 at the Civic Center in [[Baltimore]].

There was a capacity crowd of about 4,600. Leonard received $1 million and Benitez, a two-division champion with a record of 38\u20130\u20131, received $1.2 million.\n\nIt was a highly competitive and tactical battle. In the first round, Leonard rocked Benitez with a left hook that came off a jab and right cross. Late in the third, Leonard dropped Benitez on the seat of his pants with a stiff left jab. More embarrassed than hurt, Benitez got up quickly. Benitez started improving in the fourth, slipping numerous punches and finding the range with his right hand. \"I wasn't aware I was in a championship early because I hit him so easy\", Leonard said. \"But then he adjusted to my style. It was like looking in a mirror\".\n\nIn the sixth, there was an accidental clash of heads, which opened a cut on the forehead of Benitez. Blood flowed down his forehead and the bridge of his nose but stayed out of his eyes.\n\nLeonard landed the harder punches and had Benitez hurt several times late in the fight, but Leonard couldn't put him away. Benitez was very slick. \"No one, I mean no one, can make me miss punches like that\", Leonard said.\n\nGoing into the final round, Leonard led by scores of 137\u2013130, 137\u2013133, and 136\u2013134.

Dur\u00e1n, the former Undisputed World [[Lightweight]] Champion for 6 1/2 years, had a record of 71\u20131 and was the #1 [[welterweight]] contender and considered the best \"Pound for Pound\" fighter in the world. Dur\u00e1n received $1.5 million and Leonard, working for a percentage of the closed-circuit gate as well as a guarantee, received over $9 million.\n\nAngelo Dundee counseled Leonard to box, to move side to side and not to get caught on the ropes. However, Leonard decided to fight Dur\u00e1n's way. \"Flat-footed\", he said. \"I will not run.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1980\">{{cite news| first= William |last= Nack |url= https://www.si.com/vault/1980/06/30/824772/right-on-for-roberto-implacable-and-totally-relentless-in-pursuit-of-sugar-ray-leonard-duran-bludgeoned-and-bruised-his-way-to-the-welterweight-title |title= Right on for Roberto |work=Sports Illustrated| date=1980-06-30 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref>\n\nDur\u00e1n forced the issue and took the fight to Leonard, cutting off the ring and denying Leonard space to fight his fight. Dur\u00e1n attacked at almost every turn. Leonard battled back again and again, but he had to work just to find room to breathe and swing, at times simply to survive. In the second, Dur\u00e1n rocked Leonard with a left hook, sending him into the ropes. Leonard started to do better by the fifth round, finding some punching room and throwing numerous multi-punch combinations. The two fought with great intensity throughout the fight. According to Bill Nack:\n\n<blockquote>It was, from almost the opening salvo, a fight that belonged to Dur\u00e1n. The Panamanian seized the evening and gave it what shape and momentum it had. He took control, attacking and driving Leonard against the ropes, bulling him back, hitting him with lefts and rights to the body as he maneuvered the champion against the ropes from corner to corner. Always moving forward, he mauled and wrestled Leonard, scoring inside with hooks and rights. For three rounds Dur\u00e1n drove at Sugar Ray with a fury, and there were moments when it seemed the fight could not last five. Unable to get away, unable to counter and unable to slide away to open up the ring, Leonard seemed almost helpless under the assault. Now and then he got loose and countered\u2014left-right-left to Dur\u00e1n's bobbing head\u2014but he missed punches and could not work inside, could not jab, could not mount an offense to keep Dur\u00e1n at bay.<ref name= \"autogenerated1980\"/></blockquote>\n\nDur\u00e1n was awarded a unanimous decision, although it was mistakenly read as a majority decision in the ring. The scorecard of judge Angelo Poletti was incorrectly added and announced as 147\u2013147. He actually scored it 148\u2013147. In rounds, he had it three for Dur\u00e1n, two for Leonard, and ten even. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' called his scorecard \"a monument to indecision.\" Judges Raymond Baldeyrou and Harry Gibbs scored the fight 146\u2013144 and 145\u2013144, respectively. [[Associated Press]] had it 144\u2013141 for Dur\u00e1n, while ''[[The New York Times]]'' had Leonard ahead 144\u2013142.\n\n\"I did the best I could\", Leonard said. \"I think I pretty much fought from the heart.\" Asked if Leonard was the best he ever fought, Dur\u00e1n thought for a moment and then answered, \"Si, si.\" Dur\u00e1n said. \"He does have a heart.

I knew he would indulge himself, he'd gain 40\u201350 lbs and then sweat it off to make 147.\" Unlike the fight in Montreal, Leonard used his superior speed and movement to outbox and befuddle Dur\u00e1n. \"The whole fight, I was moving, I was moving\", Leonard said. \"And ''Voom!'' I snapped his head back with a jab. ''Voom!'' I snapped it back again. He tried to get me against the ropes, I'd pivot, spin off and ''Pow!'' Come under with a punch.\"\n\nIn round seven, Leonard started to taunt Dur\u00e1n. Leonard's most memorable punch came late in the round. Winding up his right hand, as if to throw a [[bolo punch]], Leonard snapped out a left jab and caught Dur\u00e1n flush in the face. \"It made his eyes water\", Leonard said. He continued to taunt Dur\u00e1n mercilessly. He stuck out his chin, inviting Dur\u00e1n to hit it. Dur\u00e1n hesitated.

He staggered Bonds with a right in the fourth round and dropped him with a follow-up combination. Bonds got up and continued to move, with Leonard in pursuit. Leonard dropped him again in the tenth.

They fought before a live crowd of 23,618. Hearns was paid $5.1 million, and Leonard made over $11 million. The fight grossed over $35 million. The live gate was $5.9 million, and the revenue from pay-per-view was $7.5 million.\n\nHearns, 32\u20130 with 30 knockouts, won the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Welterweight Championship in 1980, scoring a second-round knockout of [[Jos\u00e9 Cuevas (boxer)|Jos\u00e9 \"Pipino\" Cuevas]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. He made three successful title defenses, stopping Luis Primera, Randy Shields, and Pablo Baez.\n\nThe fight began as expected, Leonard boxing from a distance and Hearns stalking. Leonard had difficulty with Hearns' long reach and sharp jab. By the end of round five, Leonard had a growing swelling under his left eye, and Hearns had built a considerable lead on the scorecards. Leonard, becoming more aggressive, hurt Hearns in the sixth with a left hook to the chin. Leonard battered Hearns in rounds six and seven, but Hearns regrouped. Hearns started to stick and move, and he started to pile up points again. The roles reversed: Leonard became the stalker and Hearns became the boxer. The fight billed as a classic showdown between a powerful knockout artist and the best boxer/puncher the welterweight division had seen in decades devolved into a tactical and boring fight.\n\nHearns won rounds nine through twelve on all three scorecards. Between rounds twelve and thirteen, Angelo Dundee told Leonard, \"You're blowing it, son! You're blowing it!\".\n\nLeonard, with a badly swollen left eye, came out roaring for the thirteenth round. After hurting Hearns with a right, Leonard exploded with a combination of punches. Hearns' legs were clearly gone and after more pressure from Leonard he was bundled through the ropes, no knockdown was given as it wasn't a punch that sent him there. Hearns managed to rise, but was dropped by a flurry of hard punches near the end of the round.\n\nIn round fourteen, after staggering Hearns with an overhand right, Leonard pinned Hearns against the ropes, where he unleashed another furious combination, prompting referee Davey Pearl to stop the contest and award Sugar Ray Leonard the Unified World Welterweight Championship. Hearns was leading by scores of 124\u2013122, 125\u2013122, and 125\u2013121.\n\nAfter the fight, there was controversy due to the scoring of rounds six and seven. Even though Leonard dominated, hurting Hearns and battering him, all three judges gave both rounds to Leonard by a 10\u20139 margin. Many felt that the [[10-point must system|ten-point must scoring system]] was not properly used and those rounds should have been scored 10\u20138.<ref>{{cite news|first= Pat |last= Putnam |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124814/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated, September 28, 1981 |work=Sports Illustrated| date= 1981-09-28 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> Some also considered the stoppage premature. Veteran ringside commentator [[Don Dunphy]] said \"They're stopping the fight. I don't believe it.

Leonard came back to stop Howard in the ninth round, but the stoppage was disputed, with some feeling that the referee stopped the fight prematurely. Leonard was ahead on all three scorecards at the time of the stoppage. At the post-fight press conference, Leonard surprised everyone by announcing his retirement again, saying he just didn't have it anymore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O_8KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eVADAAAAIBAJ&pg=7143,2519858&dq=ray+leonard+kevin+howard&hl=en |title= Leonard knocked down, victories, then retires | work= The Courier |agency= UPI |via= news.google.com |date=1984-05-13 |accessdate=2018-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===Leonard vs. Hagler===\n{{main|Marvin Hagler vs. Sugar Ray Leonard}}\nOn March 10, 1986, [[Marvin Hagler]] knocked out [[John Mugabi]] in eleven rounds to retain the Undisputed World [[Middleweight]] Championship for the twelfth time and advance his record to 62\u20132\u20132. \"I was ringside\", Leonard said. \"I'm watching John 'The Beast' Mugabi outbox Hagler. Of all people, John 'The Beast' Mugabi.\" It was then that Leonard decided to come back and fight Hagler. He called Mike Trainer and said, \"I can beat Hagler\".\n\nOn May 1, 1986, Leonard announced on a Washington, D.C. talk show that he would return to the ring to fight Hagler. The announcement generated a lot of controversy because of Leonard's inactivity and eye injuries, yet it also excited many sports fans who had hoped to see them fight years earlier. Hagler took a few months to decide, then agreed to the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-04-05/news/8701220087_1_hagler-and-leonard-marvelous-marvin-hagler-fight |title=After A Year's Prefight, Bell Tolls For These | work= sun-sentinel.com |date=1987-04-05 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>\n\nThe fight, promoted as ''\"The Super Fight\"'' and ''\"The King of the Ring\"'', was scheduled for April 6, 1987, at [[Caesars Palace]] in Las Vegas. Leonard was guaranteed $11 million, and Hagler was guaranteed $12 million. Hagler was a heavy favorite. The odds started at 4\u20131, then settled at 3\u20131. A paying crowd 12,379 generated a live gate of $6.2 million. According to Bob Arum, the fight grossed $78 million (which equates to $170 million in 2016).\n\nThe original fight plan for Leonard was to go toe-to-toe with Hagler and try to cut him, but the plan changed about five days before the fight. Leonard got hit by sparring partner [[Quincy Taylor]] and was badly buckled. \"He almost knocked me out\", Leonard said. After that, Leonard decided to box Hagler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2694437 |title=Leonard's memories the stuff of legends |work= espn.go.com |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>\n\nMany were surprised that Hagler, a natural southpaw, opened the fight boxing out of an orthodox stance. After the quick and slick Leonard won the first two rounds on all three scorecards, Hagler started the third round as a southpaw. Hagler did better, but Leonard's superior speed and boxing skill still allowed him to control the fight. Hagler looked stiff and mechanical and missed the speedy Leonard time and again prompting CBS ringside commentator [[Gil Clancy]] to remark \"...and is he ever missing...Leonard isn't doing anything to make him miss, he's just missing!\"\n\nBy the fifth, Leonard, who was moving a lot, began to tire and Hagler started to get closer. Hagler buckled Leonard's knees with a right uppercut near the end of the round, which finished with Leonard on the ropes. Hagler continued to score somewhat effectively in round six. Leonard, having slowed down, was obliged to fight more and move less. However, he was able to outpunch Hagler along the ropes and got the better of several bristling exchanges. Hagler never seized total control of the fight as he had against Thomas Hearns two years earlier, when he brutalized Hearns and scored a third-round knockout. Hagler's punches lacked snap and, although he was scoring solidly to the body, he looked nothing like the powerful fighter who had dominated the middleweight division for the previous five years. Leonard's observation that the Hagler who beat John Mugabi was older and slower proved to be spot on.  In rounds seven and eight, Hagler's southpaw jab was landing solidly and Leonard's counter flurries were less frequent.\n\nRound nine was the most exciting round of the fight. Hagler hurt Leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner. Leonard looked to be in trouble, but he furiously fought his way out of the corner. The action see-sawed back and forth for the rest of the round, with each man having his moments. However, Hagler's moments were more spectacular and one of Hagler's cornermen: Roger Perron (in an interview that took place on an episode of [[HBO]]'s ''Legendary Nights'' episode segments in 2003) later stated that: \"the ninth round was probably Marvin (Hagler)'s, best round\".\n\nRound ten was tame by comparison, as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round but with Hagler having more spectacular moments. Despite Leonard's obvious fatigue, he boxed well in the eleventh. Every time Hagler scored, Leonard came back with something flashier and more eye-catching, if not as effective. But at that point in the fight, Hagler appeared to be slightly more ring-general and clearly more aggressive. Between rounds eleven and twelve, Leonard's trainer: [[Angelo Dundee]], implored Sugar Ray to get up off his stool yelling \"We got three minutes...new champ...new champ!\" Leonard yelled \"Yeah!\" and played to the screaming crowd. Hagler's corner was much more reserved prompting Clancy to comment: \"They're talking to him like it's an IBM meeting or something...no emotion.\" In the final round, Hagler continued to chase Leonard. He hit Leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner. Leonard responded with a furious flurry, landing few punches but whipping the upset-hoping crowd into a frenzy. Hagler backed off, and Leonard danced away with Hagler in pursuit. The fight ended with Hagler and Leonard exchanging along the ropes. At the final bell, even uniformed ringside security rushed into the ring applauding and lauding Leonard's effort.<ref>{{cite news| title= Sugar Ray...Still In Style| first= Nigel |last= Collins| work= The Ring| date= August 1987}}</ref>\n\nLeonard threw 629 punches and landed 306, while Hagler threw 792 and landed 291.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDC1430F93AA35757C0A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print |title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; No Hoosegow for JoJo Guerra| first= Ira| last= Berkow |work= The New York Times |date=1987-04-09 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>\n\nLeonard was awarded a controversial split-decision.

Many felt that Hagler deserved the decision because he was the aggressor and landed the harder punches. Scottish boxing journalist [[Hugh McIlvanney]] wrote that Leonard's plan was to \"steal rounds with a few flashy and carefully timed flurries...he was happy to exaggerate hand speed at the expense of power, and neither he nor two of the scorers seemed bothered by the fact that many of the punches landed on the champion's gloves and arms.\"<ref>{{cite news| first= Hugh |last= McIlvanney |url= https://www.si.com/vault/1987/04/20/115223/the-illusion-of-victory-another-view-of-the-leonard-hagler-decision |title=Sports Illustrated, April 20, 1987 |work=Sports Illustrated|date=1987-04-20 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>\n\nMany others felt that Leonard deservedly got the decision, arguing that Leonard landed more punches and showed better defense and ring generalship. [[Jim Murray (sportswriter)|Jim Murray]], long-time sports columnist for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', wrote, \"It wasn't even close...He didn't just outpoint Hagler, he exposed him. He made him look like a guy chasing a bus. In snowshoes...Leonard repeatedly beat Hagler to the punch. When he did, he hit harder. He hit more often...He made Hagler into what he perceived him to be throughout his career\u2014a brawler, a swarmer, a man who could club you to death only if you stood there and let him.

For Leonard's fight with Hagler, Dundee worked without a contract and received $175,000, which was less than 2% of Leonard's purse. Dundee was unhappy with that amount. He requested a contract for the Lalonde fight and Leonard refused. \"I don't have contracts. My word is my bond\", Leonard said. Janks Morton and Dave Jacobs trained Leonard for the Lalonde fight.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mQAQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DJADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6857,1391955&dq=leonard+dundee+lalonde+janks&hl=en |title=Parting of the Ways: Leonard and Dundee Split Over Money| work= New Sunday Times| via= news.google.com |date=1988-10-21 |accessdate=2018-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/06/sports/sports-of-the-times-leonard-s-missing-voice.html?pagewanted=1 |title= Sports of The Times; Leonard's Missing Voice\n| first= Dave| last= Anderson| work= The New York Times |date=1988-11-06 |accessdate=2018-04-02}}</ref>\n\nLalonde's size and awkwardness troubled Leonard.

Leonard fired back and hurt Lalonde with a right. He drove him to the ropes and unleashed a furious assault. Lalonde tried to tie up Leonard, but got dropped with a powerful left hook. He rose but was soon down again, and the fight was stopped. Judges Chuck Giampa and Franz Marti had Leonard ahead by scores of 77\u201374 and 77\u201375, respectively.

Early in the seventh round, Hearns hurt Leonard but punched himself out going for the knockout. With Hearns fatigued, Leonard came back and had a strong finish to the round. Rounds nine and ten were good rounds for Leonard, but he ran into trouble in the eleventh round. Three booming rights from Hearns sent Leonard down for the second time in the fight. Knowing he needed a big finish, Leonard fought furiously and had a big final round.\n\nThe judges scored the fight a draw and Leonard retained the title. Judge Jerry Roth scored the fight 113\u2013112 for Hearns, Judge Tom Kazmarek scored it 113\u2013112 for Leonard, and Judge Dalby Shirley scored it 112\u2013112. Shirley was the only judge to give Leonard a 10\u20138 margin in the twelfth. If he had scored it 10\u20139, as his two colleagues did, Hearns would have won by a split decision.

Camacho, a light-hitting southpaw, was a three-time world champion with a record of 62\u20133\u20131. However, Camacho was also considered to be past his prime. Leonard decided to fight Camacho after commentating on Camacho's fight with the 45-year-old [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] the previous year, describing the disputed unanimous decision as \"an early Christmas gift\".\n\nLeonard blamed his poor performance against Norris on lack of motivation, a rib injury, moving down in weight, and divorce, which was being litigated while he was in training. \"It was stupid for me to fight Norris at 154 lbs\", Leonard said. \"This is different.

Camacho applied pressure from the opening bell and started to score well in the third. He continued to score well in the fourth and opened a cut above Leonard's right eye. In the fifth, Camacho dropped Leonard with a right followed by two left uppercuts. Leonard got up, but was unable to ward off Camacho. The referee stopped the fight with Camacho teeing off on a defenseless Leonard on the ropes. It was the only time in Leonard's career that he was knocked out.\n\nAfterward, Leonard retired again, saying, \"For sure, my career is definitely over for me in the ring.\" However, less than a week after the fight, Leonard said he planned to fight again. He blamed his loss on a torn right calf muscle. His doctor suggested that he cancel the fight, but Leonard wanted to go through with it.
