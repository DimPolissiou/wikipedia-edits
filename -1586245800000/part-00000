The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies.

Wings are dark grey with varying levels of yellow highlighting. The ventral feathering is light grey to white with light grey scalloping on the chest. The feathering surrounding the eye is black. The beak and bare skin patch around the eyes are bright yellow, and the iris is brown. Legs are also yellow, though shade and brightness varies. Fledgling birds have undefined, fluffy light grey chests without scalloping. Immature birds can be identified in the hand by retained juvenile remiges and rectrices, which are more brownish.<ref name=\"BirdInTheHand\" /> Yellow-throated miners are distinctive from the other miners by their clean white rump, instead of the continuous grey from the back that the noisy and black-eared miners have. The white-rump is clearly visible as yellow-throated miners are flying away, so this feature is often used in the field where two miner species overlap.  Yellow-throated miners have a varying amount of yellow highlighting above and below the beak on the forehead and chin, as well as on the sides of the throat. This differs from noisy miners which have white above the beak and no yellow highlighting on the  forehead or neck, but can have a small amount of yellow on the chin. Yellow-throated miners have paler feathering on the lower jaw compared to the throat, while pure black-eared miners have darker feathering on the lower jaw compared to that of the throat.

As with the other miner species, they are known to be very aggressive to other birds, particularly smaller insectivores and honeyeaters.

There is pain originating in the elbow joint from mild to severe which can spread to the rest of the arm. \nIf the bursa is infected, there also will be prominent redness and the skin will feel very warm. Another symptom would include the infected bursa possibly opening spontaneously and draining [[pus]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Causes==\nYears and years of being a shite pool player combined with being a shite electrician can cause this disease where you elbow looks like a hookers kneecap.\n\nAs a reaction to injury, the lining of the bursa becomes inflamed. It then secretes a much greater than normal amount of fluid into the closed cavity of the bursa, from where it has nowhere to go. The bursa therefore inflates, producing a swelling over the proximal end of the ulna which is usually inflamed and tender.\n\nAnother possible cause of inflammation of the bursa is [[infection]], which can usually (but not always) be traced to a crack or other lesion in the skin which allowed for bacteria of the normal [[skin flora]] to invade deeper layers of tissue.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00028 |title=Elbow (Olecranon) Bursitis -OrthoInfo - AAOS |publisher=Orthoinfo.aaos.org |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}</ref>\n\nThis bursa is located just over the extensor aspect of the extreme [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] end of the [[ulna]]. In common with other bursae, it is impalpable and contains only a very small amount of fluid in its normal state, and fulfills the function of facilitating the joint's movement by enabling anatomical structures to glide more easily over each other.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis is usually based on symptoms.<ref name=Mer2018/> If there is concern of infection the fluid should be drained and tested.<ref name=AO2018/>\n\n==Treatments==\n===Non-surgical treatments===\nConservative management of minor cases involves icing, a compression bandage, and avoidance of the aggravating activity.  This can also be augmented with oral or topical anti-inflammatory medications such as [[NSAIDs]].  Elbow padding can also be used for symptomatic relief.  Treatment for more severe cases may include aspirating the excess bursa fluid with a syringe (draining of the bursa), or injecting into the bursa a [[hydrocortisone]] type medication which is aimed at relieving the inflammation and preventing further accumulation of fluid.\n\nIn case of infection, the bursitis should be treated with an [[antibiotic]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Surgery===\nIf the fluid continues to return after multiple drainings or the bursa is constantly causing pain, surgery<ref>[http://www.eorthopod.com/public/patient_education/6474/olecranon_bursitis.html# eOrthopod - Olecranon Bursitis Surgery]</ref> to remove the bursa is an option. The minor operation removes the bursa from the elbow and is left to regrow but at a normal size over a period of ten to fourteen days.

There is pain originating in the elbow joint from mild to severe which can spread to the rest of the arm. \nIf the bursa is infected, there also will be prominent redness and the skin will feel very warm. Another symptom would include the infected bursa possibly opening spontaneously and draining [[pus]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:Hard blow to the tip of the elbow.jpg|thumb|Hard blow to the tip of the elbow on a wall]]\n[[Bursitis]] normally develops as a result either of a single injury to the elbow (for example, a hard blow to the tip of the elbow), or perhaps more commonly due to repeated minor injuries, such as repeated leaning on the point of the elbow on a hard surface. The chance of developing bursitis is higher if one's job or hobby involves a repetitive movement (for example, tennis, golf, or even repetitive computer work involving leaning on one's elbow).<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Bursitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx NHS direct - Bursitis]</ref> The likelihood of developing the condition is increased as one gets older.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bursitis/basics/risk-factors/con-20015102 Mayo Clinic - Bursitis risk factors]</ref>\n\nAs a reaction to injury, the lining of the bursa becomes inflamed. It then secretes a much greater than normal amount of fluid into the closed cavity of the bursa, from where it has nowhere to go. The bursa therefore inflates, producing a swelling over the proximal end of the ulna which is usually inflamed and tender.\n\nAnother possible cause of inflammation of the bursa is [[infection]], which can usually (but not always) be traced to a crack or other lesion in the skin which allowed for bacteria of the normal [[skin flora]] to invade deeper layers of tissue.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00028 |title=Elbow (Olecranon) Bursitis -OrthoInfo - AAOS |publisher=Orthoinfo.aaos.org |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}</ref>\n\nThis bursa is located just over the extensor aspect of the extreme [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] end of the [[ulna]]. In common with other bursae, it is impalpable and contains only a very small amount of fluid in its normal state, and fulfills the function of facilitating the joint's movement by enabling anatomical structures to glide more easily over each other.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis is usually based on symptoms.<ref name=Mer2018/> If there is concern of infection the fluid should be drained and tested.<ref name=AO2018/>\n\n==Treatments==\n===Non-surgical treatments===\nConservative management of minor cases involves icing, a compression bandage, and avoidance of the aggravating activity.  This can also be augmented with oral or topical anti-inflammatory medications such as [[NSAIDs]].  Elbow padding can also be used for symptomatic relief.  Treatment for more severe cases may include aspirating the excess bursa fluid with a syringe (draining of the bursa), or injecting into the bursa a [[hydrocortisone]] type medication which is aimed at relieving the inflammation and preventing further accumulation of fluid.\n\nIn case of infection, the bursitis should be treated with an [[antibiotic]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Surgery===\nIf the fluid continues to return after multiple drainings or the bursa is constantly causing pain, surgery<ref>[http://www.eorthopod.com/public/patient_education/6474/olecranon_bursitis.html# eOrthopod - Olecranon Bursitis Surgery]</ref> to remove the bursa is an option. The minor operation removes the bursa from the elbow and is left to regrow but at a normal size over a period of ten to fourteen days. It is usually done under [[general anesthetic]] and has minimal risks. The surgery does not disturb any muscle, ligament, or joint structures. To recover from surgical removal, a splint will be applied to the arm to protect the skin. Exercises will be prescribed to improve range of motion.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|   DiseasesDB     = \n|   ICD10          = {{ICD10|M|70|2|m|70}} \n|   ICD9           = {{ICD9|726.33}} \n|   ICDO           = \n|   OMIM           = \n|   MedlinePlus    = \n|   eMedicineSubj  = article\n|   eMedicineTopic = 327951\n|   MeshID         = \n}}\n{{Soft tissue disorders}}\n\n[[Category:Soft tissue disorders]]\n[[Category:Synovial bursae]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n", "name_user": "148.252.128.25", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCauses:Fixed typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olecranon_bursitis"}

Based on a biography by [[Myra Gale Brown|Myra Lewis]] and [[Murray M. Silver Jr.]], the screenplay is written by McBride and Jack Baran. The film is produced by [[Adam Fields]], with executive producers credited as [[Michael Grais]], [[Mark Victor]], and Art Levinson.<ref>{{AFI film|id=58098|title=Great Balls of Fire!}}</ref>\n\nThe early career of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], from his rise to rock and roll stardom to his controversial marriage to his 13-year-old cousin that led to his downfall, is depicted in the film. Until the scandal of the marriage depreciated his image, many had thought Lewis would supplant [[Elvis Presley]] as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" in the 1950s.\n\n==Plot==\nJerry Lee Lewis (Quaid) plays piano (as opposed to a guitar like most other rock artists) during [[rock and roll]]'s early years from 1956 to 1958. Jerry Lee is a man with many different sides: a skilled performer with little discipline, and an [[alcoholic]]. As Jerry Lee rises to the top of the charts with such hits as \"[[Crazy Arms]]\", \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On]]\", and \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", he falls in love with [[Myra Gale Brown]] ([[Winona Ryder]]), the 13-year-old daughter of his first cousin (and bass player) J. W. Brown ([[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]]), and eventually marries her ([[elopement (marriage)|eloping]] to [[Mississippi]]), much to the anger and chagrin of her parents.\n\nA subplot deals with Jerry Lee's relationship with another cousin, (now-[[televangelist]]) [[Jimmy Swaggart]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]), who, during this period, was a struggling [[Pentecostal]] preacher. Jimmy's career kept him in constant conflict with his cousin's wild rock and roll career and brings out some uncomfortable exchanges between the two. The now-financially successful Jerry Lee buys a new car and gives it to his cousin, and when Jimmy praises the Lord for the gift, Jerry Lee replies, \"Don't thank [[Jesus]], thank Jerry Lee Lewis!\"\n\nWhile Jerry Lee is touring in [[England]] in 1958, a [[United Kingdom|British]] reporter discovers he is married to his teenage cousin. Jerry Lee is then condemned as a [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]] and a pervert by the public. Jerry Lee is booed and ridiculed off stage at his opening concert; and as a result, his British tour is cancelled and he is deported from England. Confident that his career will remain a success, Jerry Lee is undaunted; however, the scandal follows him back to the States.\n\nJerry Lee then begins drinking heavily when record sales and concert attendances are significantly down. He becomes furious when requested to print a public apology in ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' and becomes increasingly abusive toward Myra. It was during one of these abusive episodes that Myra informs Jerry Lee that she is [[pregnant]], and he collapses into Myra's arms, crying hysterically.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to improve his life, Jerry Lee, with Myra in tow, attends one of Swaggart's church services. During the [[altar call]], Jimmy offers Jerry Lee one more chance to become saved and get right with God; but Jerry Lee again refuses, declaring, \"If I'm going to hell, I'm going there playing the piano!\" The caption preceding the closing credits reads, \"Jerry Lee Lewis is playing his heart out somewhere in America tonight.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as [[Myra Gale Brown]]\n* [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] as J.

Despite this, co-writer Silver was upset by the lack of accuracy in the film, claiming it was \"phoney\". Director [[Jim McBride]] admitted that it was never his intention to tie his film to the facts, and stated, \"This movie does not represent itself in any way to be a historical documentary.

It also captures, perhaps for the first time on film, something of the sexual aura of rock-and-roll at its birth.\" Yet, she added that anyone looking for a true sense of music history will be let down by the film.<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=GREAT%20BALLS%20OF%20FIRE%20(MOVIE)&title2=&reviewer=CARYN%20JAMES&pdate=19890630&v_id= James, Caryn].

Based on a biography by [[Myra Gale Brown|Myra Lewis]] and [[Murray M. Silver Jr.]], the screenplay is written by McBride and Jack Baran. The film is produced by [[Adam Fields]], with executive producers credited as [[Michael Grais]], [[Mark Victor]], and Art Levinson.<ref>{{AFI film|id=58098|title=Great Balls of Fire!}}</ref>\n\nThe early career of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], from his rise to rock and roll stardom to his controversial marriage to his 13-year-old cousin that led to his downfall, is depicted in the film. Until the scandal of the marriage depreciated his image, many had thought Lewis would supplant [[Elvis Presley]] as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" in the 1950s.\n\n==Plot==\nJerry Lee Lewis (Quaid) plays piano (as opposed to a guitar like most other rock artists) during [[rock and roll]]'s early years from 1956 to 1958. Jerry Lee is a man with many different sides: a skilled performer with little discipline, and an [[alcoholic]]. As Jerry Lee rises to the top of the charts with such hits as \"[[Crazy Arms]]\", \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On]]\", and \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", he falls in love with [[Myra Gale Brown]] ([[Winona Ryder]]), the 13-year-old daughter of his first cousin (and bass player) J. W. Brown ([[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]]), and eventually marries her ([[elopement (marriage)|eloping]] to [[Mississippi]]), much to the anger and chagrin of her parents.\n\nA subplot deals with Jerry Lee's relationship with another cousin, (now-[[televangelist]]) [[Jimmy Swaggart]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]), who, during this period, was a struggling [[Pentecostal]] preacher. Jimmy's career kept him in constant conflict with his cousin's wild rock and roll career and brings out some uncomfortable exchanges between the two. The now-financially successful Jerry Lee buys a new car and gives it to his cousin, and when Jimmy praises the Lord for the gift, Jerry Lee replies, \"Don't thank [[Jesus]], thank Jerry Lee Lewis!\"\n\nWhile Jerry Lee is touring in [[England]] in 1958, a [[United Kingdom|British]] reporter discovers he is married to his teenage cousin. Jerry Lee is then condemned as a [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]] and a pervert by the public. Jerry Lee is booed and ridiculed off stage at his opening concert; and as a result, his British tour is cancelled and he is deported from England. Confident that his career will remain a success, Jerry Lee is undaunted; however, the scandal follows him back to the States.\n\nJerry Lee then begins drinking heavily when record sales and concert attendances are significantly down. He becomes furious when requested to print a public apology in ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' and becomes increasingly abusive toward Myra. It was during one of these abusive episodes that Myra informs Jerry Lee that she is [[pregnant]], and he collapses into Myra's arms, crying hysterically.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to improve his life, Jerry Lee, with Myra in tow, attends one of Swaggart's church services. During the [[altar call]], Jimmy offers Jerry Lee one more chance to become saved and get right with God; but Jerry Lee again refuses, declaring, \"If I'm going to hell, I'm going there playing the piano!\" The caption preceding the closing credits reads, \"Jerry Lee Lewis is playing his heart out somewhere in America tonight.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as [[Myra Gale Brown]]\n* [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] as J.

It also captures, perhaps for the first time on film, something of the sexual aura of rock-and-roll at its birth.\" Yet, she added that anyone looking for a true sense of music history will be let down by the film.<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=GREAT%20BALLS%20OF%20FIRE%20(MOVIE)&title2=&reviewer=CARYN%20JAMES&pdate=19890630&v_id= James, Caryn].
