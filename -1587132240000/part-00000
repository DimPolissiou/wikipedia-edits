The game revolves around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a secret U.S. government agency tasked with containing and studying phenomena that violate the laws of reality. As Jesse Faden (Courtney Hope), the Bureau's new Director, players explore the Oldest House \u2013 the FBC's paranormal headquarters \u2013 and utilize powerful abilities in order to defeat a deadly enemy known as the Hiss, which has invaded and corrupted reality. ''Control'' was released on 27 August 2019 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jeff |first1=Cork |title=Control Is Coming Out This August |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/03/21/control-is-coming-out-this-august |website=Game Informer |accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nUpon release, ''Control'' was met with positive reviews from critics and consumers alike, with some gaming publications naming it one of the top 10 games of 2019.

The Service Weapon can be upgraded throughout the game via a skill tree; in order to gain new powers.The Service Weapon is a gun that can transform into 5 different forms: Grip, Spin, Shatter, Pierce, Charge. players must locate various Objects of Power - ordinary items acted upon by supernatural forces - hidden throughout the Oldest House.

These phenomena manifest in the form of Altered World Events (AWEs), intrusions upon perceived reality shaped by the human [[collective unconscious]]. These AWEs affect [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] objects and give them unique properties; referred to as Altered Items by the Bureau, they are contained within their headquarters at the Oldest House, an enormous [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] skyscraper in [[New York City]]. AWEs produce Objects of Power, which are unique in that they grant certain individuals (referred to as \"parautilitarians\") paranatural abilities. Objects of Power are connected to the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension housing the Board, a pyramid-shaped entity which ordains the Bureau's leadership through a ritual connected to the Service Weapon, an Object of Power. Whomever the Board chooses to wield the Service Weapon is considered by default to be the Director of the FBC.<ref name=\"vice mythos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5ypj3/control-the-board-pyramid | title = The Mysterious \"Board\" in 'Control' Is One of the Game's Best, Most Unsettling Ideas | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = 4 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> The Oldest House itself is referred to as a Place of Power by the FBC; on the interior, it is an infinite, constantly shifting paranatural space connected to various [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimensions]] through rooms known as Thresholds.\n\nThe protagonist of ''Control'' is Jesse Faden, who arrives at the Oldest House seeking the whereabouts of her younger brother, Dylan. Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and Dylan were involved in an AWE in their hometown of Ordinary, [[Wisconsin]] involving a [[slide projector]] Object of Power capable of opening portals to other dimensions. After the Slide Projector's paranatural properties resulted in the disappearance of Ordinary's adult population, the FBC apprehended Dylan and the Slide Projector while Jesse fled, burning all but one of the slides. Jesse arrives at the Oldest House '''[https://brandsofttech.blogspot.com/2020/04/top-10-naval-battle-games-for-pc-2020.html top 10 best games]''' through the guidance of Polaris, a paranatural entity which rescued her and Dylan during the Ordinary AWE.\n\nThroughout the game, Jesse encounters various allies in the FBC, including research specialist Emily Pope, security chief Simon Arish, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, and Ahti, a mysterious Finnish janitor. She also learns of the FBC's former Director, Zachariah Trench, and finds various informative videos created by Dr. Casper Darling, the Bureau's missing Head of Research.\n\n===Plot===\nJesse Faden arrives at the Oldest House under the telepathic guidance of Polaris, finding the building seemingly devoid of people. She bumps into a Finnish janitor, Ahti, who directs her to an elevator for her \"interview.\" Through the elevator, Jesse discovers that the Federal Bureau of Control's Director, Zachariah Trench, has seemingly committed suicide with his own sidearm. Picking it up, Jesse learns that it is an Object of Power known as the Service Weapon, and is transported to the Astral Plane, where she completes a ritual and is selected as the new Director by the Board. Jesse emerges from Trench's office and finds that the Oldest House has been invaded by a hostile force she dubs \"the Hiss,\" which has possessed most of the Bureau's agents and corrupted the building's shifting topography. Jesse uses an Object of Power known as the Hotline to listen to the lingering presence of Trench, who relays that his former management team knows the secrets of the Bureau, and Jesse hopes they may be able to tell her the whereabouts of her brother, Dylan, who was kidnapped by the FBC years prior.\n\nJesse aids Emily Pope and the other remaining agents of the FBC, who have survived by donning Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs), devices developed by Casper Darling that protect their wearers from the effects of the Hiss. Pope explains that the Oldest House is on complete lockdown until the Hiss can be eradicated. Seeking to release the lockdown and access other sectors of the building, Jesse enters the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector and is guided by Ahti to repair the building's electricity and plumbing to prevent a major meltdown. Jesse then uses a Directorial Override to reopen the other sectors, and enters the Research Sector in search of Marshall, whom she believes knows about Dylan. Jesse aids Marshall in retaking the Research Sector and facilitating production of more HRAs. Marshall then reveals that Dylan, known to the Bureau as \"Prime Candidate 6\", was brought in as a candidate for the role of Director due to his special parautilitarian abilities, but after he proved unstable and killed several Bureau agents, he was detained in the Containment Sector. Jesse rushes to the sector to find Dylan, only to learn that he has appeared suddenly in the Executive Sector and surrendered to the FBC agents there. Dylan tells Jesse that he has embraced the Hiss, which he believes will set him free of the Bureau, and that their invasion was made possible by the Slide Projector Object of Power that the Bureau recovered from Ordinary. Dylan warns his sister not to trust Polaris, but Jesse resolves to find and deactivate the Slide Projector.\n\nJesse investigates the Prime Candidate program and learns that both she and Dylan were considered for the role of Director, and that the Slide Projector is contained in the Research Sector. Ahti gives Jesse a [[cassette player]] which enables her to navigate an elaborate maze protecting the Slide Projector's chamber. In the chamber, Jesse finds the Slide Projector missing. She learns that Darling led several expeditions into the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] accessed through the only surviving slide the FBC was able to recover (the other slides having been burned by Jesse years prior), discovering a polyhedron-shaped organism he named Hedron, which is the source of the HRA resonance. Jesse discovers that Hedron is Polaris, who called out to Jesse to save her from the Hiss; however, when Jesse reaches Hedron's containment chamber, the Hiss attacks and seemingly kills it.\n\nJesse's mind is invaded as the Hedron resonance falters; however, she is able to rediscover Polaris's essence within her and restore control. Jesse learns that Trench fell under the Hiss's influence during one of Darling's expeditions; he stole and concealed a second slide and used it to let the Hiss into the Oldest House to destroy what he perceived to be the threat of Hedron's takeover. Jesse finds the Slide Projector in the Executive Sector and, through it, enters the Astral Plane to confront Dylan, who is attempting to take over the Board through the Hiss. Jesse defeats the defending Hiss and cleanses Dylan, who falls into a coma. Finally accepting her new role as Director, Jesse resolves to defeat the remaining Hiss in order to restore order to the Bureau.\n\n===''The Foundation''===\n''The Foundation'' takes place in an eponymous location at the bottom of the Oldest House, where Jesse is summoned by the Board to deal with a threat to the Bureau. In the Foundation, Jesse discovers a \"Nail\" that acts as a conduit between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane, which has been damaged. The Board grants Jesse a new ability and instructs her to find the Nail's four nodes to repair it; in the process, Jesse searches for the whereabouts of Marshall, who entered the Foundation during the initial Hiss invasion seeking to secure it.\n\nWhile repairing one of the nodes, Jesse suddenly encounters the Former, an extradimensional entity and ex-member of the Board, which grants Jesse an additional ability which the Board had not ordained. The Board is furious, but later calms, and attempts to persuade Jesse not to trust the Former. Jesse repairs the nodes, but tremors occur between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane which threaten to destroy both dimensions. Jesse reaches the base of the Nail, where she finds Marshall possessed by the Hiss, and kills her. With the aid of the Former, Jesse cleanses the Nail.\n\nMarshall's presence reveals through the Hotline that it was she who destroyed the Nail, seeking to prevent the Hiss from taking over the Oldest House through it, and also as a preventative measure against the Board's control. The Board, in response, destroyed Marshall's HRA, allowing her to be possessed by the Hiss. Jesse, with her faith in the Board shattered, resolves to lead the Bureau her own way, but continue letting the Board believe it is in control. As Jesse exits the Foundation, the Former recedes in the distance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Control_rtx_example.jpg|thumb|right|''Control'' is one of the first games to support new graphics cards with real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]].

As their first major release since their [[initial public offering]] in 2017 and separation from [[Microsoft]] as a publishing partner, ''Control'' was developed using more efficient development strategies to keep costs and time low. In contrast to ''[[Alan Wake]]'' and ''[[Quantum Break]]'' which took seven and five years to complete respectively, ''Control'' was completed within three years with a {{GBP|30 million}} budget, lower than the typical costs of a [[triple A (video gaming)|triple-A]] game.<ref name=\"gi.biz people 2019\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-12-04-people-of-the-year-2019-remedy-entertainment | title = People of the Year 2019: Remedy Entertainment | first= Matthew | last= Handrahan | date = 4 December 2019 | accessdate = 4 December 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>\n\nMikael Kasurinen, who worked on ''Alan Wake'' (as lead gameplay designer) and ''Quantum Break'' (as lead director), was ''Control''{{'s}} director and [[Sam Lake]] served as the game's writer and creative director alongside narrative lead Anna Megill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/05/remedys-sam-lake-on-21-years-of-game-storytelling-and-transmedia/|title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake on 21 years of game storytelling and transmedia|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=5 July 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/index.php/e3-2018/2018/06/11/remedy-announces-gravity-bending-shooter-control|title=Remedy Announces Gravity-Bending Shooter, Control|first=Brian|last=Shea|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> Development of the game began before the release of ''Quantum Break''.<ref name=\"life after xbox\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-25-not-the-finnish-remedys-new-age|title=Remedy on life after Xbox exclusivity|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=26 May 2017|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> As they were finishing ''Quantum Break'' and deciding on the next project, Kasurinen recognized that that game rested heavily on [[full motion video]] and other cinematic elements, and suggested they look at a more open-world game where the player would drive what they experienced.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\">{{cite web | url = https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/the-best-game-ive-ever-made-how-remedy-made-control/ | title = \u2018The Best Game I\u2019ve Ever Made\u2019: How Remedy Made Control | first = Andy | last= Robinson | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 3 September 2019 | work = [[Video Games Chronicle]] }}</ref> Instead of focusing on creating a large and complex story, Remedy wanted to put more emphasis on '''[https://brandsofttech.blogspot.com/2020/04/top-10-naval-battle-games-for-pc-2020.html creating a game world best top games in the word]''' and universe that is rich enough for players to craft their own stories.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> The team still wanted to leave narrative elements for players to discover to help flesh out the world, and added optional documents, audio logs, and live-action video footage that the player could review at their own pace.<ref name=\"usg dlc\"/> Another goal for the team was to create a game that has high replayability.<ref name=\"life after xbox\"/> They still stated that they wanted to make a strong narrative, one that is \"narrowly focused\" according to Kasurinen.<ref name=\"coop\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/12/28/14101058/remedy-new-game-p7|title=Why Alan Wake's creators want to make you the storyteller|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=18 December 2016|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first concept down was creating the fictional FBC, a realistic setting that would serve as a basis for paranormal events and a catalyst for events in the story.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This enabled them to consider multiple stories they could tell, not just about the player-character but other individuals in the FBC, but this also created the challenge of how to present the stories of the other characters in the open-world format.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> The gathered writings of the fictional [[SCP Foundation]] (\"Secure, Contain, Protect\") website was a major influence on ''Control''. Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. ''Control'' was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or other stories in line with SCP.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/article/control-game-scp-foundation | title = The web's creepiest fictional wiki is now a mind-bending video game | first = Aron | last =Garst | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 2 September 2019 | work = [[Wired UK]] }}</ref> They fixed the story in the genre of the [[new weird]], a modern variant of [[weird fiction]] with stories that combine science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency involved in these events. In ''Control'', they reversed the role to make the bureaucracy at the center of the story. Narrative Designer Brooke Maggs stated \"there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling\".<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The mundane features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to World Design Director Stuart MacDonald.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The design team's goal in using the new weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the player.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/>\n\nA further challenge involved creating an environment that would encourage the player to explore, get lost in it, and learn by observation. Kasurinen felt they did not want to include a traditional [[heads-up display]] for the player, with mission markers or other clutter, and instead have the player use mission descriptions in their log and careful observation of the environment to figure out where to go next.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This further led to the decision to only tell player critical information via some means, leaving the player to fill in the missing parts with their own observations and imaginations.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> They also wanted a fluid environment, where nearly any object in it could be used as part of the player-character's telekinetic powers, so that the game world could be both a weapon to be used by the player, or a weapon against the player-character. To achieve this, Remedy replaced the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics in their in-house engine with [[PhysX]], and improved their [[artificial intelligence]] to enable enemies to take advantage of these changes.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/>\n\nThe everyday objects that would become Objects of Power in the game also were selected to be within the concept of the new weird. One such Object of Power is a [[floppy disk]]. MacDonald said he was drawn to use a floppy disk in this manner after reading a story about how many of the [[United States national missile defense]] sites had only recently transitioned off floppy disks, and prior to that, these disks could be seen as proverbial weapons that were held with high reverence.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The copious presence in the Oldest House of 1960s and 1970s technology such as [[pneumatic tubes]], [[slide projectors]] and [[monochrome monitor]]s, and the absence of modern-day technologies such as [[cell phones]], is explained in-game as the result of the tendency of newer technologies to fail or malfunction within the boundaries of the Oldest House.\n\n[[File:33_Thomas_Sidewalk_View.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[AT&T]] [[33 Thomas Street|Long Lines Building]] served as inspiration for the Oldest House.]]\nThe Oldest House setting was based on [[brutalist architecture]], a style utilizing large concrete blocks popularized in the 1950s and used in many government buildings at the time. The game's world design director, Stuart Macdonald, described brutalism as a good science-fiction setting, as it has \"this sense of power, weight, strength and stability to it\", and when the Oldest House's geometries are affected by the Hiss, \"it makes for a really good contrast with the impossible architecture\".<ref name=\"eurog art\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-03-remedys-control-is-built-on-concrete-foundations | title = Remedy's Control is built on concrete foundations | first = Ewan | last= Wilson | date = 3 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The relatively flat colors of the background walls made it an ideal canvas to showcase other design and lighting effects in the game, It also served well into the telekinesis powers of the game, as the concrete walls would be used in lieu of a target object when the player throws debris at foes via telekinesis, and the initially pristine spaces end up showing the results of a large, destructive battle.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Among real-world influences in the game's architecture is [[33 Thomas Street]], formerly known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, a windowless building in the center of New York City. Macdonald used this building as a modern example of brutalism, and created the Oldest House as a \"bizarre, brutalist monolith\" to house the FBC.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other real-world locations used as inspiration included the [[Boston City Hall]], the Andrews Building at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]], and the [[Met Breuer]].<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nOther real-world architects inspired the game's structures. [[Carlo Scarpa]]'s work was used heavily in designing stairways that ascended with other parts of the structure, while [[Tadao Ando]]'s focus on lighting and spiritual spaces were reflected in other parts of the game.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Additionally, the design team turned to film for other inspiration. Films of [[Stanley Kubrick]], particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', as well as films featuring oppressive government agencies, such as ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', served as part of the design basis.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other films, like ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'', evoke the concept of repetitiveness, process, and ritualism in these agencies, and that was used to define some of the internal artwork and architecture.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Art director Janne Pulkkinen stated they also looked at real world churches and other places where ritualism is common, as lighting and design of those spaces are often used to draw attention to specific points of interest.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nCertain areas of the game feature [[full-motion video]] sequences. Most of these are of Dr. Casper Darling explaining parts of the Oldest House and Objects of Power within it, with Darling played by [[Matthew Porretta]]. Another set of videos are short episodes of a fictional show called \"The Threshold Kids\", a puppet-based show seemingly aimed at children that may reside within the Oldest House. \"The Threshold Kids\" were written by narrative lead Anna Megill and produced by their senior cinematic designer Mircea Purdea.<ref name=\"ign new weird\">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control | title = Control Confronts Us With A Very Specific Type of Horror: A Lack of Control | first= Taurqi | last = Moosa | date = October 7, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> [[Poets of the Fall]], an alternative rock group that are close friends of Remedy, provided songs for the game, including \"Take Control\", in-game stated to be by the fictional band \"The Old Gods of Asgard\", itself an allusion back to ''Alan Wake''.<ref name=\"gamespot wake connnections\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/control-is-full-of-details-about-alan-wakes-fate/2900-3029/ | title = Control Is Full Of Details About Alan Wake's Fate | first = Phil | last = Hornshaw | date = September 23, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Remedy used this song as part of the game's \"Ashtray Maze\", a section where Jesse fights through an ever-changing set of room set to the song.

The game revolves around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a secret U.S. government agency tasked with containing and studying phenomena that violate the laws of reality. As Jesse Faden (Courtney Hope), the Bureau's new Director, players explore the Oldest House \u2013 the FBC's paranormal headquarters \u2013 and utilize powerful abilities in order to defeat a deadly enemy known as the Hiss, which has invaded and corrupted reality. ''Control'' was released on 27 August 2019 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jeff |first1=Cork |title=Control Is Coming Out This August |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/03/21/control-is-coming-out-this-august |website=Game Informer |accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nUpon release, ''Control'' was met with positive reviews from critics and consumers alike, with some gaming publications naming it one of the top 10 games of 2019. ''Control'' was followed by a downloadable expansion, ''The Foundation'', which was released on March 26, 2020.

As Jesse Faden, players wield the Service Weapon, a supernatural firearm that can be adapted into a variety of different forms with different combat applications.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vader |first1=Leo |title=Remedy's Control Only Has One Gun.

The Service Weapon has limited ammunition which reloads after a certain interval and Jesse's abilities expend Jesse's energy, necessitating a balance in their usage. The Service Weapon can be upgraded throughout the game via a skill tree; in order to gain new powers.The Service Weapon is a gun that can transform into 5 different forms: Grip, Spin, Shatter, Pierce, Charge. players must locate various Objects of Power - ordinary items acted upon by supernatural forces - hidden throughout the Oldest House.

These phenomena manifest in the form of Altered World Events (AWEs), intrusions upon perceived reality shaped by the human [[collective unconscious]]. These AWEs affect [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] objects and give them unique properties; referred to as Altered Items by the Bureau, they are contained within their headquarters at the Oldest House, an enormous [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] skyscraper in [[New York City]]. AWEs produce Objects of Power, which are unique in that they grant certain individuals (referred to as \"parautilitarians\") paranatural abilities. Objects of Power are connected to the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension housing the Board, a pyramid-shaped entity which ordains the Bureau's leadership through a ritual connected to the Service Weapon, an Object of Power. Whomever the Board chooses to wield the Service Weapon is considered by default to be the Director of the FBC.<ref name=\"vice mythos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5ypj3/control-the-board-pyramid | title = The Mysterious \"Board\" in 'Control' Is One of the Game's Best, Most Unsettling Ideas | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = 4 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> The Oldest House itself is referred to as a Place of Power by the FBC; on the interior, it is an infinite, constantly shifting paranatural space connected to various [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate dimensions]] through rooms known as Thresholds.\n\nThe protagonist of ''Control'' is Jesse Faden, who arrives at the Oldest House seeking the whereabouts of her younger brother, Dylan. Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and Dylan were involved in an AWE in their hometown of Ordinary, [[Wisconsin]] involving a [[slide projector]] Object of Power capable of opening portals to other dimensions. After the Slide Projector's paranatural properties resulted in the disappearance of Ordinary's adult population, the FBC apprehended Dylan and the Slide Projector while Jesse fled, burning all but one of the slides. Jesse arrives at the Oldest House '''[https://brandsofttech.blogspot.com/2020/04/top-10-naval-battle-games-for-pc-2020.html top 10 best games]''' through the guidance of Polaris, a paranatural entity which rescued her and Dylan during the Ordinary AWE.\n\nThroughout the game, Jesse encounters various allies in the FBC, including research specialist Emily Pope, security chief Simon Arish, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, and Ahti, a mysterious Finnish janitor. She also learns of the FBC's former Director, Zachariah Trench, and finds various informative videos created by Dr. Casper Darling, the Bureau's missing Head of Research.\n\n===Plot===\nJesse Faden arrives at the Oldest House under the telepathic guidance of Polaris, finding the building seemingly devoid of people. She bumps into a Finnish janitor, Ahti, who directs her to an elevator for her \"interview.\" Through the elevator, Jesse discovers that the Federal Bureau of Control's Director, Zachariah Trench, has seemingly committed suicide with his own sidearm. Picking it up, Jesse learns that it is an Object of Power known as the Service Weapon, and is transported to the Astral Plane, where she completes a ritual and is selected as the new Director by the Board. Jesse emerges from Trench's office and finds that the Oldest House has been invaded by a hostile force she dubs \"the Hiss,\" which has possessed most of the Bureau's agents and corrupted the building's shifting topography. Jesse uses an Object of Power known as the Hotline to listen to the lingering presence of Trench, who relays that his former management team knows the secrets of the Bureau, and Jesse hopes they may be able to tell her the whereabouts of her brother, Dylan, who was kidnapped by the FBC years prior.\n\nJesse aids Emily Pope and the other remaining agents of the FBC, who have survived by donning Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs), devices developed by Casper Darling that protect their wearers from the effects of the Hiss. Pope explains that the Oldest House is on complete lockdown until the Hiss can be eradicated. Seeking to release the lockdown and access other sectors of the building, Jesse enters the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector and is guided by Ahti to repair the building's electricity and plumbing to prevent a major meltdown. Jesse then uses a Directorial Override to reopen the other sectors, and enters the Research Sector in search of Marshall, whom she believes knows about Dylan. Jesse aids Marshall in retaking the Research Sector and facilitating production of more HRAs. Marshall then reveals that Dylan, known to the Bureau as \"Prime Candidate 6\", was brought in as a candidate for the role of Director due to his special parautilitarian abilities, but after he proved unstable and killed several Bureau agents, he was detained in the Containment Sector. Jesse rushes to the sector to find Dylan, only to learn that he has appeared suddenly in the Executive Sector and surrendered to the FBC agents there. Dylan tells Jesse that he has embraced the Hiss, which he believes will set him free of the Bureau, and that their invasion was made possible by the Slide Projector Object of Power that the Bureau recovered from Ordinary. Dylan warns his sister not to trust Polaris, but Jesse resolves to find and deactivate the Slide Projector.\n\nJesse investigates the Prime Candidate program and learns that both she and Dylan were considered for the role of Director, and that the Slide Projector is contained in the Research Sector. Ahti gives Jesse a [[cassette player]] which enables her to navigate an elaborate maze protecting the Slide Projector's chamber. In the chamber, Jesse finds the Slide Projector missing. She learns that Darling led several expeditions into the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] accessed through the only surviving slide the FBC was able to recover (the other slides having been burned by Jesse years prior), discovering a polyhedron-shaped organism he named Hedron, which is the source of the HRA resonance. Jesse discovers that Hedron is Polaris, who called out to Jesse to save her from the Hiss; however, when Jesse reaches Hedron's containment chamber, the Hiss attacks and seemingly kills it.\n\nJesse's mind is invaded as the Hedron resonance falters; however, she is able to rediscover Polaris's essence within her and restore control. Jesse learns that Trench fell under the Hiss's influence during one of Darling's expeditions; he stole and concealed a second slide and used it to let the Hiss into the Oldest House to destroy what he perceived to be the threat of Hedron's takeover. Jesse finds the Slide Projector in the Executive Sector and, through it, enters the Astral Plane to confront Dylan, who is attempting to take over the Board through the Hiss. Jesse defeats the defending Hiss and cleanses Dylan, who falls into a coma. Finally accepting her new role as Director, Jesse resolves to defeat the remaining Hiss in order to restore order to the Bureau.\n\n===''The Foundation''===\n''The Foundation'' takes place in an eponymous location at the bottom of the Oldest House, where Jesse is summoned by the Board to deal with a threat to the Bureau. In the Foundation, Jesse discovers a \"Nail\" that acts as a conduit between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane, which has been damaged. The Board grants Jesse a new ability and instructs her to find the Nail's four nodes to repair it; in the process, Jesse searches for the whereabouts of Marshall, who entered the Foundation during the initial Hiss invasion seeking to secure it.\n\nWhile repairing one of the nodes, Jesse suddenly encounters the Former, an extradimensional entity and ex-member of the Board, which grants Jesse an additional ability which the Board had not ordained. The Board is furious, but later calms, and attempts to persuade Jesse not to trust the Former. Jesse repairs the nodes, but tremors occur between the Oldest House and the Astral Plane which threaten to destroy both dimensions. Jesse reaches the base of the Nail, where she finds Marshall possessed by the Hiss, and kills her. With the aid of the Former, Jesse cleanses the Nail.\n\nMarshall's presence reveals through the Hotline that it was she who destroyed the Nail, seeking to prevent the Hiss from taking over the Oldest House through it, and also as a preventative measure against the Board's control. The Board, in response, destroyed Marshall's HRA, allowing her to be possessed by the Hiss. Jesse, with her faith in the Board shattered, resolves to lead the Bureau her own way, but continue letting the Board believe it is in control. As Jesse exits the Foundation, the Former recedes in the distance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Control_rtx_example.jpg|thumb|right|''Control'' is one of the first games to support new graphics cards with real-time [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]].

Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. ''Control'' was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or other stories in line with SCP.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/article/control-game-scp-foundation | title = The web's creepiest fictional wiki is now a mind-bending video game | first = Aron | last =Garst | date = 27 August 2019 | accessdate = 2 September 2019 | work = [[Wired UK]] }}</ref> They fixed the story in the genre of the [[new weird]], a modern variant of [[weird fiction]] with stories that combine science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency involved in these events.

Narrative Designer Brooke Maggs stated \"there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling\".<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The mundane features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to World Design Director Stuart MacDonald.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The design team's goal in using the new weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the player.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/>\n\nA further challenge involved creating an environment that would encourage the player to explore, get lost in it, and learn by observation. Kasurinen felt they did not want to include a traditional [[heads-up display]] for the player, with mission markers or other clutter, and instead have the player use mission descriptions in their log and careful observation of the environment to figure out where to go next.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> This further led to the decision to only tell player critical information via some means, leaving the player to fill in the missing parts with their own observations and imaginations.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/> They also wanted a fluid environment, where nearly any object in it could be used as part of the player-character's telekinetic powers, so that the game world could be both a weapon to be used by the player, or a weapon against the player-character. To achieve this, Remedy replaced the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics in their in-house engine with [[PhysX]], and improved their [[artificial intelligence]] to enable enemies to take advantage of these changes.<ref name=\"vgc masurinen\"/>\n\nThe everyday objects that would become Objects of Power in the game also were selected to be within the concept of the new weird. One such Object of Power is a [[floppy disk]]. MacDonald said he was drawn to use a floppy disk in this manner after reading a story about how many of the [[United States national missile defense]] sites had only recently transitioned off floppy disks, and prior to that, these disks could be seen as proverbial weapons that were held with high reverence.<ref name=\"ign new weird\"/> The copious presence in the Oldest House of 1960s and 1970s technology such as [[pneumatic tubes]], [[slide projectors]] and [[monochrome monitor]]s, and the absence of modern-day technologies such as [[cell phones]], is explained in-game as the result of the tendency of newer technologies to fail or malfunction within the boundaries of the Oldest House.\n\n[[File:33_Thomas_Sidewalk_View.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[AT&T]] [[33 Thomas Street|Long Lines Building]] served as inspiration for the Oldest House.]]\nThe Oldest House setting was based on [[brutalist architecture]], a style utilizing large concrete blocks popularized in the 1950s and used in many government buildings at the time. The game's world design director, Stuart Macdonald, described brutalism as a good science-fiction setting, as it has \"this sense of power, weight, strength and stability to it\", and when the Oldest House's geometries are affected by the Hiss, \"it makes for a really good contrast with the impossible architecture\".<ref name=\"eurog art\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-03-remedys-control-is-built-on-concrete-foundations | title = Remedy's Control is built on concrete foundations | first = Ewan | last= Wilson | date = 3 September 2019 | accessdate = 4 September 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> The relatively flat colors of the background walls made it an ideal canvas to showcase other design and lighting effects in the game, It also served well into the telekinesis powers of the game, as the concrete walls would be used in lieu of a target object when the player throws debris at foes via telekinesis, and the initially pristine spaces end up showing the results of a large, destructive battle.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Among real-world influences in the game's architecture is [[33 Thomas Street]], formerly known as the AT&T Long Lines Building, a windowless building in the center of New York City. Macdonald used this building as a modern example of brutalism, and created the Oldest House as a \"bizarre, brutalist monolith\" to house the FBC.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other real-world locations used as inspiration included the [[Boston City Hall]], the Andrews Building at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]], and the [[Met Breuer]].<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nOther real-world architects inspired the game's structures. [[Carlo Scarpa]]'s work was used heavily in designing stairways that ascended with other parts of the structure, while [[Tadao Ando]]'s focus on lighting and spiritual spaces were reflected in other parts of the game.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Additionally, the design team turned to film for other inspiration. Films of [[Stanley Kubrick]], particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', as well as films featuring oppressive government agencies, such as ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', served as part of the design basis.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Other films, like ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]'', evoke the concept of repetitiveness, process, and ritualism in these agencies, and that was used to define some of the internal artwork and architecture.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/> Art director Janne Pulkkinen stated they also looked at real world churches and other places where ritualism is common, as lighting and design of those spaces are often used to draw attention to specific points of interest.<ref name=\"eurog art\"/>\n\nCertain areas of the game feature [[full-motion video]] sequences. Most of these are of Dr. Casper Darling explaining parts of the Oldest House and Objects of Power within it, with Darling played by [[Matthew Porretta]]. Another set of videos are short episodes of a fictional show called \"The Threshold Kids\", a puppet-based show seemingly aimed at children that may reside within the Oldest House. \"The Threshold Kids\" were written by narrative lead Anna Megill and produced by their senior cinematic designer Mircea Purdea.<ref name=\"ign new weird\">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/control-confronts-us-with-a-very-specific-type-of-horror-a-lack-of-control | title = Control Confronts Us With A Very Specific Type of Horror: A Lack of Control | first= Taurqi | last = Moosa | date = October 7, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> [[Poets of the Fall]], an alternative rock group that are close friends of Remedy, provided songs for the game, including \"Take Control\", in-game stated to be by the fictional band \"The Old Gods of Asgard\", itself an allusion back to ''Alan Wake''.<ref name=\"gamespot wake connnections\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/control-is-full-of-details-about-alan-wakes-fate/2900-3029/ | title = Control Is Full Of Details About Alan Wake's Fate | first = Phil | last = Hornshaw | date = September 23, 2019 | accessdate = October 7, 2019 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> Remedy used this song as part of the game's \"Ashtray Maze\", a section where Jesse fights through an ever-changing set of room set to the song.

However, Tucker, having reconsidered his opinion, resolved that parental cruelty is of non-invasive character and therefore is not to be prohibited. Tucker's opinion is grounded on the fact that he viewed the child as the property of the mother while in the womb and until the time of their emancipation (at the age of being able to contract and provide for themselves) unless the mother had disposed of the fruit of her womb by contract. In the meantime, Tucker recognized the right of the mother to dispose of her property as she sees it fit.

According to this moral theory, the act of abortion must be conceptually separated into the acts of (a) eviction of the fetus from the womb; and (b) killing the fetus. Building on the libertarian stand against trespass and murder, Block supports a right to the first act, but except in certain circumstances not the second act. He believes the woman may legally abort if (a) the fetus is not viable outside the womb; or (b) the woman has announced to the world her abandonment of the right to custody of the fetus, and (c) no one else has \"homesteaded\" that right by offering to care for the fetus.<ref>\n* Walter Block, [http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/block-whitehead_abortion-2005.pdf ''Compromising the Uncompromisable: A Private Property Approach to Resolving the Abortion Controversy''], [http://www.walterblock.com Walter Block personal web site], originally published in Appalachian Journal of Law, Vol 4:1.\n* Jakub Bozydar Wisniewski, [http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2010/lp-2-16.pdf \"A Critique of Block on Abortion and Child Abandonment\"], LibertarianPapers.org, project of [[Ludwig Von Mises Institute]], Vol. 2, Art.

However, Tucker, having reconsidered his opinion, resolved that parental cruelty is of non-invasive character and therefore is not to be prohibited. Tucker's opinion is grounded on the fact that he viewed the child as the property of the mother while in the womb and until the time of their emancipation (at the age of being able to contract and provide for themselves) unless the mother had disposed of the fruit of her womb by contract. In the meantime, Tucker recognized the right of the mother to dispose of her property as she sees it fit.

New Democracy and PASOK were created in the wake of the toppling of the military junta in 1974, and ruled Greece alternately for the previous four decades. Following the electoral decline of PASOK, New Democracy remained one of the two major parties in Greece, the other being the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA).\n\nHaving spent four and a half years in opposition to SYRIZA's government, New Democracy regained its majority in the [[Hellenic Parliament]] and returned to government under [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] after the [[2019 Greek legislative election|2019 legislative election]].\n\nThe traditional support of New Democracy comes from an electorate leaning to the right and conservatives. From a geographical perspective, its main support base is in the rural areas of Greece as well as the city centers of Athens and Thessaloniki. Its support is generally weak in areas like West Greece, Attica, Crete and the Aegean Islands. \n\nThe party was founded in 1974 by [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] and in the same year it formed the first cabinet of the [[History of the Hellenic Republic#Third Hellenic Republic|Third Hellenic Republic]]. New Democracy is a member of the [[European People's Party]], the [[Centrist Democrat International]] and the [[International Democrat Union]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Karamanlis-konstantinos2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Konstantinos Karamanlis]], founder of New Democracy]]\nNew Democracy was founded on 4 October 1974 by [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]], in the beginning of the [[metapolitefsi]] era following the fall of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military junta]]. Karamanlis, who had already served as [[Prime Minister of Greece]] from 1955 to 1963, was sworn in as the first Prime Minister of the [[History of the Hellenic Republic#Third Hellenic Republic (1974-)|Third Hellenic Republic]] in a [[national unity government]] on 24 July 1974, until the first free elections of the new era. He intended New Democracy to be a more modern and progressive political party than the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties that ruled [[Greece]] before the [[1967 Greek coup d'\u00e9tat]], including his own [[National Radical Union]] (ERE). The party's ideology was defined as \"[[radicalism (historical)|radical liberalism]]\", a term defined as \"the prevalence of [[free market]] rules with the decisive intervention of the state in favour of [[social justice]].\" The party was formed out of dissident members the pre-Junta [[Centre Union]] and [[National Radical Union]], both of former Monarchists and Venizelists.\n\n===First government (1974\u20131981)===\nIn the [[1974 Greek legislative election|1974 legislative election]], New Democracy obtained a massive parliamentary majority of 220 seats with a record 54.37% of the vote, a result attributed to the personal appeal of Karamanlis to the electorate. Karamanlis was elected as Prime Minister and soon decided to hold a [[1974 Greek republic referendum|referendum]] on 8 December 1974 for the issue of the form of government; with a large majority of 69.17%, [[Monarchy of Greece|monarchy]] was eventually abolished in favour of a [[republic]]. The next major issue for the New Democracy cabinet was the creation of the [[Constitution of Greece]], which entered into force in 1975 and established Greece as a [[parliamentary republic]]. On 12 June 1975, Greece applied to join the [[European Communities]], of which it was already an associate member since 1961, while it had already been readmitted to the [[Council of Europe]] on 28 November 1974.\n\nIn the [[1977 Greek legislative election|1977 election]], New Democracy won again a large parliamentary majority of 171 seats, albeit with a reduced percentage of popular vote (41.84%). Under Karamanlis, Greece redefined its relations with [[NATO]] and tried to resolve the [[Cyprus dispute]] following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] of the island. In 1979, the first conference of the party was held in [[Chalkidiki]], where its ideological principles defined under the term \"radical liberalism\" were unanimously approved, as well as its statute and the operating regulations of its organizations.<ref name=nd_history>{{cite web|url=http://nd.gr/istoria|title=History|work=New Democracy official website|accessdate=23 January 2015|language=Greek}}</ref> It was the first conference of any [[List of political parties in Greece|Greek political party]] whose delegates were elected by the members.<ref name=nd_history/>\n\nKaramanlis' vision concerning the accession of Greece into the European Communities, despite the resolute opposition of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) and the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_accession_of_greece-en-61a2a7a5-39a9-4b06-91f8-69ae77b41515.html|title=The accession of Greece|date=11 September 2012|work=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|accessdate=23 January 2015|page=2}}</ref> led to the signing of the [[Treaty of Accession 1979|Treaty of Accession]] on 28 May 1979 in [[Athens]]; following the ratification of the act by the [[Hellenic Parliament]] on 28 June 1979, Greece became the tenth [[Member state of the European Union|member state of the European Communities]] on 1 January 1981. Karamanlis was criticised by opposing parties for not holding a referendum,<ref name=ethnologia>{{cite book|last=Lauth Bacas|first=Jutta|title=Ethnologia Balkanica|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=0ogSzrXJEfMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=[[LIT Verlag]]|year=2004|page=8}}</ref> even though Greece's accession into the European Communities had been in the forefront of New Democracy's political platform, under which the party had been elected to power.<ref name=ethnologia/> Meanwhile, Karamanlis relinquished the premiership in 1980 and was elected as [[President of Greece]] by the parliament, serving until 1985. [[Georgios Rallis]] was elected as the new leader of New Democracy and succeeded Karamanlis in premiership.\n\n=== Opposition and Mitsotakis' rise to power (1981\u20131989) ===\nUnder the leadership of Georgios Rallis, New Democracy was defeated in the [[1981 Greek legislative election|1981 legislative elections]] by [[Andreas Papandreou]]'s PASOK which ran on a left-wing populist platform, and was placed in opposition for a first time with 35.87% share of the vote and 115 seats. On the same day, on 18 October 1981, New Democracy was also defeated in the [[1981 European Parliament election in Greece|first Greek election to the European Parliament]]. In the following December, the party's parliamentary group elected [[Evangelos Averoff]], former [[Minister for National Defence (Greece)|Minister for National Defence]], as president of New Democracy, but he resigned in 1984 due to health problems. On 1 September 1984, [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]] succeeded him in the party's presidency and he managed to increase its percentage in the [[1985 Greek legislative election|1985 elections]] to 40.85%, although it was defeated again and remained in opposition.\n\n=== Second government (1989\u20131993) ===\n[[File:Mitsotakis and Demirel in 1992.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]] and [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]] (Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey respectively) in the 1992 [[World Economic Forum]]]]\nMitsotakis led New Democracy to a clear win in the [[June 1989 Greek legislative election|June 1989 legislative elections]] registering 44.28% of the vote but, due to the modification of the electoral law by the outbound PASOK government, New Democracy obtained only 145 seats which were not enough to form a government on its own. The aftermath was the formation of a [[coalition government]] under [[Tzannis Tzannetakis]], consisted of New Democracy and [[Coalition of Left, of Movements and Ecology|Coalition of the Left and Progress]] (''Synaspismos''), with the latter also including at the time the Communist Party of Greece. In the subsequent [[November 1989 Greek legislative election|elections of November 1989]], New Democracy took one more comfortable win, increasing its share to 46.19% of the vote and 148 seats but, under the same electoral law, they were still short of forming a government and this led to a national unity government along with PASOK and Synaspismos, under [[Xenophon Zolotas]].\n\nEventually, in the [[1990 Greek legislative election|1990 election]] Mitsotakis' New Democracy defeated once again Papandreou's PASOK with a lead of 8.28%, but this time the 46.89% of votes awarded them with 150 seats, which allowed Mitsotakis to form a majority in the parliament with the support of [[Democratic Renewal]]'s (DIANA) sole [[member of parliament]] and one more seat given by the [[Supreme Special Court (Greece)|Supreme Special Court]], after a mistake in seat calculation was detected. After three consecutive wide wins with high vote percentages, Mitsotakis became the 178th Prime Minister of Greece, though with a slim parliamentary majority of 152 seats due to the electoral law in force at the time.\n\nIn a turbulent international political environment following the [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 Fall of Communism]] in Europe, Mitsotakis' government focused on cutting government spending, the privatization of state enterprises, the reformation of the public administration and the restoration of the original electoral system, with the addition of an [[election threshold]] of 3%. In foreign policy, the priorities were the restoration of confidence among Greece's economic and political partners, NATO and the [[United States]]. Mitsotakis also supported a new dialogue with [[Turkey]] on the [[Cyprus]] dispute and a compromise over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]]; the latter triggered an irritation among the MPs of New Democracy, which led [[Antonis Samaras]] to leave it and form a new political party in June 1993, [[Political Spring]]; one more withdrawal later from its parliamentary group resulted in New Democracy's loss of the majority in the parliament and the call of early elections.\n\n=== Opposition (1993\u20132004) ===\nIn the [[1993 Greek legislative election|1993 elections]], New Democracy suffered an easy defeat with 39.30% of the vote, something that led to Mitsotakis' resignation and the election of [[Miltiadis Evert]] in the party's leadership. In the early [[1996 Greek legislative election|1996 legislative election]], New Democracy was defeated again by [[Costas Simitis]]' PASOK registering 38.12%, but Evert obtained a re-election as the party's leader in the same year. However, in the spring of 1997 a new conference took place, in order to elect a new president among others. [[Kostas Karamanlis]], nephew of the party's founder, was elected the sixth president of New Democracy.\n\nUnder Karamanlis, New Democracy experienced an evident increase in popularity, but in the [[2000 Greek legislative election|2000 elections]] they lost by only 1.06% of the popular vote, the smallest margin in modern Greek history, registering 42.74% and obtaining 125 seats in the parliament. By 2003, New Democracy was consistently leading Simitis' PASOK in opinion polls; in January 2004 Simitis resigned and announced elections for 7 March, while [[George Papandreou]] succeeded him in PASOK's leadership.\n\n=== Third government (2004\u20132009) ===\nDespite speculation that Papandreou would succeed in restoring the party's fortunes, in the [[2004 Greek legislative election|2004 election]] Karamanlis managed to take a clear win with 45.36% of the vote and 165 seats, and New Democracy returned to power after eleven years in opposition, scoring an all-time record of 3,359,682 votes in the history of [[Elections in Greece|Greek elections]]. The regions that consistently support New Democracy include the [[Peloponnese]], [[Central Macedonia]] and [[West Macedonia]]. On the other hand, the party is weak in [[Crete]], the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Attica]] and [[West Greece]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - Karamanlis5.jpg|thumb|[[Kostas Karamanlis]] giving an interview at a 2008 EPP summit]]\nOn 16 September 2007, [[Kostas Karamanlis]] won re-election with a diminished majority in [[Parliament of Greece|Parliament]], and stated: \"Thank you for your trust.

New Democracy and PASOK were created in the wake of the toppling of the military junta in 1974, and ruled Greece alternately for the previous four decades. Following the electoral decline of PASOK, New Democracy remained one of the two major parties in Greece, the other being the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA).\n\nHaving spent four and a half years in opposition to SYRIZA's government, New Democracy regained its majority in the [[Hellenic Parliament]] and returned to government under [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] after the [[2019 Greek legislative election|2019 legislative election]].\n\nThe traditional support of New Democracy comes from an electorate leaning to the right and conservatives. From a geographical perspective, its main support base is in the rural areas of Greece as well as the city centers of Athens and Thessaloniki. Its support is generally weak in areas like West Greece, Attica, Crete and the Aegean Islands. \n\nThe party was founded in 1974 by [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] and in the same year it formed the first cabinet of the [[History of the Hellenic Republic#Third Hellenic Republic|Third Hellenic Republic]]. New Democracy is a member of the [[European People's Party]], the [[Centrist Democrat International]] and the [[International Democrat Union]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Karamanlis-konstantinos2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Konstantinos Karamanlis]], founder of New Democracy]]\nNew Democracy was founded on 4 October 1974 by [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]], in the beginning of the [[metapolitefsi]] era following the fall of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military junta]]. Karamanlis, who had already served as [[Prime Minister of Greece]] from 1955 to 1963, was sworn in as the first Prime Minister of the [[History of the Hellenic Republic#Third Hellenic Republic (1974-)|Third Hellenic Republic]] in a [[national unity government]] on 24 July 1974, until the first free elections of the new era. He intended New Democracy to be a more modern and progressive political party than the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties that ruled [[Greece]] before the [[1967 Greek coup d'\u00e9tat]], including his own [[National Radical Union]] (ERE). The party's ideology was defined as \"[[radicalism (historical)|radical liberalism]]\", a term defined as \"the prevalence of [[free market]] rules with the decisive intervention of the state in favour of [[social justice]].\" The party was formed out of dissident members the pre-Junta [[Centre Union]] and [[National Radical Union]], both of former Monarchists and Venizelists.\n\n===First government (1974\u20131981)===\nIn the [[1974 Greek legislative election|1974 legislative election]], New Democracy obtained a massive parliamentary majority of 220 seats with a record 54.37% of the vote, a result attributed to the personal appeal of Karamanlis to the electorate. Karamanlis was elected as Prime Minister and soon decided to hold a [[1974 Greek republic referendum|referendum]] on 8 December 1974 for the issue of the form of government; with a large majority of 69.17%, [[Monarchy of Greece|monarchy]] was eventually abolished in favour of a [[republic]]. The next major issue for the New Democracy cabinet was the creation of the [[Constitution of Greece]], which entered into force in 1975 and established Greece as a [[parliamentary republic]]. On 12 June 1975, Greece applied to join the [[European Communities]], of which it was already an associate member since 1961, while it had already been readmitted to the [[Council of Europe]] on 28 November 1974.\n\nIn the [[1977 Greek legislative election|1977 election]], New Democracy won again a large parliamentary majority of 171 seats, albeit with a reduced percentage of popular vote (41.84%). Under Karamanlis, Greece redefined its relations with [[NATO]] and tried to resolve the [[Cyprus dispute]] following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] of the island. In 1979, the first conference of the party was held in [[Chalkidiki]], where its ideological principles defined under the term \"radical liberalism\" were unanimously approved, as well as its statute and the operating regulations of its organizations.<ref name=nd_history>{{cite web|url=http://nd.gr/istoria|title=History|work=New Democracy official website|accessdate=23 January 2015|language=Greek}}</ref> It was the first conference of any [[List of political parties in Greece|Greek political party]] whose delegates were elected by the members.<ref name=nd_history/>\n\nKaramanlis' vision concerning the accession of Greece into the European Communities, despite the resolute opposition of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) and the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_accession_of_greece-en-61a2a7a5-39a9-4b06-91f8-69ae77b41515.html|title=The accession of Greece|date=11 September 2012|work=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|accessdate=23 January 2015|page=2}}</ref> led to the signing of the [[Treaty of Accession 1979|Treaty of Accession]] on 28 May 1979 in [[Athens]]; following the ratification of the act by the [[Hellenic Parliament]] on 28 June 1979, Greece became the tenth [[Member state of the European Union|member state of the European Communities]] on 1 January 1981. Karamanlis was criticised by opposing parties for not holding a referendum,<ref name=ethnologia>{{cite book|last=Lauth Bacas|first=Jutta|title=Ethnologia Balkanica|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=0ogSzrXJEfMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=[[LIT Verlag]]|year=2004|page=8}}</ref> even though Greece's accession into the European Communities had been in the forefront of New Democracy's political platform, under which the party had been elected to power.<ref name=ethnologia/> Meanwhile, Karamanlis relinquished the premiership in 1980 and was elected as [[President of Greece]] by the parliament, serving until 1985. [[Georgios Rallis]] was elected as the new leader of New Democracy and succeeded Karamanlis in premiership.\n\n=== Opposition and Mitsotakis' rise to power (1981\u20131989) ===\nUnder the leadership of Georgios Rallis, New Democracy was defeated in the [[1981 Greek legislative election|1981 legislative elections]] by [[Andreas Papandreou]]'s PASOK which ran on a left-wing populist platform, and was placed in opposition for a first time with 35.87% share of the vote and 115 seats. On the same day, on 18 October 1981, New Democracy was also defeated in the [[1981 European Parliament election in Greece|first Greek election to the European Parliament]]. In the following December, the party's parliamentary group elected [[Evangelos Averoff]], former [[Minister for National Defence (Greece)|Minister for National Defence]], as president of New Democracy, but he resigned in 1984 due to health problems. On 1 September 1984, [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]] succeeded him in the party's presidency and he managed to increase its percentage in the [[1985 Greek legislative election|1985 elections]] to 40.85%, although it was defeated again and remained in opposition.\n\n=== Second government (1989\u20131993) ===\n[[File:Mitsotakis and Demirel in 1992.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]] and [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]] (Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey respectively) in the 1992 [[World Economic Forum]]]]\nMitsotakis led New Democracy to a clear win in the [[June 1989 Greek legislative election|June 1989 legislative elections]] registering 44.28% of the vote but, due to the modification of the electoral law by the outbound PASOK government, New Democracy obtained only 145 seats which were not enough to form a government on its own. The aftermath was the formation of a [[coalition government]] under [[Tzannis Tzannetakis]], consisted of New Democracy and [[Coalition of Left, of Movements and Ecology|Coalition of the Left and Progress]] (''Synaspismos''), with the latter also including at the time the Communist Party of Greece. In the subsequent [[November 1989 Greek legislative election|elections of November 1989]], New Democracy took one more comfortable win, increasing its share to 46.19% of the vote and 148 seats but, under the same electoral law, they were still short of forming a government and this led to a national unity government along with PASOK and Synaspismos, under [[Xenophon Zolotas]].\n\nEventually, in the [[1990 Greek legislative election|1990 election]] Mitsotakis' New Democracy defeated once again Papandreou's PASOK with a lead of 8.28%, but this time the 46.89% of votes awarded them with 150 seats, which allowed Mitsotakis to form a majority in the parliament with the support of [[Democratic Renewal]]'s (DIANA) sole [[member of parliament]] and one more seat given by the [[Supreme Special Court (Greece)|Supreme Special Court]], after a mistake in seat calculation was detected. After three consecutive wide wins with high vote percentages, Mitsotakis became the 178th Prime Minister of Greece, though with a slim parliamentary majority of 152 seats due to the electoral law in force at the time.\n\nIn a turbulent international political environment following the [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 Fall of Communism]] in Europe, Mitsotakis' government focused on cutting government spending, the privatization of state enterprises, the reformation of the public administration and the restoration of the original electoral system, with the addition of an [[election threshold]] of 3%. In foreign policy, the priorities were the restoration of confidence among Greece's economic and political partners, NATO and the [[United States]]. Mitsotakis also supported a new dialogue with [[Turkey]] on the [[Cyprus]] dispute and a compromise over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]]; the latter triggered an irritation among the MPs of New Democracy, which led [[Antonis Samaras]] to leave it and form a new political party in June 1993, [[Political Spring]]; one more withdrawal later from its parliamentary group resulted in New Democracy's loss of the majority in the parliament and the call of early elections.\n\n=== Opposition (1993\u20132004) ===\nIn the [[1993 Greek legislative election|1993 elections]], New Democracy suffered an easy defeat with 39.30% of the vote, something that led to Mitsotakis' resignation and the election of [[Miltiadis Evert]] in the party's leadership. In the early [[1996 Greek legislative election|1996 legislative election]], New Democracy was defeated again by [[Costas Simitis]]' PASOK registering 38.12%, but Evert obtained a re-election as the party's leader in the same year. However, in the spring of 1997 a new conference took place, in order to elect a new president among others. [[Kostas Karamanlis]], nephew of the party's founder, was elected the sixth president of New Democracy.\n\nUnder Karamanlis, New Democracy experienced an evident increase in popularity, but in the [[2000 Greek legislative election|2000 elections]] they lost by only 1.06% of the popular vote, the smallest margin in modern Greek history, registering 42.74% and obtaining 125 seats in the parliament. By 2003, New Democracy was consistently leading Simitis' PASOK in opinion polls; in January 2004 Simitis resigned and announced elections for 7 March, while [[George Papandreou]] succeeded him in PASOK's leadership.\n\n=== Third government (2004\u20132009) ===\nDespite speculation that Papandreou would succeed in restoring the party's fortunes, in the [[2004 Greek legislative election|2004 election]] Karamanlis managed to take a clear win with 45.36% of the vote and 165 seats, and New Democracy returned to power after eleven years in opposition, scoring an all-time record of 3,359,682 votes in the history of [[Elections in Greece|Greek elections]]. The regions that consistently support New Democracy include the [[Peloponnese]], [[Central Macedonia]] and [[West Macedonia]]. On the other hand, the party is weak in [[Crete]], the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Attica]] and [[West Greece]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - Karamanlis5.jpg|thumb|[[Kostas Karamanlis]] giving an interview at a 2008 EPP summit]]\nOn 16 September 2007, [[Kostas Karamanlis]] won re-election with a diminished majority in [[Parliament of Greece|Parliament]], and stated: \"Thank you for your trust.

By the age of 10, he had passed the audition for the Mitchell Boys Choir (founded by [[Bob Mitchell]]) in Hollywood, California where he studied music theory from 1974 to 1981. In 1977, whilst still attending the Mitchell Boys, he performed vocals on composer [[Ennio Morricone]]\u2019s [[Exorcist II: The Heretic]] soundtrack as well as contributing to the made for TV American movie [[The Possessed (1977 film)]] directed by [[Jerry Thorpe]]. In 1981 he performed and appeared in the Universal pic [[All Night Long (1981 film)]] starring [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Gene Hackman]] During this period, Darling also performed in [[La boh\u00e8me]] at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Musical Career==\nIn 1985, Darling formed his first band [[Antix (band)]] using his Greg Clewley family name. The band signed to [[Enigma Records]] and released the mini-album Get Up, Get Happy. In 1987, Darling met [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Poison (American band)]] and [[Motley Crue]] manager [[Vicky Hamilton]] who introduced him to producer Bob Rose and American [[Glam metal]]/[[Glam punk]] band [[Faster Pussycat]] who she also managed. Darling subsequently played piano and provided backing vocals for the band\u2019s 1987 [[Faster Pussycat (album)|self-titled debut album]].\nIn 1988 Darling recorded demos with his new band, Darling Cruel, and was offered a record contract by [[George Michael]] who had recently set up his own Mika Records imprint via [[Polygram]]. Soon after this Polygram signed Darling Cruel directly and, later that year, the band recorded their debut album \"Passion Crimes\" at [[Rockfield Studios]] in Monmouth, Wales. A year later Darling Cruel signed to George Michael\u2019s management company, Lippmann/Kahane.<ref name=\"LAtimes\"/>\n\nIn September 1989, Darling Cruel released their debut album \"Passion Crimes\". The album garnered great reviews and Darling\u2019s extraordinary vocal range was officially acknowledged for the first time \u2013 \u201ca man with a range and vision that is as unique in approach as W. Axl Rose of Guns n\u2019 Roses ..twisting with the confidence of Terence Trent Darby before contortioning into a mutoid David Coverdale\u201d.<ref name=\"MetalHammer\"/> \"Everything\u2019s Over\", the first single lifted from the album, secured active rotation on MTV for six months whilst the album entered the Billboard Top 200 album chart. \"Love Child\" became the second single to be released from the album.\n \nIn 1990 Polygram president Dick Asher resigned whilst Darling Cruel recorded new album \"Movies For The Mind\" in New York with producer [[Tony Visconti]]. New Polygram president [[Alain Levy]] \u2013 champion of [[Rhythm and blues|R \u2018n\u2019 B]] and [[Hip hop music|Rap music]] \u2013 disassociated himself from the new record that was subsequently shelved. In 1991, Darling Cruel toured the US, opening for [[The Moody Blues]] before dismembering. Darling remained with Polygram to co-write with [[Holly Knight]]. Together they produced \"Don\u2019t Like The Way You Look At My Love\" for [[Russ Irwin]], released on [[SBK Records]]. A year later Darling requested to be dropped from the label.\n\nIn 1994 Darling jammed live with [[Prince|Prince (musician)]] in [[Century City]] \u2013 \u201cI was playing a show and this guy comes over to the stage and says \u201cIs it ok if the Artist Formerly Known As Prince comes up to jam? Before you know it, the audience parts, and a little man in a golden suit approaches me walks right up on stage, looks directly at me and says \u2018What key are you in?\u2019 I said \u2018We\u2019re in C\u2019, and he replied \u2018Does your bass player know that?\u2019! I\u2019ll never forget it! My bass player is shaking, he\u2019s terrified. Fortunately, my guitar player recognized this, so he picks up the bass, hands Prince his guitar, and we went off for twenty three minutes on a musical safari, full of chord changes, alternating tempos... an absolutely extraordinary experience <ref name=\"Fireworks\"/> - and a year later he signed a publishing contract with [[Herman Rarebell]]\u2019s Monaco Records. This led to him co-writing five songs (including the title track) and playing piano) on [[Julian Lennon]]\u2019s critically acclaimed album [[Photograph Smile]]. Between 1998 and 2000 Darling embarked on a world tour with Lennon playing piano and providing backing vocals.\n \nIn 2001, Darling worked alongside producer [[Richard Perry]] as arranger and musician for his Baby Genius project before continuing his co-writing work with Julian Lennon at the latter\u2019s Treehouse Studios.

The album received critical acclaim throughout Europe \u2013 the record wasn\u2019t released in the US \u2013 and Darling found himself opening up for [[Bryan Adams]] throughout his 2007 tour of Italy.\n\nIn 2010 Darling released his second Bob Rose-produced album, \"Stew Americano\", for FOD Records which received outstanding reviews in the UK, [[Star_(magazine)|Star magazine]] acclaiming it \u201ca resolutely and gloriously old-fashioned album that echoes the storytelling stylings of Billy Joel and Elton John\u201d <ref name=\"StarMagazine\"/>, the Mail On Sunday maintaining it recalled \u201cElton John in his prime\u201d <ref name=\"MailOnSunday\"/> whilst Mark Edwards in the Sunday Times hailed it as \u201ca wonderful album full of classic 1970s-style piano pop that should delight anyone who loves peak-period Elton John, Joe Jackson or even Elvis Costello at his mellowest.\u201d <ref name=\"SundayTimes\"/>  The album spawned the singles \"Kiss The Pain\", \"Somebody Kill The DJ\", \"Hard Way Back\" and \"Where Were You Last Night\".\n\nDarling played piano on Gus Macgregor\u2019s debut album \"Under The Sun\" released in 2011. The same year saw him collaborate with electro/acoustic/pop/folk/reggae outfit Caligagan on their album \"Naked Garden\" and co-writing three songs \u2013 \"Hold On\", \"Don\u2019t Wake Me Up\" and \"Beautiful\" \u2013 on [[Julian Lennon]]\u2019s Everything Changes album.\n\nIn 2012 Darling released his third solo album \"Coloured Life\" on FOD Records, an album that again saw him compared to both Elton John and Billy Joel.<ref name=\"SundayTimes2\"/> He subsequently performed piano on [[East 17]]\u2019s fifth album [[Dark_Light_(East_17_album)|Dark Light]] (2012) then performed co-writing duties, played piano and provided background vocals on [[Tony Mortimer]]\u2019s debut solo album \"Songs From The Suitcase\" released in 2013. In 2014 he co-wrote the song \"I Want Love To Punch Me In The Face\" with Blondie\u2019s [[Nigel Harrison]] and [[Michael Des Barres]] for the latter\u2019s \"The Key To The Universe album\".\n\nIn 2015 Darling provided vocals for Regan\u2019s Theme on Ennio Morricone\u2019s Oscar-winning score for [[Quentin Tarantino]]\u2019s \"The Hateful Eight\" whilst also co-writing the song \"On The Metro\" with [[Dan Reed]] for Reed\u2019s album Transmission.\n\nIn 2016 Darling narrated Cosmos Discovery for [[NASA]] and released his first official album in the US entitled \"Songs From Under The Hat\", the album was a compilation of highlights taken from Darling\u2019s first three releases \"Shell\", \"Stew Americano\" and \"Colored Life\". Darling also co-wrote \"When You Shine\" and \"I\u2019m Alive\" with English 'People\u2019s Tenor' [[Russell Watson]] for Watson\u2019s album \"True Stories\". Darling subsequently played piano for Watson on his 2017 UK tour.\n \n==Current activity==\nDarling, who is a long-term resident of Europe, has attained Top 40 US Billboard status for his last four single releases.

Initially, as part of the deal, the city was asked to donate 35 acres (142,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) of land for construction of the factory. A derelict farm was selected for this, however the owners refused to sell the property unless the city purchased their entire 71 acres for $3,550. Four Elgin businessmen agreed to purchase the property and then donated the required 35 acres to the watch company. The company was re-organized in April 1865 and the factory was completed in 1866. The first [[Movement (clockwork)|movement]], delivered in 1867, was named the B.W. Raymond in honor of Benjamin W. Raymond. The watch was an 18 size, full plate design. In 1869, the National Watch Company won \"Best Watches, Illinois Manufacture\" at the 17th Annual [[Illinois State Fair]], for which it won a silver medal.<ref>John P. Reynolds.

The company produced many of the [[automatic watch|self-winding]] wristwatch movements made in the United States beginning with the 607 and 618 calibers (which were bumper wind) and the calibers 760 and 761 (30 and 27 [[jewel bearing|jewels]] respectively).\n\nDuring [[World War II]] all civilian manufacturing was halted and the company moved into the defense industry, manufacturing military watches, [[Chronometer watch|chronometer]]s, [[Fuse_(explosives)|fuzes]] for artillery shells, [[altimeter]]s and other aircraft instruments and sapphire bearings used for aiming cannons.\n\nOver time a number of additional plants were operated, mostly in Elgin. However, additional plants were located in [[Aurora, Illinois]] and [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]. The original, obsolete factory in Elgin closed in 1964, after having produced half of the total number of pocket watches manufactured in the United States ([[Dollar watch|dollar-type]] not included).

Unlike many other city bike systems, riders do not need to pick up a card to access the system. A rider can register for and pay for a daily, weekly or annual pass. The rider will be given a personal cyclist ID and a PIN code for unlocking a bike from any station. The locations of stations and information about bike availability can be accessed on HSL's [[Public transport route planner#Finland|Journey Planner]]. A [[Helsinki Regional Transport Authority#Ticketing|HSL Travel Card]] can be used instead of a cyclist ID. The pass entitles the user to an unlimited number of rides of up to 30 minutes. Extra charges apply for longer journeys. \n<ref>{{cite web | title = City bikes | publisher = HSL | url = https://www.hsl.fi/en/citybikes | accessdate = 5 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = T\u00e4llaisia ovat Helsingin uudet kaupunkipy\u00f6r\u00e4t \u2013 \"Se on kirkkaankeltainen perusmummis\" | publisher = [[Helsingin Sanomat]] |language=Finnish| url = http://www.hs.fi/kaupunki/a1457073774229 | accessdate = 8 May 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Stadscyklarna \u00e4r h\u00e4r \u2013 nu \u00e4r det gult p\u00e5 gatorna | publisher = [[Hufvudstadsbladet]] |language=Swedish| url = https://www.hbl.fi/artikel/nu-ar-det-gult-pa-gatorna/| accessdate = 8 May 2016 }}</ref>\n\nBikes are available from April until 31 October, unlike many other public bicycle programs that are available throughout the year.\n\n==Financing and management==\nThe Helsinki city bike system is procured by [[Helsinki City Transport]].
