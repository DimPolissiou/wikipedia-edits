{"title_page": "Personal defense weapon", "text_new": "[[File:FN-P90 2.jpg|thumb|[[FN P90]]]]\n\n'''Personal defense weapons''' ('''PDWs''') are a class of compact, [[selective fire]], [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]]-fed, [[submachine gun]]-like [[firearm]]s\u2014essentially a hybrid between a conventional submachine gun and a [[assault rifles#Compact assault rifles|compact assault rifle]].  Most PDWs fire a small-caliber (less than 6 mm), high-velocity [[centerfire]] bottleneck [[cartridge (firearm)|cartridge]] resembling a scaled down/shortened [[intermediate cartridge|intermediate]] [[rifle cartridge]].  This gives the PDWs better effective range, accuracy and [[armor-piercing bullet|armor-penetrating]] capability than submachine guns, which fire the larger-caliber [[List of handgun cartridges|handgun cartridges]].\n\nThe name describes the weapon's original conceptual role: as a compact but powerful small arm that can be conveniently carried by support troops behind the frontline such as [[military engineer]]s, [[military logistics|logistic]] drivers, [[artillery]] crews or [[signaller]]s.  These personnel may be at risk of encountering decently equipped enemy [[infiltration tactics|infiltrator]]s and having to defend themselves in [[close quarters combat|close quarters]], which warrants an effective weapon that can suppress enemy [[charge (warfare)|charge]]s and hold them beyond a safe distance to prevent the defenders from being overrun, but such risk is rare enough that a long-barrel [[service rifle]] would be an unnecessary burden during their normal duties.  Because of their ease of use, light weight and controllability, PDWs have also been used by [[special forces]], [[paramilitaries]], [[police militarization|heavily-armed police]] and even [[bodyguard]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mauser C96 M1916 Red 9 7.JPG|thumb|9mm Parabellum \"Red 9\" Mauser C96 with stock]]\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, shortened versions of the infantry rifle were issued as \"carbines\" for cavalry troops and gun crews.  This designation was dropped as infantry rifle designs became shortened overall, such as in the [[Lee\u2013Enfield#Short Magazine Lee\u2013Enfield Mk I|Short Magazine Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifle.  Thereafter, [[handgun]]s were typically issued as a self-defense weapons.  However, they were not effective in most [[close combat]] situations.  As a result, during the First World War, the [[Mauser C96]] and artillery versions of the [[Luger pistol]] were issued with attachable shoulder stock holsters, which allowed for greater control and accuracy.\n\n[[File:Pedersen device.PNG|thumb|Pedersen device drawing]]\nDuring [[World War I]], the United States secretly developed the [[Pedersen device]] attachment for the [[M1903 Springfield rifle]] that allowed it to fire a .30 caliber (7.62&nbsp;mm) pistol-type cartridge in [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] mode.<ref name=\"auto\">https://www.guns.com/news/2013/06/22/perishings-super-weapon-the-pedersen-device/ The Pedersen Device: The WWI superweapon that (almost) won the war. 6/22/13. by Chris Eger</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">Military Small Arms of the 20th Century. 7th Edition. by Ian V.

The PDW is a compact automatic weapon that can defeat enemy [[ballistic vest|body armor]] and which can be used conveniently by non-combatant and support troops, as well as a [[close quarters battle]] weapon for [[special forces]] and [[counter-terrorist]] groups.<ref name=\"miller2001\">{{cite book |first=David |last=Miller |year=2001 |title=The Illustrated Directory of 20th Century Guns |publisher=Salamander Books Ltd. |location=London |isbn=9781840652451}}</ref><ref name=\"oliver2007\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.global-defence.com/2006/Utilities/article.php?id=40 \n |title=In the Line of Fire \n |author=Oliver, David \n |year=2007 \n |publisher=Global Defence Review \n |accessdate=October 19, 2009 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016074936/http://www.global-defence.com/2006/Utilities/article.php?id=40 \n |archivedate=October 16, 2006 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\nIntroduced in 1991, the [[FN P90]] features a [[bullpup]] design with a futuristic appearance.

Featuring a more conventional looking design, the MP7 uses a short stroke piston gas system as used on [[Heckler & Koch|H&K]]'s [[Heckler & Koch G36|G36]] and [[Heckler & Koch HK416|HK416]] assault rifles, in place of a [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]] system traditionally seen on submachine guns.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_2_49/ai_95680072/ | work=Guns Magazine | first=Charles Q. | last=Cutshaw | title=Heckler & Koch's cutting-edge compacts G36C and MP7 PDW: when less really is more | year=2003}}</ref> The MP7 is able to use 20-, 30- and 40-round magazines and fires [[4.6\u00d730mm]] ammunition which can penetrate soft body armor.

PDWs use a proprietary [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], such as the [[5.7\u00d728mm]] cartridge for the [[FN P90]] or [[4.6\u00d730mm]] for the [[Heckler & Koch MP7]], neither of which were originally compatible with any existing pistols or rifles (although both manufacturers planned handguns that used the same proprietary rounds, only FN went forward with production of the [[Five-seven|Five-Seven pistol]], chambered for the 5.7\u00d728mm cartridge). A different take on the PDW concept is the Russian made [[PP-2000]], which can fire common [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] ammunition or a special high-pressure [[armor-piercing]] version to give it similar capabilities as other PDWs.\n\nThough personal defense weapons have not been very popular for their intended application, they have been acquired by many [[special forces]] and [[law enforcement]] groups as direct replacements for submachine guns.

Featuring a more conventional looking design, the MP7 uses a short stroke piston gas system as used on [[Heckler & Koch|H&K]]'s [[Heckler & Koch G36|G36]] and [[Heckler & Koch HK416|HK416]] assault rifles, in place of a [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]] system traditionally seen on submachine guns.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_2_49/ai_95680072/ | work=Guns Magazine | first=Charles Q. | last=Cutshaw | title=Heckler & Koch's cutting-edge compacts G36C and MP7 PDW: when less really is more | year=2003}}</ref> The MP7 is able to use 20-, 30- and 40-round magazines and fires [[4.6\u00d730mm]] ammunition which can penetrate soft body armor.

PDWs use a proprietary [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], such as the [[5.7\u00d728mm]] cartridge for the [[FN P90]] or [[4.6\u00d730mm]] for the [[Heckler & Koch MP7]], neither of which were originally compatible with any existing pistols or rifles (although both manufacturers planned handguns that used the same proprietary rounds, only FN went forward with production of the [[Five-seven|Five-Seven pistol]], chambered for the 5.7\u00d728mm cartridge). A different take on the PDW concept is the Russian made [[PP-2000]], which can fire common [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] ammunition or a special high-pressure [[armor-piercing]] version to give it similar capabilities as other PDWs.\n\nThough personal defense weapons have not been very popular for their intended application, they have been acquired by many [[special forces]] and [[law enforcement]] groups as direct replacements for submachine guns.

Used as the [[theme music|theme song]] for the 1995 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film ''[[Toy Story]]'', it has since become a major musical component for its sequels, ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999), ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010) and ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' (2019) as well as a musical [[leitmotif]] throughout the whole [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]]. The song was nominated for both the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]], but lost both to \"[[Colors of the Wind]]\" from Disney's ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]''.\n\nLike many other Disney theme songs, \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" has been covered numerous times. Cover versions featured in the first three ''Toy Story'' films include a duet with Newman and [[Lyle Lovett]] in ''[[Toy Story]]; '' a [[Cinematic techniques#Sound|diegetic]] instance by [[Tom Hanks]], a version by [[Robert Goulet]] and an instrumental by [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]] in ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and a [[Spanish language]] version by the [[Gipsy Kings]] in ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.\n\n==In ''Toy Story''==\nThe song is played during the opening credits for ''Toy Story,'' ''Toy Story 3'', and ''Toy Story 4'', establishing the importance of Woody and Andy in the first film and the importance of all his toys in the third and fourth. ''Toy Story 3'' also uses it for irony and dramatic effect, as the opening credits harken back to the first film and the song abruptly fades out with \"As the years go by, Our friendship will never die\", before showing that Andy's remaining toys in the present day are boxed up and unused. When they were unused, Andy was 17 years old. In ''Toy Story 4,'' the song is heard during the opening montage, that features Andy playing with Woody, giving him to Bonnie as a teenager, and Bonnie playing with him, but soon starting to neglect him.\n\nIn two sequels, the song is listened to by the characters as part of the story, as cover versions done at the end of the film for thematic reasons: at the end of ''Toy Story 2'', the character Wheezy starts to sing it to the other toys; during the end credits of ''Toy Story 3'', Buzz Lightyear and Jessie (now a couple) perform a [[pasodoble]] to a Spanish version of the song, deliberately played by Jessie to get Buzz to dance.\n\nThe most significant use of the song was in the third act of ''Toy Story 2'', where an episode of ''Woody's Roundup'' (the 1950s puppet show he was based on) shows the puppet Woody singing the song, directed at the young audience and featuring a small child hugging the puppet. Woody sees this and has an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], realizing that his mission as a toy is to be there for a child. (In-universe, the song was presumably written for ''Woody's Roundup''.)\n\nThe ''Woody's Roundup'' version was performed by [[Tom Hanks]], with acoustic guitar backing; Wheezy's version was sung by [[Robert Goulet]] (though the character was voiced by [[Joe Ranft]]); and the Spanish version, \"You've Got a Friend in Me (Para el Buzz Espa\u00f1ol)\", was performed by the [[Gipsy Kings]].\n\n==Chart performance==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1996)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canadian ''RPM'' Adult Contemporary\n|align=\"center\"|40\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (2010)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|119\n|}\n\n===Certifications===\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United States|title=You've Got a Friend in Me|artist=Randy Newman|type=single|award=Gold|relyear=2004|certyear=2013}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom}}\n\n==Release history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Format\n!Release date\n!Catalog\n|-\n|Demo\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Unreleased\n|rowspan=\"1\" {{N/A|none}}\n\n|-\n|Cassette\n|rowspan=\"2\"|April 12, 1996<ref name=\"single\"/>\n|rowspan=\"2\"|#60367\n|-\n|CD\n|-\n|}\n\n==Cover versions==\n[[Michael Bubl\u00e9]] covered \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" on his 2013 album, ''[[To Be Loved]]''.

Cover versions featured in the first three ''Toy Story'' films include a duet with Newman and [[Lyle Lovett]] in ''[[Toy Story]]; '' a [[Cinematic techniques#Sound|diegetic]] instance by [[Tom Hanks]], a version by [[Robert Goulet]] and an instrumental by [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]] in ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and a [[Spanish language]] version by the [[Gipsy Kings]] in ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.\n\n==In ''Toy Story''==\nThe song is played during the opening credits for ''Toy Story,'' ''Toy Story 3'', and ''Toy Story 4'', establishing the importance of Woody and Andy in the first film and the importance of all his toys in the third and fourth. ''Toy Story 3'' also uses it for irony and dramatic effect, as the opening credits harken back to the first film and the song abruptly fades out with \"As the years go by, Our friendship will never die\", before showing that Andy's remaining toys in the present day are boxed up and unused. When they were unused, Andy was 17 years old. In ''Toy Story 4,'' the song is heard during the opening montage, that features Andy playing with Woody, giving him to Bonnie as a teenager, and Bonnie playing with him, but soon starting to neglect him.\n\nIn two sequels, the song is listened to by the characters as part of the story, as cover versions done at the end of the film for thematic reasons: at the end of ''Toy Story 2'', the character Wheezy starts to sing it to the other toys; during the end credits of ''Toy Story 3'', Buzz Lightyear and Jessie (now a couple) perform a [[pasodoble]] to a Spanish version of the song, deliberately played by Jessie to get Buzz to dance.\n\nThe most significant use of the song was in the third act of ''Toy Story 2'', where an episode of ''Woody's Roundup'' (the 1950s puppet show he was based on) shows the puppet Woody singing the song, directed at the young audience and featuring a small child hugging the puppet. Woody sees this and has an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], realizing that his mission as a toy is to be there for a child. (In-universe, the song was presumably written for ''Woody's Roundup''.)\n\nThe ''Woody's Roundup'' version was performed by [[Tom Hanks]], with acoustic guitar backing; Wheezy's version was sung by [[Robert Goulet]] (though the character was voiced by [[Joe Ranft]]); and the Spanish version, \"You've Got a Friend in Me (Para el Buzz Espa\u00f1ol)\", was performed by the [[Gipsy Kings]].\n\n==Chart performance==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1996)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canadian ''RPM'' Adult Contemporary\n|align=\"center\"|40\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (2010)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|119\n|}\n\n===Certifications===\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United States|title=You've Got a Friend in Me|artist=Randy Newman|type=single|award=Gold|relyear=2004|certyear=2013}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom}}\n\n==Release history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Format\n!Release date\n!Catalog\n|-\n|Demo\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Unreleased\n|rowspan=\"1\" {{N/A|none}}\n\n|-\n|Cassette\n|rowspan=\"2\"|April 12, 1996<ref name=\"single\"/>\n|rowspan=\"2\"|#60367\n|-\n|CD\n|-\n|}\n\n==Cover versions==\n[[Michael Bubl\u00e9]] covered \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" on his 2013 album, ''[[To Be Loved]]''.

Portrayed by series regular [[Allison Mack]], the character was created exclusively for ''Smallville'' by series developers [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]]. Other than main character [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]], Chloe is the only main character to last the duration of the show, though Mack signed on for only five episodes in the tenth and final season.<ref name=TVGuide>Sands, Rich. \"''Smallville'''s Chloe Makes Her Comic-Book Debut\" ''[[TV Guide]]''; September 27, 2010; Page 10</ref> The character has also appeared in various literature based on ''Smallville'', an internet series, and was then later adapted back into the original Superman comics which inspired ''Smallville''.\n\nIn ''Smallville'', Chloe is [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]'s best friend, [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]]'s cousin, and the editor of the high school newspaper the ''Torch''; she notices that the meteor rocks ([[kryptonite]]) are mutating the citizens of Smallville which she tracks on her \"Wall of Weird\". She generally teams up with Clark and [[Characters of Smallville#Pete Ross|Pete Ross]] in tracking and stopping meteor-infected people from harming other citizens. In the first five seasons, Chloe harbors an unrequited love for Clark, but eventually accepts her place as his best friend and nothing more. In later seasons, Chloe discovers she has a meteor rock power of her own, until she apparently loses them during an encounter with the alien [[supervillain]] [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. In terms of romantic storylines, after ''Superman'' supporting character [[Jimmy Olsen (Smallville)|Jimmy Olsen]] is introduced to the show, he becomes Chloe's boyfriend and later husband, but the pair later divorce. In the show's final seasons, Chloe finds romance with [[Justice League (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]], otherwise known as the costumed vigilante-archer [[Green Arrow in other media#Smallville|Green Arrow]], whom she eventually marries and has a son with.\n\nChloe Sullivan has been characterized as independent, intelligent, curious and impulsive by both the writers and the actress that portrays her. The latter two characteristics often cause Chloe to get into trouble with both her friends and with local industrialists [[Lionel Luthor]] and his son [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex]], two of the show's primary antagonists. Mack has been recognized with multiple award nominations and wins for her portrayal of Chloe.\n\n==Role in ''Smallville''==\nIntroduced in the [[Pilot (Smallville)|series pilot]], Chloe spends much of season one helping her best friend Clark Kent ([[Tom Welling]]) stop the citizens of Smallville who have developed special abilities from genetic mutations, caused by the [[Kryptonite|meteor rocks]] that fell to Smallville in 1989, from committing crimes. It is established that Chloe is the editor of the school newspaper the ''Torch'' at the start of the [[Smallville (season 1)|first season]]. Her journalistic curiosity\u2014always wanting to \"expose falsehoods\" and \"know the truth\"<ref name=\"Allison\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.128\u2013131</ref>\u2014causes tension with her friends, especially when she is digging into Clark's past in the [[Smallville (season 2)|season two]] episode \"Lineage\".<ref>{{cite episode|title=Lineage|series=Smallville|credits=Alfred Gough, Miles Millar (writers) & Greg Beeman (director)|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]|airdate=November 5, 2002|season=2|number=7}}</ref> In the early seasons, Chloe hides the fact that she is in love with Clark, although the feeling is not reciprocated; she confesses her true feelings to Clark in season two's \"Fever\" while he is sick, but he calls out [[Lana Lang (Smallville)|Lana Lang]]'s name in his delirium.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Fever|series=Smallville|credits=Matthew Okumura (writer) & Bill Gereghty (director)|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]|airdate=February 18, 2003|season=2|number=16}}</ref> Her feelings for Clark get in the way of her better judgment as she betrays his trust in the season two finale, after witnessing him and Lana Lang ([[Kristin Kreuk]]) sharing a kiss in his barn, and agrees to uncover information on Clark for [[Lionel Luthor]] ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]) in exchange for a job at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Exodus|series=Smallville|credits=Alfred Gough, Miles Millar (writers) & Greg Beeman (director)|network=The WB|airdate=May 20, 2003|season=2|number=23}}</ref>\n\nChloe and Clark patch their relationship in the [[Smallville (season 3)|season three]] episode \"Whisper\", after Clark discovers that she has been helping Lionel.

Mack enjoys the fact that her character was created specifically for the show, because she feels like she does not have to worry about being compared to someone else in the same role, which she likens to people comparing Michael Rosenbaum's performance as Lex Luthor to [[Gene Hackman]]'s portrayal in the [[Superman in film|''Superman'' film series]] of the 1970s \u2013 1980s.<ref name=\"AM1\"/> Mack only signed on for five episodes of the tenth and final season.<ref name=TVGuide/>\n\n==Character development==\n\n===Storyline progression===\n<!--STOP! THESE SECTIONS ARE FOR REAL WORLD CONTENT ONLY. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO DISCUSS GENERAL PLOT INFO, BUT WHERE ANALYSIS OF PLOT, RELATIONSHIPS, AND CHARACTERIZATION IS GIVEN BY REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nAllison Mack was disappointed that the character \"lost some of her backbone\" in the second season. The second season was about exploring Chloe's heart, and the idea of her being this \"lovelorn [\u2026] angsty teenager\". As Mack describes her, \"[Chloe] was a little spineless and a little bit too much of a pushover [in season two].\" Mack does believe that by the end of the season Chloe manages to get some of that integrity back.<ref name=\"AM2\"/> The actress likes to make sure that her character is kept \"smart\" and \"ambitious\",<ref name=\"AM3\"/> but at the end of season two Chloe's impulsiveness causes her to get stuck under Lionel's control, when she \"spitefully\" agrees to uncover Clark's secrets for Lionel Luthor after Clark is not honest with her about his newly established relationship with Lana.<ref name=\"AM2\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 2 Companion) pp.132-135</ref>\n\nFor season three, Mack wanted the character to be given a major obstacle to overcome, something that would help the character mature. The obstacle in question became Lionel's control over Chloe, after she made a deal to spy on Clark. Allison Mack believes that Chloe is in her own comfort zone while she is working at the ''Torch'', as she is in complete control, but likens Chloe being under Lionel's control to that of a \"caged animal\". When she ruins the lives of a mother and her son in season three's \"Truth\", after exposing the mother as a fugitive from the law, Chloe is forced to look deeper into her own self. Mack believes that this event was a turning point for Chloe's maturity; it is the moment that she realizes that there needs to be a line she should never cross.<ref name=\"AM3\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 3 Companion) pp.126-129</ref> After it is revealed to Clark in the season five premiere that Chloe knows his secret, the character becomes a larger part of the storyline for the show. Knowing Clark's secret allowed Chloe to finally come to terms with her feelings for Clark, and recognize where their relationship will always be; Chloe's acceptance of her place in Clark's life provides a means for the two to have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe's unrequited love. According to Mack, Chloe has learned to evolve her love for Clark into something more \"genuine\" and \"selfless\".<ref name=\"AM5\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp. 128-131</ref>\n\nFor the actress, having Chloe become part of the meteor infected community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people\u2014the meteor infected\u2014she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand what it feels like to live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the ''Daily Planet'' allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her \u2013 her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.<ref name=\"AM6\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 6 Companion) pp. 128-131</ref>\n\n===Characterization===\n<!--STOP! THESE SECTIONS ARE FOR REAL WORLD CONTENT ONLY. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO DISCUSS GENERAL PLOT INFO, BUT WHERE ANALYSIS OF PLOT, RELATIONSHIPS, AND CHARACTERIZATION IS GIVEN BY REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nAllison Mack characterizes Chloe as being a \"misfit\" during the first season; more of \"a really smart girl with attitude\". She goes on to describe Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe's defining characteristics is her need to \"expose falsehoods\" and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious, and wants to be honest with people. She is always trying to make sense of the situation.<ref name=\"AM1\"/> Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel.<ref name=\"AM2\"/> The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that \"drives [Chloe] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is\".<ref name=\"AM3\"/>\n\nA leading theory among audiences was that Chloe would eventually change her name to Lois Lane, Clark's wife in the comics, as she embodies various characteristics that Lois Lane has in the comic books.<ref name=\"AM1\"/> The creative team removed the notion that Chloe was going to turn into Clark's future wife when they introduced Lois Lane in season four. Though the characters share similarities, according to Mack, Chloe and Lois are more \"different shades of the same color [\u2026] Chloe is a softer version of Lois\". Chloe's upbringing allows her to be less jaded than Lois. Chloe also looks to the future, whereas Lois is more shortsighted.<ref name=\"AM4\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 4 Companion) pp. 126-129</ref>\n\nThe season six finale reveals that Chloe has the ability to heal others.<ref name=\"Phantom ep\"/> Mack describes Chloe's newfound meteor power as similar to \"[[empathy]]\". The actress further defines the power as the ability to heal others by taking their pain and making it her own.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jason C. |url=http://blogs.trb.com/network/cwsource/2007/09/cw_source_exclusive_allison_ma.html |title=Allison Mack - Smallville's Chloe Sullivan - Part 1 |publisher=CWSOURCE |accessdate=September 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011011444/http://blogs.trb.com/network/cwsource/2007/09/cw_source_exclusive_allison_ma.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}</ref> Writer Todd Slavkin contends that giving Chloe the power to heal was the best choice for the character. According to Slavkin, Chloe has sacrificed so much in her life for the greater good that it only seemed natural that her meteor power would reflect that. For the writer, it did not make sense for her ability to be something \"malicious and evil and destructive\".<ref name=\"AM6\"/> In season eight, Chloe discovers that she also has super-intelligence \u2013 being able to solve complex algorithms faster than LuthorCorp's most powerful supercomputer.<ref name=\"Odyssey ep\"/> She and Clark later deduce that her newfound intelligence was brought on during her encounter with Brainiac, who infected her with a part of himself during his attack.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Toxic|series=[[Smallville]]|credits=Caroline Dries (writer) & Mairzee Almas (director)|network=The CW|airdate=October 2, 2008|season=8}}</ref>\n\n===Relationships===\n<!--STOP! THESE SECTIONS ARE FOR REAL WORLD CONTENT ONLY. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO DISCUSS GENERAL PLOT INFO, BUT WHERE ANALYSIS OF PLOT, RELATIONSHIPS, AND CHARACTERIZATION IS GIVEN BY REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nOne of Chloe's key relationships is with the series protagonist, Clark Kent. Although believers in the \"Chlois\" theory initially suspected that Chloe would eventually become Lois Lane, Clark's future wife in the comics, Mack contends that Clark does not love Chloe in the way that she loves him. The actress does not believe that Clark's feelings will ever change.<ref name=\"AM1\"/> Regardless of Clark's feelings, Mack recognizes that Chloe is blinded by her love for Clark, which ultimately affects her judgment in not only seeing Clark's faults, but making choices that place her character in danger.<ref name=\"AM3\"/> In season five, Clark finally discovers that Chloe knows his secret, and this revelation allows Chloe the opportunity to come to terms with her feelings for Clark; this also provided a means for the two have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe's unrequited love.<ref name=\"AM5\"/>\n\nSpeaking on the evolving relationship of Clark and Chloe, Mack believes that the season six introduction of Jimmy Olsen into Chloe's life increased her value to Clark. Before, Chloe would drop anything for Clark, but now that Chloe has other priorities, it makes Clark realize how valuable she is to him. The introduction of Jimmy Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can finally have a romantic relationship with. The relationship is strained when Chloe has to lie to cover up Clark's secret, as well as keeping the fact that she is meteor-infected hidden. Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe's heart that Clark occupied for so long.<ref name=\"AM6\"/>\n\nChloe's relationship with her mother is one tackled both off-screen and behind the scenes. In a brainstorming session, Mack, Gough and Millar came up with the idea that Chloe's mother had left her at a young age. Mack wanted to make the character a \"[[latchkey kid]]\", in an effort to explain why she is out all hours of the night. Mack feels that Chloe has real [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]], which play on the fact that she never feels like she is good enough for anyone. These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love her the same way that she loves him, as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends.<ref name=\"AM2\"/> One of Chloe's story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution, and living with the fear that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility. This fear also affects Clark, who worries that keeping his secret will have negative effects on Chloe, like it did Pete.<ref name=\"AM5\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nAllison Mack has been nominated for a number of awards for her role as Chloe Sullivan.

Those roles were already filled by the adult comic book versions of [[Lana Lang]] and [[Lois Lane]], so the plan was to give the character a new background. Busiek hoped to make Chloe the younger sister of someone Clark had gone to school with, who was a now interning at the ''Daily Planet''. Busiek believed that this would make her different from Lana and Lois, but still familiar to readers who also watched the show. Another distinguishing feature would be that this version of Chloe would not know Clark's secret, nor would she be meteor infected. These ideas never came to fruition.<ref>{{cite news|author=Troy Brownfield |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=139973 |title=Smallville's 'Chloe Sullivan' joins the Superman supporting cast |publisher=Newsarama |date=December 17, 2007 |accessdate=December 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100118170718/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=139973 |archivedate=January 18, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nChloe first appeared in \"Jimmy Olsen's Big Week\", a serialized ''[[Jimmy Olsen]]'' story written by [[Nick Spencer]], beginning in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #893 (November 2010).<ref name=TVGuide/><ref>Manning, Shaun.

Portrayed by series regular [[Allison Mack]], the character was created exclusively for ''Smallville'' by series developers [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]]. Other than main character [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]], Chloe is the only main character to last the duration of the show, though Mack signed on for only five episodes in the tenth and final season.<ref name=TVGuide>Sands, Rich. \"''Smallville'''s Chloe Makes Her Comic-Book Debut\" ''[[TV Guide]]''; September 27, 2010; Page 10</ref> The character has also appeared in various literature based on ''Smallville'', an internet series, and was then later adapted back into the original Superman comics which inspired ''Smallville''.\n\nIn ''Smallville'', Chloe is [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]'s best friend, [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]]'s cousin, and the editor of the high school newspaper the ''Torch''; she notices that the meteor rocks ([[kryptonite]]) are mutating the citizens of Smallville which she tracks on her \"Wall of Weird\". She generally teams up with Clark and [[Characters of Smallville#Pete Ross|Pete Ross]] in tracking and stopping meteor-infected people from harming other citizens. In the first five seasons, Chloe harbors an unrequited love for Clark, but eventually accepts her place as his best friend and nothing more. In later seasons, Chloe discovers she has a meteor rock power of her own, until she apparently loses them during an encounter with the alien [[supervillain]] [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. In terms of romantic storylines, after ''Superman'' supporting character [[Jimmy Olsen (Smallville)|Jimmy Olsen]] is introduced to the show, he becomes Chloe's boyfriend and later husband, but the pair later divorce. In the show's final seasons, Chloe finds romance with [[Justice League (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]], otherwise known as the costumed vigilante-archer [[Green Arrow in other media#Smallville|Green Arrow]], whom she eventually marries and has a son with.\n\nChloe Sullivan has been characterized as independent, intelligent, curious and impulsive by both the writers and the actress that portrays her. The latter two characteristics often cause Chloe to get into trouble with both her friends and with local industrialists [[Lionel Luthor]] and his son [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex]], two of the show's primary antagonists. Mack has been recognized with multiple award nominations and wins for her portrayal of Chloe.\n\n==Role in ''Smallville''==\nIntroduced in the [[Pilot (Smallville)|series pilot]], Chloe spends much of season one helping her best friend Clark Kent ([[Tom Welling]]) stop the citizens of Smallville who have developed special abilities from genetic mutations, caused by the [[Kryptonite|meteor rocks]] that fell to Smallville in 1989, from committing crimes. It is established that Chloe is the editor of the school newspaper the ''Torch'' at the start of the [[Smallville (season 1)|first season]].

The second season was about exploring Chloe's heart, and the idea of her being this \"lovelorn [\u2026] angsty teenager\".

Allison Mack believes that Chloe is in her own comfort zone while she is working at the ''Torch'', as she is in complete control, but likens Chloe being under Lionel's control to that of a \"caged animal\". When she ruins the lives of a mother and her son in season three's \"Truth\", after exposing the mother as a fugitive from the law, Chloe is forced to look deeper into her own self. Mack believes that this event was a turning point for Chloe's maturity; it is the moment that she realizes that there needs to be a line she should never cross.<ref name=\"AM3\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 3 Companion) pp.126-129</ref> After it is revealed to Clark in the season five premiere that Chloe knows his secret, the character becomes a larger part of the storyline for the show. Knowing Clark's secret allowed Chloe to finally come to terms with her feelings for Clark, and recognize where their relationship will always be; Chloe's acceptance of her place in Clark's life provides a means for the two to have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe's unrequited love. According to Mack, Chloe has learned to evolve her love for Clark into something more \"genuine\" and \"selfless\".<ref name=\"AM5\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp. 128-131</ref>\n\nFor the actress, having Chloe become part of the meteor infected community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people\u2014the meteor infected\u2014she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand what it feels like to live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the ''Daily Planet'' allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her \u2013 her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.<ref name=\"AM6\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 6 Companion) pp. 128-131</ref>\n\n===Characterization===\n<!--STOP! THESE SECTIONS ARE FOR REAL WORLD CONTENT ONLY. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO DISCUSS GENERAL PLOT INFO, BUT WHERE ANALYSIS OF PLOT, RELATIONSHIPS, AND CHARACTERIZATION IS GIVEN BY REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nAllison Mack characterizes Chloe as being a \"misfit\" during the first season; more of \"a really smart girl with attitude\". She goes on to describe Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe's defining characteristics is her need to \"expose falsehoods\" and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious, and wants to be honest with people. She is always trying to make sense of the situation.<ref name=\"AM1\"/> Next to her curiosity, her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel.<ref name=\"AM2\"/> The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that \"drives [Chloe] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is\".<ref name=\"AM3\"/>\n\nA leading theory among audiences was that Chloe would eventually change her name to Lois Lane, Clark's wife in the comics, as she embodies various characteristics that Lois Lane has in the comic books.<ref name=\"AM1\"/> The creative team removed the notion that Chloe was going to turn into Clark's future wife when they introduced Lois Lane in season four. Though the characters share similarities, according to Mack, Chloe and Lois are more \"different shades of the same color [\u2026] Chloe is a softer version of Lois\". Chloe's upbringing allows her to be less jaded than Lois. Chloe also looks to the future, whereas Lois is more shortsighted.<ref name=\"AM4\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 4 Companion) pp. 126-129</ref>\n\nThe season six finale reveals that Chloe has the ability to heal others.<ref name=\"Phantom ep\"/> Mack describes Chloe's newfound meteor power as similar to \"[[empathy]]\". The actress further defines the power as the ability to heal others by taking their pain and making it her own.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jason C. |url=http://blogs.trb.com/network/cwsource/2007/09/cw_source_exclusive_allison_ma.html |title=Allison Mack - Smallville's Chloe Sullivan - Part 1 |publisher=CWSOURCE |accessdate=September 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011011444/http://blogs.trb.com/network/cwsource/2007/09/cw_source_exclusive_allison_ma.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}</ref> Writer Todd Slavkin contends that giving Chloe the power to heal was the best choice for the character. According to Slavkin, Chloe has sacrificed so much in her life for the greater good that it only seemed natural that her meteor power would reflect that. For the writer, it did not make sense for her ability to be something \"malicious and evil and destructive\".<ref name=\"AM6\"/> In season eight, Chloe discovers that she also has super-intelligence \u2013 being able to solve complex algorithms faster than LuthorCorp's most powerful supercomputer.<ref name=\"Odyssey ep\"/> She and Clark later deduce that her newfound intelligence was brought on during her encounter with Brainiac, who infected her with a part of himself during his attack.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Toxic|series=[[Smallville]]|credits=Caroline Dries (writer) & Mairzee Almas (director)|network=The CW|airdate=October 2, 2008|season=8|episode=2}}</ref>\n\n===Relationships===\n<!--STOP! THESE SECTIONS ARE FOR REAL WORLD CONTENT ONLY. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO DISCUSS GENERAL PLOT INFO, BUT WHERE ANALYSIS OF PLOT, RELATIONSHIPS, AND CHARACTERIZATION IS GIVEN BY REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nOne of Chloe's key relationships is with the series protagonist, Clark Kent. Although believers in the \"Chlois\" theory initially suspected that Chloe would eventually become Lois Lane, Clark's future wife in the comics, Mack contends that Clark does not love Chloe in the way that she loves him. The actress does not believe that Clark's feelings will ever change.<ref name=\"AM1\"/> Regardless of Clark's feelings, Mack recognizes that Chloe is blinded by her love for Clark, which ultimately affects her judgment in not only seeing Clark's faults, but making choices that place her character in danger.<ref name=\"AM3\"/> In season five, Clark finally discovers that Chloe knows his secret, and this revelation allows Chloe the opportunity to come to terms with her feelings for Clark; this also provided a means for the two have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe's unrequited love.<ref name=\"AM5\"/>\n\nSpeaking on the evolving relationship of Clark and Chloe, Mack believes that the season six introduction of Jimmy Olsen into Chloe's life increased her value to Clark. Before, Chloe would drop anything for Clark, but now that Chloe has other priorities, it makes Clark realize how valuable she is to him. The introduction of Jimmy Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can finally have a romantic relationship with. The relationship is strained when Chloe has to lie to cover up Clark's secret, as well as keeping the fact that she is meteor-infected hidden. Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe's heart that Clark occupied for so long.<ref name=\"AM6\"/>\n\nChloe's relationship with her mother is one tackled both off-screen and behind the scenes. In a brainstorming session, Mack, Gough and Millar came up with the idea that Chloe's mother had left her at a young age. Mack wanted to make the character a \"[[latchkey kid]]\", in an effort to explain why she is out all hours of the night. Mack feels that Chloe has real [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]], which play on the fact that she never feels like she is good enough for anyone. These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love her the same way that she loves him, as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends.<ref name=\"AM2\"/> One of Chloe's story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution, and living with the fear that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility. This fear also affects Clark, who worries that keeping his secret will have negative effects on Chloe, like it did Pete.<ref name=\"AM5\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nAllison Mack has been nominated for a number of awards for her role as Chloe Sullivan.

Also, new Buddhist texts in India, from at least the third century onward, were directly composed in standard Sanskrit. Manuscripts from the northern tradition, especially those of Central Asian provenance, are therefore often in Prakrit (especially G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b) or some nonstandard form of Sanskrit, sometimes called Buddhist Sanskrit, an intermediate stage between some Prakrit and standard Sanskrit. <ref>Marcus Bingenheimer, Editor in Chief; Bhikkhu An\u0101layo and Roderick S.

A large portion of Early Buddhist literature is part of the \"sutta\" or \"sutra\" genre, these are usually placed in different collections (called [[Nik\u0101ya|Nikayas]] or [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|Agamas]]) and constitute the \"Sutta Pitaka\" (Skt: S\u016btra Pitaka, \"Basket of sutras\") section of the various early Buddhist Canonical collections called [[Tripi\u1e6daka|Tripitakas]] (\"Three Baskets\"). The suttas generally contain doctrinal, spiritual and philosophical content. \n\nThere are EBTs from various Buddhist schools, especially from the Theravada and [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] schools, but also from the [[Dharmaguptaka]], [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika|Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e45ghika]], [[Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka]], [[Mulasarvastivada|M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]], and other texts of uncertain prominence.<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|volume=|pages=39|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|authorlink1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref>  \n\nAccording to [[Oskar von Hin\u00fcber]] the main purpose for the composition of the EBTs was to \"preserve and to defend an orthodox tradition.\" He adds that this literary effort was influenced by the Vedic prose of the [[Br\u0101hma\u1e47as]].<ref name=\":2\">[[Oskar von Hin\u00fcber]] (2006).

While the southern tradition eventually settled on one of these dialects, P\u0101li, as its canonical language, in India and Central Asia Buddhist texts were successively Sanskritized and/or translated into other languages such as Chinese, Tokharian, Khotanese, Sogdian, and Tibetan. Also, new Buddhist texts in India, from at least the third century onward, were directly composed in standard Sanskrit. Manuscripts from the northern tradition, especially those of Central Asian provenance, are therefore often in Prakrit (especially G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b) or some nonstandard form of Sanskrit, sometimes called Buddhist Sanskrit, an intermediate stage between some Prakrit and standard Sanskrit. <ref>Marcus Bingenheimer, Editor in Chief; Bhikkhu An\u0101layo and Roderick S.

These include internal evidence from the texts themselves which indicates that they were to be memorized and recited, the lack of any evidence (whether archeological or internal to the texts) that writing was being used to preserve these texts and the stylistic features of the texts themselves.<ref>Allon, Mark (1997), ''The Oral Composition and Transmission of Early Buddhist Texts.'', in Indian Insights: Buddhism, Brahmanism and Bhakti, Luzac, pp 39-61 </ref> \n\nAn important feature that marks the Early Buddhist texts are formal characteristics which reflect their origin as orally transmitted literature such as the use of repetition and rhetorical formulas.<ref>{{cite journal|author=An\u0101layo|authorlink=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Reflections on Comparative \u0100gama Studies|url=https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/reflect-comp-agama.pdf|journal =Chung-Hwa Buddhist Journal|year=2008|volume=21|pages=3\u201321|publisher=Taipei: Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies|issn=1017-7132}}</ref> Other stylistic features which betray orality include: the use of multiple synonyms, standardized phrases and passages, verse summaries similies, numbered lists and standard framing narratives.<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|volume=|pages=51|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|authorlink1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref>  \n\nThese stylistic features are in contrast to later works such as [[Mahayana sutras]], which contain more elaborate and complex narratives, that would be more difficult to memorize.

The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India, page 14</ref> According to Lamotte, these 'interpolations' are easily discernible.<ref>Lamotte, History of Indian Buddhism, From the origins to the Saka era, Institut Orientaliste Louvain-la-neuve, 1988, page 156.</ref> According to Analayo, the most often proposed hypothesis is that the EA derives from the [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika|Mahasamgika]] school.<ref>Analayo, ''Mah\u0101y\u0101na in the Ekottarika-\u0101gama,'' Singaporean Journal of Buddhist Studies, Volume 1, 2013.</ref>\n\n===EBTs from Pakistan and Afghanistan===\n[[File:Fragmentary_Buddhist_text_-_Gandhara_birchbark_scrolls_(1st_C),_part_31_-_BL_Or._14915.jpg|thumb|Gandhara birchbark scroll fragments (c. 1st century) from British Library Collection]]\nModern discoveries of various fragmentary manuscript collections from [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] has contributed significantly to the study of Early Buddhist Texts. \n\nMost of these texts are written in the [[Gandhari language|Gandhari Language]] and the [[Kharosthi|Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b script]], but some have also been discovered in [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]].<ref name=\":0\">Allon, M.

A few publications have translated some of these texts.<ref>Andrew Glass, Mark Allon. ''Four Gandhari Samyuktagama Sutras'', pp 5, 15.</ref> \n\nAccording to Mark Allon, the most recent major finds include the following collections:<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n* \"The British Library Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b Manuscripts\", Birch bark scrolls in the Gandhari Language and the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b script, possibly belonging to the [[Dharmaguptaka]] school. They include prose sutras and verse works like parts of the [[Dhammapada|Dharmapada]] dating to the 1st century CE, making them the earliest EBT manuscripts discovered. \n* \"The Senior Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b Manuscripts\", Birch bark scrolls in the Gandhari Language and the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b script, possibly belonging to the [[Dharmaguptaka]] school. Most of these preserve \"canonical\" prose sutras, as well as some biographical material on the Buddha's life associated with the Vinaya.\n* \"The [[Sch\u00f8yen Collection|Sch\u00f8yen]] Manuscripts\", discovered in the [[Bamyan|Bamiyan]] caves, a collection which preserves both EBT texts, Abhidharma and Mahayana texts in either Sanskrit or Gandhari. \n\nAnother important recent find is \"a substantial portion of a large Sanskrit birch bark manuscript of the [[D\u012brgh\u0101gama|''Dirghagama'']], the division of the canon containing long discourses, belonging to the (Mula)-Sarvastivada school, which dates to the seventh or eighth centuries AD\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Abhidharma ===\nThe various [[Abhidharma]] texts and collections (''Pitakas'') are considered by scholars to be (mostly) later material (3rd century BCE onwards) and thus are not EBTs.<ref>\"Abhidhamma Pitaka.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2008.</ref> In spite of the relative lateness of the Abhidharma works, according to scholars like [[Erich Frauwallner]], there are kernels of early pre-sectarian material in the earliest layer of the Abhidharma literature, such as in the [[Theravada]] ''[[Vibhanga]]'', the ''[[Dharmaskandha]]'' of the [[Sarvastivada]], and the ''\u015a\u0101riputr\u0101bhidharma'' of the [[Dharmaguptaka]] school. According to Frauwallner's comparative study, these texts were possibly developed and \"constructed from the same material\", mainly early Buddhist doctrinal lists (Pali: ''m\u0101tik\u0101'', Sanskrit: ''m\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101'') which forms the \"ancient core\" of early Abhidharma.<ref name=\":4\">Frauwallner, Erich.

SUNY Press. pp. 18, 100.</ref>\n\n=== Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika sources ===\nThe first schism among the Buddhist community was between the so called [[Sthavira nik\u0101ya|Sthaviras]] (\"Elders\") and the [[Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika]] (\"Great Community\"). Some scholars such as Edward Conze have thus emphasized the importance of EBTs that have parallels in both Sthavira and Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e45ghika sources.<ref>Reat, Noble Ross. ''\u201cThe Historical Buddha and his Teachings\u201d''. In: Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy. Ed. by Potter, Karl H. Vol. VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 AD. Motilal Banarsidass, 1996, p. 27.</ref> However, fewer Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika texts have survived in comparison to Sthavira material.\n\nOne important source for Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika EBTs is the ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'' (\"Great Event\"). This is a mythic life of the Buddha which includes many legendary tales but also includes various EBTs parallels.<ref>Rahula, Bhikkhu Telwatte (1978). ''A Critical Study of the Mah\u0101vastu,'' chapter 2''.'' Motilal Banarsidass.</ref>\n\nThere are also fragments of the Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a and Ca\u1e41gi (Pali: Ca\u1e45ki) sutras of the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika dating to the 3rd\u20134th century.<ref>Braarvig, Jens et al., eds. ''Buddhist manuscripts of the Sch\u00f8yen collection vol. I.'' Hermes Academic Publishing, 2000.</ref>  \n\nThe ''[[Salistamba Sutra|\u015a\u0101listamba S\u016btra]] (rice stalk s\u016btra)'' is an early Buddhist text which has been tied to the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika school, it contains many parallel passages to the Pali suttas. As noted by N. Ross Reat, this text is in general agreement with the basic doctrines of the Sthavira EBTs such as [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da|dependent origination]], the \"[[Middle Way|middle way]]\" between eternalism and annihilationism, the \"[[Skandha|five aggregates]]\", the \"[[Three poisons|three unwholesome roots]]\", the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path|noble eightfold path]].<ref>Reat, Noble Ross.

Motilal Banarsidass, 1996, pp. 28, 33, 37, 41, 43, 48.</ref>\n\nThere are also various Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika Vinaya texts which contain early material, including their ''[[Pr\u0101timok\u1e63a]]'' monastic code, which is almost identical with Sthavira p\u0101timokkhas.<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|volume=|pages=45-46|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|authorlink1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' (\u589e\u58f9\u963f\u542b\u7d93; pinyin: ''z\u0113ngy\u012b-ah\u00e1nj\u012bng'') has been attributed to the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas by various scholars, though this attribution remains uncertain.<ref>G. P. Malalasekera (ed, 2009), ''Encyclopaedia of Buddhism: Volume VIII, fascicle 3.'' p. 822.</ref>\n\n===Other fragmentary sources===\nThere are various EBTs collected in the Tibetan [[Kangyur]]. Peter Skilling has published English translations of these texts in his two volume \"Mahasutras\" (P\u0101li Text Society, 1994). According to [http://read.84000.co/section/O1JC114941JC14668.html 84000.co], a site of Tibetan Canon translations, the Deg\u00e9 [[Kangyur]] catalogue states that sutras Toh 287-359 of the General Sutra section are \"[[\u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na]]\" works \"probably extracted from the \u0100gamas of the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\". \n\nAnother important source of early Buddhist material in the Tibetan canon are numerous quotations by \u015aamathadeva in his ''Abhidharmako\u015bop\u0101yik\u0101-\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101'' (Derge no. 4094 / Peking no. 5595), a commentary to the [[Abhidharmakosha]]. Some of this material is available in English translation by Bhikkhun\u012b Dhammadinn\u0101.<ref>Dhammadinn\u0101. ''The Madhyama-\u0101gama in \u015aamathadeva\u2019s Abhidharmako\u015bop\u0101yik\u0101-\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101: annotated translation, comparative studies and concordances ''(Dharma Drum Buddhist College Research Series 9), Taiwan: Dharma Drum Publishing Corporation (in preparation).</ref>\n\nLikewise, numerous sutra quotations by authors of [[Sautrantika]] treatises are also a source of EBT fragments. The Sautrantika school was known for focusing on using examples from and references to EBT sutras. These works include Kumaralata\u2019s ''Drstantapankti'', the ''Abhidharmamrtara-sasastra'' attributed to Ghosaka, the ''Abhidharmavatara-sastra'' attributed to Skandhila and the ''[[Tattvasiddhi]]'' of Harivarman.<ref>Charles Willemen, Bart Dessein, Collett Cox (editors) ''Sarvastivada Buddhist Scholasticism'', ''Handbuch Der Orientalistik'', page 108.</ref>\n\nSanskritized fragments of different early Buddhist Agamas also survive from archaeological finds in the [[Tarim Basin]] and the city of [[Turfan]]. These finds include versions of a Sanskrit [[Udanavarga]].<ref>Nariman, J.K.; Introduction to the Early Buddhist Texts in Sanskritised Pr\u0101kit from Literary History of Sanskrit Buddhism, Ch 1-6. http://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Reference/Early-Buddhist-Texts/02-EBT-Sanskrit-Canon.htm</ref>\n\n[[Mahayana]] treatises also sometimes quote EBTs. According to [[\u00c9tienne Lamotte|Etienne Lamotte]], the ''[[Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101upade\u015ba|D\u00e0 zh\u00ecd\u00f9 l\u00f9n]]'' cites \"about a hundred s\u016btras of the Lesser Vehicle; the majority are borrowed from the \u0100gama collections.\"<ref>Lamotte, Etienne; Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron.
