As with many other parts of early Dunedin, and indeed New Zealand, streets were laid out in a grid pattern with no consideration for the terrain, usually by planners in London. In the case of Baldwin Street (and much of the Dunedin street plan), the layout was surveyed by [[Charles Kettle]] in the mid-19th century. The street is named after [[William Baldwin (New Zealand politician)|William Baldwin]], an [[Otago Province|Otago]] Provincial Councillor and newspaper founder, who subdivided the area.\n\nFor cars it is a cul-de-sac, but Baldwin Street is linked across the top by Buchanan Street, a footpath following an otherwise unformed (i.e. unpaved) road linking it with Calder Avenue and Arnold Street, which are unformed in their upper reaches where Baldwin is steepest. The streets running parallel to Baldwin are all quite steep: Arnold Street (1:3.6), Dalmeny Street (1:3.7), and Calder Avenue (1:5.4).\n\nIn 1987, Baldwin Street was officially recognized as the world's steepest street by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] following a two-year campaign by the broadcaster [[Jim Mora (broadcaster)|Jim Mora]]. At the time, Baldwin Street topped two competing streets in [[San Francisco]], which hitherto had held the title of being the steepest streets in the world.<ref name=\"ODT 16 Jul 2019\" />\n\nOn 16 July 2019, Baldwin Street lost its title of Worlds Steepest Street to [[Ffordd Pen Llech]], with Baldwin Street being at a gradient of 35%, and Ffordd Pen Llech being at a gradient of 37.45%. [[Otago Chamber of Commerce]] chief executive Dougal McGowan remarked that it could lead to a drop in visitor numbers to Baldwin Street but added that it could be a \"blessing in disguise for some residents fed up with crowds of visitors, trampled gardens and bad driving decisions on the street.\" [[Mayor of Dunedin]] [[Dave Cull]] said that the [[Dunedin City Council]] could consider altering the signage wording from the world's steepest street to the southern hemisphere's steepest street.<ref name=\"Stuff 14 Jul 2019\" /><ref name=\"ODT 16 Jul 2019\" /><ref name=\"NZH 16 Jul 2019\" />\n\nOn 8th April 2020, after an extensive review of an appeal to return the title to Baldwin Street filed by several Dunedin residents led by surveyor Toby Stoff, it was decided that the steepness of the street must be based on the central axis, which meant that Ffordd Pen Llech had a gradient of 28.6% compared to Baldwin Street's 34.8%. This meant that the title of Steepest Street was returned to Baldwin Street.<ref name=\"Guinness 8 April 2020\" /><ref name=\"Stuff 8 April 2020\">{{cite news |last1=Kitchin |first1=Tom |title=NZ wins back title of world's steepest street from Welsh challenger |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/120918309/baldwin-st-wins-back-title-of-worlds-steepest-from-welsh-challenger |accessdate=8 April 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=8 April 2020|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200408110256/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/120918309/baldwin-st-wins-back-title-of-worlds-steepest-from-welsh-challenger|archive-date=8 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"ODT 8 April 2020\">{{cite news |last1=Hudson |first1=Daisy |title=Baldwin St reclaims steepest street title |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/baldwin-st-reclaims-steepest-street-title |accessdate=8 April 2020 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=8 April 2020|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200408105909/https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/baldwin-st-reclaims-steepest-street-title|archive-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Associated events==\n[[File:Baldwin Street uni challenge (3020727110).jpg|left|thumb| The unicyclist has to lean forward to keep his centre of gravity centred over his unicycle's contact with Baldwin Street, on the steeper cement covered portion of the street.]]\nThe street is the venue for an annual event in Dunedin, the ''Baldwin Street Gutbuster''.

As with many other parts of early Dunedin, and indeed New Zealand, streets were laid out in a grid pattern with no consideration for the terrain, usually by planners in London. In the case of Baldwin Street (and much of the Dunedin street plan), the layout was surveyed by [[Charles Kettle]] in the mid-19th century. The street is named after [[William Baldwin (New Zealand politician)|William Baldwin]], an [[Otago Province|Otago]] Provincial Councillor and newspaper founder, who subdivided the area.\n\nFor cars it is a cul-de-sac, but Baldwin Street is linked across the top by Buchanan Street, a footpath following an otherwise unformed (i.e. unpaved) road linking it with Calder Avenue and Arnold Street, which are unformed in their upper reaches where Baldwin is steepest. The streets running parallel to Baldwin are all quite steep: Arnold Street (1:3.6), Dalmeny Street (1:3.7), and Calder Avenue (1:5.4).\n\nIn 1987, Baldwin Street was officially recognized as the world's steepest street by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] following a two-year campaign by the broadcaster [[Jim Mora (broadcaster)|Jim Mora]]. At the time, Baldwin Street topped two competing streets in [[San Francisco]], which hitherto had held the title of being the steepest streets in the world.<ref name=\"ODT 16 Jul 2019\" />\n\nOn 16 July 2019, Baldwin Street lost its title of Worlds Steepest Street to [[Ffordd Pen Llech]], with Baldwin Street being at a gradient of 35%, and Ffordd Pen Llech being at a gradient of 37.45%. [[Otago Chamber of Commerce]] chief executive Dougal McGowan remarked that it could lead to a drop in visitor numbers to Baldwin Street but added that it could be a \"blessing in disguise for some residents fed up with crowds of visitors, trampled gardens and bad driving decisions on the street.\" [[Mayor of Dunedin]] [[Dave Cull]] said that the [[Dunedin City Council]] could consider altering the signage wording from the world's steepest street to the southern hemisphere's steepest street.<ref name=\"Stuff 14 Jul 2019\" /><ref name=\"ODT 16 Jul 2019\" /><ref name=\"NZH 16 Jul 2019\" />\n\nOn 8th April 2020, after an extensive review of an appeal to return the title to Baldwin Street filed by several Dunedin residents led by surveyor Toby Stoff, it was decided that the steepness of the street must be based on the central axis, which meant that Ffordd Pen Llech had a gradient of 28.6% compared to Baldwin Street's 34.8%. This meant that the title of Steepest Street was returned to Baldwin Street.<ref name=\"Guinness 8 April 2020\" /><ref name=\"Stuff 8 April 2020\">{{cite news |last1=Kitchin |first1=Tom |title=NZ wins back title of world's steepest street from Welsh challenger |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/120918309/baldwin-st-wins-back-title-of-worlds-steepest-from-welsh-challenger |accessdate=8 April 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=8 April 2020|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200408110256/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/120918309/baldwin-st-wins-back-title-of-worlds-steepest-from-welsh-challenger|archive-date=8 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"ODT 8 April 2020\">{{cite news |last1=Hudson |first1=Daisy |title=Baldwin St reclaims steepest street title |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/baldwin-st-reclaims-steepest-street-title |accessdate=8 April 2020 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=8 April 2020|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200408105909/https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/baldwin-st-reclaims-steepest-street-title|archive-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Associated events==\n[[File:Baldwin Street uni challenge (3020727110).jpg|left|thumb| The unicyclist has to lean forward to keep his centre of gravity centred over his unicycle's contact with Baldwin Street, on the steeper cement covered portion of the street.]]\nThe street is the venue for an annual event in Dunedin, the ''Baldwin Street Gutbuster''.

It is the second major game in the ''[[Dragon Age]]'' series and was released worldwide in March 2011. Set in the world of Thedas, introduced in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'', players assume the role of Hawke, a human mage, rogue, or warrior who arrives in the city of Kirkwall as a lowly refugee, and becomes its legendary champion over a turbulent decade of political and social conflict. In the game, players explore and engage in combat from a [[third-person perspective]]. Players encounter various companions, who play major roles in the game's plot and gameplay. Depending on players' decisions and dialogue, a companion will either recognize Hawke as a friend or a rival.\n\nBioWare began the game's development during the production of ''Origins''{{'}}s [[expansion pack]] ''[[Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening|Awakening]]''. EA gave them only 14 to 16 months to finish the game's development, thus forcing the team to [[Video game developer#Crunch time|crunch]] for an extended period and reuse assets. BioWare looked at players' feedback and reviews of ''Origins'', and decided to improve its gameplay, making it more action-oriented. They improved the [[Eclipse Engine]], renaming it Lycium, to enhance the game's visuals and [[lighting]], and accommodate a new art style inspired by movies like ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]''. Both [[David Gaider]] and [[Inon Zur]], who worked on ''Origins'', returned and served as lead writer and composer respectively.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews from critics. They praised its gameplay, companions and writing, though they had mixed feelings about the storytelling structure, and the diminished focus on tactics and strategy. Employing reused assets, and setting the game entirely in one city, were widely criticized. It received a more polarized response from players, though more than one million copies were sold in less than two weeks, a faster sales pace than its predecessor. A sequel, ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'' was released in November 2014.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Dragon Age 2 screenshot.jpg|thumb|250px|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player character Hawke and his companions combat a dragon from a [[third-person perspective]].|alt=Screenshot photograph of gameplay]]\n\n''Dragon Age II'' is an action [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] played from a [[third-person perspective]].

This forms the background story of ''Dragon Age II''. The main story has a linear [[frame narrative]], unfolding through flashbacks from the perspective of [[Varric Tethras]] ([[Brian Bloom]]), a humorous though caring storyteller and dwarf rogue whose signature weapon is a custom-made repeating crossbow he named Bianca. The protagonist is Hawke (voiced by either Nicholas Boulton or [[Jo Wyatt]]), whose gender, first name, appearance, and class type is player-determined. During the events of ''Origins,'' Hawke fled the nation of Ferelden as a refugee to the city state of Kirkwall. There they eventually grew in power and influence to become the legendary \"Champion of Kirkwall\", and the center of events that change the course of history. Varric, Hawke's companion, relates the Champion's \"true story\" to his interrogator [[Cassandra Pentaghast]] ([[Miranda Raison]]), mainly based on the protagonist's choices. The story is told in three acts, with each act separated by a gap of almost three years. Although the story remains unaltered until the two endings, it is greatly influenced by the player's decisions.\n\nHawke can recruit up to eight companions, each of whom can be player-controlled. Along with Varric, mandatory companions include [[Anders (Dragon Age)|Anders]] ([[Adam Howden]]), a proud but mercurial mage and former Grey Warden determined to defend the mages in Kirkwall from the templars; Aveline Vallen ([[Joanna Roth]]), a pragmatic and strict warrior who rise up the ranks of the Kirkwall City Guard to become its leader; and Merrill ([[Eve Myles]]), a soft-hearted but socially awkward Dalish elven mage shunned by her clan due to her obsession with a dangerous ancient artifact as well as her use of blood magic. As well, one of Hawke's twin siblings serves as a companion for the story's first act: their sister Bethany ([[Rebekah Staton]]), a kind though timid mage who has a loving relationship with her sibling; or their brother Carver (Nico Lennon), a prideful though abrasive warrior who cares for his elder sibling but feels overshadowed by them.\n\nOptional companions include Fenris ([[Gideon Emery]]), a moody elven warrior who resents his former slaver, a Tevinter magister who wields great magical power; and Isabela (Victoria Kruger), a confident and promiscuous rogue pirate captain searching for a coveted relic. Sebastian Vael ([[Alec Newman]]), a pious human rogue archer and lay brother of the Kirkwall Chantry, can be recruited via the [[downloadable content]], ''The Exiled Prince.'' Anders, Fenris, Isabela and Merrill are romance options for Hawke of either gender, with Sebastian a chaste love interest for a female Hawke.\n\n===Plot===\nCassandra, a member of the Seekers of Truth which supervise the Templar Order, investigates whereabouts of Hawke, the \"Champion of Kirkwall\". She captures and interrogates Varric, demanding to know how Hawke started a war between the mages and templars. After he initially spun a fanciful version of Hawke's escape from the Blight which is quickly rejected by Cassandra, Varric cooperates and tells her how the Mage-Templar War really started. The story starts shortly after the [[Dragon Age: Origins#Plot|Battle of Ostagar]], with the Hawke family escaping their home village of Lothering in Ferelden with a darkspawn horde in pursuit. They are joined by Aveline, though her husband Wesley and either Bethany or Carver are killed in the process. Flemeth, a witch who can assume the form of a dragon, intervenes and helps the party escape to Kirkwall, a city across the sea, on the condition Hawke travels to a Dalish clan based in Sundermount, a mountain located near Kirkwall, and complete a task for her. Hawke enters the service of a mercenary band or smuggler group to enter Kirkwall, after which the family takes up residence in the city's Lowtown with their maternal uncle Gamlen.\n\nA year later, a prosperous opportunity presents itself to Hawke; Varric and his brother Bartrand are planning a risky but rewarding treasure hunting expedition into the perilous region of the Deep Roads. Varric partners with Hawke to acquire funding and knowledge of the region. Hawke enlists the aid of Anders, a former Grey Warden who possesses knowledge of the Deep Roads. The expedition proves both a financial success and a tragedy; the proceeds make Hawke famous and wealthy, enabling them to buy back their family mansion in Hightown. However, a very powerful magical idol made of red lyrium corrupts Bartrand's mind and causes him to betray Hawke and Varric. Additionally, Hawke's surviving sibling is either killed by the darkspawn taint, or conscripted into the Grey Wardens if they are brought along. If not, then they are conscripted either into the Circle of Mages or the Templar Order, depending on the sibling who survives.\n\nThree years later, the Viscount of Kirkwall summons Hawke to help resolve a political situation the foreign military forces of the Qunari have caused. The Qunari, who were shipwrecked in Kirkwall three years earlier, neither obey the laws of Kirkwall nor seem willing to leave in the foreseeable future, escalating tension between them and the inhabitants of Kirkwall. As well, Hawke's mother, Leandra, is murdered by a blood mage serial killer preying on Kirkwall's women. Hawke resolves to uncover \"O\", the identity of the serial killer's accomplice. Eventually, he discovers the reason the Qunari refuse to leave Kirkwall is because Isabela stole a coveted artifact from them. When she flees Kirkwall with the artifact, the Qunari leader, the Arishok, decides to attack Kirkwall and ultimately executes the Viscount. Hawke's party successfully retakes Kirkwall and, if Hawke chooses, eliminates the Arishok. For their actions, Hawke is declared the Champion of Kirkwall.\n\nOver the next three years, Kirkwall has been turned into a police state under the tyrannical rule of the Templar Order. Under the command of Knight-Commander Meredith, they aim to oppress mages for their alleged use of blood magic or any other forbidden techniques. Meredith is challenged by First Enchanter Orsino, the Circle of Magi leader in Kirkwall, who tries to topple her with public support. Constant violence between the two sides forces Hawke to intervene, during which a group of anti-Meredith rebels kidnap his surviving sibling/closest friend. Fearing for their loved ones' safety Hawke attempts to get away from the conflict. However, Anders orchestrates a massive explosion that levels the Chantry and kills Grand Cleric Elthina. This triggers a final decisive battle between the mages and templars across the city, as Meredith is determined proceed with a mass extermination of mages in Kirkwall as a result of Elthina's death, forcing Hawke to choose a side. They end up killing both Orsino, who is surmised to have been \"O\", and Meredith, who bought the lyrium idol from Bartrand and is driven mad by her paranoid delusions. Afterwards, Hawke either leaves Kirkwall as a hero to mages, or is elected Viscount of Kirkwall.\n\nVarric concludes the story, saying that Hawke's companions eventually drifted apart, and Hawke eventually left Kirkwall. The Circles of Magi all over Thedas have followed Kirkwall's example and rebelled, with the Templar Order breaking away from the Chantry to fight them. Satisfied with his story, Cassandra lets Varric go and leaves with Leliana and the reformed [[Dragon Age: Inquisition|Inquisition]], believing that since both Hawke and the Hero of Ferelden (if alive) have disappeared, they must be found to stop the war.\n\n==Development==\n[[BioWare]]'s [[Edmonton]] office began development of ''Dragon Age II'' during the production of ''[[Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening]]''. Publisher [[Electronic Arts]] gave BioWare only 14 to 16 months to finish the game's development, forcing the team to [[Video game developer#Crunch time|crunch]] for an extended period.<ref name=\"recycled asset\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-25-being-the-boss-of-dragon-age|title=Being the boss of Dragon Age|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=May 25, 2018|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Mike Laidlaw, [[David Gaider]] and [[Inon Zur]] returned to their roles as lead designer, writer and composer respectively. The game's development was completed on February 11, 2011, with BioWare confirming it had been declared [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|gold]], indicating it was being prepared for duplication and release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/02/11/dragon-age-ii-goes-gold-55-mins-of-footage/?|title=Dragon Age II Goes Gold, 55 Mins Of Footage|first=John|last=Walker|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=February 11, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Game design===\nOne of BioWare's core goals when creating the game was to improve the formula established in ''Origins''. According to Laidlaw, the team evaluated ''Origins'' different gameplay components, especially its overly complex mechanics, and studied players' feedback.<ref name=\"spartan\"/> After learning most players never finished the early hours of ''Origins'', the team's goal was to make ''Dragon Age II'' more accessible to new players, and appeal to more players. They decided to streamline some of the game's mechanics, while retaining many conventional elements of a role-playing game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2011/02/24/laidlaw-dragon-age-2-lowers-the-entry-barriers-to-rpgs/|title=Laidlaw: Dragon Age 2 lowers the entry barriers to RPGs|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG 247]]|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The team also looked at reviews of ''Origins'', and realized that one of the common criticisms, especially of the console versions, focused on the game's slow combat. As a result, the team looked at gameplay of [[action game]]s and sped up its combat so it would be more responsive and give more immediate responses without latency. The game's combat [[animation]] was made to be more reactive and \"stylish\" to reflect this.<ref name=\"hit harder\"/> While it became more action-orientated, the team did not completely remove the tactical aspect of ''Origins'' as they felt that would alienate its fan base. Despite this, the [[bird's-eye view]] from ''Origins'' was removed as the team wanted to create more varied scenery for players without needing to \"slice off\" the top of a room.<ref name=\"console or pc\"/> Laidlaw added the gameplay is more tactical in nature as the team overhauled the combo system which prompts players to make use of all the classes' talents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/22/gamesblog-live-mike-laidlaw-dragon-age-2|title=Bioware's Mike Laidlaw talks narrative and games as art|first=Steve|last=Boxer|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 22, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> According to Robyn Theberge, the game's development manager, the team hoped players could \"think like a general\" using Tactic, and \"fight like a spartan\" with the game's faster combat.<ref name=\"spartan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/11/11/bioware-clarifies-differences-between-pc-and-console-versions-of-dragon-age-ii/|title=BioWare on Dragon Age II combat: \"think like a general but fight like a Spartan\"|first=Nathan|last=Grayson|work=[[VG 247]]|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe works of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], [[Sergio Leone]] and [[Akira Kurosawa]], as well as movies including ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]'' inspired the game.

For instance, the Qunari now have a pair of horns, as opposed to their hornless counterparts in ''Origins''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/07/28/a-look-at-the-qunari-evolved.aspx|title=A Look At The Qunari, Evolved|first=Jeff|last=Cork|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=July 28, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Due to the game's short development cycle, BioWare set the game in a single city so they could reuse many art assets. Laidlaw added the team drew inspiration from ''[[Eternal Darkness]]'' where players get to see the city evolve as time progresses. This meant the team only had to modify the assets and did not need to create new ones.<ref name=\"recycled asset\"/>\n\nWhile ''Origins'' was developed mainly for [[personal computer]]s, BioWare developed ''Dragon Age II'' for both PCs and consoles, hoping players of both machines could enjoy the same experience. The game's controls, including the Tactic menu and commands, as well as its story are identical across all the versions, though there are differences in their [[user interface]]s.<ref name=\"a defence\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-03-10-biowares-mike-laidlaw-a-defence-of-dragon-age-ii-interview|title=BioWare's Mike Laidlaw: A defence of Dragon Age II|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=March 11, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Laidlaw described porting ''Origins'' to the [[PlayStation 3]] as a terrible experience.

It was criticized for being a predictable and formulaic hero journey. As a result, the team decided to make the narrative more \"personal\", focusing on one character over the course of several years with a framed structure that allows the story to skip periods that do not interest players. To offer a more focused experience, the team decided to ditch players' origin stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/08/29/dragon-age-2-a-lot-of-other-choices-make-up-for-single-player-race-says-dr-ray|title=Dragon Age 2: \"A lot of other choices\" make up for single player race, says Dr Ray|first=Patrick|last=Garett|work=[[VG 247]]|date=August 29, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Inspired by ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', Hawke is fully voiced as opposed to the Warden (the silent player character in ''Origins'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/the-old-school-dragon-age-ii-and-its-influences-194234.phtml|title=The old school: Dragon Age II and its influences|first=Joseph|last=Leray|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The story's tone was also considered darker than its predecessor. Gaider believed this approach introduced new opportunities for storytelling, as consequences of a player's decisions can be highlighted further, and the state of the game's world can be radically changed. Laidlaw added that with choices having more impact, ''Dragon Age II'' would be BioWare's \"most reactive game\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/12/08/dragon-age-ii-may-be-our-most-reactive-game-to-date-says-bioware/|title=Dragon Age II may be \"our most reactive game to date\", says BioWare|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG 247]]|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref> There were different types of choices in the game, namely flavors, local choices and global choices. Some have little effect on the game's narrative, while others may affect the story dramatically. As players have no knowledge of the extent of the impact a choice will bring, the team hoped they had created a more individualized experience.<ref name=\"writing\"/> Like its predecessor, the choices presented were not \"black or white\", so players are motivated to do what they deem is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/07/21/good-choice-morality-and-dragon-age-ii.aspx|title=Good Choice: Morality and Dragon Age II|first=Joe|last=Juba|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=July 21, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe team used an approach called a \"one-pager\", where the general overview of the story was produced; then the writers expanded the smaller components. The team also used a [[wiki]] to store the game's [[Folklore|lore]] to keep it consistent. All story content was reviewed twice.

Zur collaborated with Aubrey Ashburn, who sang the main title and several songs in the game, an Israeli songwriter, and [[Florence and The Machine]], whose song \"I\u2019m Not Calling You a Liar\" was reimagined for the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2011/02/25/dragon-age-ii-soundtrack-to-feature-florence-the-machine/|title=Dragon Age II soundtrack to feature Florence + The Machine|first=Johnny|last=Cullen|work=[[VG 247]]|date=February 25, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Like its predecessor, the game's music is a cross between \"heroic\" and \"demonic\".

Laidlaw admitted the team never expected the game to perform as well as ''Origins'', but he thought the title would score higher.<ref name=\"a defence\"/>\n\nSeveral critics praised the game's combat noting it was faster than its predecessor.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/><ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Joe Juba of ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised it for being \"responsive\" and believed the new system suited the game.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> [[IGN]]'s Kristine Steimer praised the combat, which integrated action elements and tactical features together well, for being \"entertaining\" and \"versatile\". However, she found issues with the console controls' imprecision and AI weaknesses.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Mike Sharkey of [[GameSpy]] described the gameplay as \"smooth\". He noted its improved [[user interface]], and felt it was a \"great fusion\" of both action and strategic elements, though he remarked that deploying strategy is not as necessary as before.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> [[GamesRadar]]'s Eric Neigher was disappointed by the \"cumbersome\" strategy system, which made the combat excessively straightforward.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Rich McCormick of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' liked the game's talents and abilities, saying they are \"exciting\" to use.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> VanOrd appreciated its flexibility, though he thought it was streamlined, alongside the inventory management system. Both ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s VanOrd and Juba noted there were issues with the [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] gameplay in the PC version.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/><ref name=\"GIPRev\"/>\n\nThe game's storytelling attracted mixed responses. The use of an [[unreliable narrator]] was applauded for holding the story together in a cohesive manner by McCormick,<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> and being entertaining by Steimer.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Sharkey liked the three-act structure, comparing it to \"historical fiction reads\" that explores a \"tumultuous period in a fully realized fantasy world\".<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher thought the three-act structure delivered a \"compelling\" story, and appreciated the game's writing, calling it a step-up from ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> VanOrd disliked the game's storytelling, however, calling it a \"downward turn\" from ''Origins'' as it lacked a central goal that engaged players, thus making the story less epic than it should be. However, he remarked that there were \"heartfelt moments\", mostly associated with the game's sidequests and companions.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Juba agreed with VanOrd on the story's shortcomings, saying that there was little tension or consequences in the main story, and it felt like several side-quests stitched together. However, he praised the scenarios for being creative and inventive.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Both VanOrd and ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Dan Whitehead noted the game drew inspiration from real-life events when the writing team created the setting and its cultural and political conflicts. Whitehead called it \"a political game\".<ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/>\n\nCritics had varied opinions on the game's dialogue system. McCormick felt the lack of a morality system enabled players to pick different dialogue stances depending on different circumstances, as opposed to being funneled to role-play a certain personality.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> He praised the game's three-act structure for making choices consequential. Decisions made earlier may result in a significant difference several years later in the game. McCormick called this \"impressive\".<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> Sharkey and Whitehead liked the choices presented, and felt they were impactful and often morally ambiguous.<ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> VanOrd agreed, and attributed it to the setting's unstable political climate. He was disappointed that some choices were merely illusions, but felt there were more impactful decisions in the game than in ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> However, Steimer felt there were not a lot of impactful choices in the game, and criticized the [[cliffhanger]] ending.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Joseph Leray of ''[[Destructoid]]'' commented on the game's pacing, saying that \"Act I is too long, Act III is too short, and Act II feels like the climax of the game but is largely tangential to the main plot\".<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/>\n\nCritics praised the companions featured in the game. Steimer liked the background banter between the companions, saying they are \"heartwarming\" and \"hilarious\".<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Sharkey felt the characters were exceptional, calling them BioWare's best, though he was disappointed by the fact their armor could not be customized.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher also liked the companions, saying they were more fleshed out and less \"expository\".<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Both Whitehead and VanOrd felt the companions were not as interesting as the original game, though VanOrd noted their personalities are \"vivid\" nonetheless, and all the companions were excellently voiced and their lines were well-written.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/><ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/> Juba, however, found the companions superior to those in ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Leray liked the companion quests, singling out Merill's and Aveline's as two of the best. However, he lamented the game did not offer enough opportunities to interact with its cast of companions.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> Revisiting ''Dragon Age II'' in 2015, Chris Thursten of ''PC Gamer'' praised the game's handling of its roster of companions, noting that \"they have their own homes, jobs and opinions\". Thrusten also praised the complex relationships they have with each other. He noted that Hawke's decade in Kirkwall is primarily an exploration of these relationships and concluded that \"BioWare has not created a narrative with this much nuance since, nor so many clever moments...\".<ref name=\"Reinstall\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/reinstall-dragon-age-2/|author=Chris Thursten|title=Reinstall: Dragon Age 2|date=January 7, 2015 |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nReused assets and the game being set entirely in Kirkwall were criticized. Some critics felt the game confined players to a very small city. Steimer felt the rich lore featured in the game was wasted.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> McCormick felt the small world helped players become more thoroughly engaged in it, able to understand its culture and politics due to its small scale.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> Sharkey called certain areas in the game \"carbon-copy dungeon crawls\", and was disappointed by the excessive reuse of areas.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher added that the [[backtracking]] featured in the game gave the impression it was more linear than its predecessor.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Juba felt the game's locations were \"painfully limited\", and players would get tired of them after a while.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Leray criticized the assets for being \"bland\", saying that reusing them made the issue even worse. Like Juba, he felt that locations would became \"stale\" as players progress, and that the city has too few people of interest or missions for players to complete.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/>\n\n===Players reaction===\nBefore the game's release, players of the original game were worried the sequel would be streamlined like ''[[Mass Effect]]''. Head writer David Gaider assured fans of ''Origins'' this was not the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/07/14/dont-panic-on-dragon-age-ii-changes-says-bioware/|title=Don\u2019t panic on Dragon Age II changes, says BioWare|first=Johnny|last=Cullen|work=[[VG 247]]|date=July 14, 2010|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref> While BioWare expected fan criticism over the drastic changes implemented in the sequel, they were surprised by the widespread backlash from players.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-02-dragon-age-2-response-surprised-bioware|title=Dragon Age 2 response surprised BioWare|first=Fred|last=Dutton|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=August 2, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref> EA acknowledged the game's negative reception among fans, saying that they \"lost some [''Origins''] fans\" with the game's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/ea-admits-it-lost-some-fans-over-dragon-age-2/|title=EA Admits It \u2018Lost Some Fans\u2019 Over Dragon Age 2|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|date=June 14, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref> Players were divided over ''Dragon Age II''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5875251/not-everyone-hates-dragon-age-ii--you-know|title=Not Everyone Hates Dragon Age II, You Know|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=November 1, 2012|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref> Most of their criticism was directed at the game's wave-based enemies, excessively reused environments, and the lack of origin choices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-06-14-ea-we-lost-some-fans-with-dragon-age-2|title=EA: we lost some fans with Dragon Age 2|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 14, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Controversies===\nA BioWare employee was caught posting as a consumer on Metacritic. The employee, Chris Hoban, gave the game score of 10/10.

It is the second major game in the ''[[Dragon Age]]'' series and was released worldwide in March 2011. Set in the world of Thedas, introduced in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'', players assume the role of Hawke, a human mage, rogue, or warrior who arrives in the city of Kirkwall as a lowly refugee, and becomes its legendary champion over a turbulent decade of political and social conflict. In the game, players explore and engage in combat from a [[third-person perspective]]. Players encounter various companions, who play major roles in the game's plot and gameplay. Depending on players' decisions and dialogue, a companion will either recognize Hawke as a friend or a rival.\n\nBioWare began the game's development during the production of ''Origins''{{'}}s [[expansion pack]] ''[[Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening|Awakening]]''. EA gave them only 14 to 16 months to finish the game's development, thus forcing the team to [[Video game developer#Crunch time|crunch]] for an extended period and reuse assets. BioWare looked at players' feedback and reviews of ''Origins'', and decided to improve its gameplay, making it more action-oriented. They improved the [[Eclipse Engine]], renaming it Lycium, to enhance the game's visuals and [[lighting]], and accommodate a new art style inspired by movies like ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]''. Both [[David Gaider]] and [[Inon Zur]], who worked on ''Origins'', returned and served as lead writer and composer respectively.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews from critics. They praised its gameplay, companions and writing, though they had mixed feelings about the storytelling structure, and the diminished focus on tactics and strategy. Employing reused assets, and setting the game entirely in one city, were widely criticized. It received a more polarized response from players, though more than one million copies were sold in less than two weeks, a faster sales pace than its predecessor. A sequel, ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'' was released in November 2014.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Dragon Age 2 screenshot.jpg|thumb|250px|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player character Hawke and his companions combat a dragon from a [[third-person perspective]].|alt=Screenshot photograph of gameplay]]\n\n''Dragon Age II'' is an action [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] played from a [[third-person perspective]].

This forms the background story of ''Dragon Age II''. The main story has a linear [[frame narrative]], unfolding through flashbacks from the perspective of [[Varric Tethras]] ([[Brian Bloom]]), a humorous though caring storyteller and dwarf rogue whose signature weapon is a custom-made repeating crossbow he named Bianca. The protagonist is Hawke (voiced by either Nicholas Boulton or [[Jo Wyatt]]), whose gender, first name, appearance, and class type is player-determined. During the events of ''Origins,'' Hawke fled the nation of Ferelden as a refugee to the city state of Kirkwall. There they eventually grew in power and influence to become the legendary \"Champion of Kirkwall\", and the center of events that change the course of history. Varric, Hawke's companion, relates the Champion's \"true story\" to his interrogator [[Cassandra Pentaghast]] ([[Miranda Raison]]), mainly based on the protagonist's choices. The story is told in three acts, with each act separated by a gap of almost three years. Although the story remains unaltered until the two endings, it is greatly influenced by the player's decisions.\n\nHawke can recruit up to eight companions, each of whom can be player-controlled. Along with Varric, mandatory companions include [[Anders (Dragon Age)|Anders]] ([[Adam Howden]]), a proud but mercurial mage and former Grey Warden determined to defend the mages in Kirkwall from the templars; Aveline Vallen ([[Joanna Roth]]), a pragmatic and strict warrior who rise up the ranks of the Kirkwall City Guard to become its leader; and Merrill ([[Eve Myles]]), a soft-hearted but socially awkward Dalish elven mage shunned by her clan due to her obsession with a dangerous ancient artifact as well as her use of blood magic. As well, one of Hawke's twin siblings serves as a companion for the story's first act: their sister Bethany ([[Rebekah Staton]]), a kind though timid mage who has a loving relationship with her sibling; or their brother Carver (Nico Lennon), a prideful though abrasive warrior who cares for his elder sibling but feels overshadowed by them.\n\nOptional companions include Fenris ([[Gideon Emery]]), a moody elven warrior who resents his former slaver, a Tevinter magister who wields great magical power; and Isabela (Victoria Kruger), a confident and promiscuous rogue pirate captain searching for a coveted relic. Sebastian Vael ([[Alec Newman]]), a pious human rogue archer and lay brother of the Kirkwall Chantry, can be recruited via the [[downloadable content]], ''The Exiled Prince.'' Anders, Fenris, Isabela and Merrill are romance options for Hawke of either gender, with Sebastian a chaste love interest for a female Hawke.\n\n===Plot===\nCassandra, a member of the Seekers of Truth which supervise the Templar Order, investigates whereabouts of Hawke, the \"Champion of Kirkwall\". She captures and interrogates Varric, demanding to know how Hawke started a war between the mages and templars. After he initially spun a fanciful version of Hawke's escape from the Blight which is quickly rejected by Cassandra, Varric cooperates and tells her how the Mage-Templar War really started. The story starts shortly after the [[Dragon Age: Origins#Plot|Battle of Ostagar]], with the Hawke family escaping their home village of Lothering in Ferelden with a darkspawn horde in pursuit. They are joined by Aveline, though her husband Wesley and either Bethany or Carver are killed in the process. Flemeth, a witch who can assume the form of a dragon, intervenes and helps the party escape to Kirkwall, a city across the sea, on the condition Hawke travels to a Dalish clan based in Sundermount, a mountain located near Kirkwall, and complete a task for her. Hawke enters the service of a mercenary band or smuggler group to enter Kirkwall, after which the family takes up residence in the city's Lowtown with their maternal uncle Gamlen.\n\nA year later, a prosperous opportunity presents itself to Hawke; Varric and his brother Bartrand are planning a risky but rewarding treasure hunting expedition into the perilous region of the Deep Roads. Varric partners with Hawke to acquire funding and knowledge of the region. Hawke enlists the aid of Anders, a former Grey Warden who possesses knowledge of the Deep Roads. The expedition proves both a financial success and a tragedy; the proceeds make Hawke famous and wealthy, enabling them to buy back their family mansion in Hightown. However, a very powerful magical idol made of red lyrium corrupts Bartrand's mind and causes him to betray Hawke and Varric. Additionally, Hawke's surviving sibling is either killed by the darkspawn taint, or conscripted into the Grey Wardens if they are brought along. If not, then they are conscripted either into the Circle of Mages or the Templar Order, depending on the sibling who survives.\n\nThree years later, the Viscount of Kirkwall summons Hawke to help resolve a political situation the foreign military forces of the Qunari have caused. The Qunari, who were shipwrecked in Kirkwall three years earlier, neither obey the laws of Kirkwall nor seem willing to leave in the foreseeable future, escalating tension between them and the inhabitants of Kirkwall. As well, Hawke's mother, Leandra, is murdered by a blood mage serial killer preying on Kirkwall's women. Hawke resolves to uncover \"O\", the identity of the serial killer's accomplice. Eventually, he discovers the reason the Qunari refuse to leave Kirkwall is because Isabela stole a coveted artifact from them. When she flees Kirkwall with the artifact, the Qunari leader, the Arishok, decides to attack Kirkwall and ultimately executes the Viscount. Hawke's party successfully retakes Kirkwall and, if Hawke chooses, eliminates the Arishok. For their actions, Hawke is declared the Champion of Kirkwall.\n\nOver the next three years, Kirkwall has been turned into a police state under the tyrannical rule of the Templar Order. Under the command of Knight-Commander Meredith, they aim to oppress mages for their alleged use of blood magic or any other forbidden techniques. Meredith is challenged by First Enchanter Orsino, the Circle of Magi leader in Kirkwall, who tries to topple her with public support. Constant violence between the two sides forces Hawke to intervene, during which a group of anti-Meredith rebels kidnap his surviving sibling/closest friend. Fearing for their loved ones' safety Hawke attempts to get away from the conflict. However, Anders orchestrates a massive explosion that levels the Chantry and kills Grand Cleric Elthina. This triggers a final decisive battle between the mages and templars across the city, as Meredith is determined proceed with a mass extermination of mages in Kirkwall as a result of Elthina's death, forcing Hawke to choose a side. They end up killing both Orsino, who is surmised to have been \"O\", and Meredith, who bought the lyrium idol from Bartrand and is driven mad by her paranoid delusions. Afterwards, Hawke either leaves Kirkwall as a hero to mages, or is elected Viscount of Kirkwall.\n\nVarric concludes the story, saying that Hawke's companions eventually drifted apart, and Hawke eventually left Kirkwall. The Circles of Magi all over Thedas have followed Kirkwall's example and rebelled, with the Templar Order breaking away from the Chantry to fight them. Satisfied with his story, Cassandra lets Varric go and leaves with Leliana and the reformed [[Dragon Age: Inquisition|Inquisition]], believing that since both Hawke and the Hero of Ferelden (if alive) have disappeared, they must be found to stop the war.\n\n==Development==\n[[BioWare]]'s [[Edmonton]] office began development of ''Dragon Age II'' during the production of ''[[Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening]]''. Publisher [[Electronic Arts]] gave BioWare only 14 to 16 months to finish the game's development, forcing the team to [[Video game developer#Crunch time|crunch]] for an extended period.<ref name=\"recycled asset\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-25-being-the-boss-of-dragon-age|title=Being the boss of Dragon Age|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=May 25, 2018|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Mike Laidlaw, [[David Gaider]] and [[Inon Zur]] returned to their roles as lead designer, writer and composer respectively. The game's development was completed on February 11, 2011, with BioWare confirming it had been declared [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|gold]], indicating it was being prepared for duplication and release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/02/11/dragon-age-ii-goes-gold-55-mins-of-footage/?|title=Dragon Age II Goes Gold, 55 Mins Of Footage|first=John|last=Walker|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=February 11, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Game design===\nOne of BioWare's core goals when creating the game was to improve the formula established in ''Origins''. According to Laidlaw, the team evaluated ''Origins'' different gameplay components, especially its overly complex mechanics, and studied players' feedback.<ref name=\"spartan\"/> After learning most players never finished the early hours of ''Origins'', the team's goal was to make ''Dragon Age II'' more accessible to new players, and appeal to more players. They decided to streamline some of the game's mechanics, while retaining many conventional elements of a role-playing game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2011/02/24/laidlaw-dragon-age-2-lowers-the-entry-barriers-to-rpgs/|title=Laidlaw: Dragon Age 2 lowers the entry barriers to RPGs|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG 247]]|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The team also looked at reviews of ''Origins'', and realized that one of the common criticisms, especially of the console versions, focused on the game's slow combat. As a result, the team looked at gameplay of [[action game]]s and sped up its combat so it would be more responsive and give more immediate responses without latency. The game's combat [[animation]] was made to be more reactive and \"stylish\" to reflect this.<ref name=\"hit harder\"/> While it became more action-orientated, the team did not completely remove the tactical aspect of ''Origins'' as they felt that would alienate its fan base. Despite this, the [[bird's-eye view]] from ''Origins'' was removed as the team wanted to create more varied scenery for players without needing to \"slice off\" the top of a room.<ref name=\"console or pc\"/> Laidlaw added the gameplay is more tactical in nature as the team overhauled the combo system which prompts players to make use of all the classes' talents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/22/gamesblog-live-mike-laidlaw-dragon-age-2|title=Bioware's Mike Laidlaw talks narrative and games as art|first=Steve|last=Boxer|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 22, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> According to Robyn Theberge, the game's development manager, the team hoped players could \"think like a general\" using Tactic, and \"fight like a spartan\" with the game's faster combat.<ref name=\"spartan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/11/11/bioware-clarifies-differences-between-pc-and-console-versions-of-dragon-age-ii/|title=BioWare on Dragon Age II combat: \"think like a general but fight like a Spartan\"|first=Nathan|last=Grayson|work=[[VG 247]]|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe works of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], [[Sergio Leone]] and [[Akira Kurosawa]], as well as movies including ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]'' inspired the game.

Laidlaw added the team drew inspiration from ''[[Eternal Darkness]]'' where players get to see the city evolve as time progresses. This meant the team only had to modify the assets and did not need to create new ones.<ref name=\"recycled asset\"/>\n\nWhile ''Origins'' was developed mainly for [[personal computer]]s, BioWare developed ''Dragon Age II'' for both PCs and consoles, hoping players of both machines could enjoy the same experience.

It was criticized for being a predictable and formulaic hero journey.

Gaider believed this approach introduced new opportunities for storytelling, as consequences of a player's decisions can be highlighted further, and the state of the game's world can be radically changed. Laidlaw added that with choices having more impact, ''Dragon Age II'' would be BioWare's \"most reactive game\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/12/08/dragon-age-ii-may-be-our-most-reactive-game-to-date-says-bioware/|title=Dragon Age II may be \"our most reactive game to date\", says BioWare|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG 247]]|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref> There were different types of choices in the game, namely flavors, local choices and global choices.

Laidlaw admitted the team never expected the game to perform as well as ''Origins'', but he thought the title would score higher.<ref name=\"a defence\"/>\n\nSeveral critics praised the game's combat noting it was faster than its predecessor.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/><ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Joe Juba of ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised it for being \"responsive\" and believed the new system suited the game.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> [[IGN]]'s Kristine Steimer praised the combat, which integrated action elements and tactical features together well, for being \"entertaining\" and \"versatile\". However, she found issues with the console controls' imprecision and AI weaknesses.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Mike Sharkey of [[GameSpy]] described the gameplay as \"smooth\". He noted its improved [[user interface]], and felt it was a \"great fusion\" of both action and strategic elements, though he remarked that deploying strategy is not as necessary as before.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> [[GamesRadar]]'s Eric Neigher was disappointed by the \"cumbersome\" strategy system, which made the combat excessively straightforward.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Rich McCormick of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' liked the game's talents and abilities, saying they are \"exciting\" to use.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> VanOrd appreciated its flexibility, though he thought it was streamlined, alongside the inventory management system. Both ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s VanOrd and Juba noted there were issues with the [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] gameplay in the PC version.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/><ref name=\"GIPRev\"/>\n\nThe game's storytelling attracted mixed responses. The use of an [[unreliable narrator]] was applauded for holding the story together in a cohesive manner by McCormick,<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> and being entertaining by Steimer.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Sharkey liked the three-act structure, comparing it to \"historical fiction reads\" that explores a \"tumultuous period in a fully realized fantasy world\".<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher thought the three-act structure delivered a \"compelling\" story, and appreciated the game's writing, calling it a step-up from ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> VanOrd disliked the game's storytelling, however, calling it a \"downward turn\" from ''Origins'' as it lacked a central goal that engaged players, thus making the story less epic than it should be. However, he remarked that there were \"heartfelt moments\", mostly associated with the game's sidequests and companions.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Juba agreed with VanOrd on the story's shortcomings, saying that there was little tension or consequences in the main story, and it felt like several side-quests stitched together. However, he praised the scenarios for being creative and inventive.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Both VanOrd and ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Dan Whitehead noted the game drew inspiration from real-life events when the writing team created the setting and its cultural and political conflicts. Whitehead called it \"a political game\".<ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/>\n\nCritics had varied opinions on the game's dialogue system. McCormick felt the lack of a morality system enabled players to pick different dialogue stances depending on different circumstances, as opposed to being funneled to role-play a certain personality.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> He praised the game's three-act structure for making choices consequential. Decisions made earlier may result in a significant difference several years later in the game. McCormick called this \"impressive\".<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> Sharkey and Whitehead liked the choices presented, and felt they were impactful and often morally ambiguous.<ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> VanOrd agreed, and attributed it to the setting's unstable political climate. He was disappointed that some choices were merely illusions, but felt there were more impactful decisions in the game than in ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> However, Steimer felt there were not a lot of impactful choices in the game, and criticized the [[cliffhanger]] ending.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Joseph Leray of ''[[Destructoid]]'' commented on the game's pacing, saying that \"Act I is too long, Act III is too short, and Act II feels like the climax of the game but is largely tangential to the main plot\".<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/>\n\nCritics praised the companions featured in the game. Steimer liked the background banter between the companions, saying they are \"heartwarming\" and \"hilarious\".<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Sharkey felt the characters were exceptional, calling them BioWare's best, though he was disappointed by the fact their armor could not be customized.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher also liked the companions, saying they were more fleshed out and less \"expository\".<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Both Whitehead and VanOrd felt the companions were not as interesting as the original game, though VanOrd noted their personalities are \"vivid\" nonetheless, and all the companions were excellently voiced and their lines were well-written.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/><ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/> Juba, however, found the companions superior to those in ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Leray liked the companion quests, singling out Merill's and Aveline's as two of the best. However, he lamented the game did not offer enough opportunities to interact with its cast of companions.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> Revisiting ''Dragon Age II'' in 2015, Chris Thursten of ''PC Gamer'' praised the game's handling of its roster of companions, noting that \"they have their own homes, jobs and opinions\". Thrusten also praised the complex relationships they have with each other. He noted that Hawke's decade in Kirkwall is primarily an exploration of these relationships and concluded that \"BioWare has not created a narrative with this much nuance since, nor so many clever moments...\".<ref name=\"Reinstall\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/reinstall-dragon-age-2/|author=Chris Thursten|title=Reinstall: Dragon Age 2|date=January 7, 2015 |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nReused assets and the game being set entirely in Kirkwall were criticized. Some critics felt the game confined players to a very small city. Steimer felt the rich lore featured in the game was wasted.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> McCormick felt the small world helped players become more thoroughly engaged in it, able to understand its culture and politics due to its small scale.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> Sharkey called certain areas in the game \"carbon-copy dungeon crawls\", and was disappointed by the excessive reuse of areas.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher added that the [[backtracking]] featured in the game gave the impression it was more linear than its predecessor.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Juba felt the game's locations were \"painfully limited\", and players would get tired of them after a while.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Leray criticized the assets for being \"bland\", saying that reusing them made the issue even worse. Like Juba, he felt that locations would became \"stale\" as players progress, and that the city has too few people of interest or missions for players to complete.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/>\n\n===Players reaction===\nBefore the game's release, players of the original game were worried the sequel would be streamlined like ''[[Mass Effect]]''. Head writer David Gaider assured fans of ''Origins'' this was not the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/07/14/dont-panic-on-dragon-age-ii-changes-says-bioware/|title=Don\u2019t panic on Dragon Age II changes, says BioWare|first=Johnny|last=Cullen|work=[[VG 247]]|date=July 14, 2010|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref> While BioWare expected fan criticism over the drastic changes implemented in the sequel, they were surprised by the widespread backlash from players.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-02-dragon-age-2-response-surprised-bioware|title=Dragon Age 2 response surprised BioWare|first=Fred|last=Dutton|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=August 2, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref> EA acknowledged the game's negative reception among fans, saying that they \"lost some [''Origins''] fans\" with the game's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/ea-admits-it-lost-some-fans-over-dragon-age-2/|title=EA Admits It \u2018Lost Some Fans\u2019 Over Dragon Age 2|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|date=June 14, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref> Players were divided over ''Dragon Age II''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5875251/not-everyone-hates-dragon-age-ii--you-know|title=Not Everyone Hates Dragon Age II, You Know|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=November 1, 2012|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref> Most of their criticism was directed at the game's wave-based enemies, excessively reused environments, and the lack of origin choices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-06-14-ea-we-lost-some-fans-with-dragon-age-2|title=EA: we lost some fans with Dragon Age 2|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 14, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Controversies===\nA BioWare employee was caught posting as a consumer on Metacritic.
