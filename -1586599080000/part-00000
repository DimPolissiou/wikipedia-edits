Originally, ''Voima'' was scheduled to be replaced by [[Polaris (icebreaker)|a new icebreaker]] by the winter of 2015\u201316. However, in 2016 it was decided to extend her operational lifetime by at least ten years with another refit.\n\n== Development and construction ==\nIn the [[Moscow Armistice]], signed on 19 September 1944, Finland agreed to pay [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations of US$300 million]] to the [[Soviet Union]]. The war reparations, paid in the form of ships and machinery over six years, included the newest [[steamship|steam-powered]] state-owned icebreakers [[Voima (1924 icebreaker)|''Voima'']] and [[J\u00e4\u00e4karhu (icebreaker)|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'']]. This left Finland with one modern diesel-electric icebreaker, [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']], which had been damaged by a [[naval mine]] during the war, and four older steam-powered icebreakers. Of these, especially [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']] and [[Apu (1899 icebreaker)|''Apu'']] were considered nearly obsolete and their efforts in the [[Archipelago Sea]] were sometimes described being \"mostly of moral nature\". As a result, only the ports of [[Hanko]] and [[Turku]] were kept open through the first post-war winters.<ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\">Kaukiainen (1992), pp. 226\u2013231.</ref>\n\n[[File:Voima bow propellers.jpg|thumb|left|''Voima'' was the first icebreaker in the world with two bow propellers]]\nIn 1946, the [[Finnish Government]] appointed a committee to start planning the rebuilding of the Finnish icebreaker fleet. The committee, consisting of the director of the [[Finnish Maritime Administration]], [[Svante Sundman]], and two experienced Finnish shipbuilders, [[K. Albin Johansson]] and [[Ossian Tybeck]], delivered its final report on the construction of a new icebreaker in the following year.<ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\" /> The main dimensions of the new 4,415-ton icebreaker, large enough to escort 10,000-ton dry cargo ships or 16,000-ton tankers, were based on the old ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'', but the [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]] were replaced with a modern diesel-electric propulsion system, similar to the 1939-built ''Sisu'', with a combined output of 10,500 [[shaft horsepower|shp]].<ref name=\"laurellvoima\" /> In the early drafts, the new icebreaker was designed with three propellers (two in the stern and one in the bow) and an asymmetric [[Stem (ship)|stem]] that would compensate for the transverse force caused by the bow propeller.<ref name=\"ramsay352-353\">Ramsay (1949), pp. 352\u2013353.</ref> However, these features were later dropped after extensive [[Ship model basin|model testing]] and co-operation with Swedish naval architects in favor of a completely new design.<ref name=\"sl2-54\">J\u00e4\u00e4nmurtaja Voima ja sen nelj\u00e4 potkuria. Suomen Laivasto 2/1954, pp. 27\u201328.</ref>\n\nThe result was, in many respects, the most advanced icebreaker in the world at the time. Although bow propellers had been a common feature in icebreakers around the world for decades, it was incorrectly believed that they helped with the actual icebreaking process by reducing the pressure under the ice in front of the ship. However, extensive research and recent experiences had shown that bow propellers improved the icebreaking capability because their flushing effect reduced the friction between the broken ice floes and the hull of the ship. The drawback of a single bow propeller was that it would lubricate only one side of the hull. As a result, the new Finnish icebreaker was designed with two bow propellers which would produce a more powerful and, more importantly, symmetric flushing effect. Furthermore, a vessel with four propellers would be extremely maneuverable and capable of even moving sideways. Prior to the new Finnish icebreaker, only the 1947-built Canadian [[ferry]] [[MV Abegweit (1947)|''Abegweit'']] had been fitted with such propulsion arrangement. While the new ship was not the largest icebreaker in the world at the time, the power-to-displacement and power-to-beam ratios of the new Finnish icebreaker put her in a class of her own among icebreaking ships.<ref name=\"sl2-54\" />\n\n[[File:Voima at Hietalahti 1954.jpg|thumb|left|''Voima'' shortly before delivery at [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard]]]]\nThe construction of the first Finnish post-war icebreaker was awarded to [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] in 1948, but due to lack of funding the keel of the ship was not laid down at the [[Hietalahti shipyard]] until 29 May 1951.<ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\" /><ref>[http://hyl.edu.hel.fi/~petri/petri/oppilastyot/mikkojp/murtajat.html J\u00e4\u00e4nmurtajat Suomessa]. {{retrieved |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> The working name of the newbuilding was ''Into'',<ref name=\"sl3-50\">Den nya havsisbryaren - ett teknisk framsteg.

However, in the following spring the United States commissioned [[USS Glacier (AGB-4)|USS ''Glacier'']] which, at 21,000{{nbsp}}shp, had twice the power of the Finnish icebreaker.\n\nThe new state-owned icebreaker generated widespread publicity and the follow-up orders allowed W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 to establish the Finnish shipbuilding industry as the world leader in the design and construction of icebreaking ships.<ref name=\"turunen40\">Turunen and Partanen (2011), p. 40.</ref> After ''Voima'', the shipyard delivered three icebreakers of similar design to the Soviet Union (''[[Kapitan Belousov]]'', ''[[Kapitan Voronin]]'' and ''[[Kapitan Melehov]]'') and one for the [[Swedish Maritime Administration]] ([[Oden (1957 icebreaker)|''Oden'']]).<ref name=\"arctia\" /><ref>Suurtunnustus j\u00e4\u00e4nmurtajien rakentajillemme.

Mongabay.com. {{retrieved |accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref> including all Finnish icebreakers in service at the time.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n[[File:Voima-as-built.jpg|thumb|left|''Voima'' breaking ice outside Helsinki, showing her original outfit]]\nWhile the new icebreaker was being built, the state-owned icebreaker fleet had become a powerful [[Strike action|strike weapon]] for [[Niilo W\u00e4ll\u00e4ri]], the chairman of the [[Finnish Seamen's Union]]. By the early 1950s, the strikes had become so common that they were sometimes considered a normal part of the arrival of winter. It was also jokingly said that a new icebreaker strike could be predicted simply by looking at the thermometer\u2014the \"strike limit\" would be reached when the temperature dropped low enough for the seas to freeze.<ref name=\"sampo\">[http://www.sampotours.com/assets/files/Sampo-Icebreaker-history.pdf Sampo - The giant of the ice fields]. {{retrieved |accessdate=2012-08-21}}</ref> When W\u00e4ll\u00e4ri announced a new strike in 1953, the Finnish Government decided to take action as the icebreaker strikes effectively stopped all foreign trade during the winter months, causing major losses for the Finnish industry. In Sweden, the state-owned icebreakers were part of the [[Swedish Navy]] and thus were not allowed to go on strike. On 9 February 1954, only four days before ''Voima'' was commissioned, it was decided to move the new icebreaker under the [[Finnish Navy]], where it would replace the 77-year-old [[SS Von D\u00f6beln|''Von D\u00f6beln'']] as the supply ship for the [[torpedo boat]]s during the summer months. During the icebreaking season, the ship would still be crewed by the Navy, but used to escort merchant ships under the command of the Finnish Maritime Administration.<ref name=\"sl3-54\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\" />\n\nThe change of flag was postponed until the end of the winter season due to opposition from the Seamen's Union. When ''Voima'' was transferred to the Finnish Navy on 1 May 1954, the Seamen's Union announced that Finnish merchant ships, crewed by civilians, would not subject themselves to military authority by accepting assistance from a naval ship. As a result, the ports of [[Kotka]] and [[Hamina]] were effectively closed during the first months of the following winter, trapping a number of ships in the harbors, as ''Voima'' was the only icebreaker stationed in the eastern part of the [[Gulf of Finland]]. Eventually, the Government gave up and called ''Voima'' to Helsinki, where she remained until the spring. On 1 December 1955, ''Voima'' was transferred back to the Finnish Maritime Administration.<ref name=\"laurellvoima\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\" /><ref>Uusi Suomi, 11 February 1954. s. 10.</ref>\n\n[[File:Voima at work 1954.jpg|thumb|right|''Voima'' breaking ice shortly after delivery]]\nAlthough the commissioning of the new icebreaker did not go as planned, ''Voima'' still brought a long-awaited relief to the Finnish winter navigation. During the extremely difficult winter of 1956, she broke all previous records by escorting or otherwise assisting 616 icebound ships, among them the steam-powered icebreakers [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']] and [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']] that had been immobilized by compressive pack ice. ''Voima'' also proved the superiority of two bow propellers in Baltic ice conditions and experiences from her first years in service were used to design the new [[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|''Karhu''-class icebreakers]] in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"laurellvoima\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\" /> ''Voima'' remained the most powerful icebreaker in the Finnish state-owned fleet until the new 12,000&nbsp;hp [[Finnish icebreaker Tarmo (1963)|''Tarmo''-class icebreakers]] entered service in the mid-1960s.<ref>Turunen and Partanen (2011), p. 38.</ref>\n\n=== Refitting ===\nThe rebuilding and expanding of the Finnish icebreaker fleet continued until all Finnish ports could be kept open year-round.<ref>J\u00e4\u00e4salo (1980).</ref> In the late 1970s, the first post-war icebreakers were approaching either [[mid-life update]] or retirement. As a result, the 25-year-old ''Voima'' was extensively rebuilt by W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki Shipyard]] in 1978\u20131979 at a cost of about [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 86 million,<ref>Pohjanpalo (1978), p. 182.</ref> 60{{nbsp}}% of the price of a new icebreaker of comparable size. In the refit, ''Voima'' received new hull plating and additional ice-strengthening, new main engines and a completely new superstructure to accommodate the crew, and her propulsion motors and electrical systems were completely refurbished. After the refit, ''Voima'' was practically a new ship with only web frames, bottom plating, forepeak and propellers remaining from the original ship and, at 14,000 shaft horsepower, the third most powerful icebreaker of Finland at the time.<ref name=\"laurellvoima\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen329\" /><ref name=\"turunen121-123\" /> She returned to service on 10 October 1979.<ref>J\u00e4\u00e4nmurtaja Voima uudistettu.

As more powerful icebreakers entered service in the 1980s and 1990s, she has operated mainly in the Gulf of Finland. During the particularly mild winters of 1995 and 2002, she remained at stand-by at [[Katajanokka]] through the winter. Although ''Voima'' had been involved in minor collisions and other incidents in the past, she had not been grounded until 11 April 2003, when she ran aground while assisting a small German cargo ship in difficult conditions outside Helsinki. However, there were only minor dents in the hull plating and some damage to the bow propeller blades, which were repaired at [[Vuosaari shipyard]] on 14\u201317 April.<ref name=\"onnettomuustutkinta\"/>\n\nFollowing the reorganization of the Finnish Maritime Administration in 2004, the ownership and management of the state-owned vessels was transferred to a newly founded state-owned enterprise, [[Finstaship]]. Since 2010, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers have been owned and operated by the state-owned shipping company [[Arctia (company)|Arctia]] through its subsidiary, Arctia Icebreaking.

Originally, ''Voima'' was scheduled to be replaced by [[Polaris (icebreaker)|a new icebreaker]] by the winter of 2015\u201316. However, in 2016 it was decided to extend her operational lifetime by at least ten years with another refit.\n\n== Development and construction ==\nIn the [[Moscow Armistice]], signed on 19 September 1944, Finland agreed to pay [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations of US$300 million]] to the [[Soviet Union]]. The war reparations, paid in the form of ships and machinery over six years, included the newest [[steamship|steam-powered]] state-owned icebreakers [[Voima (1924 icebreaker)|''Voima'']] and [[J\u00e4\u00e4karhu (icebreaker)|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'']]. This left Finland with one modern diesel-electric icebreaker, [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']], which had been damaged by a [[naval mine]] during the war, and four older steam-powered icebreakers. Of these, especially [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']] and [[Apu (1899 icebreaker)|''Apu'']] were considered nearly obsolete and their efforts in the [[Archipelago Sea]] were sometimes described being \"mostly of moral nature\". As a result, only the ports of [[Hanko]] and [[Turku]] were kept open through the first post-war winters.<ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\">Kaukiainen (1992), pp. 226\u2013231.</ref>\n\n[[File:Voima bow propellers.jpg|thumb|left|''Voima'' was the first icebreaker in the world with two bow propellers]]\nIn 1946, the [[Finnish Government]] appointed a committee to start planning the rebuilding of the Finnish icebreaker fleet. The committee, consisting of the director of the [[Finnish Maritime Administration]], [[Svante Sundman]], and two experienced Finnish shipbuilders, [[K. Albin Johansson]] and [[Ossian Tybeck]], delivered its final report on the construction of a new icebreaker in the following year.<ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\" /> The main dimensions of the new 4,415-ton icebreaker, large enough to escort 10,000-ton dry cargo ships or 16,000-ton tankers, were based on the old ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'', but the [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]] were replaced with a modern diesel-electric propulsion system, similar to the 1939-built ''Sisu'', with a combined output of 10,500 [[shaft horsepower|shp]].<ref name=\"laurellvoima\" /> In the early drafts, the new icebreaker was designed with three propellers (two in the stern and one in the bow) and an asymmetric [[Stem (ship)|stem]] that would compensate for the transverse force caused by the bow propeller.<ref name=\"ramsay352-353\">Ramsay (1949), pp. 352\u2013353.</ref> However, these features were later dropped after extensive [[Ship model basin|model testing]] and co-operation with Swedish naval architects in favor of a completely new design.<ref name=\"sl2-54\">J\u00e4\u00e4nmurtaja Voima ja sen nelj\u00e4 potkuria. Suomen Laivasto 2/1954, pp. 27\u201328.</ref>\n\nThe result was, in many respects, the most advanced icebreaker in the world at the time. Although bow propellers had been a common feature in icebreakers around the world for decades, it was incorrectly believed that they helped with the actual icebreaking process by reducing the pressure under the ice in front of the ship. However, extensive research and recent experiences had shown that bow propellers improved the icebreaking capability because their flushing effect reduced the friction between the broken ice floes and the hull of the ship. The drawback of a single bow propeller was that it would lubricate only one side of the hull. As a result, the new Finnish icebreaker was designed with two bow propellers which would produce a more powerful and, more importantly, symmetric flushing effect. Furthermore, a vessel with four propellers would be extremely maneuverable and capable of even moving sideways. Prior to the new Finnish icebreaker, only the 1947-built Canadian [[ferry]] [[MV Abegweit (1947)|''Abegweit'']] had been fitted with such propulsion arrangement. While the new ship was not the largest icebreaker in the world at the time, the power-to-displacement and power-to-beam ratios of the new Finnish icebreaker put her in a class of her own among icebreaking ships.<ref name=\"sl2-54\" />\n\n[[File:Voima at Hietalahti 1954.jpg|thumb|left|''Voima'' shortly before delivery at [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard]]]]\nThe construction of the first Finnish post-war icebreaker was awarded to [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] in 1948, but due to lack of funding the keel of the ship was not laid down at the [[Hietalahti shipyard]] until 29 May 1951.<ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\" /><ref>[http://hyl.edu.hel.fi/~petri/petri/oppilastyot/mikkojp/murtajat.html J\u00e4\u00e4nmurtajat Suomessa]. {{retrieved |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref> The working name of the newbuilding was ''Into'',<ref name=\"sl3-50\">Den nya havsisbryaren - ett teknisk framsteg.

By the early 1950s, the strikes had become so common that they were sometimes considered a normal part of the arrival of winter. It was also jokingly said that a new icebreaker strike could be predicted simply by looking at the thermometer\u2014the \"strike limit\" would be reached when the temperature dropped low enough for the seas to freeze.<ref name=\"sampo\">[http://www.sampotours.com/assets/files/Sampo-Icebreaker-history.pdf Sampo - The giant of the ice fields]. {{retrieved |accessdate=2012-08-21}}</ref> When W\u00e4ll\u00e4ri announced a new strike in 1953, the Finnish Government decided to take action as the icebreaker strikes effectively stopped all foreign trade during the winter months, causing major losses for the Finnish industry. In Sweden, the state-owned icebreakers were part of the [[Swedish Navy]] and thus were not allowed to go on strike. On 9 February 1954, only four days before ''Voima'' was commissioned, it was decided to move the new icebreaker under the [[Finnish Navy]], where it would replace the 77-year-old [[SS Von D\u00f6beln|''Von D\u00f6beln'']] as the supply ship for the [[torpedo boat]]s during the summer months. During the icebreaking season, the ship would still be crewed by the Navy, but used to escort merchant ships under the command of the Finnish Maritime Administration.<ref name=\"sl3-54\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\" />\n\nThe change of flag was postponed until the end of the winter season due to opposition from the Seamen's Union. When ''Voima'' was transferred to the Finnish Navy on 1 May 1954, the Seamen's Union announced that Finnish merchant ships, crewed by civilians, would not subject themselves to military authority by accepting assistance from a naval ship. As a result, the ports of [[Kotka]] and [[Hamina]] were effectively closed during the first months of the following winter, trapping a number of ships in the harbors, as ''Voima'' was the only icebreaker stationed in the eastern part of the [[Gulf of Finland]]. Eventually, the Government gave up and called ''Voima'' to Helsinki, where she remained until the spring. On 1 December 1955, ''Voima'' was transferred back to the Finnish Maritime Administration.<ref name=\"laurellvoima\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\" /><ref>Uusi Suomi, 11 February 1954. s. 10.</ref>\n\n[[File:Voima at work 1954.jpg|thumb|right|''Voima'' breaking ice shortly after delivery]]\nAlthough the commissioning of the new icebreaker did not go as planned, ''Voima'' still brought a long-awaited relief to the Finnish winter navigation. During the extremely difficult winter of 1956, she broke all previous records by escorting or otherwise assisting 616 icebound ships, among them the steam-powered icebreakers [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']] and [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']] that had been immobilized by compressive pack ice. ''Voima'' also proved the superiority of two bow propellers in Baltic ice conditions and experiences from her first years in service were used to design the new [[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|''Karhu''-class icebreakers]] in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"laurellvoima\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen226-231\" /> ''Voima'' remained the most powerful icebreaker in the Finnish state-owned fleet until the new 12,000&nbsp;hp [[Finnish icebreaker Tarmo (1963)|''Tarmo''-class icebreakers]] entered service in the mid-1960s.<ref>Turunen and Partanen (2011), p. 38.</ref>\n\n=== Refitting ===\nThe rebuilding and expanding of the Finnish icebreaker fleet continued until all Finnish ports could be kept open year-round.<ref>J\u00e4\u00e4salo (1980).</ref> In the late 1970s, the first post-war icebreakers were approaching either [[mid-life update]] or retirement. As a result, the 25-year-old ''Voima'' was extensively rebuilt by W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki Shipyard]] in 1978\u20131979 at a cost of about [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 86 million,<ref>Pohjanpalo (1978), p. 182.</ref> 60{{nbsp}}% of the price of a new icebreaker of comparable size. In the refit, ''Voima'' received new hull plating and additional ice-strengthening, new main engines and a completely new superstructure to accommodate the crew, and her propulsion motors and electrical systems were completely refurbished. After the refit, ''Voima'' was practically a new ship with only web frames, bottom plating, forepeak and propellers remaining from the original ship and, at 14,000 shaft horsepower, the third most powerful icebreaker of Finland at the time.<ref name=\"laurellvoima\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen329\" /><ref name=\"turunen121-123\" /> She returned to service on 10 October 1979.<ref>J\u00e4\u00e4nmurtaja Voima uudistettu.

As more powerful icebreakers entered service in the 1980s and 1990s, she has operated mainly in the Gulf of Finland. During the particularly mild winters of 1995 and 2002, she remained at stand-by at [[Katajanokka]] through the winter. Although ''Voima'' had been involved in minor collisions and other incidents in the past, she had not been grounded until 11 April 2003, when she ran aground while assisting a small German cargo ship in difficult conditions outside Helsinki. However, there were only minor dents in the hull plating and some damage to the bow propeller blades, which were repaired at [[Vuosaari shipyard]] on 14\u201317 April.<ref name=\"onnettomuustutkinta\"/>\n\nFollowing the reorganization of the Finnish Maritime Administration in 2004, the ownership and management of the state-owned vessels was transferred to a newly founded state-owned enterprise, [[Finstaship]]. Since 2010, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers have been owned and operated by the state-owned shipping company [[Arctia (company)|Arctia]] through its subsidiary, Arctia Icebreaking.

Laid down at [[Werft Becker & Co.]] in [[Tallinn]] in 1916 and fitted with engines in [[Danzig]] in 1918, the unfinished icebreaker was towed to [[Helsinki]] in 1920 and completed by [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab]] in 1923\u20131924. After two decades of successful service ''Voima'' was handed over to the [[Soviet Union]] as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparation]] in 1945 and renamed '''''Malygin''''' (''\u041c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0433\u0438\u043d''). She remained in service until 1970 and was broken up in 1971.\n\n''Voima'' was the first state-owned icebreaker acquired by the independent Finland.<ref name=\"tietomajakka\" /> She can also be considered as the first state-owned icebreaker designed by Finnish [[naval architect]]s and delivered by a Finnish shipyard.<ref name=\"laurell293-294\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background and construction ===\n\nWhen Finland signed the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] on 14 October 1920, it agreed to return the Russian icebreakers that the [[White Guard (Finland)|Finnish White Guard]] had seized during the [[Finnish Civil War|Civil War]] in 1918. As a result, the [[Suur T\u00f5ll (icebreaker)|''W\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'']], the largest and most powerful state-owned icebreaker of Finland at that time, was handed over to Estonia and the smaller [[Finnish icebreaker Ilmarinen|''Ilmarinen'']] to the Soviet Union in 1922. While Finland got the [[Apu (1899 icebreaker)|''Avance'']] back in return, there was a definite need for a powerful icebreaker \u2014 both the size of the ships calling the Finnish winter ports and the amount of exported goods, especially forest products, had increased considerably since the [[First World War]]. When the forest industry owners voiced their concerns, the Finnish shipowner John Nurminen stepped in and offered the state an unfinished icebreaker he had purchased from Germany two years earlier.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" />\n\nThe partially completed icebreaker he was offering was one of the two icebreakers ordered by the [[Russian Baltic Fleet]] from Werft B\u00f6cker & Co. in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1916. Laid down as ''Shtorm'', the icebreaker was intended not only for escort operations on the [[Baltic Sea]], but also naval tasks such as laying mines during the winter months and transporting troops and supplies to Russian warships and coastal forts. The construction proceeded slowly during the war and in 1918, shortly after the ship had been launched, the unfinished icebreaker was captured by Germans and towed to Danzig, where she was fitted with boilers. However, the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]] stopped the construction of the ship, now known as ''Hansa'', shortly afterwards. Nurminen bought the unfinished icebreaker in 1920 and had her towed to Helsinki.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" />\n\nWhen Nurminen began offering ''Hansa'' to the state of Finland, he faced severe opposition even though he even offered to accept the old and, to some people, outdated icebreaker [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']] as part of the payment. Her rusted hull was seen as a pile of scrap, not worth the government's scarce funds, and she didn't even have a bow propeller which was seen as a crucial component of a modern icebreaker.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" /> However, several maritime professionals saw her potential and the owner of [[G\u00f6taverken]], [[Hugo Hammar]], even said that once finished, ''Hansa'' would outperform the largest icebreakers of Finland at that time, [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']] and [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']]. As a result, the [[Finnish Board of Navigation]] reserved FIM 17 million for the purchase and completion of ''Hansa''.<ref name=\"ramsay309-310\" />\n\nThe rebuilding of ''Hansa'' was awarded to Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab in Helsinki and the work began in late spring 1923. During the ten months the icebreaker spent in the shipyard she received a new bow with a bow propeller and two German [[steam engine]]s with an official combined maximum output of {{convert|4100|ihp|abbr=out}}, making her the most powerful Finnish icebreaker at that time. On 15 December 1923 she was given the name ''Voima'', meaning \"strength\" in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and during the first [[sea trials]] on 6 March 1924 she turned out to be an excellent icebreaker that left a broad ice-free channel behind her. ''Voima'' had also cost considerably less than a new icebreaker with similar characteristics and performance.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" /><ref name=\"ramsay309-310\" />\n\n=== Career ===\n\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Voima guns.jpg|thumb|left|''Voima'' was fitted with [[120 mm 50 caliber Pattern 1905|120 mm Pattern 1905]] deck guns before the [[Second World War]]]]\n\nCommissioned in March 1924, ''Voima'' was usually sent to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] where she assisted ships to the port of [[Vaasa]] until late December. As the ice conditions got worse, she moved south until, from February on, she was tasked to maintain an open channel between Finland and [[Sweden]] on the [[Turku]]-[[Stockholm]] route.<ref name=\"laurell158\">Laurell 1992, p. 158.</ref>\n\nIn 1927, after the loss of the [[Finnish torpedo boat S2|Finnish torpedo boat ''S2'']], ''Voima'' was used as a gunnery training ship by the [[Finnish Navy]]. As a result, she already had deck gun mounts when the [[Winter War]] began on 30 November 1939 and the icebreakers were armed against Soviet fighters. During the war ''Voima'' assisted ships in the [[Bothnian Sea]] and stayed outside major conflicts.<ref name=\"laurell259-260\">Laurell 1992, p. 259-260.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Moscow Armistice]] was signed on 19 September 1944, Finland was ordered to pay [[war reparations]] to the Soviet Union. One of the first payments included the newest and most powerful state-owned steam-powered icebreakers. ''Voima'' was handed over along with the enormous [[J\u00e4\u00e4karhu (icebreaker)|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'']] on 24 February 1945. She was renamed ''Malygin'' (''\u041c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0433\u0438\u043d''), becoming the second Soviet icebreaker named after the Russian 18th century [[arctic explorer]] [[Stepan Malygin]]. The [[Icebreaker Malygin (1912)|old ''Malygin'']], built in 1912, had been lost in a storm near [[Kamchatka]] in 1940.<ref name=\"laurell294\">Laurell 1992, p. 294.</ref> In 1950 she was modernized and her boilers were converted to oil. The name ''Voima'' was later given to the [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|first Finnish post-war icebreaker]].\n\n''Malygin'' remained in service until 1970. She was broken up in the following year.\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n''Voima'' was {{convert|64.20|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[length overall|long overall]] and {{convert|61.25|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[waterline length|at the waterline]]. Her [[moulded breadth]] was {{convert|14.20|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} and breadth at the waterline slightly smaller, {{convert|14.00|m|ft|2|abbr=out}}.<ref name=\"laurell344\">Laurell 1992, p. 344.</ref> To improve her icebreaking characteristics ''Voima'' was built with considerable stern trim, meaning that her draft was greater in the stern than in the bow. When operating at a normal displacement of 2,070 tons, her bow draft was {{convert|4.4|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} and stern draft {{convert|5.1|m|ft|2|abbr=out}}, but the latter could be increased up to {{convert|5.9|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} in case of difficult ice conditions.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" /> ''Voima'' had a crew of 44.<ref name=\"laurell201\" />\n\nThe hull of ''Voima'', designed by Finnish naval architect [[K. Albin Johansson]], was based on Finnish icebreakers ''Sampo'' and ''Tarmo'', and the Russian icebreaker [[Russian icebreaker Pyotr Velikiy (1912)|''Pyotr Velikiy'']] \u2014 her hull form and main dimensions were interpolated from the three older icebreakers. While initially designed without a bow propeller, her bow was later completely rebuilt with one.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" /> The angle of the stem, the first part of the icebreaker to encounter ice and bend it under the weight of the ship, was 26 degrees.<ref name=\"laurell344\" />\n\n''Voima'' was powered by two coal-fired [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]] manufactured by [[AG Vulcan Stettin|Vulcan-Werke Hamburg und Stettin AG]], one driving a propeller in the stern and the other a second propeller in the bow to reduce friction between the hull and the ice. The stern engine was rated at 2,500 [[indicated horsepower|ihp]] at 95 rpm and the bow engine 1,000 ihp at 140 rpm, but during backing and ramming the engines could produce 2,800\u20133,100 ihp and 1,200\u20131,300 ihp, respectively, for a brief period of time.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" /> Her speed in open water was {{convert|13|kn|abbr=out}}.<ref name=\"laurell344\" /> The four coal-fired mechanically ventilated main boilers, installed on the icebreaker in 1918 in Danzig, had been manufactured by [[Blohm & Voss]] in 1899 and originally intended for German [[armored frigate]] [[SMS Friedrich der Grosse (1874)|SMS ''Friedrich der Grosse'']].

Laid down at [[Werft Becker & Co.]] in [[Tallinn]] in 1916 and fitted with engines in [[Danzig]] in 1918, the unfinished icebreaker was towed to [[Helsinki]] in 1920 and completed by [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab]] in 1923\u20131924. After two decades of successful service ''Voima'' was handed over to the [[Soviet Union]] as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparation]] in 1945 and renamed '''''Malygin''''' (''\u041c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0433\u0438\u043d''). She remained in service until 1970 and was broken up in 1971.\n\n''Voima'' was the first state-owned icebreaker acquired by the independent Finland.<ref name=\"tietomajakka\" /> She can also be considered as the first state-owned icebreaker designed by Finnish [[naval architect]]s and delivered by a Finnish shipyard.<ref name=\"laurell293-294\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background and construction ===\n\nWhen Finland signed the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] on 14 October 1920, it agreed to return the Russian icebreakers that the [[White Guard (Finland)|Finnish White Guard]] had seized during the [[Finnish Civil War|Civil War]] in 1918. As a result, the [[Suur T\u00f5ll (icebreaker)|''W\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'']], the largest and most powerful state-owned icebreaker of Finland at that time, was handed over to Estonia and the smaller [[Finnish icebreaker Ilmarinen|''Ilmarinen'']] to the Soviet Union in 1922. While Finland got the [[Apu (1899 icebreaker)|''Avance'']] back in return, there was a definite need for a powerful icebreaker \u2014 both the size of the ships calling the Finnish winter ports and the amount of exported goods, especially forest products, had increased considerably since the [[First World War]]. When the forest industry owners voiced their concerns, the Finnish shipowner John Nurminen stepped in and offered the state an unfinished icebreaker he had purchased from Germany two years earlier.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" />\n\nThe partially completed icebreaker he was offering was one of the two icebreakers ordered by the [[Russian Baltic Fleet]] from Werft B\u00f6cker & Co. in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1916. Laid down as ''Shtorm'', the icebreaker was intended not only for escort operations on the [[Baltic Sea]], but also naval tasks such as laying mines during the winter months and transporting troops and supplies to Russian warships and coastal forts. The construction proceeded slowly during the war and in 1918, shortly after the ship had been launched, the unfinished icebreaker was captured by Germans and towed to Danzig, where she was fitted with boilers. However, the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]] stopped the construction of the ship, now known as ''Hansa'', shortly afterwards. Nurminen bought the unfinished icebreaker in 1920 and had her towed to Helsinki.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" />\n\nWhen Nurminen began offering ''Hansa'' to the state of Finland, he faced severe opposition even though he even offered to accept the old and, to some people, outdated icebreaker [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']] as part of the payment. Her rusted hull was seen as a pile of scrap, not worth the government's scarce funds, and she didn't even have a bow propeller which was seen as a crucial component of a modern icebreaker.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" /> However, several maritime professionals saw her potential and the owner of [[G\u00f6taverken]], [[Hugo Hammar]], even said that once finished, ''Hansa'' would outperform the largest icebreakers of Finland at that time, [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']] and [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']]. As a result, the [[Finnish Board of Navigation]] reserved FIM 17 million for the purchase and completion of ''Hansa''.<ref name=\"ramsay309-310\" />\n\nThe rebuilding of ''Hansa'' was awarded to Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab in Helsinki and the work began in late spring 1923. During the ten months the icebreaker spent in the shipyard she received a new bow with a bow propeller and two German [[steam engine]]s with an official combined maximum output of {{convert|4100|ihp|abbr=out}}, making her the most powerful Finnish icebreaker at that time. On 15 December 1923 she was given the name ''Voima'', meaning \"strength\" in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and during the first [[sea trials]] on 6 March 1924 she turned out to be an excellent icebreaker that left a broad ice-free channel behind her. ''Voima'' had also cost considerably less than a new icebreaker with similar characteristics and performance.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" /><ref name=\"ramsay309-310\" />\n\n=== Career ===\n\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Voima guns.jpg|thumb|left|''Voima'' was fitted with [[120 mm 50 caliber Pattern 1905|120 mm Pattern 1905]] deck guns before the [[Second World War]]]]\n\nCommissioned in March 1924, ''Voima'' was usually sent to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] where she assisted ships to the port of [[Vaasa]] until late December. As the ice conditions got worse, she moved south until, from February on, she was tasked to maintain an open channel between Finland and [[Sweden]] on the [[Turku]]-[[Stockholm]] route.<ref name=\"laurell158\">Laurell 1992, p. 158.</ref>\n\nIn 1927, after the loss of the [[Finnish torpedo boat S2|Finnish torpedo boat ''S2'']], ''Voima'' was used as a gunnery training ship by the [[Finnish Navy]]. As a result, she already had deck gun mounts when the [[Winter War]] began on 30 November 1939 and the icebreakers were armed against Soviet fighters. During the war ''Voima'' assisted ships in the [[Bothnian Sea]] and stayed outside major conflicts.<ref name=\"laurell259-260\">Laurell 1992, p. 259-260.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Moscow Armistice]] was signed on 19 September 1944, Finland was ordered to pay [[war reparations]] to the Soviet Union. One of the first payments included the newest and most powerful state-owned steam-powered icebreakers. ''Voima'' was handed over along with the enormous [[J\u00e4\u00e4karhu (icebreaker)|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'']] on 24 February 1945. She was renamed ''Malygin'' (''\u041c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0433\u0438\u043d''), becoming the second Soviet icebreaker named after the Russian 18th century [[arctic explorer]] [[Stepan Malygin]]. The [[Icebreaker Malygin (1912)|old ''Malygin'']], built in 1912, had been lost in a storm near [[Kamchatka]] in 1940.<ref name=\"laurell294\">Laurell 1992, p. 294.</ref> In 1950 she was modernized and her boilers were converted to oil. The name ''Voima'' was later given to the [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|first Finnish post-war icebreaker]].\n\n''Malygin'' remained in service until 1970. She was broken up in the following year.\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n''Voima'' was {{convert|64.20|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[length overall|long overall]] and {{convert|61.25|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[waterline length|at the waterline]]. Her [[moulded breadth]] was {{convert|14.20|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} and breadth at the waterline slightly smaller, {{convert|14.00|m|ft|2|abbr=out}}.<ref name=\"laurell344\">Laurell 1992, p. 344.</ref> To improve her icebreaking characteristics ''Voima'' was built with considerable stern trim, meaning that her draft was greater in the stern than in the bow. When operating at a normal displacement of 2,070 tons, her bow draft was {{convert|4.4|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} and stern draft {{convert|5.1|m|ft|2|abbr=out}}, but the latter could be increased up to {{convert|5.9|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} in case of difficult ice conditions.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" /> ''Voima'' had a crew of 44.<ref name=\"laurell201\" />\n\nThe hull of ''Voima'', designed by Finnish naval architect [[K. Albin Johansson]], was based on Finnish icebreakers ''Sampo'' and ''Tarmo'', and the Russian icebreaker [[Russian icebreaker Pyotr Velikiy (1912)|''Pyotr Velikiy'']] \u2014 her hull form and main dimensions were interpolated from the three older icebreakers. While initially designed without a bow propeller, her bow was later completely rebuilt with one.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" /> The angle of the stem, the first part of the icebreaker to encounter ice and bend it under the weight of the ship, was 26 degrees.<ref name=\"laurell344\" />\n\n''Voima'' was powered by two coal-fired [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]] manufactured by [[AG Vulcan Stettin|Vulcan-Werke Hamburg und Stettin AG]], one driving a propeller in the stern and the other a second propeller in the bow to reduce friction between the hull and the ice. The stern engine was rated at 2,500 [[indicated horsepower|ihp]] at 95 rpm and the bow engine 1,000 ihp at 140 rpm, but during backing and ramming the engines could produce 2,800\u20133,100 ihp and 1,200\u20131,300 ihp, respectively, for a brief period of time.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\" /> Her speed in open water was {{convert|13|kn|abbr=out}}.<ref name=\"laurell344\" /> The four coal-fired mechanically ventilated main boilers, installed on the icebreaker in 1918 in Danzig, had been manufactured by [[Blohm & Voss]] in 1899 and originally intended for German [[armored frigate]] [[SMS Friedrich der Grosse (1874)|SMS ''Friedrich der Grosse'']]. In addition ''Voima'' had a smaller auxiliary boiler, manufactured by [[Vulcan (Turku shipyard)|Vulcan]] in Turku.

Its natural [[habitat]] is subtropical or tropical moist [[montane forest]]s.  It is found in the highlands of New Guinea at elevations of {{convert|2400|to|3900|m|ft}} and is replaced by the [[slaty robin]] at lower elevations.\n\n==Description==\nMeasuring {{convert|14|to|15|cm|in}}, the adult white-winged robin has black plumage, with largely white wings. The male and female are identical. The bill and feet are black, and the eyes are dark brown. Juveniles have a variable streaked brown plumage.<ref name=coates90/>\n\n==Behaviour==\nWithin the forest the robin is found in pairs or small troops of several birds in the [[understory]] or on the ground. It is insectivorous, but does also eat some seeds.<ref name=coates90/>  The somewhat bulky cup-shaped nest is constructed in a tree fork.<ref name=coates90/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nDescribed by English naturalist [[Charles Walter De Vis]] in 1890, the white-winged robin is a member of the Australasian robin family [[Petroicidae]], or Eopsaltridae.<ref name=Boles35>* {{cite book |title=The Robins and Flycatchers of Australia |last=Boles |first=Walter E.|year=1988 |publisher=Angus & Robertson |location=Sydney |isbn=0-207-15400-7|page=35}}</ref> [[Charles Sibley|Sibley]] and [[Jon Ahlquist|Ahlquist]]'s [[DNA-DNA hybridisation]] studies placed this group in a [[Corvida]] [[parvorder]] comprising many tropical and Australian passerines including [[Pardalotidae|pardalotes]], [[Maluridae|fairy-wrens]], [[Meliphagidae|honeyeaters]] and crows.<ref name=\"SibAhl\">{{cite book|vauthors=Sibley CG, Ahlquist JE|title=Phylogeny and Classification of Birds: A Study in Molecular Evolution |publisher= Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|year=1990|pages=603, 610\u201327|isbn=0-300-04085-7}}</ref> However, subsequent molecular research (and current consensus) places the robins as a very early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] (or \"advanced\" songbirds) within the [[songbird]] lineage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barker, F.
