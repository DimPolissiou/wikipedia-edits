Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states. It is known as the \"Constitution State\", the \"Nutmeg State\", the \"Provisions State\", and the \"Land of Steady Habits\".<ref name=\"SOTS\" /> It was influential in development of the federal government of the United States (see [[Connecticut Compromise]]).\n\nThe Connecticut River, [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton).

The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[Presidents pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate|President pro tempore]] presides. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] presides over the House.<ref name=\"CT_CONST\">{{cite web |title=Constitution of the State of Connecticut |website=Secretary of the State |publisher=State of Connecticut |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?A=3188&Q=392288 |date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109004649/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392288 |archive-date=November 9, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> {{As of|2017}}, [[Joe Aresimowicz]] is the Speaker of the House of Connecticut.\n\n{{As of|2019}}, Connecticut's [[United States Senators]] are [[Richard Blumenthal]] (Democrat) and [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] (Democrat).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/states/CT/intro.htm | title=Connecticut | publisher=U.S. Senate | website=States in the Senate | access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref> Connecticut has five [[U.S. Congressional Delegations from Connecticut|representatives in the U.S. House]], all of whom are Democrats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/representatives/#state_ct | title=Connecticut | publisher=U.S. House of Representatives | website=Directory of Representatives | access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nLocally elected representatives also develop [[Local ordinance]]s to govern cities and towns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/ordinances.htm |title=Connecticut Ordinances and Charters by Town |website=Judicial Branch Law Libraries |publisher=State of Connecticut |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref> The town ordinances often include [[noise pollution#Human|noise control]] and [[zoning]] guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtown-ct.gov/Public_Documents/NewtownCT_Police/Ord%20Folder/Ordinances/262 |title=Newtown Noise Control Ordinance |website=Town of Newtown |date=August 20, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511122630/http://www.newtown-ct.gov/Public_Documents/NewtownCT_Police/Ord%20Folder/Ordinances/262 |archivedate=May 11, 2013 }}</ref> However, the State of Connecticut does also provide statewide ordinances for noise control as well.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sec. 22a-69-1 to 22a-69-7.4: Control of Noise |website=Department of Environmental Protection |publisher=State of Connecticut |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/lib/sots/regulations/title_22a/069.pdf |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231223637/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/lib/sots/regulations/title_22a/069.pdf |archive-date=December 31, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Judicial===\n\nThe highest [[court]] of Connecticut's judicial branch is the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]], headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

''Countdown's'' format, per its name, involved Olbermann ranking the five biggest news stories of the day or sometimes \"stories my producers force me to cover\", as Olbermann put it. This was done in numerically reverse order, counting down with the first story shown being ranked fifth but apparently the most important.\n\nThe first few stories shown were typically oriented toward government, politics, and world events; the segments ranked numbers two and one were typically of a lighter fare than the preceding segments. These lighter stories sometimes involved celebrities, sports, and, regularly and somewhere in the middle, the bizarre, in a segment he called \"Oddball.\" Opinions on each were offered by Olbermann and guests interviewed during the segment. Olbermann had been criticized for only having guests that agree with his perspective. Former ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' television critic Howard Rosenberg stated that \"''Countdown'' is more or less an echo chamber in which Olbermann and like-minded bobbleheads nod at each other.\"<ref name=\"Rosenberg2008\" />\n\nOn October 13, 2004, Olbermann launched ''[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6210240 Bloggermann]'', his ''Countdown'' blog, hosted on MSNBC.com.<ref name=\"welcome_to_bloggermann\" /> Olbermann used the open format of the blog to expand on facts or ideas alluded to in the broadcast, to offer personal musings and reactions. However, in February 2007, Olbermann launched a new blog, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20150201181155/http://thenewshole.msnbc.msn.com/default.aspx The News Hole]''.\n\nIn a technique similar to that of former [[CBS News]] anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] in connection to the [[Iran Hostage Crisis]],<ref name=\"Bliss1991\" /> for the last six years of the program, Olbermann closed every show by announcing the number of days passed since President George W. Bush had declared the end of \"major combat operations\" in Iraq under a banner that read \"[[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|Mission Accomplished]]\" (May 1, 2003). Olbermann would then crumple up his notes, throwing them at the camera and saying \"Good night and good luck\", echoing another former CBS newsman, [[Edward R. Murrow]].

In a ''Countdown'' interview with [[Al Franken]] on October 25, 2005, Olbermann noted that in 2003, after having [[Janeane Garofalo]] and Franken on his show, a vice president of MSNBC had questioned him on inviting \"liberals\" on consecutive nights, contrasting that occurrence to the apparent ideological latitude he enjoyed at the time of the second Franken interview.<ref name=\"Ref_2005\" /> In January 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'''s [[Howard Kurtz]] wrote that Olbermann was \"position[ing] his program as an increasingly [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] alternative to ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''.\"<ref name=\"Kurtz2007\" /> Much of the program featured harsh criticism of prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Right-wing politics|right]]-leaning figures, including those who worked for or supported the [[George W.

It's as dangerous as the Ku Klux Klan ever was.\" \n[https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/olbermann-jonah-goldberg-3/]\n\nIn November 2007, British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' placed Olbermann at #67 on their Top 100 list of most influential US liberals. It said that he used his MSNBC show to promote \"an increasingly strident liberal agenda.\" It added that he would be \"a force on the [[political left|Left]] for some time to come.\"<ref name=\"mostinfluential\" /> Avoiding ideological self-labeling, Olbermann described his reporting in 2006 to [[Salon.com]], \"I don't think in these issues that I'm a liberal; I think that I'm an American.

[[Jon Stewart]] criticized Olbermann about this attack on his show, ''The Daily Show'', by noting that it was \"the harshest description of anyone I've ever heard uttered on MSNBC\". Following Stewart's critique, Olbermann apologized by noting, \"I have been a little over the top lately. Point taken. Sorry.\"<ref name=\"Shea2010\" />\n\nHe has accused the [[Tea Party movement]] of being racist due to what he views as a lack of racial diversity at the events, using photos that show overwhelmingly Caucasian crowds attending the rallies.

At one point in the show he referred to [[Bristol, Connecticut]] (ESPN's headquarters), as a \"Godforsaken place\".<ref name=\"Solo\" /> Later that year he abruptly left ESPN under a cloud of controversy, apparently burning his bridges with the network's management;<ref name=\"scorchedbridges\" /> this began a long and drawn-out feud between Olbermann and ESPN. Between 1997 and 2007 incidents between the two sides included Olbermann's publishing an essay on ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' in November 2002 titled \"Mea Culpa\", in which he stated, \"I couldn't handle the pressure of working in daily long-form television, and what was worse, I didn't know I couldn't handle it.\"<ref name=\"meaculpa\" /> The essay told of an instance when his former bosses remarked he had \"too much backbone\", a claim that is literally true, as Olbermann has six [[lumbar vertebrae]] instead of the normal five.<ref name=\"meaculpa\" />\n\nIn 2004 Olbermann was not included in ESPN's guest lineup for its 25th anniversary ''[[SportsCenter]]'' \"Reunion Week\", which saw [[Craig Kilborn]] and [[Charley Steiner]] return to the ''SportsCenter'' set. In 2007, ten years after Olbermann's departure, in an appearance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', he said, \"If you burn a bridge, you can possibly build a new bridge, but if there's no river any more, that's a lot of trouble.\" During the same interview Olbermann stated that he had recently learned that as a result of ESPN's agreeing to let him return to the airwaves on ESPN Radio, he was banned from ESPN's main ([[Bristol, Connecticut]]) campus.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7bXnJ9MvOI|title=Keith and Dan with Dave|date=June 27, 2007|publisher=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-''SportsCenter'' ===\nIn 1999, Olbermann joined [[Fox Sports Net]] to be the star anchor for the weekday sports news show ''[[The National Sports Report|National Sports Report]]'' which was an ill-fated competitor to ''SportsCenter''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/2015/the-keith-olbermann-timeline.html|title=The Keith Olbermann Timeline|first=Ken|last=Fang|date=July 9, 2015|publisher=}}</ref> Olbermann later left that show to be an anchor and executive producer for ''The Keith Olbermann Evening News'', a sportscast similar to ''SportsCenter'' that aired weekly on Sunday evenings. While at Fox he hosted the [[2000 World Series]] as well as [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Broadcasting]]'s baseball ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]''. In May and July 1999, Olbermann also guest-starred ten times on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''.<ref name=\"Ref_f\" />\n\nAccording to Olbermann, he was demoted by Fox when he asked for a slight reduction in duties for health reasons, and then was fired from Fox in 2001 after reporting on rumors that [[Rupert Murdoch]], whose [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] owns Fox, was planning on selling the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].<ref name=\"Ref_2004a\" /> Olbermann characterized the demotion as \"blackmail.\"<ref name=\"Ref_2011a\" /> When asked about Olbermann, Murdoch said, \"I fired him ...

In 2003, his network won an [[RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Award|Edward R. Murrow Award]] for writing on the \"Keith Olbermann Speaking of Everything\" show. In addition, Olbermann wrote a weekly column for [[Salon.com]] from July 2002 until early 2003,<ref name=\"Ref_h\" /> worked for [[CNN]] as a freelance reporter,<ref name=\"Counting_Down_w_KO\" /> and was a fill-in for newscaster [[Paul Harvey]].<ref name=\"Ref_i\" /><ref name=\"Ref_j\" />\n\nOlbermann revived his association with MSNBC in 2003 briefly as a substitute host on ''[[Jerry Nachman|Nachman]]'' and as an anchor for the network's coverage of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war in Iraq]].\n\n=== ''Countdown with Keith Olbermann'' ===\n{{Main|Countdown with Keith Olbermann}}\nOlbermann's own show, ''Countdown'', debuted on MSNBC on March 31, 2003, in the 8 p.m. ET time slot previously held by programs hosted by [[Phil Donahue]] and, briefly, [[Lester Holt]]. ''Countdown's'' format, per its name, involved Olbermann ranking the five biggest news stories of the day or sometimes \"stories my producers force me to cover\", as Olbermann put it. This was done in numerically reverse order, counting down with the first story shown being ranked fifth but apparently the most important.\n\nThe first few stories shown were typically oriented toward government, politics, and world events; the segments ranked numbers two and one were typically of a lighter fare than the preceding segments. These lighter stories sometimes involved celebrities, sports, and, regularly and somewhere in the middle, the bizarre, in a segment he called \"Oddball.\" Opinions on each were offered by Olbermann and guests interviewed during the segment. Olbermann had been criticized for only having guests that agree with his perspective. Former ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' television critic Howard Rosenberg stated that \"''Countdown'' is more or less an echo chamber in which Olbermann and like-minded bobbleheads nod at each other.\"<ref name=\"Rosenberg2008\" />\n\nOn October 13, 2004, Olbermann launched ''[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6210240 Bloggermann]'', his ''Countdown'' blog, hosted on MSNBC.com.<ref name=\"welcome_to_bloggermann\" /> Olbermann used the open format of the blog to expand on facts or ideas alluded to in the broadcast, to offer personal musings and reactions. However, in February 2007, Olbermann launched a new blog, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20150201181155/http://thenewshole.msnbc.msn.com/default.aspx The News Hole]''.\n\nIn a technique similar to that of former [[CBS News]] anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] in connection to the [[Iran Hostage Crisis]],<ref name=\"Bliss1991\" /> for the last six years of the program, Olbermann closed every show by announcing the number of days passed since President George W. Bush had declared the end of \"major combat operations\" in Iraq under a banner that read \"[[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|Mission Accomplished]]\" (May 1, 2003). Olbermann would then crumple up his notes, throwing them at the camera and saying \"Good night and good luck\", echoing another former CBS newsman, [[Edward R. Murrow]]. (Yet Olbermann himself discounted this gesture to his hero as \"presumptuous\" and a \"feeble tribute.\")<ref name=\"olbermann_murrow\" />\n\nOn February 16, 2007, MSNBC reported that Olbermann had signed a four-year extension on his contract with MSNBC for ''Countdown'' which also provided for his hosting of two ''Countdown'' specials a year to be aired on NBC as well as for his occasional contribution of essays on ''NBC's Nightly News with Brian Williams''.<ref name=\"Ref_k\" />\n\nOlbermann co-anchored, with [[Chris Matthews]], MSNBC's coverage of the death of fellow [[NBC News]] employee [[Tim Russert]] on June 13, 2008.<ref name=\"Elber2008\" /> He presented a tribute, along with several fellow journalists, in honor of Russert.<ref name=\"Ref_l\" />\n\nDuring the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 U.S. presidential election]], Olbermann co-anchored MSNBC's coverage with Chris Matthews until September 7, 2008, when they were replaced by [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] after complaints from both outside and inside of [[NBC]] that they were making partisan statements.<ref name=replaced /> This apparent conflict of interest had been an issue as early as May 2007, when [[Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign, 2008|Giuliani campaign officials]] complained about his serving in dual roles, as both a host and a commentator.<ref name=\"Ref_m\" /> Despite this, ''Countdown'' was broadcast both before and after each of the presidential and vice-presidential debates, and Olbermann and Matthews joined Gregory on MSNBC's Election Day coverage.<ref name=electionnight /> Olbermann and Matthews also led MSNBC's coverage of the inauguration of President [[Barack Obama]].<ref name=inauguration /><ref name=inauguration2 />\n\nIn November 2008, it was announced that Olbermann had signed a four-year contract extension worth an estimated $30 million.<ref name=\"tvnewsernov08\" />\n\n==== Feud with Bill O'Reilly ====\nAfter beginning ''Countdown''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Worst Person in the World\" segment in July 2005, Olbermann repeatedly awarded [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], host of ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' on [[Fox News Channel]], the dubious honor.<ref name=\"niche\" /> The feud between the anchors originated with Olbermann's extensive coverage of a 2004 [[sexual harassment]] suit brought against O'Reilly by former Fox News Channel producer [[Andrea Mackris]] during which Olbermann asked ''Countdown'' viewers to fund the purchase of lurid audio tapes allegedly held by Mackris.<ref name=\"Hagan2004\" /><ref name=\"mackris_lawsuit\" /> In 2008 O'Reilly decided to avoid mentioning Olbermann's name on the air, and once cut off a caller who mentioned Olbermann.<ref name=\"banned\" /> O'Reilly has also criticized MSNBC's news commentary and political coverage without ever specifically mentioning Olbermann.<ref name=\"niche\" /><ref name=\"Ref_2006a\" /><ref name=\"Carpenter\" /> The rivalry continued when in 2006 at Television Critics' Association in California, Olbermann donned a mask of O'Reilly and made a [[Nazi]] salute, leading to a letter of protest from the [[Anti-Defamation League]].<ref name=\"Ref_n\" /><ref name=\"feud boils\" /><ref name=\"Ref_o\" />\n\nIn an article on \"perhaps the fiercest media feud of the decade\", ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} [[Brian Stelter]] noted that in early June 2009 the \"combat\" between the two hosts seemed to have abruptly ended as a result of instructions filtered down to Olbermann and O'Reilly from the chief executives of their respective networks.<ref name=\"Stelter2009\" /> On the August 3, 2009, edition of ''Countdown'', Olbermann asserted that he had made statements to Stelter before the article was published denying that he was a party to such a deal, or that there was such a deal between NBC and Fox News, or that any NBC executive had asked him to change ''Countdown'''s content.

In a ''Countdown'' interview with [[Al Franken]] on October 25, 2005, Olbermann noted that in 2003, after having [[Janeane Garofalo]] and Franken on his show, a vice president of MSNBC had questioned him on inviting \"liberals\" on consecutive nights, contrasting that occurrence to the apparent ideological latitude he enjoyed at the time of the second Franken interview.<ref name=\"Ref_2005\" /> In January 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'''s [[Howard Kurtz]] wrote that Olbermann was \"position[ing] his program as an increasingly [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] alternative to ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''.\"<ref name=\"Kurtz2007\" /> Much of the program featured harsh criticism of prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Right-wing politics|right]]-leaning figures, including those who worked for or supported the [[George W.

Fox News is worse than Al Qaeda \u2014 worse for our society. It's as dangerous as the Ku Klux Klan ever was.\" \n[https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/olbermann-jonah-goldberg-3/]\n\nIn November 2007, British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' placed Olbermann at #67 on their Top 100 list of most influential US liberals. It said that he used his MSNBC show to promote \"an increasingly strident liberal agenda.\" It added that he would be \"a force on the [[political left|Left]] for some time to come.\"<ref name=\"mostinfluential\" /> Avoiding ideological self-labeling, Olbermann described his reporting in 2006 to [[Salon.com]], \"I don't think in these issues that I'm a liberal; I think that I'm an American. I think I'm acting almost as a historian on these particular things\".<ref name=olbermannfactor />\n\nDuring the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, Olbermann frequently chastised presidential aspirant [[Hillary Clinton]] for her campaign tactics against her principal opponent, Senator [[Barack Obama]], and made her the subject of two of his \"special comments\".<ref name=\"Ref_2008c\" /><ref name=\"Ref_2008d\" /> Olbermann has also posted on the liberal blog [[Daily Kos]].<ref name=\"Ref_p\" />\n\nBefore the [[2010 Massachusetts special election]], Olbermann called Republican candidate [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] \"an irresponsible, homophobic, racist, reactionary, ex-nude model, Tea Bagging supporter of violence against women, and against politicians with whom he disagrees\".<ref name=\"roasts\" /> This was criticized by his colleague [[Joe Scarborough]], who called the comments \"reckless\" and \"sad\".<ref name=\"Barr2010\" /> Yael T. Abouhalkah of the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' said that Olbermann \"crossed the line in a major way with his comments\".<ref name=\"Abouhalkah2010\" /> The next night, Olbermann chose to \"double down\", as ''[[The Huffington Post]]'''s Danny Shea described it,<ref name=\"Shea2010\" /> on his criticism of Brown by adding the word \"sexist\" to his original description of the Republican candidate. [[Jon Stewart]] criticized Olbermann about this attack on his show, ''The Daily Show'', by noting that it was \"the harshest description of anyone I've ever heard uttered on MSNBC\". Following Stewart's critique, Olbermann apologized by noting, \"I have been a little over the top lately. Point taken.
