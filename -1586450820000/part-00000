The [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Vladivostok]] is the [[administrative center]] of the krai, as well as the largest city in the Russian Far East. The krai has the largest economy among the federal subjects in the Russian Far East, and a [[list of federal subjects of Russia by population|population]] of&nbsp;1,956,497 as of the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]].<ref name=\"2010Census\">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref>\n\nThe name of the krai is derived from the Russian words \"{{lang|ru|\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439}}\" (''primorsky''), meaning \"littoral\" or \"coastal\", and \"{{lang|ru|\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439}} (''kray''), meaning \"region\" or \"area\". It is informally known as '''Primorye''' ({{lang|ru|\u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435}}, {{IPA-ru|pr\u02b2\u026a\u02c8mor\u02b2j\u026a|IPA}}) in Russian, and is occasionally translated as '''Coastal Territory''' in English. The krai shares Russia's only [[North Korea\u2013Russia border|border with North Korea]], along the [[Tumen River]] in [[Khasansky District]] in the southwestern corner of the krai. [[Peter the Great Gulf]], the largest [[Bay|gulf]] in the [[Sea of Japan]], is located along the south coast.\n\nHistorically part of [[Manchuria]], Primorsky Krai was ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] by [[Qing China]] in 1860 as part of a region known as [[Outer Manchuria]], forming most of the territory of [[Primorskaya Oblast]]. During the [[Russian Civil War]] it became part of the [[Far Eastern Republic]] before joining the [[Soviet Union]], going through numerous changes until reaching its current form in 1938. Primorsky Krai is home to the [[Russian Navy]]'s [[Russian Pacific Fleet]].\n\n==Geography==\n{{Main|Geography of Primorsky Krai}}\n\n*'''Borders length'''&nbsp;\u2014 over {{convert|3000|km|sp=us}}, including {{convert|1350|km|sp=us}} of the sea borders.\n*'''Highest peak'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Anik Mountain]], {{convert|1933|m|sp=us}}\n*'''Railroads length'''&nbsp;\u2014 {{convert|1628|km|sp=us}} (of which {{convert|345|km|sp=us}} are electrified).\n*'''Automobile roads length'''&nbsp;\u2014 {{convert|12633|km|sp=us}}\n\nPrimorsky Krai, bordered by China ([[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]]), North Korea ([[Rason]]), and the relatively warm\u2014although freezing in winter\u2014waters of the [[Sea of Japan]], is the southeasternmost region of Russia, located between the [[42nd parallel north|42\u00b0]] and [[48th parallel north|48\u00b0 north]] latitude and [[130th meridian east|130\u00b0]] and [[139th meridian east|139\u00b0 east]] longitude.

Most of the territory is mountainous, and almost 80% of it is forested. The average elevation is about {{convert|500|m|sp=us}}. [[Sikhote-Alin]] is a mountainous formation, extending for the most part of the Krai. It consists of a number of parallel ranges: the Partizansky (Partisan), the Siny (Blue), the Kholodny (Cold), and others. There are many [[karst]] caves in the South of Primorye. The relatively accessible Spyashchaya Krasavitsa cave (the Sleeping Beauty) in the Ussuriysky Nature Preserve could be recommended for tourists. There are comparatively well-preserved fragments of the ancient volcanoes in the area.\n\nThe ranges are cut by the picturesque narrow and deep valleys of the rivers and by large brooks, such as the [[Partizanskaya River|Partizanskaya]], the [[Kiyevka River|Kiyevka]], the Zerkalnaya, the Cheryomukhovaya, the Yedinka, the [[Samarga River|Samarga]], the [[Bikin River|Bikin]], and the [[Bolshaya Ussurka River|Bolshaya Ussurka]]. Most rivers in the [[Krai]] have rocky bottoms and limpid water. The largest among them is the [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]], with a length of {{convert|903|km|sp=us}}. The head of the [[Ussuri River]] originates {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} to the East of Oblachnaya Mountain. The vast Khanka Lowlands extends into the West and the South-West of Primorye, carpeted by coniferous-deciduous forests. A part of the Lowland surrounding the largest lake in the [[Russian Far East]], [[Khanka Lake]], is occupied by a forest-steppe.\n\n===Coast and islands===\nThe krai's coastline is fairly straight, except for the southern-most section around Vladivostok which contains the [[Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula]].\nThere are numerous islands in this area, the main ones being [[Lisy Island]], Askold Island, [[Putyatin Island]], [[Skrebtsov island]], [[Sibiryakov Island]], the [[Eug\u00e9nie Archipelago]] (the largest island of which being [[Russky Island]]), the [[Rimsky-Korsakov Archipelago]] and [[Furugelm Island]].\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nThe geographic location of Primorye accounts for the variety of its [[flora (plants)|flora]]. The territory of Primorye has not been subjected to the ice cover in the past in contrast to the rest of Siberia during the ice ages. This circumstance, as well as the specifics of the geographical situation and the specific features of climate, determine the unique, diversity of the plant world at species and cenotic levels and the richness of plant resources. In the flora of Primorye there are more than two thousand species of higher plants, of which are about 250 species of trees, bushes and ligneous lianas. Flora of mosses and lichens are very diverse. As part of the coastal flora, there are many valuable medicinal, technical and food plants, many relict and endemic species. About 200 species are listed in the IUCN Red List as rare and threatened extermination.\n\nThere are mountainous tundra areas, conifers and coniferous-deciduous forests, and forest-steppe, which is sometimes called the Far Eastern Prairie, where many ancient plant species have been preserved, including [[fern]]s, [[nelumbo|lotus]], and the ''[[Chosenia]]'' willow. The flora of the territory contains such plants as ''[[Taxus cuspidata]]'', ''[[Juniperus rigida]]'', ''[[Phellodendron amurense]]'', ''[[Kalopanax]]'', ''[[Aralia elata]]'', ''[[Maackia amurensis]]'', ''[[Alnus japonica]]'', ''[[Actinidia kolomikta]]'', ''[[Schisandra chinensis]]'', ''[[Celastrus orbiculatus]]'', ''[[Thladiantha dubia]]'', ''[[Weigela]]'', ''[[Eleutherococcus]]'', ''[[Flueggea suffruticosa]]'', ''[[Deutzia]]'', ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', ''Betula schmidtii'', ''Carpinus cordata'', ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'', ''[[Parthenocissus tricuspidata]]'', ''[[Vitis amurensis]]'', ''[[Panax ginseng]]'' and many others.\n\nThe [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] of Primorye is also diverse. The following animals are found in the [[Krai]]: [[Ussuri black bear]] (''Ursus thibetanus''), [[Amur tiger]], [[Amur leopard]] (Panthera pardus orientalis), [[Eurasian lynx]] (Lynx lynx), [[wild boar]] (Sus scrofa), [[Manchurian deer]] (''Cervus elaphus xanthopygos''), [[Siberian roe deer]] (Capreolus pygargus), [[musk deer]] (Moschus moschiferus), [[long-tailed goral]] (''Naemorhedus caudatus''), [[sika deer]] (Cervus nippon), [[sable]] (Martes zibellina), [[Blakiston's fish owl]] (Bubo blakistoni), [[mandarinka duck]] (''Aix galericulata''), [[black stork]] (''Ciconia nigra''), [[scaly goosander]] (''Mergus squamatus''), [[chestnut-cheeked starling]] (''Sturnia philippensis''), [[black griffon]] (''Aegypius monachus''), large-winged cuckoo (''[[Cuculidae]]'' family), and others. Among 690 species of birds inhabiting the territory of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]], 350 are found in Primorye. Rich fisheries of [[salmon]], [[Hucho taimen]], [[lenok]] and marine fisheries of crab, pollock and other species make the aquatic and maritime environment a valuable resource for the region. However, the rich diversity of wildlife in Primorye is threatened by poaching and the illegal [[wildlife trade]].

After Balhae was conquered by the Khitans, the territory became part of Liao Dynasty's Eastern Circuit and Jin Dynasty's Supin Circuit. It then came under the Mongol and Manchu rule. \n\nThe acquisition of [[Siberia]] by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and the subsequent Russian expansion to the Far East brought the Russians into direct contact with [[Qing dynasty|China]]. The [[Nerchinsk Treaty]] of 1689 demarcating the borders of the two states gave all lands lying south of the [[Stanovoy Mountains]], including Primorye, to the Qing Empire. However, with the weakening of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]]{{explain|date=October 2015}} in the second half of the 19th century, Russia began its expansion into the area. In 1858, the towns of [[Khabarovsk]] and [[Blagoveshchensk]] were founded. In 1858, [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky]] signed the [[Aigun Treaty]] with China, followed by the [[Convention of Peking|Beijing Treaty]] two years later. As a result of the two treaties, the Sino\u2013Russian border shifted south to the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri River]]s, granting Russia full control of Primorye.\n\n[[Primorskaya Oblast]] was established as the easternmost division of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1856. It included the territory of modern Primorsky Krai as well as the territories of modern [[Khabarovsk Krai]] and [[Magadan Oblast]], stretching from Vladivostok to the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] in the far north.\n\nIn the period from 1859 to 1882, ninety-five settlements were established in the Primorye region, including Vladivostok, [[Ussuriysk]], Razdolnoye, Vladimiro-Aleksandrovskoye, [[Shkotovo]], [[Pokrovka, Oktyabrsky District, Primorsky Krai|Pokrovka]], Tury Rog, and [[Kamen-Rybolov]]. The population was primarily engaged in hunting, fishing and cultivation. More than two-thirds of the territory's inhabitants followed these occupations.\n[[File:Primorskaya Oblast CoA.png|thumb|left|Coat of arms of Primorskaya Oblast in the beginning of the 20th century]]\n\nDuring the latter part of the 19th century, there was significant resource, industrial and resulting economic development in Primorye. Coal mining became a prominent industry, as did the export of [[Seakale|sea-kale]], [[velvet antler]]s, [[timber]], [[crab]], [[dried fish]], and [[Sea cucumber (food)|trepangs]]. The rapid economic expansion of Primorye was financed in large measure by Russian and foreign capital investment.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution and the victory of the communists, the new government renamed Primorskaya Oblast as the [[Zemstvo of Maritime Territory]]. It was defined as the [[Far-Eastern Republic]] (1920\u20131922). Within the [[Russian SFSR]], this became Far-Eastern Oblast (1922\u20131926) and then Far-Eastern Krai (1926\u20131938).\n\nThe area became a battleground for allied and Bolshevik troops during the [[Siberian Intervention]]. In 1922, shortly before the end of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], Primorye came under Bolshevik control. The new government directed the economic, scientific, and cultural development of the territory. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet Government]] spent the following ten years combating \"bourgeois ideology\" in many areas of life and culture. As a result, the music, theater, literature, and the fine arts of Primorye were censored.\n\nPrimorsky was the center of the ethnic Korean minority of Russia. The Pos'et Korean National Raion was created under the policy of [[korenizatsiya]]. The Krai had 105 both fully and mixed Korean towns where residents used the Korean language as an official language. Nearly 200,000 ethnic Koreans were living in the Krai by the time of their [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union|deportation in 1938]].<ref name=\"Pohl10\">{{harvnb|Pohl|1999|p=10}}</ref> The Soviet Union had earlier deported ethnic Chinese from western Siberia.\n\nDuring this period, the Soviet government emphasized [[planned economy|centralized planning]] of the economy. As in the rest of the Soviet Union, priority was given to heavy industry, with a special emphasis on mining and commercial fishing. There was widespread investment in construction of rail and sea transit, and new port facilities were constructed.\n\nPrimorsky Krai was formed by further subdivision of Far-Eastern Krai in 1938, as part of the Stalin-era policy of \"unbundling\". Primorsky Krai, as defined in 1938, corresponds to the northeastern part of the historical region of [[Outer Manchuria]].\n\nOn April 18, 1942, the region became accidentally involved in [[World War II]], which the United States had entered after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Primorsky Krai was the location where one of 16 [[United States Army Air Corps]] [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s landed. The group had been launched from [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS ''Hornet'']] to carry out the [[Doolittle Raid]] on [[Japan]]. Japan and the Soviet Union were not then at war. The landing occurred 40 miles (65&nbsp;km) west of Vladivostok; the bomber's crew could not return to their base, the aircraft carrier ''Hornet,'' by the mission plan.<ref>See the article on the [[Doolittle Raid#The Raid|Doolittle Raid]].</ref>  The crew later returned home via [[Iran]].\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Soviet Union expanded scientific institutions in Primorye, especially in the city of [[Vladivostok]]. Several large research institutions are located here, such as the Institute of Biology and Agriculture, the Pacific Institute of Bio-organic Chemistry, the Institute of Marine Biology, the Pacific Institute of Geography, the Pacific Oceanological Institute, as well as several Institutes affiliated with the [[Russian Academy of Science|Far Eastern Division of the Russian Academy of Science]].\n\nBy the early 1990s, once-small enterprises in the city had developed into large companies. Some of the most prominent include the [[Far Eastern Shipping Company|DVMP]] (FESCO) shipping company, the Dalmoreprodukt {{clarify span|seafood concern|date=May 2014}}, Progress [[Arsenyev]] Aircraft Works, and Vostok Mining. Commercial fishing plays an important part in the economy of the Primorye and includes firms like Vladivostok Trawling and Refrigerating Fleet (VBTRF), the Active Marine Fisheries Base of [[Nakhodka]], and the Fishing and Marine Transport Fleet of Primorye. Numerous enterprises of the [[Defense industry of Russia|Russian military industrial complex]] were also established in Primorye.\n\nThe [[Udege people]], led by [[Pavel Sulyandziga]] trying to gain control over their traditional territories along the [[Bikin River]] and in particular a [[Territory of Traditional Natural Resource Use]] of federal status.<ref name=cerd>[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/RU/RAIPON_IWGIA_RUS_UPR_S4_2009anx_Indigenous_Peoples_Russia_RAIPON_INFOE_2008.pdf Discrimination against indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East of the Russian Federation].

After 1991, the head of the Oblast administration and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].\n\nThe Charter of Primorsky Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Legislative Assembly of Primorsky Krai]] is the province's [[regional parliaments of Russia|regional]] standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the krai Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of Primorsky Krai}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Category see also|Companies based in Primorsky Krai}}\n[[File:John Deere Combine in Russia.jpg|thumb]]\nPrimorsky Krai's economy, the most balanced in the Russian Far East,{{fact|date=October 2018}} is also the largest in absolute terms.

Second is [[machine building]], where half of the output is geared toward the [[fishing industry]] and [[shipyard]]s. [[Defense industry of Russia|Defense]] is another important sector, producing naval vessels and military [[aircraft]]. The [[construction]] materials industry here provides for the whole Russian Far East. Lead smelting is conducted in [[Rudnaya Pristan]] on the coast.\n\nThe [[timber]] industry, though in [[recession]],{{when|date=October 2018}} is still second only to [[Khabarovsk Krai]]'s with an annual yield of about 3 million cubic meters of [[timber]]. Primorsky Krai is the largest [[coal]] producer in the Russian Far East and generates more [[electricity]] than any other Russian Far East administrative division, but power shortages are common. [[Agriculture]] is also important; the krai produces rice, milk, eggs, and vegetables.\n\nPrimorsky Krai is the Russian Far East's [[banking]] and [[finance]] center.

[[Peter the Great Gulf]], the largest [[Bay|gulf]] in the [[Sea of Japan]], is located along the south coast.\n\nHistorically part of [[Manchuria]], Primorsky Krai was ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] by [[Qing China]] in 1860 as part of a region known as [[Outer Manchuria]], forming most of the territory of [[Primorskaya Oblast]]. During the [[Russian Civil War]] it became part of the [[Far Eastern Republic]] before joining the [[Soviet Union]], going through numerous changes until reaching its current form in 1938.

Most of the territory is mountainous, and almost 80% of it is forested. The average elevation is about {{convert|500|m|sp=us}}. [[Sikhote-Alin]] is a mountainous formation, extending for the most part of the Krai. It consists of a number of parallel ranges: the Partizansky (Partisan), the Siny (Blue), the Kholodny (Cold), and others. There are many [[karst]] caves in the South of Primorye. The relatively accessible Spyashchaya Krasavitsa cave (the Sleeping Beauty) in the Ussuriysky Nature Preserve could be recommended for tourists. There are comparatively well-preserved fragments of the ancient volcanoes in the area.\n\nThe ranges are cut by the picturesque narrow and deep valleys of the rivers and by large brooks, such as the [[Partizanskaya River|Partizanskaya]], the [[Kiyevka River|Kiyevka]], the Zerkalnaya, the Cheryomukhovaya, the Yedinka, the [[Samarga River|Samarga]], the [[Bikin River|Bikin]], and the [[Bolshaya Ussurka River|Bolshaya Ussurka]]. Most rivers in the [[Krai]] have rocky bottoms and limpid water. The largest among them is the [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]], with a length of {{convert|903|km|sp=us}}. The head of the [[Ussuri River]] originates {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} to the East of Oblachnaya Mountain. The vast Khanka Lowlands extends into the West and the South-West of Primorye, carpeted by coniferous-deciduous forests. A part of the Lowland surrounding the largest lake in the [[Russian Far East]], [[Khanka Lake]], is occupied by a forest-steppe.\n\n===Coast and islands===\nThe krai's coastline is fairly straight, except for the southern-most section around Vladivostok which contains the [[Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula]].\nThere are numerous islands in this area, the main ones being [[Lisy Island]], Askold Island, [[Putyatin Island]], [[Skrebtsov island]], [[Sibiryakov Island]], the [[Eug\u00e9nie Archipelago]] (the largest island of which being [[Russky Island]]), the [[Rimsky-Korsakov Archipelago]] and [[Furugelm Island]].\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nThe geographic location of Primorye accounts for the variety of its [[flora (plants)|flora]]. The territory of Primorye has not been subjected to the ice cover in the past in contrast to the rest of Siberia during the ice ages. This circumstance, as well as the specifics of the geographical situation and the specific features of climate, determine the unique, diversity of the plant world at species and cenotic levels and the richness of plant resources. In the flora of Primorye there are more than two thousand species of higher plants, of which are about 250 species of trees, bushes and ligneous lianas. Flora of mosses and lichens are very diverse. As part of the coastal flora, there are many valuable medicinal, technical and food plants, many relict and endemic species. About 200 species are listed in the IUCN Red List as rare and threatened extermination.\n\nThere are mountainous tundra areas, conifers and coniferous-deciduous forests, and forest-steppe, which is sometimes called the Far Eastern Prairie, where many ancient plant species have been preserved, including [[fern]]s, [[nelumbo|lotus]], and the ''[[Chosenia]]'' willow. The flora of the territory contains such plants as ''[[Taxus cuspidata]]'', ''[[Juniperus rigida]]'', ''[[Phellodendron amurense]]'', ''[[Kalopanax]]'', ''[[Aralia elata]]'', ''[[Maackia amurensis]]'', ''[[Alnus japonica]]'', ''[[Actinidia kolomikta]]'', ''[[Schisandra chinensis]]'', ''[[Celastrus orbiculatus]]'', ''[[Thladiantha dubia]]'', ''[[Weigela]]'', ''[[Eleutherococcus]]'', ''[[Flueggea suffruticosa]]'', ''[[Deutzia]]'', ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', ''Betula schmidtii'', ''Carpinus cordata'', ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'', ''[[Parthenocissus tricuspidata]]'', ''[[Vitis amurensis]]'', ''[[Panax ginseng]]'' and many others.\n\nThe [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] of Primorye is also diverse. The following animals are found in the [[Krai]]: [[Ussuri black bear]] (''Ursus thibetanus''), [[Amur tiger]], [[Amur leopard]] (Panthera pardus orientalis), [[Eurasian lynx]] (Lynx lynx), [[wild boar]] (Sus scrofa), [[Manchurian deer]] (''Cervus elaphus xanthopygos''), [[Siberian roe deer]] (Capreolus pygargus), [[musk deer]] (Moschus moschiferus), [[long-tailed goral]] (''Naemorhedus caudatus''), [[sika deer]] (Cervus nippon), [[sable]] (Martes zibellina), [[Blakiston's fish owl]] (Bubo blakistoni), [[mandarinka duck]] (''Aix galericulata''), [[black stork]] (''Ciconia nigra''), [[scaly goosander]] (''Mergus squamatus''), [[chestnut-cheeked starling]] (''Sturnia philippensis''), [[black griffon]] (''Aegypius monachus''), large-winged cuckoo (''[[Cuculidae]]'' family), and others. Among 690 species of birds inhabiting the territory of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]], 350 are found in Primorye. Rich fisheries of [[salmon]], [[Hucho taimen]], [[lenok]] and marine fisheries of crab, pollock and other species make the aquatic and maritime environment a valuable resource for the region. However, the rich diversity of wildlife in Primorye is threatened by poaching and the illegal [[wildlife trade]]. [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[Wild Salmon Center]], and Russian NGOs including [[Phoenix Fund]] are active in the region's wildlife and habitat conservation.\n[[File:Tiger-zoologie.de0001 22.JPG|thumb|right|Most of the world's population of wild [[Siberian tiger]]s is found in Primorsky Krai]]\n\n[[File:Brat i sestra nakhodka.jpg|thumb|right|The cliffs Brat (\"Brother\") and Sestra (\"Sister\") in the environs of Nakhodka.]]\n\n===Climate===\n*Average annual temperature&nbsp;\u2014 near {{convert|+1|C}} in the north of the krai; {{convert|+5.5|C}} on the southern coast.{{fact|date=July 2018}}{{vague|date=July 2018}}\n*Average annual [[precipitation]]&nbsp;\u2014 600\u2013850&nbsp;mm.{{fact|date=July 2018}}{{vague|date=July 2018}}\n\n==History==\n{{cleanup-rewrite|date=January 2015}}\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}\n{{cleanup section|reason=particularly wrt industry section|date=May 2014}}\n{{Further|History of the Russian Far East|History of Manchuria|Outer Manchuria}}\nThe area was settled by several Tungusic and Turkic tribes, such as the [[Sushen]], the proto-Mongol Shiwei and the [[Mohe people|Mohe]]. \nThe [[Udege people]] are said to have traditionally settled in territories along the [[Bikin River]] long ago, however, they are possibly of Jianzhou Jurchen origin.<ref name=cerd>[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/RU/RAIPON_IWGIA_RUS_UPR_S4_2009anx_Indigenous_Peoples_Russia_RAIPON_INFOE_2008.pdf Discrimination against indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East of the Russian Federation].

After Balhae was conquered by the Khitans, the territory became part of Liao Dynasty's Eastern Circuit and Jin Dynasty's Supin Circuit. It then came under the Mongol and Manchu rule. \n\nThe acquisition of [[Siberia]] by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and the subsequent Russian expansion to the Far East brought the Russians into direct contact with [[Qing dynasty|China]]. The [[Nerchinsk Treaty]] of 1689 demarcating the borders of the two states gave all lands lying south of the [[Stanovoy Mountains]], including Primorye, to the Qing Empire. However, with the weakening of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]]{{explain|date=October 2015}} in the second half of the 19th century, Russia began its expansion into the area. In 1858, the towns of [[Khabarovsk]] and [[Blagoveshchensk]] were founded. In 1858, [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky]] signed the [[Aigun Treaty]] with China, followed by the [[Convention of Peking|Beijing Treaty]] two years later. As a result of the two treaties, the Sino\u2013Russian border shifted south to the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri River]]s, granting Russia full control of Primorye.\n\n[[Primorskaya Oblast]] was established as the easternmost division of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1856. It included the territory of modern Primorsky Krai as well as the territories of modern [[Khabarovsk Krai]] and [[Magadan Oblast]], stretching from Vladivostok to the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] in the far north.\n\nIn the period from 1859 to 1882, ninety-five settlements were established in the Primorye region, including Vladivostok, [[Ussuriysk]], Razdolnoye, Vladimiro-Aleksandrovskoye, [[Shkotovo]], [[Pokrovka, Oktyabrsky District, Primorsky Krai|Pokrovka]], Tury Rog, and [[Kamen-Rybolov]]. The population was primarily engaged in hunting, fishing and cultivation. More than two-thirds of the territory's inhabitants followed these occupations.\n[[File:Primorskaya Oblast CoA.png|thumb|left|Coat of arms of Primorskaya Oblast in the beginning of the 20th century]]\n\nDuring the latter part of the 19th century, there was significant resource, industrial and resulting economic development in Primorye. Coal mining became a prominent industry, as did the export of [[Seakale|sea-kale]], [[velvet antler]]s, [[timber]], [[crab]], [[dried fish]], and [[Sea cucumber (food)|trepangs]]. The rapid economic expansion of Primorye was financed in large measure by Russian and foreign capital investment.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution and the victory of the communists, the new government renamed Primorskaya Oblast as the [[Zemstvo of Maritime Territory]]. It was defined as the [[Far-Eastern Republic]] (1920\u20131922). Within the [[Russian SFSR]], this became Far-Eastern Oblast (1922\u20131926) and then Far-Eastern Krai (1926\u20131938).\n\nThe area became a battleground for allied and Bolshevik troops during the [[Siberian Intervention]]. In 1922, shortly before the end of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], Primorye came under Bolshevik control. The new government directed the economic, scientific, and cultural development of the territory. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet Government]] spent the following ten years combating \"bourgeois ideology\" in many areas of life and culture. As a result, the music, theater, literature, and the fine arts of Primorye were censored.\n\nPrimorsky was the center of the ethnic Korean minority of Russia. The Pos'et Korean National Raion was created under the policy of [[korenizatsiya]]. The Krai had 105 both fully and mixed Korean towns where residents used the Korean language as an official language. Nearly 200,000 ethnic Koreans were living in the Krai by the time of their [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union|deportation in 1938]].<ref name=\"Pohl10\">{{harvnb|Pohl|1999|p=10}}</ref> The Soviet Union had earlier deported ethnic Chinese from western Siberia.\n\nDuring this period, the Soviet government emphasized [[planned economy|centralized planning]] of the economy. As in the rest of the Soviet Union, priority was given to heavy industry, with a special emphasis on mining and commercial fishing. There was widespread investment in construction of rail and sea transit, and new port facilities were constructed.\n\nPrimorsky Krai was formed by further subdivision of Far-Eastern Krai in 1938, as part of the Stalin-era policy of \"unbundling\". Primorsky Krai, as defined in 1938, corresponds to the northeastern part of the historical region of [[Outer Manchuria]].\n\nOn April 18, 1942, the region became accidentally involved in [[World War II]], which the United States had entered after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Primorsky Krai was the location where one of 16 [[United States Army Air Corps]] [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s landed. The group had been launched from [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS ''Hornet'']] to carry out the [[Doolittle Raid]] on [[Japan]]. Japan and the Soviet Union were not then at war. The landing occurred 40 miles (65&nbsp;km) west of Vladivostok; the bomber's crew could not return to their base, the aircraft carrier ''Hornet,'' by the mission plan.<ref>See the article on the [[Doolittle Raid#The Raid|Doolittle Raid]].</ref>  The crew later returned home via [[Iran]].\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Soviet Union expanded scientific institutions in Primorye, especially in the city of [[Vladivostok]]. Several large research institutions are located here, such as the Institute of Biology and Agriculture, the Pacific Institute of Bio-organic Chemistry, the Institute of Marine Biology, the Pacific Institute of Geography, the Pacific Oceanological Institute, as well as several Institutes affiliated with the [[Russian Academy of Science|Far Eastern Division of the Russian Academy of Science]].\n\nBy the early 1990s, once-small enterprises in the city had developed into large companies. Some of the most prominent include the [[Far Eastern Shipping Company|DVMP]] (FESCO) shipping company, the Dalmoreprodukt {{clarify span|seafood concern|date=May 2014}}, Progress [[Arsenyev]] Aircraft Works, and Vostok Mining. Commercial fishing plays an important part in the economy of the Primorye and includes firms like Vladivostok Trawling and Refrigerating Fleet (VBTRF), the Active Marine Fisheries Base of [[Nakhodka]], and the Fishing and Marine Transport Fleet of Primorye. Numerous enterprises of the [[Defense industry of Russia|Russian military industrial complex]] were also established in Primorye.\n\nThe [[Udege people]], led by [[Pavel Sulyandziga]] trying to gain control over their traditional territories along the [[Bikin River]] and in particular a [[Territory of Traditional Natural Resource Use]] of federal status.<ref name=cerd>[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/RU/RAIPON_IWGIA_RUS_UPR_S4_2009anx_Indigenous_Peoples_Russia_RAIPON_INFOE_2008.pdf Discrimination against indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East of the Russian Federation].

After 1991, the head of the Oblast administration and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].\n\nThe Charter of Primorsky Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Legislative Assembly of Primorsky Krai]] is the province's [[regional parliaments of Russia|regional]] standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the krai Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of Primorsky Krai}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Category see also|Companies based in Primorsky Krai}}\n[[File:John Deere Combine in Russia.jpg|thumb]]\nPrimorsky Krai's economy, the most balanced in the Russian Far East,{{fact|date=October 2018}} is also the largest in absolute terms.

The commercial deposits of coal are connected to the Partizansky and Razdolnensky coal basins, the Podgorodnensky deposit, the Uglovsky basin, and the Shkotovsky, Pavlovsky, Bikinsky, Rettikhovsky, and Suputinsky deposits.\n\n'''Partizansky Basin''': The city of [[Partizansk]] is located in the southern part of the basin. The total area of the basin is {{convert|6,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The basin has been known since the 19th century and has been explored since 1902. Five coal-bearing regions\u2014Staropartizansky, Melnikovsky, Belopadinsky, Molchanovsky, and Sergeyevsky\u2014are within the limits of the basin. The coal is [[hard coal]]. By the output of volatile substances and caking ability, rich coals prevail. The reserves of coal in the basin total 193.6 million [[tonne]]s. The deposits are maintained by the mines of the Partizanskugol Association. A coal-mining factory also operates in this area.\n\n'''Razdolnensky Basin''': The total area of this basin is about {{convert|4,500|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The basin is located to the north and the west of the city of [[Ussuriysk]]. The basin includes the following deposits: Ussuriysky, Lipovetsky, Verkhne-Razdolnensky, Konstantinovsky, and Alekseye-Nikolsky. The deposits were prospected as early as 1868. The mining of coal has been conducted since 1909. The coal is hard coal. By the output of volatile substances and caking ability, long-flame coals prevail. The reserves of coal in the basin total 66.7 million tons. The deposits are maintained by the mines and the open-pit coal mines of the Lipovetskoye Mine Administration.\n\n'''Uglovsky Basin''': Located {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vladivostok]], the basin's band extends about {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northeast of [[Amursky Bay]] and ranges from {{convert|6|to|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} in width. Coals in the basin have been known since 1859. The mining of coal has been executed since 1867 in the Tavrichansky deposit, and since 1911 in the Artyomovsky deposit. The coal is [[brown coal]], which is used as a power fuel. In the long years of operation the stocks of coal in the basin have been considerably depleted. The reserves of coal in the basin total 233.7 million tons. The mines of the Tavrichansky Mine Administration and the Artyomugol Association operate on the basis of the deposits.\n\n'''Podgrodnensko-Surazhevsky''':  This coal-bearing region is located close to [[Vladivostok]]. The stocks of the Podgrodnensky deposit are estimated to be a total of 19.6 million tons. The coal is [[hard coal]]. By the output of volatile substances and caking ability, the coal is hard (non-bituminous). The deposits are maintained by the Podgorodenka mine of the Artyomugol Association.\n\nThe '''Paleogene-Neogene deposits''' of Primorsky Krai are the Bikinsky, Pavlovsky, Shkotovsky, Rettikhovsky, Rakovsky, and Khasansky deposits. The deposits are the major sources of fuel for the largest heat and power stations of Primorye: Luchegorskaya and Vladivostokskaya. The coal is [[brown coal]].\n\nThe '''Bikinsky Deposit''' is the largest [[brown coal]] deposit in Primorsky Krai. Its total area is {{convert|260|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

The defeat of Carthaginian forces by [[Scipio Africanus]] in Eastern Hispania allowed the pacification of the west, led by Consul [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus]]. Decimus obtained the alliance of [[Olisipo|Olissipo]] (which sent men to fight alongside the Roman Legions against the northwestern Celtic tribes) by integrating it into the empire, as the ''Municipium Cives Romanorum Felicitas Julia''. Local authorities were granted self-rule over a territory that extended {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=off}}; exempt from taxes, its citizens were given the privileges of Roman citizenship,<ref name=\"Livermore1973\" /> and it was then integrated with the Roman province of [[Lusitania]] (whose capital was [[Emerita Augusta]]).\n\n[[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] raids and rebellions during Roman occupation required the construction of a wall around the settlement. During [[Augustus]]' reign, the Romans also built a great theatre; the Cassian Baths (underneath ''Rua da Prata''); temples to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Cybele]], [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and Idea [[Phrygia]]e (an uncommon cult from [[Asia Minor]]), in addition to temples to the Emperor; a large [[necropolis]] under ''[[Pra\u00e7a da Figueira]]''; a large forum and other buildings such as [[insula (building)|insulae]] (multi-storied apartment buildings) in the area between Castle Hill and the historic city core. Many of these ruins were first unearthed during the mid-18th century (when the recent discovery of [[Pompeii]] made Roman archaeology fashionable among Europe's upper classes).\n\nThe city prospered as [[piracy]] was eliminated and technological advances were introduced, consequently ''Felicitas Julia'' became a center of trade with the Roman provinces of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] (particularly [[Cornwall]]) and the [[Rhine]]. Economically strong, Olissipo was known for its [[garum]] (a fish sauce highly prized by the elites of the empire and exported in [[amphora]]e to Rome), wine, salt, and horse-breeding, while Roman culture permeated the hinterland. The city was connected by a broad road to Western Hispania's two other large cities, [[Bracara Augusta]] in the province of [[Tarraconensis]] (Portuguese [[Braga]]), and [[Emerita Augusta]], the capital of [[Lusitania]]. The city was ruled by an [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] council dominated by two families, the Julii and the Cassiae, although regional authority was administered by the Roman Governor of Emerita or directly by Emperor [[Tiberius]]. Among the majority of [[Latin]] speakers lived a large minority of Greek traders and slaves.\n\nOlissipo, like most great cities in the Western Empire, was a center for the dissemination of Christianity. Its first attested [[Patriarch of Lisbon|Bishop]] was Potamius (c. 356), and there were several [[martyr]]s during the period of persecution of the Christians: [[Holy Martyrs of Lisbon|Verissimus, Maxima, and Julia]] are the most significant examples. By the time of the [[Fall of Rome]], Olissipo had become a notable Christian center.\n\n{{wide image|CastleSaintGeorge.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|[[S\u00e3o Jorge Castle]] and the surrounding neighborhoods of [[Castelo (Lisbon)|Castelo]], Mouraria, and [[Alfama]].}}\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nFollowing the disintegration of the Western Roman Empire there were [[barbarian]] invasions; between 409 and 429 the city was occupied successively by [[Sarmatian]]s, [[Alans]] and [[Vandals]]. The Germanic [[Suebi]], who established a kingdom in [[Gallaecia]] (modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern Portugal), with its capital in ''Bracara Augusta'', also controlled the region of Lisbon until 585. In 585, the Suebi Kingdom was integrated into the Germanic [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Kingdom of Toledo, which comprised all of the Iberian Peninsula: Lisbon was then called ''Ulishbona''.\n\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align  = left\n | image1 = Siege of Lisbon (2).tif\n | image2 = Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg\n | footer = King [[Afonso Henriques]] reconquered the city from the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid Empire]] at the 1147 [[Siege of Lisbon]]. }}\n\nOn 6 August 711, Lisbon was taken by [[Moors|Muslim]] forces. These conquerors, who were mostly [[Berber people|Berbers]] and [[Arab]]s from [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], built many mosques and houses, rebuilt the city wall (known as the ''Cerca Moura'') and established administrative control, while permitting the diverse population ([[Muladi]], [[Mozarabs]], [[Berber people|Berbers]], [[Arabs]], [[Jews]], ''[[Zanj]]'' and ''[[Saqaliba]]'') to maintain their socio-cultural lifestyles. [[Mozarabic]] was the native language spoken by most of the Christian population although Arabic was widely known as spoken by all religious communities. Islam was the official religion practised by the Arabs, Berbers, Zanj, Saqaliba and [[Muladi]] ([[muwallad]]un).\n\nThe Muslim influence is still visible in the [[Alfama]] district, an old quarter of Lisbon that survived the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]: many place-names are derived from Arabic and the Alfama (the oldest existing district of Lisbon) was derived from the Arabic \"''al-hamma''{{-\"}}.\n\nFor a brief time Lisbon was an independent Muslim kingdom known as the [[Taifa of Lisbon]] (1022\u20131094), before being conquered by the larger [[Taifa of Badajoz]].\n\nIn 1108 Lisbon was raided and occupied by [[Norway|Norwegian]] crusaders led by [[Sigurd I of Norway|Sigurd I]] on their way to the [[Holy Land]] as part of the [[Norwegian Crusade]] and occupied by crusader forces for three years.<ref>Pires, Helio. \"Sigur\u0111r's Attack on Lisbon: Where Exactly?\" In ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'' 8 (2012) \u2013 Turnhout, Belgium : Brepols Publishers, c = 2012, pp. 199\u2013205.</ref> It was taken by the Moorish [[Almoravids]] in 1111.\n\n[[File:Siege of Lisbon 1384.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Siege of Lisbon (1384)|1384 Siege of Lisbon]] in [[Froissart's Chronicles]].]]\n\nIn 1147, as part of the ''[[Reconquista]]'', crusader knights led by [[Afonso I of Portugal]] [[Siege of Lisbon|besieged and reconquered Lisbon]]. The city, with around 154,000 residents at the time, was returned to Christian rule. The reconquest of Portugal and re-establishment of [[Christianity]] is one of the most significant events in Lisbon's history, described in the chronicle ''[[Expugnatione Lyxbonensi]]'', which describes, among other incidents, how the local bishop was killed by the crusaders and the city's residents prayed to the [[Virgin Mary]] as it happened. Some of the Muslim residents converted to Roman Catholicism and most of those who did not convert fled to other parts of the Islamic world, primarily [[Muslim Spain]] and [[North Africa]]. All mosques were either completely destroyed or converted into churches. As a result of the end of Muslim rule, spoken Arabic quickly lost its place in the everyday life of the city and disappeared altogether.\n\nWith its central location, Lisbon became the capital city of the new Portuguese territory in 1255.\nThe first Portuguese university was founded in Lisbon in 1290 by King [[Dinis I of Portugal|Denis I]]; for many years the ''[[Studium Generale]]'' (''General Study'') was transferred intermittently to [[Coimbra]], where it was installed permanently in the 16th century as the [[University of Coimbra]].\n\nIn 1384, the city was besieged by King [[Juan I of Castille]], as a part of the ongoing [[1383\u20131385 Crisis]]. The result of the siege was a victory for the Portuguese led by [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]].\n\nDuring the last centuries of the Middle Ages, the city expanded substantially and became an important trading post with both [[Northern Europe]]an and Mediterranean cities.\n\n=== Early Modern ===\n[[File:Lisboa 1500-1510.jpg|thumb|left|The oldest known image of Lisbon (1500\u20131510) from the ''Cr\u00f3nica de Dom Afonso Henriques'' by Duarte Galv\u00e3o]]\n\nMost of the Portuguese expeditions of the [[Age of Discovery]] left Lisbon during the period from the end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century, including [[Vasco da Gama]]'s expedition to [[India]] in 1498.

This period saw the rise of the exuberant [[Manueline]] style in architecture, which left its mark in many 16th-century monuments (including Lisbon's [[Bel\u00e9m Tower]] and [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], which were declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]).

The [[Portuguese Restoration War]], which began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] organised by the nobility and [[bourgeois]]ie in Lisbon and executed on 1 December 1640, restored Portuguese independence. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare until the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 1668.\n\nIn the early 18th century, gold from Brazil allowed [[John V of Portugal|King John V]] to sponsor the building of several [[Baroque]] churches and theatres in the city.

[[Voltaire]] wrote a long poem, ''Po\u00eame sur le d\u00e9sastre de Lisbonne'', shortly after the quake, and mentioned it in his 1759 novel ''[[Candide]]'' (indeed, many argue that this critique of [[optimism]] was inspired by that earthquake). [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] also mentions it in his 1857 poem, ''The Deacon's Masterpiece, or The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay.''\n\nAfter the 1755 earthquake, the city was rebuilt largely according to the plans of Prime Minister [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo]], the [[Marquis of Pombal|1st Marquis of Pombal]]; the lower town began to be known as the ''Baixa Pombalina'' ([[Pombaline Lower Town|Pombaline central district]]). Instead of rebuilding the medieval town, Pombal decided to demolish what remained after the earthquake and rebuild the city centre in accordance with principles of modern urban design. It was reconstructed in an open rectangular plan with two great squares: the ''[[Pra\u00e7a do Rossio]]'' and the ''[[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]]''. The first, the central commercial district, is the traditional gathering place of the city and the location of the older caf\u00e9s, theatres and restaurants; the second became the city's main access to the River Tagus and point of departure and arrival for seagoing vessels, adorned by a triumphal arch (1873) and monument to King [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]].\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Proclama\u00e7\u00e3o Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa.jpg|thumb|right|The [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Portuguese Republic]] in 1910.]]\n\nIn the first years of the 19th century, Portugal was invaded by the troops of [[Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], forcing Queen [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]] and Prince-Regent [[John VI of Portugal|John]] (future John VI) to flee temporarily to Brazil. By the time the new King returned to Lisbon, many of the buildings and properties were pillaged, sacked or destroyed by the invaders.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Liberal movement introduced new changes into the urban landscape. The principal areas were in the ''Baixa'' and along the ''Chiado'' district, where shops, tobacconists shops, caf\u00e9s, bookstores, clubs and theatres proliferated. The development of industry and commerce determined the growth of the city, seeing the transformation of the [[Passeio P\u00fablico (Lisbon)|Passeio P\u00fablico]], a Pombaline era park, into the [[Avenida da Liberdade]], as the city grew farther from the Tagus.\n\nLisbon was the site of the [[Lisbon Regicide|regicide]] of [[Carlos I of Portugal]] in 1908, an event which culminated two years later in the establishment of the First Republic.\n[[File:Lisbon, the Pal\u00e1cio Nacional da Ajuda.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Palace of Ajuda]] was built as a residence for the [[King of Portugal]] following the [[1755 Lisbon Earthquake]].]]\n[[File:Teatro Dona Maria II (2.\u00aa metade do s\u00e9c.

Maria II National Theatre|Queen Maria II National Theatre]] was built in 1842.]]\nThe city refounded its university in 1911 after centuries of inactivity in Lisbon, incorporating reformed former colleges and other non-university higher education schools of the city (such as the ''Escola Polit\u00e9cnica'' \u2013 now ''Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias''). Today there are two public universities in the city ([[University of Lisbon]] and [[New University of Lisbon]]), a public university institute  ([[ISCTE - Lisbon University Institute]]) and a [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]] institute (IPL \u2013 [[Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Lisboa]]).\n\nDuring [[Portugal in World War II|World War II]], Lisbon was one of the very few neutral, open European Atlantic ports, a major gateway for refugees to the U.S. and a haven for spies. More than 100,000 refugees were able to flee [[Nazi Germany]] via Lisbon.<ref>\"[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html Portugal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121130631/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html |date=21 January 2017 }}\". The Virtual Jewish History Tour.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime (1926\u20131974), Lisbon was expanded at the cost of other districts within the country, resulting in nationalist and monumental projects. New residential and public developments were constructed; the zone of [[Bel\u00e9m (Lisbon)|Bel\u00e9m]] was modified for the [[Portuguese World Exhibition|1940 Portuguese Exhibition]], while along the periphery new districts appeared to house the growing population. The inauguration of the bridge over the Tagus allowed rapid connection between both sides of the river.\n\nLisbon was the site of three revolutions in the 20th century. The first, the [[5 October 1910 revolution]], brought an end to the [[Portuguese monarchy]] and established the highly unstable and corrupt [[Portuguese First Republic]]. The [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat|6 June 1926 revolution]] would see the end of that first republic and firmly establish the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], or the [[Portuguese Second Republic]], as the ruling regime.\n\n===Contemporary===\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (08) edited.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which forms the constitutional basis of the [[European Union]], was signed at the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] in 2007.]]\nThe [[Carnation Revolution]], which took place on 25 April 1974, ended the right-wing [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime and reformed the country to become as it is today, the [[Portuguese Third Republic]].\n\nIn the 1990s, many of the districts were renovated and projects in the historic quarters were established to modernise those areas, for instance, architectural and patrimonial buildings were renovated, the northern margin of the Tagus was re-purposed for leisure and residential use, the [[Vasco da Gama Bridge]] was constructed and the eastern part of the municipality was re-purposed for [[Expo '98]] to commemorate the 500th anniversary of [[Vasco da Gama]]'s sea voyage to India, a voyage that would bring immense riches to Lisbon and cause many of Lisbon's landmarks to be built.\n\nIn 1988, a fire in the historical district of [[Chiado]] saw the destruction of many 18th-century [[Pombaline style]] buildings. A series of restoration works has brought the area back to its former self and made it a high-scale shopping district.\n\nThe [[Lisbon Agenda]] was a European Union agreement on measures to revitalise the EU economy, signed in Lisbon in March 2000. In October 2007 Lisbon hosted the [[2007 EU Summit]], where an agreement was reached regarding a new EU governance model. The resulting [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed on 13 December 2007 and came into force on 1 December 2009.\n\nLisbon has been the site for many international events and programmes.

These communities have no clearly defined boundaries and represent distinctive quarters of the city that have in common a historical culture, similar living standards, and identifiable architectural landmarks, as exemplified by the ''Bairro Alto'', ''Alfama'', ''Chiado'', and so forth.\n\n==== Alc\u00e2ntara ====\n[[File:Alc\u00e2ntara by wax115.jpg|thumb|[[Alc\u00e2ntara (Lisbon)|Alc\u00e2ntara]] from the [[Port of Lisbon]].]]\n{{main|Alc\u00e2ntara, Lisbon|l1=Alc\u00e2ntara}}\nAlthough today it is quite central, it was once a mere suburb of Lisbon, comprising mostly farms and country estates of the nobility with their palaces. In the 16th century, there was a brook there which the nobles used to promenade in their boats. During the late 19th century, Alc\u00e2ntara became a popular industrial area, with lots of small factories and warehouses.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Alc\u00e2ntara began to attract youth because of the number of pubs and discoth\u00e8ques. This was mainly due to its outer area of mostly commercial buildings, which acted as barriers to the noise-generating nightlife (which acted as a buffer to the residential communities surrounding it). In the meantime, some of these areas began to become gentrified, attracting loft developments and new flats, which have profited from its river views and central location.\n\nThe riverfront of Alc\u00e2ntara is known for its nightclubs and bars. The area is commonly known as ''docas'' (docks), since most of the clubs and bars are housed in converted dock warehouses.\n\n==== Alfama ====\n{{Main|Alfama}}\n[[File:A ver S. Vicente.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alfama]], with the churches of [[Monastery of S\u00e3o Vicente de Fora|S. Vicente de Fora]], [[Church of Santa Engr\u00e1cia|S. Engr\u00e1cia]], and [[Igreja de Santo Est\u00eav\u00e3o (Lisbon)|S. Est\u00eav\u00e3o]], and the Tagus river behind.]]\nThe oldest district of Lisbon, it spreads down the southern slope from the [[S\u00e3o Jorge Castle|Castle of S\u00e3o Jorge]] to the [[River Tagus]]. Its name, derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Al-hamma'', means fountains or baths. During the [[Islamic invasion of Iberia]], the Alfama constituted the largest part of the city, extending west to the [[Baixa]] neighbourhood. Increasingly, the Alfama became inhabited by fishermen and the poor: its fame as a poor neighbourhood continues to this day. While the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] caused considerable damage throughout the capital, the Alfama survived with little damage, thanks to its compact labyrinth of narrow streets and small squares. \n[[File:View from the S\u00e3o Jorge Castle, including the Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio on the waterfront.jpg|thumb|View from the S\u00e3o Jorge Castle, including the Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio on the waterfront]]\nIt is a historical quarter of mixed-use buildings occupied by [[Fado]] bars, restaurants, and homes with small shops downstairs. Modernising trends have invigorated the district: old houses have been re-purposed or remodeled, while new buildings have been constructed. Fado, the typically Portuguese style of melancholy music, is common (but not obligatory) in the restaurants of the district.\n\n==== Mouraria ====\nThe Mouraria, or Moorish quarter, is one of the most traditional neighborhoods of Lisbon,<ref name=\"Carvalho2007\">{{cite book|author=Joaquim Carvalho|title=Religion and Power in Europe: Conflict and Convergence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jR98-Ata0CkC&pg=PA38|year=2007|publisher=Edizioni Plus|isbn=978-88-8492-464-3|page=38|access-date=29 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509071129/https://books.google.com/books?id=jR98-Ata0CkC&pg=PA38|archive-date=9 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> although most of its old buildings were demolished by the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] between the 1930s and the 1970s.<ref name=\"Colvin2008\">{{cite book|author=Michael Colvin|title=The Reconstruction of Lisbon: Severa's Legacy and the Fado's Rewriting of Urban History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3kkMvRabv4C&pg=PA28|year=2008|publisher=Associated University Presse|isbn=978-0-8387-5708-6|page=98|access-date=29 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508093045/https://books.google.com/books?id=O3kkMvRabv4C&pg=PA28|archive-date=8 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It takes its name from the fact that after the reconquest of Lisbon, the Muslims who remained were confined to this part of the city.<ref name=\"Soyer2007\">{{cite book|author=Fran\u00e7ois Soyer|title=The Persecution of the Jews and Muslims of Portugal: King Manuel I and the End of Religious Tolerance (1496\u20137)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvOpWcWD2_wC&pg=PA41|date=15 October 2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16262-4|page=41|access-date=29 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603064836/https://books.google.com/books?id=hvOpWcWD2_wC&pg=PA41|archive-date=3 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In turn, the Jews were confined to three neighbourhoods called [http://www.redejudiariasportugal.com/index.php/en/ \"Judiarias\"]<ref name=\"O'Flanagan2008\">{{cite book|author=Patrick O'Flanagan|title=Port Cities of Atlantic Iberia, C. 1500\u20131900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzJc8ii7OMsC&pg=PA147|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6109-2|page=147|access-date=29 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511050547/https://books.google.com/books?id=fzJc8ii7OMsC&pg=PA147|archive-date=11 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Bairro Alto ====\n\n{{Main|Bairro Alto}}\n\n[[File:Bairro Alto, Lisbon (34487234082).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Duke of Cadaval]] Square'', bordering [[Bairro Alto]] and the [[Baixa Pombalina]].]]\n\n'''Bairro Alto''' (literally ''the upper quarter'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is an area of central Lisbon that functions as a residential, shopping and entertainment district; it is the center of the Portuguese capital's nightlife, attracting hipster youth and members of various music subcultures. Lisbon's [[Punk subculture|Punk]], [[Gay (term)|Gay]], Metal, [[Goth subculture|Goth]], [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]] and [[Reggae]] scenes all find a home in the ''Bairro'' with its many clubs and bars that cater to them. The crowds in the Bairro Alto are a multicultural mix of people representing a broad cross-section of modern Portuguese society, many of them being entertainment seekers and devotees of various music genres outside the mainstream, [[Fado]], Portugal's national music, still survives in the midst of the new nightlife.\n\n==== Baixa ====\n{{Main|Baixa Pombalina}}\nThe heart of the city is the ''[[Baixa]]'' or city centre; the Pombaline Baixa is an elegant district, primarily constructed after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]], taking its name from its benefactor, [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal]], who was the minister of [[Joseph I of Portugal]] (1750\u20131777) and a key figure during the Portuguese [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Following the 1755 disaster, Pombal took the lead in rebuilding Lisbon, imposing strict conditions and guidelines on the construction of the city, and transforming the organic street plan that characterised the district before the earthquake into its current grid pattern. As a result, the Pombaline Baixa is one of the first examples of [[earthquake construction|earthquake-resistant construction]]. Architectural models were tested by having troops march around them to simulate an earthquake. Notable features of Pombaline structures include the ''Pombaline cage'', a symmetrical wood-lattice framework aimed at distributing earthquake forces, and inter-terrace walls that were built higher than roof timbers to inhibit the spread of fires.\n{{wide image|File:Lisbon Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio pano.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|[[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]], with the [[Rua Augusta Arch]], in the [[Lisbon Baixa]].}}\n\n==== Beato ====\n\n[[File:Teatro_Ib\u00e9rico_(cropped).jpg|thumb|Facade of Teatro Ib\u00e9rico, in [[Beato]].]]\nThe parish of Beato (Lisbon) stands out for the new cultural dynamics it has been experiencing in recent years.

In particular, it is the place from which [[Vasco da Gama]] departed for [[India]] in 1497 and Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral departed for Brazil in 1499. It is also a former royal residence and features the 17th \u2013 18th-century [[Bel\u00e9m Palace]], a former royal residence now occupied by the [[President of Portugal]], and the [[Ajuda Palace]], begun in 1802 but never completed.\n\nPerhaps Bel\u00e9m's most famous feature is its tower, [[Bel\u00e9m Tower|Torre de Bel\u00e9m]], whose image is much used by Lisbon's tourist board. The tower was built as a fortified lighthouse late in the reign of [[Manuel I of Portugal|Dom Manuel l]] (1515\u20131520) to guard the entrance to the port. It stood on a little island in right side of the [[Tagus]], surrounded by water. Bel\u00e9m's other major historical building is the ''[[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery, Lisbon|Mosteiro dos Jer\u00f3nimos]]'' (Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery), which the [[Bel\u00e9m Tower|Torre de Bel\u00e9m]] was built partly to defend. Bel\u00e9m's most notable modern feature is the [[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos]] (Monument to the Discoveries) built for the Portuguese World Fair in 1940. In the heart of Bel\u00e9m is the ''Pra\u00e7a do Imp\u00e9rio'': gardens centred upon a large fountain, laid out during [[World War II]]. To the west of the gardens lies the ''[[Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m]]''. Bel\u00e9m is one of the most visited Lisbon districts. Here is located the [[Est\u00e1dio do Restelo]], house of [[Belenenses]].\n{{wide image|JeronimosLisbon (cropped).jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|View of [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] and ''Pra\u00e7a do Imp\u00e9rio'' (Empire Square) from the top of the ''[[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos]]'' in [[Bel\u00e9m (Lisbon)|Bel\u00e9m]].}}\n\n==== Chiado ====\n\n{{Main|Chiado}}\n\n[[File:PlazaDeCamoesLisboa-P1100966-P1100968.jpg|thumb|Monument to [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]], considered the greatest poet of the [[Portuguese language]], in [[Chiado]].]]\n\nThe Chiado is a traditional shopping area that mixes old and modern commercial establishments, concentrated specially in the Rua do Carmo and the Rua Garrett. Locals as well as tourists visit the Chiado to buy books, clothing and pottery as well as to have a cup of coffee. The most famous caf\u00e9 of Chiado is ''[[A Brasileira]]'', famous for having had poet [[Fernando Pessoa]] among its customers. The Chiado is also an important cultural area, with several museums and theatres, including the opera. Several buildings of the Chiado were destroyed in a fire in 1988, an event that deeply shocked the country. Thanks to a renovation project that lasted more than 10 years, coordinated by celebrated architect [[Siza Vieira]], the affected area has now virtually recovered.\n\nThe ornate, late 18th-century [[Estrela Basilica]] is the main attraction of this district. The church with its large dome is located on a hill in what was at the time the western part of Lisbon and can be seen from great distances. The style is similar to that of the [[Mafra National Palace]], late baroque and neoclassical. The fa\u00e7ade has twin bell towers and includes statues of saints and some allegorical figures. [[S\u00e3o Bento Palace]], the seat of the Portuguese parliament and the official residences of the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] and the President of the [[Assembly of the Republic of Portugal]], are in this district. Also in this district is Estrela Park, a favorite with families. There are exotic plants and trees, a duck pond, various sculptures, a children's playground, and many cultural events going on through the year, including outdoor cinema, markets, and music festivals.\n\n==== Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es ====\n{{Main|Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es}}\n[[File:Lisbon 120 (31787634704).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es]] district was initially built for the [[Expo '98|Lisbon World Expo]].]]\nParque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es (Park of Nations) is the newest district in Lisbon; it emerged from an urban renewal program to host the 1998 World Exhibition of Lisbon, also known as Expo'98. The area suffered massive changes giving Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es a futuristic look. A long lasting legacy of the same, the area has become another commercial and higher-end residential area for the city.\n\nCentral in the area is the [[Gare do Oriente]] (Orient railway station), one of the main transport hubs of Lisbon for trains, buses, taxis, and the metro. Its glass and steel columns are inspired by Gothic architecture, lending the whole structure a visual fascination (especially in sunlight or when illuminated at night). It was designed by the architect [[Santiago Calatrava]] from [[Valencia]], Spain. The Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es is across the street.\n\nThe area is pedestrian-friendly with new buildings, restaurants, gardens, the [[Casino Lisboa, Portugal|Casino Lisbon]], the FIL building (International Exhibition and Fair), the Cam\u00f5es Theatre and the ''Ocean\u00e1rio de Lisboa'' ([[Lisbon Oceanarium]]), which is the second largest in the world. The district's [[Altice Arena]] has become Lisbon's \"jack-of-all-trades\" performance arena. Seating 20,000, it has staged events from concerts to basketball tournaments.\n\n== Politics ==\n[[File:Lisboa, Ayuntamiento.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lisbon City Hall]], ceremonial seat of the Lisbon's municipal government.]]\n:''See also: [[List of mayors of Lisbon]] and [[:de:Lissabon#Kommunalpolitik|Lisbon politics]] (in German)''\n[[Fernando Medina (politician)|Fernando Medina]] is the current and 77th [[List of mayors of Lisbon|Mayor of Lisbon]].\n\n===Local election results 1976\u20132017===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;

The city is also crossed by historical boulevards and monuments along the main thoroughfares, particularly in the upper districts; notable among these are the ''[[Avenida da Liberdade]]'' (Avenue of Liberty), ''Avenida Fontes Pereira de Melo'', ''Avenida Almirante Reis'' and ''Avenida da Rep\u00fablica'' (Avenue of the Republic).\n\nLisbon is home to numerous prominent museums and art collections, from all around the world. The [[National Museum of Ancient Art]], which has one of the [[List of largest art museums|largest art collections in the world]], and the [[National Coach Museum]], which has the world's largest collection of royal coaches and carriages, are the two most visited museums in the city.

Many of these ruins were first unearthed during the mid-18th century (when the recent discovery of [[Pompeii]] made Roman archaeology fashionable among Europe's upper classes).\n\nThe city prospered as [[piracy]] was eliminated and technological advances were introduced, consequently ''Felicitas Julia'' became a center of trade with the Roman provinces of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] (particularly [[Cornwall]]) and the [[Rhine]]. Economically strong, Olissipo was known for its [[garum]] (a fish sauce highly prized by the elites of the empire and exported in [[amphora]]e to Rome), wine, salt, and horse-breeding, while Roman culture permeated the hinterland. The city was connected by a broad road to Western Hispania's two other large cities, [[Bracara Augusta]] in the province of [[Tarraconensis]] (Portuguese [[Braga]]), and [[Emerita Augusta]], the capital of [[Lusitania]]. The city was ruled by an [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] council dominated by two families, the Julii and the Cassiae, although regional authority was administered by the Roman Governor of Emerita or directly by Emperor [[Tiberius]]. Among the majority of [[Latin]] speakers lived a large minority of Greek traders and slaves.\n\nOlissipo, like most great cities in the Western Empire, was a center for the dissemination of Christianity. Its first attested [[Patriarch of Lisbon|Bishop]] was Potamius (c. 356), and there were several [[martyr]]s during the period of persecution of the Christians: [[Holy Martyrs of Lisbon|Verissimus, Maxima, and Julia]] are the most significant examples. By the time of the [[Fall of Rome]], Olissipo had become a notable Christian center.\n\n{{wide image|CastleSaintGeorge.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|[[S\u00e3o Jorge Castle]] and the surrounding neighborhoods of [[Castelo (Lisbon)|Castelo]], Mouraria, and [[Alfama]].}}\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nFollowing the disintegration of the Western Roman Empire there were [[barbarian]] invasions; between 409 and 429 the city was occupied successively by [[Sarmatian]]s, [[Alans]] and [[Vandals]]. The Germanic [[Suebi]], who established a kingdom in [[Gallaecia]] (modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern Portugal), with its capital in ''Bracara Augusta'', also controlled the region of Lisbon until 585. In 585, the Suebi Kingdom was integrated into the Germanic [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Kingdom of Toledo, which comprised all of the Iberian Peninsula: Lisbon was then called ''Ulishbona''.\n\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align  = left\n | image1 = Siege of Lisbon (2).tif\n | image2 = Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg\n | footer = King [[Afonso Henriques]] reconquered the city from the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid Empire]] at the 1147 [[Siege of Lisbon]]. }}\n\nOn 6 August 711, Lisbon was taken by [[Moors|Muslim]] forces. These conquerors, who were mostly [[Berber people|Berbers]] and [[Arab]]s from [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], built many mosques and houses, rebuilt the city wall (known as the ''Cerca Moura'') and established administrative control, while permitting the diverse population ([[Muladi]], [[Mozarabs]], [[Berber people|Berbers]], [[Arabs]], [[Jews]], ''[[Zanj]]'' and ''[[Saqaliba]]'') to maintain their socio-cultural lifestyles. [[Mozarabic]] was the native language spoken by most of the Christian population although Arabic was widely known as spoken by all religious communities. Islam was the official religion practised by the Arabs, Berbers, Zanj, Saqaliba and [[Muladi]] ([[muwallad]]un).\n\nThe Muslim influence is still visible in the [[Alfama]] district, an old quarter of Lisbon that survived the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]: many place-names are derived from Arabic and the Alfama (the oldest existing district of Lisbon) was derived from the Arabic \"''al-hamma''{{-\"}}.\n\nFor a brief time Lisbon was an independent Muslim kingdom known as the [[Taifa of Lisbon]] (1022\u20131094), before being conquered by the larger [[Taifa of Badajoz]].\n\nIn 1108 Lisbon was raided and occupied by [[Norway|Norwegian]] crusaders led by [[Sigurd I of Norway|Sigurd I]] on their way to the [[Holy Land]] as part of the [[Norwegian Crusade]] and occupied by crusader forces for three years.<ref>Pires, Helio. \"Sigur\u0111r's Attack on Lisbon: Where Exactly?\" In ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'' 8 (2012) \u2013 Turnhout, Belgium : Brepols Publishers, c = 2012, pp. 199\u2013205.</ref> It was taken by the Moorish [[Almoravids]] in 1111.\n\n[[File:Siege of Lisbon 1384.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Siege of Lisbon (1384)|1384 Siege of Lisbon]] in [[Froissart's Chronicles]].]]\n\nIn 1147, as part of the ''[[Reconquista]]'', crusader knights led by [[Afonso I of Portugal]] [[Siege of Lisbon|besieged and reconquered Lisbon]]. The city, with around 154,000 residents at the time, was returned to Christian rule. The reconquest of Portugal and re-establishment of [[Christianity]] is one of the most significant events in Lisbon's history, described in the chronicle ''[[Expugnatione Lyxbonensi]]'', which describes, among other incidents, how the local bishop was killed by the crusaders and the city's residents prayed to the [[Virgin Mary]] as it happened. Some of the Muslim residents converted to Roman Catholicism and most of those who did not convert fled to other parts of the Islamic world, primarily [[Muslim Spain]] and [[North Africa]]. All mosques were either completely destroyed or converted into churches. As a result of the end of Muslim rule, spoken Arabic quickly lost its place in the everyday life of the city and disappeared altogether.\n\nWith its central location, Lisbon became the capital city of the new Portuguese territory in 1255.\nThe first Portuguese university was founded in Lisbon in 1290 by King [[Dinis I of Portugal|Denis I]]; for many years the ''[[Studium Generale]]'' (''General Study'') was transferred intermittently to [[Coimbra]], where it was installed permanently in the 16th century as the [[University of Coimbra]].\n\nIn 1384, the city was besieged by King [[Juan I of Castille]], as a part of the ongoing [[1383\u20131385 Crisis]]. The result of the siege was a victory for the Portuguese led by [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]].\n\nDuring the last centuries of the Middle Ages, the city expanded substantially and became an important trading post with both [[Northern Europe]]an and Mediterranean cities.\n\n=== Early Modern ===\n[[File:Lisboa 1500-1510.jpg|thumb|left|The oldest known image of Lisbon (1500\u20131510) from the ''Cr\u00f3nica de Dom Afonso Henriques'' by Duarte Galv\u00e3o]]\n\nMost of the Portuguese expeditions of the [[Age of Discovery]] left Lisbon during the period from the end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century, including [[Vasco da Gama]]'s expedition to [[India]] in 1498.

This period saw the rise of the exuberant [[Manueline]] style in architecture, which left its mark in many 16th-century monuments (including Lisbon's [[Bel\u00e9m Tower]] and [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], which were declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]).

The [[Portuguese Restoration War]], which began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] organised by the nobility and [[bourgeois]]ie in Lisbon and executed on 1 December 1640, restored Portuguese independence. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare until the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 1668.\n\nIn the early 18th century, gold from Brazil allowed [[John V of Portugal|King John V]] to sponsor the building of several [[Baroque]] churches and theatres in the city.

[[Voltaire]] wrote a long poem, ''Po\u00eame sur le d\u00e9sastre de Lisbonne'', shortly after the quake, and mentioned it in his 1759 novel ''[[Candide]]'' (indeed, many argue that this critique of [[optimism]] was inspired by that earthquake). [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] also mentions it in his 1857 poem, ''The Deacon's Masterpiece, or The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay.''\n\nAfter the 1755 earthquake, the city was rebuilt largely according to the plans of Prime Minister [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo]], the [[Marquis of Pombal|1st Marquis of Pombal]]; the lower town began to be known as the ''Baixa Pombalina'' ([[Pombaline Lower Town|Pombaline central district]]). Instead of rebuilding the medieval town, Pombal decided to demolish what remained after the earthquake and rebuild the city centre in accordance with principles of modern urban design. It was reconstructed in an open rectangular plan with two great squares: the ''[[Pra\u00e7a do Rossio]]'' and the ''[[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]]''. The first, the central commercial district, is the traditional gathering place of the city and the location of the older caf\u00e9s, theatres and restaurants; the second became the city's main access to the River Tagus and point of departure and arrival for seagoing vessels, adorned by a triumphal arch (1873) and monument to King [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]].\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Proclama\u00e7\u00e3o Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa.jpg|thumb|right|The [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Portuguese Republic]] in 1910.]]\n\nIn the first years of the 19th century, Portugal was invaded by the troops of [[Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]], forcing Queen [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]] and Prince-Regent [[John VI of Portugal|John]] (future John VI) to flee temporarily to Brazil. By the time the new King returned to Lisbon, many of the buildings and properties were pillaged, sacked or destroyed by the invaders.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Liberal movement introduced new changes into the urban landscape. The principal areas were in the ''Baixa'' and along the ''Chiado'' district, where shops, tobacconists shops, caf\u00e9s, bookstores, clubs and theatres proliferated. The development of industry and commerce determined the growth of the city, seeing the transformation of the [[Passeio P\u00fablico (Lisbon)|Passeio P\u00fablico]], a Pombaline era park, into the [[Avenida da Liberdade]], as the city grew farther from the Tagus.\n\nLisbon was the site of the [[Lisbon Regicide|regicide]] of [[Carlos I of Portugal]] in 1908, an event which culminated two years later in the establishment of the First Republic.\n[[File:Lisbon, the Pal\u00e1cio Nacional da Ajuda.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Palace of Ajuda]] was built as a residence for the [[King of Portugal]] following the [[1755 Lisbon Earthquake]].]]\n[[File:Teatro Dona Maria II (2.\u00aa metade do s\u00e9c.

Maria II National Theatre|Queen Maria II National Theatre]] was built in 1842.]]\nThe city refounded its university in 1911 after centuries of inactivity in Lisbon, incorporating reformed former colleges and other non-university higher education schools of the city (such as the ''Escola Polit\u00e9cnica'' \u2013 now ''Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias''). Today there are two public universities in the city ([[University of Lisbon]] and [[New University of Lisbon]]), a public university institute  ([[ISCTE - Lisbon University Institute]]) and a [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]] institute (IPL \u2013 [[Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Lisboa]]).\n\nDuring [[Portugal in World War II|World War II]], Lisbon was one of the very few neutral, open European Atlantic ports, a major gateway for refugees to the U.S. and a haven for spies. More than 100,000 refugees were able to flee [[Nazi Germany]] via Lisbon.<ref>\"[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html Portugal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121130631/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html |date=21 January 2017 }}\".

New residential and public developments were constructed; the zone of [[Bel\u00e9m (Lisbon)|Bel\u00e9m]] was modified for the [[Portuguese World Exhibition|1940 Portuguese Exhibition]], while along the periphery new districts appeared to house the growing population. The inauguration of the bridge over the Tagus allowed rapid connection between both sides of the river.\n\nLisbon was the site of three revolutions in the 20th century. The first, the [[5 October 1910 revolution]], brought an end to the [[Portuguese monarchy]] and established the highly unstable and corrupt [[Portuguese First Republic]]. The [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat|6 June 1926 revolution]] would see the end of that first republic and firmly establish the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], or the [[Portuguese Second Republic]], as the ruling regime.\n\n===Contemporary===\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (08) edited.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which forms the constitutional basis of the [[European Union]], was signed at the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] in 2007.]]\nThe [[Carnation Revolution]], which took place on 25 April 1974, ended the right-wing [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime and reformed the country to become as it is today, the [[Portuguese Third Republic]].\n\nIn the 1990s, many of the districts were renovated and projects in the historic quarters were established to modernise those areas, for instance, architectural and patrimonial buildings were renovated, the northern margin of the Tagus was re-purposed for leisure and residential use, the [[Vasco da Gama Bridge]] was constructed and the eastern part of the municipality was re-purposed for [[Expo '98]] to commemorate the 500th anniversary of [[Vasco da Gama]]'s sea voyage to India, a voyage that would bring immense riches to Lisbon and cause many of Lisbon's landmarks to be built.\n\nIn 1988, a fire in the historical district of [[Chiado]] saw the destruction of many 18th-century [[Pombaline style]] buildings. A series of restoration works has brought the area back to its former self and made it a high-scale shopping district.\n\nThe [[Lisbon Agenda]] was a European Union agreement on measures to revitalise the EU economy, signed in Lisbon in March 2000. In October 2007 Lisbon hosted the [[2007 EU Summit]], where an agreement was reached regarding a new EU governance model. The resulting [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed on 13 December 2007 and came into force on 1 December 2009.\n\nLisbon has been the site for many international events and programmes.

These communities have no clearly defined boundaries and represent distinctive quarters of the city that have in common a historical culture, similar living standards, and identifiable architectural landmarks, as exemplified by the ''Bairro Alto'', ''Alfama'', ''Chiado'', and so forth.\n\n==== Alc\u00e2ntara ====\n[[File:Alc\u00e2ntara by wax115.jpg|thumb|[[Alc\u00e2ntara (Lisbon)|Alc\u00e2ntara]] from the [[Port of Lisbon]].]]\n{{main|Alc\u00e2ntara, Lisbon|l1=Alc\u00e2ntara}}\nAlthough today it is quite central, it was once a mere suburb of Lisbon, comprising mostly farms and country estates of the nobility with their palaces. In the 16th century, there was a brook there which the nobles used to promenade in their boats. During the late 19th century, Alc\u00e2ntara became a popular industrial area, with lots of small factories and warehouses.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Alc\u00e2ntara began to attract youth because of the number of pubs and discoth\u00e8ques. This was mainly due to its outer area of mostly commercial buildings, which acted as barriers to the noise-generating nightlife (which acted as a buffer to the residential communities surrounding it). In the meantime, some of these areas began to become gentrified, attracting loft developments and new flats, which have profited from its river views and central location.\n\nThe riverfront of Alc\u00e2ntara is known for its nightclubs and bars. The area is commonly known as ''docas'' (docks), since most of the clubs and bars are housed in converted dock warehouses.\n\n==== Alfama ====\n{{Main|Alfama}}\n[[File:A ver S. Vicente.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alfama]], with the churches of [[Monastery of S\u00e3o Vicente de Fora|S. Vicente de Fora]], [[Church of Santa Engr\u00e1cia|S. Engr\u00e1cia]], and [[Igreja de Santo Est\u00eav\u00e3o (Lisbon)|S. Est\u00eav\u00e3o]], and the Tagus river behind.]]\nThe oldest district of Lisbon, it spreads down the southern slope from the [[S\u00e3o Jorge Castle|Castle of S\u00e3o Jorge]] to the [[River Tagus]]. Its name, derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Al-hamma'', means fountains or baths. During the [[Islamic invasion of Iberia]], the Alfama constituted the largest part of the city, extending west to the [[Baixa]] neighbourhood. Increasingly, the Alfama became inhabited by fishermen and the poor: its fame as a poor neighbourhood continues to this day. While the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] caused considerable damage throughout the capital, the Alfama survived with little damage, thanks to its compact labyrinth of narrow streets and small squares. \n[[File:View from the S\u00e3o Jorge Castle, including the Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio on the waterfront.jpg|thumb|View from the S\u00e3o Jorge Castle, including the Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio on the waterfront]]\nIt is a historical quarter of mixed-use buildings occupied by [[Fado]] bars, restaurants, and homes with small shops downstairs. Modernising trends have invigorated the district: old houses have been re-purposed or remodeled, while new buildings have been constructed. Fado, the typically Portuguese style of melancholy music, is common (but not obligatory) in the restaurants of the district.\n\n==== Mouraria ====\nThe Mouraria, or Moorish quarter, is one of the most traditional neighborhoods of Lisbon,<ref name=\"Carvalho2007\">{{cite book|author=Joaquim Carvalho|title=Religion and Power in Europe: Conflict and Convergence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jR98-Ata0CkC&pg=PA38|year=2007|publisher=Edizioni Plus|isbn=978-88-8492-464-3|page=38|access-date=29 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509071129/https://books.google.com/books?id=jR98-Ata0CkC&pg=PA38|archive-date=9 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> although most of its old buildings were demolished by the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] between the 1930s and the 1970s.<ref name=\"Colvin2008\">{{cite book|author=Michael Colvin|title=The Reconstruction of Lisbon: Severa's Legacy and the Fado's Rewriting of Urban History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3kkMvRabv4C&pg=PA28|year=2008|publisher=Associated University Presse|isbn=978-0-8387-5708-6|page=98|access-date=29 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508093045/https://books.google.com/books?id=O3kkMvRabv4C&pg=PA28|archive-date=8 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It takes its name from the fact that after the reconquest of Lisbon, the Muslims who remained were confined to this part of the city.<ref name=\"Soyer2007\">{{cite book|author=Fran\u00e7ois Soyer|title=The Persecution of the Jews and Muslims of Portugal: King Manuel I and the End of Religious Tolerance (1496\u20137)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvOpWcWD2_wC&pg=PA41|date=15 October 2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16262-4|page=41|access-date=29 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603064836/https://books.google.com/books?id=hvOpWcWD2_wC&pg=PA41|archive-date=3 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In turn, the Jews were confined to three neighbourhoods called [http://www.redejudiariasportugal.com/index.php/en/ \"Judiarias\"]<ref name=\"O'Flanagan2008\">{{cite book|author=Patrick O'Flanagan|title=Port Cities of Atlantic Iberia, C. 1500\u20131900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzJc8ii7OMsC&pg=PA147|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6109-2|page=147|access-date=29 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511050547/https://books.google.com/books?id=fzJc8ii7OMsC&pg=PA147|archive-date=11 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Bairro Alto ====\n\n{{Main|Bairro Alto}}\n\n[[File:Bairro Alto, Lisbon (34487234082).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Duke of Cadaval]] Square'', bordering [[Bairro Alto]] and the [[Baixa Pombalina]].]]\n\n'''Bairro Alto''' (literally ''the upper quarter'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) is an area of central Lisbon that functions as a residential, shopping and entertainment district; it is the center of the Portuguese capital's nightlife, attracting hipster youth and members of various music subcultures. Lisbon's [[Punk subculture|Punk]], [[Gay (term)|Gay]], Metal, [[Goth subculture|Goth]], [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]] and [[Reggae]] scenes all find a home in the ''Bairro'' with its many clubs and bars that cater to them. The crowds in the Bairro Alto are a multicultural mix of people representing a broad cross-section of modern Portuguese society, many of them being entertainment seekers and devotees of various music genres outside the mainstream, [[Fado]], Portugal's national music, still survives in the midst of the new nightlife.\n\n==== Baixa ====\n{{Main|Baixa Pombalina}}\nThe heart of the city is the ''[[Baixa]]'' or city centre; the Pombaline Baixa is an elegant district, primarily constructed after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]], taking its name from its benefactor, [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal]], who was the minister of [[Joseph I of Portugal]] (1750\u20131777) and a key figure during the Portuguese [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Following the 1755 disaster, Pombal took the lead in rebuilding Lisbon, imposing strict conditions and guidelines on the construction of the city, and transforming the organic street plan that characterised the district before the earthquake into its current grid pattern. As a result, the Pombaline Baixa is one of the first examples of [[earthquake construction|earthquake-resistant construction]]. Architectural models were tested by having troops march around them to simulate an earthquake. Notable features of Pombaline structures include the ''Pombaline cage'', a symmetrical wood-lattice framework aimed at distributing earthquake forces, and inter-terrace walls that were built higher than roof timbers to inhibit the spread of fires.\n{{wide image|File:Lisbon Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio pano.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|[[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]], with the [[Rua Augusta Arch]], in the [[Lisbon Baixa]].}}\n\n==== Beato ====\n\n[[File:Teatro_Ib\u00e9rico_(cropped).jpg|thumb|Facade of Teatro Ib\u00e9rico, in [[Beato]].]]\nThe parish of Beato (Lisbon) stands out for the new cultural dynamics it has been experiencing in recent years.

In particular, it is the place from which [[Vasco da Gama]] departed for [[India]] in 1497 and Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral departed for Brazil in 1499. It is also a former royal residence and features the 17th \u2013 18th-century [[Bel\u00e9m Palace]], a former royal residence now occupied by the [[President of Portugal]], and the [[Ajuda Palace]], begun in 1802 but never completed.\n\nPerhaps Bel\u00e9m's most famous feature is its tower, [[Bel\u00e9m Tower|Torre de Bel\u00e9m]], whose image is much used by Lisbon's tourist board. The tower was built as a fortified lighthouse late in the reign of [[Manuel I of Portugal|Dom Manuel l]] (1515\u20131520) to guard the entrance to the port. It stood on a little island in right side of the [[Tagus]], surrounded by water. Bel\u00e9m's other major historical building is the ''[[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery, Lisbon|Mosteiro dos Jer\u00f3nimos]]'' (Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery), which the [[Bel\u00e9m Tower|Torre de Bel\u00e9m]] was built partly to defend. Bel\u00e9m's most notable modern feature is the [[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos]] (Monument to the Discoveries) built for the Portuguese World Fair in 1940. In the heart of Bel\u00e9m is the ''Pra\u00e7a do Imp\u00e9rio'': gardens centred upon a large fountain, laid out during [[World War II]]. To the west of the gardens lies the ''[[Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m]]''. Bel\u00e9m is one of the most visited Lisbon districts. Here is located the [[Est\u00e1dio do Restelo]], house of [[Belenenses]].\n{{wide image|JeronimosLisbon (cropped).jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|View of [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] and ''Pra\u00e7a do Imp\u00e9rio'' (Empire Square) from the top of the ''[[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos]]'' in [[Bel\u00e9m (Lisbon)|Bel\u00e9m]].}}\n\n==== Chiado ====\n\n{{Main|Chiado}}\n\n[[File:PlazaDeCamoesLisboa-P1100966-P1100968.jpg|thumb|Monument to [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]], considered the greatest poet of the [[Portuguese language]], in [[Chiado]].]]\n\nThe Chiado is a traditional shopping area that mixes old and modern commercial establishments, concentrated specially in the Rua do Carmo and the Rua Garrett. Locals as well as tourists visit the Chiado to buy books, clothing and pottery as well as to have a cup of coffee. The most famous caf\u00e9 of Chiado is ''[[A Brasileira]]'', famous for having had poet [[Fernando Pessoa]] among its customers. The Chiado is also an important cultural area, with several museums and theatres, including the opera. Several buildings of the Chiado were destroyed in a fire in 1988, an event that deeply shocked the country. Thanks to a renovation project that lasted more than 10 years, coordinated by celebrated architect [[Siza Vieira]], the affected area has now virtually recovered.\n\nThe ornate, late 18th-century [[Estrela Basilica]] is the main attraction of this district. The church with its large dome is located on a hill in what was at the time the western part of Lisbon and can be seen from great distances. The style is similar to that of the [[Mafra National Palace]], late baroque and neoclassical. The fa\u00e7ade has twin bell towers and includes statues of saints and some allegorical figures. [[S\u00e3o Bento Palace]], the seat of the Portuguese parliament and the official residences of the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] and the President of the [[Assembly of the Republic of Portugal]], are in this district. Also in this district is Estrela Park, a favorite with families. There are exotic plants and trees, a duck pond, various sculptures, a children's playground, and many cultural events going on through the year, including outdoor cinema, markets, and music festivals.\n\n==== Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es ====\n{{Main|Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es}}\n[[File:Lisbon 120 (31787634704).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es]] district was initially built for the [[Expo '98|Lisbon World Expo]].]]\nParque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es (Park of Nations) is the newest district in Lisbon; it emerged from an urban renewal program to host the 1998 World Exhibition of Lisbon, also known as Expo'98. The area suffered massive changes giving Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es a futuristic look. A long lasting legacy of the same, the area has become another commercial and higher-end residential area for the city.\n\nCentral in the area is the [[Gare do Oriente]] (Orient railway station), one of the main transport hubs of Lisbon for trains, buses, taxis, and the metro. Its glass and steel columns are inspired by Gothic architecture, lending the whole structure a visual fascination (especially in sunlight or when illuminated at night). It was designed by the architect [[Santiago Calatrava]] from [[Valencia]], Spain. The Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es is across the street.\n\nThe area is pedestrian-friendly with new buildings, restaurants, gardens, the [[Casino Lisboa, Portugal|Casino Lisbon]], the FIL building (International Exhibition and Fair), the Cam\u00f5es Theatre and the ''Ocean\u00e1rio de Lisboa'' ([[Lisbon Oceanarium]]), which is the second largest in the world. The district's [[Altice Arena]] has become Lisbon's \"jack-of-all-trades\" performance arena. Seating 20,000, it has staged events from concerts to basketball tournaments.\n\n== Politics ==\n[[File:Lisboa, Ayuntamiento.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lisbon City Hall]], ceremonial seat of the Lisbon's municipal government.]]\n:''See also: [[List of mayors of Lisbon]] and [[:de:Lissabon#Kommunalpolitik|Lisbon politics]] (in German)''\n[[Fernando Medina (politician)|Fernando Medina]] is the current and 77th [[List of mayors of Lisbon|Mayor of Lisbon]].\n\n===Local election results 1976\u20132017===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;

The city is also crossed by historical boulevards and monuments along the main thoroughfares, particularly in the upper districts; notable among these are the ''[[Avenida da Liberdade]]'' (Avenue of Liberty), ''Avenida Fontes Pereira de Melo'', ''Avenida Almirante Reis'' and ''Avenida da Rep\u00fablica'' (Avenue of the Republic).\n\nLisbon is home to numerous prominent museums and art collections, from all around the world. The [[National Museum of Ancient Art]], which has one of the [[List of largest art museums|largest art collections in the world]], and the [[National Coach Museum]], which has the world's largest collection of royal coaches and carriages, are the two most visited museums in the city.
