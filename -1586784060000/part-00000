After the boy had a cold, 9,700 years later, Jesus was the beginning of ancient Ireland, when ice was removed, known as Mesolithic archeology, in 4000 BC. S., neolithic age and 2300 copper and copper. Iron Age BC And B.C. The Bronze Age began in the second millennium BC. The \"History of Wisdom\" begins with Helia's accession to Ireland and ends with the emergence of Celtic culture in Europe.\n\nBy the end of the 4th century, Christianity wanted to gradually accept this or that of the Celts. In the late 6th century, he introduced the idea, especially the Christian Church, which transformed it into Irish society. Viking attacks and the eighth century onwards. After all. C, the results are variable in terms of culture exchange, as well as innovation in agriculture and transportation. Scandinavian shops and coins were first built in many cities throughout Ireland. The Viking influence only returned to the river banks and even after 1014. The Clinton war did great damage to Welsh culture. 1169 Norman also defeats attack. To some extent, it even went down the island. 800th anniversary of Britain and the army in Ireland. In fact, the interests of the conquered Romans in the following centuries remained with the birth of Gili [2], who restored Helia culture in many parts of the country, in the fortified cities of the Dublin region, called Pal. For the first time.\n\nReduced to the control of small pockets, the [[English Crown]] did not make another attempt to conquer the island until after the end of the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1488). This released resources and manpower for overseas expansion, beginning in the early 16th century.  However, the nature of Ireland's decentralised political organisation into small territories (known as [[t\u00faath]]a), martial traditions, difficult terrain and climate and lack of urban infrastructure, meant that attempts to assert Crown authority were slow and expensive. Attempts to impose the new Protestant faith were also successfully resisted by both the Gaelic and Norman-Irish. The new policy fomented the rebellion of the [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[Earl of Kildare]] [[Silken Thomas]] in 1534, keen to defend his traditional autonomy and Catholicism, and marked the beginning of the prolonged [[Tudor period|Tudor]] conquest of Ireland lasting from 1534 to 1603. [[Henry VIII]] proclaimed himself [[King of Ireland]] in 1541 to facilitate the project. Ireland became a potential battleground in the [[Religious wars in Europe|wars]] between Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] and [[Protestant Reformation]] Europe.\n\nEngland's attempts to either conquer or assimilate both the Hiberno-Norman lordships and the Gaelic territories into the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] provided the impetus for ongoing warfare, notable examples being the [[First Desmond Rebellion|1st Desmond Rebellion]], the [[Second Desmond Rebellion|2nd Desmond Rebellion]] and the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]]. This period was marked by the Crown policies of, at first, [[surrender and regrant]], and later, [[Plantations of Ireland|plantation]], involving the arrival of thousands of English and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Protestant]] settlers, and the displacement of both the Hiberno-Normans (or Old English as they were known by then) and the native [[Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic]] landholders. [[Gaelic Ireland]] was finally defeated at the [[battle of Kinsale]] in 1601 which marked the collapse of the Gaelic system and the beginning of Ireland's history as part of the [[British Empire]].\n\nDuring the 17th century, this division between a Protestant landholding minority and a dispossessed Catholic majority was intensified and conflict between them was to become a recurrent theme in Irish history.  Domination of Ireland by the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] was reinforced after two periods of religious war, the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] in 1641-52 and the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite war]] in 1689-91. Political power thereafter rested almost exclusively in the hands of a minority Protestant Ascendancy, while Catholics and members of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|dissenting]] Protestant denominations suffered severe political and economic privations under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]].\n\nOn 1 January 1801, in the wake of the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|United Irishmen Rebellion]], the [[Irish House of Commons|Irish Parliament]] was abolished and Ireland became part of a new [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] formed by the [[Acts of Union 1800]]. Catholics were not granted full rights until [[Catholic Emancipation]] in 1829, achieved by [[Daniel O\u2019Connell]]. The catastrophe of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] struck Ireland in 1845 resulting in over a million deaths from starvation and disease and in a million refugees fleeing the country, mainly to America.  Irish attempts to break away continued with [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell's]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] which strove from the 1880s to attain [[Irish Home Rule Bill|Home Rule]] through the parliamentary constitutional movement, eventually winning the [[Home Rule Act 1914]], although this Act was suspended at the outbreak of [[World War I]].\n\nIn 1916 the [[Easter Rising]] succeeded in turning public opinion against the British establishment after the execution of the leaders by British authorities. It also eclipsed the home rule movement.  In 1922, after the [[Irish War of Independence]] most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom to become the independent [[Irish Free State]] but under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] the six northeastern counties, known as [[Northern Ireland]], remained within the United Kingdom, creating the partition of Ireland. The treaty was opposed by many; their opposition led to the outbreak of the [[Irish Civil War]], in which [[Irish Free State]], or \"pro-treaty\", forces proved victorious. The [[history of Northern Ireland]] has since been dominated by the division of society along sectarian faultlines and conflict between (mainly Catholic) [[Irish Nationalism|Irish nationalist]]s and (mainly Protestant) [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]]. These divisions erupted into [[the Troubles]] in the late 1960s, after civil rights marches were met with opposition by authorities. The violence escalated after the deployment of the British Army to maintain authority led to clashes with nationalist communities. The violence continued for 28 years until an uneasy, but largely successful peace was finally achieved with the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998.\n\n==Prehistory (10,500 BC\u2013AD 400)==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Ireland}}\n\n===Stone Age to Bronze Age===\n[[File:Www.wesleyjohnston.com-users-ireland-maps-historical-ice age.gif|thumb|Ireland during the [[Ice Age]]]]\n\nWhat is known of pre-Christian Ireland comes from references in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writings, [[Irish poetry]] and myth, and archaeology.

Within these kingdoms a rich culture flourished. The society of these kingdoms was dominated by an upper class consisting of aristocratic warriors and learned people, which possibly included [[Druid]]s.\n\nLinguists realised from the 17th century onwards that the language spoken by these people, the [[Goidelic languages]], was a branch of the [[Celtic languages]]. This is usually explained as a result of invasions by [[Celt]]s from the continent. However, other research has postulated that the culture developed gradually and continuously, and that the introduction of Celtic language and elements of Celtic culture may have been a result of cultural exchange with Celtic groups in southwest continental Europe from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.<ref name=\"prospect\">{{cite web|accessdate=30 June 2011|publisher=Prospect Magazine|url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7817|title=Myths of British Ancestry}}</ref><ref name=\"hnn\">{{cite web|accessdate=30 June 2011|publisher=[[George Mason University]] History News Network|url=http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/7406.html|title=DNA Research Links Scots, Irish And Welsh To North-western Spain}}</ref>\n\nThe hypothesis that the native Late Bronze Age inhabitants gradually absorbed Celtic influences has since been supported by some recent genetic research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/capelli2_CB.pdf|title=A Y Chromosne Census of the British Isles (pdf)|website=Familytreedna.com|accessdate=15 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901035019/http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/capelli2_CB.pdf|archive-date=1 September 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans referred to Ireland as Scotia AD 500, and later [[Hibernia]]. [[Ptolemy]], in AD 100, recorded Ireland's geography and tribes. Ireland was never a part of the [[Roman Empire]], but Roman influence was often projected well beyond its borders. [[Tacitus]] writes that an exiled Irish prince was with [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] in [[Roman Britain]] and would return to seize power in Ireland. [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] tells us that Roman \"arms had been taken beyond the shores of Ireland\". In recent years, some experts have hypothesized that Roman-sponsored Gaelic forces (or perhaps even Roman regulars) mounted some kind of invasion around AD 100,<ref name='ba-n014-0596'>{{cite web|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba14/ba14feat.html|publisher=British Archaeology|title=Yes, the Romans did invade Ireland}}</ref> but the exact relationship between Rome and the dynasties and peoples of Hibernia remains unclear.\n\nIrish confederations (the [[Scoti]]) attacked and some settled in [[Great Britain|Britain]] during the [[Great Conspiracy]] of 367.

Politically, what appears to have been a prehistoric emphasis on tribal affiliation had been replaced by the 8th century by patrilineal dynasties ruling the island's kingdoms. Many formerly powerful kingdoms and peoples disappeared. Irish pirates struck all over the coast of western Britain in the same way that the Vikings would later attack Ireland. Some of these founded entirely new kingdoms in Pictland and, to a lesser degree, in parts of Cornwall, Wales, and Cumbria. The [[Attacotti]] of south [[Leinster]] may even have served in the Roman military in the mid-to-late 300s.<ref>*Philip Rance, 'Attacotti, D\u00e9isi and Magnus Maximus: the Case for Irish Federates in Late Roman Britain\u2019, ''Britannia'' 32 (2001), pp. 243\u2013270</ref>\n\nPerhaps it was some of the latter returning home as rich mercenaries, merchants, or slaves stolen from Britain or Gaul, that first brought the Christian faith to Ireland. Some early sources claim that there were missionaries active in southern Ireland long before [[St. Patrick]]. Whatever the route, and there were probably many, this new faith was to have the most profound effect on the Irish.\n\nTradition maintains that in A.D. 432, [[Saint Patrick|St. Patrick]] arrived on the island and, in the years that followed, worked to convert the Irish to Christianity. St Patrick's ''Confession'', in Latin, written by him is the earliest Irish historical document. It gives some information about the Saint.<ref>MacAmnaidh, S. 2013. ''Irish History.'' Parragon Books Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1-4723-2723-9}}</ref> On the other hand, according to [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], a contemporary chronicler, [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|Palladius]] was sent to Ireland by the Pope in 431 as ''\"first Bishop to the Irish believing in Christ\"'', which demonstrates that there were already Christians living in Ireland. Palladius seems to have worked purely as Bishop to Irish Christians in the Leinster and Meath kingdoms, while Patrick \u2013 who may have arrived as late as 461 \u2013 worked first and foremost as a missionary to the pagan Irish, in the more remote kingdoms in Ulster and Connacht.\n[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|A page from the [[Book of Kells]] that opens the [[Gospel of John]]]]\n\nPatrick is traditionally credited with preserving and codifying Irish laws and changing only those that conflicted with Christian practices. He is credited with introducing the [[Roman alphabet]], which enabled Irish monks to preserve parts of the extensive oral literature. The historicity of these claims remains the subject of debate and there is no direct evidence linking Patrick with any of these accomplishments. The myth of Patrick, as scholars refer to it, was developed in the centuries after his death.<ref>[[Carmel McCaffrey]], Leo Eaton \"In Search of Ancient Ireland\" Ivan R Dee (2002)PBS 2002</ref>\n\nIrish scholars excelled in the study of [[Latin]] learning and Christian theology in the monasteries that flourished shortly thereafter. [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Missionaries from Ireland]] to England and [[Continental Europe]] spread news of the flowering of learning, and scholars from other nations came to Irish monasteries. The excellence and isolation of these monasteries helped preserve Latin learning during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The period of [[Insular art]], mainly in the fields of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, metalworking, and sculpture flourished and produced such treasures as the [[Book of Kells]], the [[Ardagh Chalice]], and the many carved [[high cross|stone crosses]] that dot the island. Insular style was to be a crucial ingredient in the formation of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles throughout Western Europe. Sites dating to this period include [[clochan]]s, [[ringfort]]s and [[promontory fort]]s.\n\n[[Francis John Byrne]] describes the effect of the epidemics which occurred during this era:\n<blockquote>\nThe plagues of the 660s and the 680s had a traumatic effect on Irish society. The golden age of the saints was over, together with the generation of kings who could fire a [[saga]]-writer's imagination. The literary tradition looks back to the reign of the sons of [[Aed Slaine]] (Diarmait and Blathmac, who died in 665) as to the end of an era. Antiquaries, [[brehon]]s, [[Genealogy|genealogists]] and [[Hagiography|hagiographers]], felt the need to collect ancient traditions before they were totally forgotten. Many were in fact swallowed by oblivion; when we examine the writing of [[Tirechan]] we encounter obscure references to tribes which are quite unknown to the later genealogical tradition. The laws describe a ... society that was [[obsolescent]], and the meaning and use of the word ''moccu''<ref>Meaning \"pertaining to the tribe of . .\", or roughly equivalent to the later \"Mc\" or \"Mac\"</ref> dies out with archaic [[Old Irish]] at the beginning of the new century.<ref>\"Tribes and Tribalism in Early Ireland\", [[\u00c9riu (journal)]] 22, 1971, p. 153</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe first English involvement in Ireland took place in this period. Tullylease, [[Abbey of Rathmelsigi|Rath Melsigi]] and [[Mayo, County Mayo|Maigh Eo na Saxain]] were founded by 670 for English students who wished to study or live in Ireland. In summer 684, an English expeditionary force sent by [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]]n King [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|Ecgfrith]] raided Brega.\n\n==Early medieval and Viking era (800\u20131166)==\n{{Main|History of Ireland (800\u20131169)}}\n[[File:Viking Ireland.png|thumb|Map showing the [[Longphort|Viking settlements]] in Ireland]]\nThe first recorded [[Viking]] raid in Irish history occurred in 795 AD when Vikings from [[Norway]] looted the island. Early Viking raids were generally fast-paced and small in scale. These early raids interrupted the golden age of Christian Irish culture and marked the beginning of two centuries of intermittent warfare, with waves of Viking raiders plundering monasteries and towns throughout Ireland. Most of those early raiders came from western Norway.\n\nThe Vikings were expert sailors, who travelled in [[longship]]s, and by the early 840s, had begun to establish settlements along the Irish coasts and to spend the winter months there. The longships were technologically advanced, allowing them to travel faster through the narrow rivers. Vikings founded settlements in several places; most famously in [[Dublin]]. Most of the settlements were near the water, allowing the Vikings to trade using their longships. Written accounts from this time (early to mid 840s) show that the Vikings were moving further inland to attack (often using rivers) and then retreating to their coastal headquarters.\n\nIn 852, the Vikings landed in [[Dublin Bay]] and established a fortress. Dublin became the centre for trade of many goods, especially slaves. Bringing back new ideas and motivations, they began settling more permanently. In the tenth century an earthen bank was constructed around the city with a second larger bank built outside that in the eleventh century. On the interior of the town, an extensive series of defences have been excavated at Fishamble Street, Dublin. The site featured nine waterfronts, including two possible flood banks and two positive defensive embankments during the Viking Age. The early embankments were non-defensive, being only one metre high, and it is uncertain how much of the site they encircled. After several generations a group of mixed Irish and Norse ethnic background arose, the ''[[Norse\u2013Gaels|Gall-Gaels]]'', '(''Gall'' being the Old Irish word for foreign).\n\nThe second wave of Vikings made stations at winter-bases called [[longphort]]s to serve as control centres to exert a more localized force on the island through raiding. The third wave in 917 established towns as not only control centres, but also as centres of trade to enter into Irish economy and greater Western Europe. Returning to Dublin, they set up a market town. Over the next century a great period of economic growth would spread across the pastoral country. The Vikings introduced the concept of international trade to the Irish,{{dubious|date=May 2018}} as well as popularizing a silver based economy with local trade and the first minting of coins in 997.\n\nIn 902 [[M\u00e1el Finnia mac Flannacain]] of Brega and [[Cerball mac Muirec\u00e1in]] of Leinster joined forces against Dublin, and \"The heathens were driven from Ireland, i.e. from the fortress of \u00c1th Cliath [Dublin]\".<ref group=\"note\">[[#AU|AU 902.2]] Note that the untranslated text [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100001A.html] reads: \"Indarba n-gennti a h-Ere, .\u00ed. longport Atha Cliath o Mael Findia m.

The [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014 began the decline of Viking power in Ireland but the towns which Vikings had founded continued to flourish, and trade became an important part of the Irish economy.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Norman Ireland (1168\u20131535)==\n{{Main|History of Ireland (1169\u20131536)}}\n\n===Arrival of the Normans===\n{{Main|Norman invasion of Ireland}}\n[[File:Ireland tower house near quin county clare.jpg|thumb|A tower house near [[Quin, County Clare]]. The Normans consolidated their presence in Ireland by building hundreds of castles and towers such as this.]]\n\nBy the 12th century, Ireland was divided politically into a shifting hierarchy of [[petty kingdom]]s and over-kingdoms. Power was exercised by the heads of a few regional dynasties vying against each other for supremacy over the whole island. One of these men, King [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] of [[Leinster]] was forcibly exiled by the new High King, [[Ruaidri mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] of the Western kingdom of Connacht. Fleeing to [[Aquitaine]], Diarmait obtained permission from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] to recruit [[Normans|Norman]] knights to regain his kingdom. The first Norman knights landed in Ireland in 1167, followed by the main forces of Normans, Welsh and [[Flanders|Flemings]]. Several counties were restored to the control of Diarmait, who named his son-in-law, the Norman [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]], known as Strongbow, heir to his kingdom. This troubled King Henry, who feared the establishment of a rival Norman state in Ireland. Accordingly, he resolved to establish his authority.  In 1177 Prince [[John Lackland]] was made [[Lord of Ireland]] by his father [[Henry II of England]] at the [[Council of Oxford]].<ref>Connolly, S.J., ''The Oxford Companion to Irish History'', 2007, Oxford Univ.

Henry awarded his Irish territories to his younger son John with the title ''Dominus Hiberniae'' (\"Lord of Ireland\"). When John unexpectedly succeeded his brother as [[John of England|King John of England]], the \"[[Lordship of Ireland]]\" fell directly under the English Crown.\n<div style=\"float:left;\">[[File:Www.wesleyjohnston.com-users-ireland-maps-historical-map1014.gif|thumb|left|Ireland in 1014: a patchwork of rival kingdoms]]</div>\n<div style=\"float:left;\">[[File:www.wesleyjohnston.com-users-ireland-maps-historical-map1300.gif|thumb|left|The extent of Norman control of Ireland in 1300]]</div>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Lordship of Ireland===\n{{Main|Lordship of Ireland}}\nThe Normans initially controlled the entire east coast, from [[Waterford]] to eastern [[Ulster]], and penetrated a considerable distance inland as well. The counties were ruled by many smaller kings. The first Lord of Ireland was King John, who visited Ireland in 1185 and 1210 and helped consolidate the Norman-controlled areas, while ensuring that the many Irish kings swore fealty to him.\n\nThroughout the thirteenth century the policy of the English Kings was to weaken the power of the Norman Lords in Ireland. For example, King John encouraged [[Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster|Hugh de Lacy]] to destabilise and then overthrow the Lord of Ulster, before naming him as the first Earl of Ulster. The [[Hiberno-Norman]] community suffered from a series of invasions that ceased the spread of their settlement and power. Politics and events in Gaelic Ireland served to draw the settlers deeper into the orbit of the Irish.\n\n===Gaelic resurgence and Norman decline===\n[[File:Durer-Irish-16thC.jpg|thumb|right|Irish soldiers, 1521 \u2013 by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]].]]\nBy 1261 the weakening of the [[Normans]] had become manifest when [[F\u00ednghin Mac Carthaigh|Fineen MacCarthy]] defeated a Norman army at the [[Battle of Callann]]. The war continued between the different lords and earls for about 100 years, causing much destruction, especially around Dublin. In this chaotic situation, local Irish lords won back large amounts of land that their families had lost since the conquest and held them after the war was over.\n\nThe [[Black Death]] arrived in Ireland in 1348. Because most of the English and Norman inhabitants of Ireland lived in towns and villages, the plague hit them far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the country again. The English-controlled territory shrank to a fortified area around Dublin ([[the Pale]]), whose rulers had little real authority outside (beyond the Pale).\n\nBy the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared. England's attentions were diverted by the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The [[Lordship of Ireland]] lay in the hands of the powerful Fitzgerald [[Earl of Kildare]], who dominated the country by means of military force and alliances with Irish lords and clans. Around the country, local Gaelic and [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] lords expanded their powers at the expense of the English government in Dublin but the power of the Dublin government was seriously curtailed by the introduction of [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] in 1494. According to this act the Irish Parliament was essentially put under the control of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]].\n\n==Early modern Ireland (1536\u20131691)==\n{{Main|History of Ireland (1536\u20131691)}}\n\n===Conquest and rebellion===\n{{Main|Tudor conquest of Ireland|Kingdom of Ireland}}\nFrom 1536, Henry VIII of England decided to reconquer Ireland and bring it under crown control. The Fitzgerald dynasty of [[Earl of Kildare|Kildare]], who had become the effective rulers of Ireland in the 15th century, had become unreliable allies of the Tudor monarchs. They had invited [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] troops into Dublin to crown the [[Yorkist]] pretender, [[Lambert Simnel]] as [[King of England]] in 1487. Again in 1536, [[Silken Thomas]] Fitzgerald went into open rebellion against the crown. Having put down this rebellion, Henry resolved to bring Ireland under English government control so the island would not become a base for future rebellions or foreign invasions of England. In 1541, he upgraded Ireland from a lordship to a full [[Kingdom of Ireland|Kingdom]]. Henry was proclaimed King of Ireland at a meeting of the Irish Parliament that year. This was the first meeting of the Irish Parliament to be attended by the [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic Irish]] chieftains as well as the [[Hiberno-Norman]] aristocracy. With the institutions of government in place, the next step was to extend the control of the English Kingdom of Ireland over all of its claimed territory. This took nearly a century, with various English administrations either negotiating or fighting with the independent Irish and Old English lords. The [[Spanish Armada in Ireland]] suffered heavy losses during an extraordinary season of storms in the autumn of 1588. Among the survivors was Captain [[Francisco de Cuellar]], who gave a remarkable account of his experiences on the run in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro63.shtml 'The Wild Irish are Barbarous and Most Filthy in their Diet'], bbc.co.uk</ref>\n\nThe re-conquest was completed during the reigns of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and [[James I of England|James I]], after several brutal conflicts. (See the [[Desmond Rebellions]], 1569\u201373 and 1579\u201383, and the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]], 1594\u20131603, for details.) After this point, the English authorities in Dublin established real control over Ireland for the first time, bringing a centralised government to the entire island, and successfully disarmed the native lordships. In 1614 the Catholic majority in the Irish Parliament was overthrown through the creation of numerous new boroughs which were dominated by the new settlers. However, the English were not successful in converting the Catholic Irish to the Protestant religion and the brutal methods used by crown authority (including resorting to [[martial law]]) to bring the country under English control, heightened resentment of English rule.\n\nFrom the mid-16th to the early 17th century, crown governments had carried out a policy of land confiscation and [[colonisation]] known as [[Plantations of Ireland|Plantations]]. Scottish and English Protestant colonists were sent to the provinces of [[Munster]], [[Ulster]] and the counties of [[Laois]] and [[Offaly]]. These Protestant settlers replaced the Irish Catholic landowners who were removed from their lands. These settlers formed the ruling class of future British appointed administrations in Ireland. Several [[Penal Laws]], aimed at Catholics, Baptists and Presbyterians, were introduced to encourage conversion to the established ([[Anglican]]) [[Church of Ireland]].\n\n===Wars and penal laws===\n\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell by Samuel Cooper.jpg|left|thumb|After an unusually bitter Irish Catholic rebellion and civil war, [[Oliver Cromwell]], on behalf of the English Commonwealth, re-conquered Ireland by invasion which lasted from 1649 to 1651. Under Cromwell's government, landownership in Ireland was transferred overwhelmingly to [[Puritan]] soldiery and commercial undertakers to pay for the war.]]\n\nThe 17th century was perhaps the bloodiest in Ireland's history. Two periods of war (1641\u201353 and 1689\u201391) caused huge loss of life. The ultimate dispossession of most of the Irish Catholic landowning class was engineered, and recusants were subordinated under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]].\n\nDuring the 17th century, Ireland was convulsed by [[Irish Confederate Wars|eleven years of warfare]], beginning with the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|Rebellion of 1641]], when Irish Catholics rebelled against the domination of English and Protestant settlers. The Catholic gentry briefly ruled the country as [[Confederate Ireland]] (1642\u20131649) against the background of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] until [[Oliver Cromwell]] [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|reconquered]] Ireland in 1649\u20131653 on behalf of the [[English Commonwealth]]. Cromwell's conquest was the most brutal phase of the war. By its close, around half of Ireland's pre-war population was killed or exiled as slaves, where many died due to harsh conditions. As retribution for the rebellion of 1641, the better-quality remaining lands owned by Irish Catholics were confiscated and [[Cromwellian Plantation|given to British settlers]]. Several hundred remaining native landowners were transplanted to [[Connacht]].\n\n[[File:King James II by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[James II of England]] by [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]].<br>Forty years later, Irish Catholics, known as \"Jacobites\", fought for James from 1688 to 1691, but failed to restore James to the throne of Ireland, England and Scotland.]]\nIreland became the main battleground after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, when the Catholic [[James II of England|James II]] left London and the [[Convention Parliament (1689)|English Parliament]] replaced him with [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. The wealthier Irish Catholics backed James to try to reverse the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] and land confiscations, whereas Protestants supported William and Mary in this \"Glorious Revolution\" to preserve their property in the country. James and William fought for the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in the [[Williamite war in Ireland|Williamite War]], most famously at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, where James's outnumbered forces were defeated.\n\n====Indentured Labour====\nFrom the 15th to the 18th century, Irish, English, Scots and Welsh prisoners were transported for forced labour in the Caribbean to work off their term of punishment. Even larger numbers came voluntarily as indentured servants. In the 18th century they were sent to the American colonies, and in the early 19th century to Australia.<ref>Kristen Block and Jenny Shaw,  \"Subjects Without an Empire: The Irish in the Early Modern Caribbean,\" ''Past & Present'' (2011) 210#1 pp 33-60.</ref><ref>Hilary McD.

In 1654 the British parliament gave [[Oliver Cromwell]] a free hand to banish Irish \"undesirables\". Cromwell rounded up Catholics throughout the Irish countryside and placed them on ships bound for the [[Caribbean]], mainly the island of [[Barbados]]. By 1655, 12,000 political prisoners had been forcibly shipped to Barbados and into indentured servitude.<ref name=\"Ph.D.1997\">{{cite book|author=Junius P Rodriguez, PhD|title=The historical encyclopedia of world slavery. 1.

Nevertheless, there was a growing Catholic cultural awakening underway.<ref>Ian McBride, ''Eighteenth-Century Ireland: The Isle of Slaves - The Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland'' (2009 ch 6-7</ref>  There were two Protestant groups.  The Presbyterians in Ulster in the North lived in much better economic conditions, but had virtually no political power. Power was held by a small group of Anglo-Irish families, who were  loyal to the Anglican Church of Ireland.  They owned the great bulk of the farmland, where the work was done by the Catholic peasants.  Many of these families lived in England and were absentee landlords, whose loyalty was basically to England.  The Anglo-Irish who lived in Ireland became increasingly identified as Irish nationalists, and were resentful of the English control of their island.  Their spokesmen, such as [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Edmund Burke]], sought more local control.<ref>R. F. Foster, ''Modern Ireland: 1600-1972'' (1988) pp 153-225</ref>\n\n[[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] resistance in Ireland was finally ended after the [[Battle of Aughrim]] in July 1691. The [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] that had been relaxed somewhat after the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] were reinforced more thoroughly after this war, as the infant [[Anglo-Irish]] Ascendency wanted to ensure that the Irish Roman Catholics would not be in a position to repeat their rebellions. Power was held by the 5% who were Protestants belonging to the Church of Ireland. They controlled  all major sectors of the Irish economy, the bulk of the farmland, the \nlegal system, local government and held strong majorities in both houses of the Irish Parliament.  They strongly distrusted the Presbyterians in Ulster, and were convinced that the Catholics should have minimal rights.   They did not have full political control because the government in London had superior authority and treated Ireland like a backward colony.  When the American colonies revolted in the 1770s, the Ascendency wrested multiple concessions to strengthen its power. They did not seek independence because they knew they were heavily outnumbered and ultimately depended upon the British Army to guarantee their security.<ref>Harry T. Dickinson, \"Why did the American Revolution not spread to Ireland?.\" ''Valahian Journal of Historical Studies'' #18-19 (2012) pp: 155-180.

Some [[absentee landlord]]s managed their estates inefficiently, and food tended to be produced for export rather than for domestic consumption. Two very cold winters near the end of the [[Little Ice Age]] led directly to a [[Irish Famine (1740\u20131741)|famine between 1740 and 1741]], which killed about 400,000 people and caused over 150,000 Irish to leave the island. In addition, Irish exports were reduced by the [[Navigation Acts]] from the 1660s, which placed tariffs on Irish products entering England, but exempted English goods from tariffs on entering Ireland. Despite this most of the 18th century was relatively peaceful in comparison with the preceding two centuries, and the population doubled to over four million.\n\nBy the 18th century, the [[Anglo-Irish]] ruling class had come to see Ireland, not England, as their native country.<ref>R. F. Foster, ''Modern Ireland: 1600-1972'' (1988) p 178</ref> A Parliamentary faction led by [[Henry Grattan]] agitated for a more favourable trading relationship with Great Britain and for greater legislative independence for the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. However, reform in Ireland stalled over the more radical proposals toward [[Catholic Emancipation|enfranchising Irish Catholics]]. This was partially enabled in 1793, but Catholics could not yet become members of the Irish Parliament, or become government officials. Some were attracted to the more militant example of the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.\n\nPresbyterians and Dissenters too faced persecution on a lesser scale, and in 1791 a group of dissident Protestant individuals, all of whom but two were Presbyterians, held the first meeting of what would become the [[Society of the United Irishmen]]. Originally they sought to reform the Irish Parliament which was controlled by those belonging to the state church; seek Catholic Emancipation; and help remove religion from politics. When their ideals seemed unattainable they became more determined to use force to overthrow British rule and found a non-sectarian republic. Their activity culminated in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], which was bloodily suppressed.\n\nIreland was a separate kingdom ruled by King George III of Britain; he set policy for Ireland through his appointment of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] or viceroy. In practice, the viceroys lived in England and the affairs in the island were largely controlled by an elite group of Irish Protestants known as \"undertakers.\"  The system changed in 1767, with the appointment of an English politician who became a very strong Viceroy. George Townshend served 1767-72 and was in residence in The Castle in Dublin. Townsend had the strong support of both the King and the British cabinet in London, and all major decisions were basically made in London.  The Ascendancy complained, and obtained a series of new laws in the 1780s that made the Irish Parliament effective and independent of the British Parliament, although still under the supervision of the king and his Privy Council.<ref>R.F. Foster, ''Modern Ireland 1600-1972'' (1988) pp 226-40</ref>\n\nLargely in response to the 1798 rebellion, Irish self-government was ended altogether by the provisions of the [[Acts of Union 1800]] (which abolished the Irish Parliament of that era).<ref>R. B. McDowell, ''Ireland in the age of imperialism and revolution, 1760\u20131801'' (1979)</ref>\n\n==Union with Great Britain (1801\u20131912)==\n{{Main|History of Ireland (1801\u20131923)}}\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell - Project Gutenberg 13103.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Daniel O'Connell]]]]\n\nIn 1800, following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], the Irish and the British parliaments enacted the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]]. The merger created a new political entity called [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] with effect from 1 January 1801. Part of the agreement forming the basis of union was that the [[Test Act]] would be repealed to remove any remaining discrimination against Roman Catholics, [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Presbyterians]], [[Baptists]] and other dissenter religions in the newly United Kingdom. However, King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], invoking the provisions of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] controversially and adamantly blocked attempts by Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]]. Pitt resigned in protest, but his successor [[Henry Addington]] and his new cabinet failed to legislate to repeal or change the [[Test Act]]. This was followed by the first [[Irish Reform Act 1832]], which allowed Catholic members of parliament but raised the property qualification to \u00a310 effectively removing the poorer Irish freeholders from [[Suffrage|the franchise]].\n\nIn 1823 an enterprising Catholic lawyer, [[Daniel O'Connell]], known in Ireland as 'The Liberator' began an ultimately successful Irish campaign to achieve emancipation, and to be seated in the Parliament. This culminated in O'Connell's successful election in the Clare by-election, which revived the parliamentary efforts at reform.\n\nThe [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]] was eventually approved by the UK parliament under the leadership of the Dublin-born Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]. This indefatigable Anglo-Irish statesman, a former Chief Secretary for Ireland, and hero of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], successfully guided the legislation through both houses of Parliament. By threatening to resign, he persuaded King George IV to sign the bill into law in 1829. The continuing obligation of Roman Catholics to fund the established [[Church of Ireland]], however, led to the sporadic skirmishes of the [[Tithe War]] of 1831\u201338. The Church was disestablished by the [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone government]] in 1867. The continuing enactment of parliamentary reform during the ensuing administrations further extended the initially limited franchise. Daniel O'Connell M.P. later led the [[Repeal Association]] in an unsuccessful campaign to undo the [[Act of Union 1800]].<ref>Kee, Robert. ''The Green Flag''. London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1972. pp. 187\u2013243</ref>\n\nThe [[Great Irish Famine]] (''An Gorta M\u00f3r'') was the second of Ireland's \"Great Famines\". It struck the country during 1845\u201349, with [[potato blight]], exacerbated by the political factors of the time<ref>Cecil Woodham-Smith, ''The Great Hunger'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991, p. 19. {{ISBN|978-0-14-014515-1}}</ref> leading to mass starvation and emigration. The impact of emigration in Ireland was severe; the population dropped from over 8 million before the Famine to 4.4 million in 1911. [[Irish language|Gaelic]] or Irish, once the island's spoken language, declined in use sharply in the nineteenth century as a result of the Famine and the creation of the [[national school (Ireland)|National School]] education system, as well as hostility to the language from leading Irish politicians of the time; it was largely replaced by English.\n\nOutside mainstream nationalism, a series of violent rebellions by Irish republicans took place in 1803, under [[Robert Emmet]]; in 1848 a [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|rebellion]] by the [[Young Irelanders]], most prominent among them, [[Thomas Francis Meagher]]; and in 1867, [[Fenian Rising|another insurrection]] by the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]. All failed, but ''physical force nationalism'' remained an undercurrent in the nineteenth century.\n[[File:Family evicted by their landlord during the Irish Land War c1879.jpg|thumb|Irish family evicted at Moyasta, County Clare during [[Land War]], c.1879]]\nA central issue throughout the 19th and early 20th century was land ownership. A small group of about 10,000 English families owned practically all the farmland; Most were permanent residents of England, and seldom presented the land. They rented it out to Irish tenant farmers.  Falling behind in rent payments meant eviction, and very bad feelings \u2013 often violence.<ref>Michael J.

[[William O'Brien]] played a leading role in the 1902 [[Land Conference]] to pave the way for the most advanced social legislation in Ireland since the Union, the [[Wyndham Land Purchase Act]] of 1903. This Act set the conditions for the break-up of large estates and gradually devolved to rural landholders, and tenants' ownership of the lands. It effectively ended the era of the [[absentee landlord]], finally resolving the Irish Land Question.\n\nIn the 1870s the issue of Irish self-government again became a major focus of debate under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], founder of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] made two unsuccessful attempts to pass [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule]] in 1886 and 1893. Parnell's leadership ended when he was implicated in a divorce scandal that gained international publicity in 1890. He had been secretly living for years with [[Katherine Parnell|Katherine O'Shea]], the long-separated wife of a fellow Irish MP. Disaster came quickly: Gladstone and the Liberal Party refused to cooperate with him; his party split; the Irish Catholic bishops led the successful effort to crush his minority faction at by-elections.  Parnell fought for control to the end, but his body was collapsing and he died in 1891 at age 45.\n\nAfter the introduction of the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] which broke the power of the [[Protestant Ascendancy|landlord-dominated]] \"Grand Juries\", passing for the first time democratic control of local affairs into the hands of the people through elected Local County Councils, the debate over full Home Rule led to tensions between [[Irish nationalist]]s and [[Unionists (Ireland)|Irish unionists]] (those who favoured maintenance of the Union). Most of the island was predominantly nationalist, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and agrarian. The northeast, however, was predominantly unionist, Protestant and industrialised. Unionists feared a loss of political power and economic wealth in a predominantly rural, nationalist, Catholic home-rule state. Nationalists believed they would remain economically and politically second-class citizens without self-government. Out of this division, two opposing sectarian movements evolved, the Protestant ''[[Orange Order]]'' and the Catholic ''[[Ancient Order of Hibernians]]''.\n\n==Home Rule, Easter Rising and War of Independence (1912\u20131922)==\n{{main|Irish revolutionary period}}\n{{unbalanced|section|date=May 2019}}\nHome Rule became certain when in 1910 the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) under [[John Redmond]] held the balance of power in [[British House of Commons|Commons]] and the third Home Rule Bill was introduced in 1912. Unionist resistance was immediate with the formation of the [[Ulster Volunteers]]. In turn the [[Irish Volunteers]] were established to oppose them and enforce the introduction of self-government.\n[[File:Easter Proclamation of 1916.png|left|thumb|The [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Easter Proclamation]], issued by Leaders of the Easter Rising]]\n\nIn September 1914, just as the [[First World War]] broke out, the UK Parliament passed the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]] to establish self-government for Ireland, but it was suspended for the duration of the war. To ensure implementation of Home Rule after the war, nationalist leaders and the IPP under Redmond supported with [[Ireland and World War I|Ireland's participation]] in the British and [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] war effort under the [[Triple Entente]] against the expansion of [[Central Powers]]. The core of the Irish Volunteers were against this decision, but the majority left to form the [[National Volunteers]] who enlisted in [[Irish military diaspora#'Irish' named units of the British Army|Irish regiments]] of the [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]], the [[10th (Irish) Division|10th]] and [[16th (Irish) Division]]s, their Northern counterparts in the [[36th (Ulster) Division]]. Before the war ended, Britain made two concerted efforts to implement Home Rule, one in May 1916 and again with the [[Irish Convention]] during 1917\u20131918, but the Irish sides (Nationalist, Unionist) were unable to agree to terms for the temporary or permanent exclusion of Ulster from its provisions.\n\nThe period 1916\u20131921 was marked by political violence and upheaval, ending in the [[partition of Ireland]] and independence for 26 of its 32 counties. A failed militant attempt was made to gain separate independence for Ireland with the 1916 [[Easter Rising]], an insurrection in Dublin. Though support for the insurgents was small, the violence used in its suppression led to a swing in support of the rebels. In addition, the unprecedented [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|threat of Irishmen being conscripted]] to the [[British Army]] in 1918 (for service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as a result of the German [[Spring Offensive]]) accelerated this change. In the [[1918 Irish general election|December 1918 elections]] [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], the party of the rebels, won three-quarters of all seats in Ireland, twenty-seven [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s of which assembled in Dublin on 21 January 1919 to form a 32-county [[Irish Republic]] Parliament, the first [[First D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] [[Declaration of Independence (Ireland)|unilaterally declaring]] sovereignty over the entire island.\n\n{{IrishParliaments|clear=\"right\"}}\nUnwilling to negotiate any understanding with Britain short of complete independence, the [[Irish Republican Army]], the army of the newly declared Irish Republic, waged a guerilla war (the [[Irish War of Independence]]) from 1919 to 1921. In the course of the fighting and amid much acrimony, the Fourth [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] implemented Home Rule while separating the island into what the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British government]]'s Act termed \"[[Northern Ireland]]\" and \"[[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]\". In July 1921 the Irish and British governments agreed to a truce that halted the war. In December 1921 representatives of both governments signed an [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. The Irish delegation was led by [[Arthur Griffith]] and [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. This abolished the [[Irish Republic]] and created the [[Irish Free State]], a self-governing [[Dominion]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in the manner of Canada and Australia. Under the Treaty, [[Northern Ireland]] could opt out of the Free State and stay within the United Kingdom: it promptly did so. In 1922 both parliaments [[Second D\u00e1il#The Treaty|ratified the Treaty]], formalising independence for the 26-county Irish Free State (which renamed itself ''Ireland'' in 1937, and [[Republic of Ireland Act|declared itself a republic]] in 1949); while the 6-county Northern Ireland, gaining Home Rule for itself, remained part of the United Kingdom. For most of the next 75 years, each territory was strongly aligned to either [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] or [[Protestant]] ideologies, although this was more marked in the six counties of Northern Ireland.\n\n==Free State and Republic (1922\u2013present)==\n{{main|History of the Republic of Ireland|Irish Free State|Republic of Ireland|Names of the Irish state}}\n[[File:Ei-map.svg|left|thumb|Political map of Ireland]]\n\nThe treaty to sever the Union divided the republican movement into ''anti-Treaty'' (who wanted to fight on until an Irish Republic was achieved) and ''pro-Treaty'' supporters (who accepted the Free State as a first step towards full independence and unity). Between 1922 and 1923 both sides fought the bloody [[Irish Civil War]]. The new Irish Free State government defeated the anti-Treaty remnant of the [[Irish Republican Army]], imposing [[Executions during the Irish Civil War|multiple executions]]. This division among nationalists still colours Irish politics today, specifically between the two leading Irish political parties, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]].\n\nThe new Irish Free State (1922\u201337) existed against the backdrop of the growth of dictatorships in mainland Europe and a major [[Great depression|world economic downturn]] in 1929. In contrast with many contemporary European states it remained a democracy. Testament to this came when the losing faction in the Irish civil war, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s Fianna F\u00e1il, was able to take power peacefully by winning the [[1932 Irish general election|1932 general election]]. Nevertheless, until the mid-1930s, considerable parts of Irish society saw the Free State through the prism of the civil war, as a repressive, British-imposed state. It was only the peaceful change of government in 1932 that signalled the final acceptance of the Free State on their part. In contrast to many other states in the period, the Free State remained financially solvent as a result of low government expenditure, despite the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War|Economic War]] with Britain. However, unemployment and emigration were high. The population declined to a low of 2.7 million recorded in the 1961 census.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] had a powerful influence over the Irish state for much of its history. The clergy's influence meant that the Irish state had very conservative social policies, forbidding, for example, divorce, [[contraception]], abortion, pornography as well as encouraging the [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland|censoring and banning]] of many books and films. In addition the Church largely controlled the State's hospitals, schools and remained the largest provider of many other social services.\n\nWith the partition of Ireland in 1922, 92.6% of the Free State's population were Catholic while 7.4% were Protestant.<ref>M.E.Collins, Ireland 1868\u20131966, (1993) p. 431)</ref> By the 1960s the Protestant population had fallen by half. Although emigration was high among all the population, due to a lack of economic opportunity, the rate of Protestant emigration was disproportionate in this period. Many Protestants left the country in the early 1920s, either because they felt unwelcome in a predominantly Catholic and nationalist state, because they were afraid due to the burning of Protestant homes (particularly of the old landed class) by republicans during the civil war, because they regarded themselves as British and did not wish to live in an independent Irish state, or because of the economic disruption caused by the recent violence. The Catholic Church had also issued a decree, known as [[Ne Temere]], whereby the children of marriages between Catholics and Protestants had to be brought up as Catholics. From 1945, the emigration rate of Protestants fell and they became less likely to emigrate than Catholics.\n[[File:President's Trip to Europe- Motorcade in Dublin. President Kennedy, motorcade, spectators. Dublin, Ireland - NARA - 194227.jpg|thumb|President [[John F. Kennedy]] in motorcade in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] on 27 June 1963]]\n\nIn 1937 a new [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] re-established the state as ''Ireland'' (or ''[[\u00c9ire]]'' in Irish). The state remained neutral throughout [[World War II]] (see ''[[Irish neutrality]]''), which saved it from much of the horrors of the war, although tens of thousands volunteered to serve in the British forces. Ireland was also impacted by food rationing, and coal shortages; [[B\u00f3rd na M\u00f3na|peat production]] became a priority during this time. Though nominally neutral, recent studies have suggested a far greater level of involvement by the South with the Allies than was realised, with [[D Day]]'s date set on the basis of secret weather information on Atlantic storms supplied by Ireland. ''For more detail on 1939\u201345, see main article [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]''.\n\nIn 1949, Ireland left the British [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and was formally declared a republic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/70-years-since-ireland-became-a-republic-4597795-Apr2019/|title=Today marks 70 years since Ireland became a republic|first=Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed|last=Aodha|website=TheJournal.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Ireland underwent a major economic change under reforming [[Taoiseach]] (prime minister) [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] and Secretary of the Department of Finance [[T.K. Whitaker]], who produced a series of economic plans. Free second-level education was introduced by [[Donogh O'Malley]] as Minister for Education in 1968. From the early 1960s, Ireland sought admission to the [[European Economic Community]] but, because 90% of exports were to the United Kingdom market, it did not do so until the UK did, in 1973.\n\nGlobal economic problems in the 1970s, augmented by a set of misjudged economic policies followed by governments, including that of Taoiseach [[Jack Lynch]], caused the Irish economy to stagnate. [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland discouraged foreign investment. Devaluation was enabled when the Irish Pound, or Punt, was established as a separate currency in 1979, breaking the link with the UK's [[Pound sterling|sterling]]. However, economic reforms in the late 1980s, helped by investment from the [[European Community]], led to the emergence of one of the world's highest economic growth rates, with mass immigration (particularly of people from Asia and Eastern Europe) as a feature of the late 1990s. This period came to be known as the [[Celtic Tiger]] and was focused on as a model for economic development in the former Eastern Bloc states, which entered the [[European Union]] in the early 2000s (decade). Property values had risen by a factor of between four and ten between 1993 and 2006, in part fuelling the boom.\n\nIrish society adopted relatively liberal social policies during this period. Divorce was legalised, homosexuality decriminalised, and abortion in limited cases was allowed by the Irish Supreme Court in the [[X Case]] legal judgement. Major scandals in the Roman Catholic Church, both sexual and financial, coincided with a widespread decline in religious practice, with weekly attendance at Roman Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] dropping by half in twenty years. [[Public inquiries in the Republic of Ireland|A series of tribunals]] set up from the 1990s have investigated alleged malpractices by politicians, the Catholic clergy, judges, hospitals and the Garda\u00ed (police).\n\nIreland's new found prosperity ended abruptly in 2008 when the [[bank|banking system]] collapsed due to the [[Irish property bubble]] bursting. Some 25-26% of GDP was needed to bail out failing Irish banks and force banking sector consolidation. This was the largest banking bailout for any country in history, in comparison only 7\u20138% of GDP was needed to bail out failing Finnish banks in its banking crisis in the 1990s. This resulted in a major [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial and political crisis]] as Ireland entered a [[recession]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/indicators/default.aspx?id=1NQQ17A|title=Central Statistics Office Ireland Key short-term economic indicators:Gross Domestic Product (GDP)|website=Cso.ie|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref> Emigration rose to 1989 levels as the unemployment rate rose from 4.2% in 2007 to reach 14.6% as of February 2012.<ref>[http://insideireland.ie/2012/03/07/cso-figures-reveal-unemployment-levels-59631/ CSO figures reveal unemployment levels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308225201/http://insideireland.ie/2012/03/07/cso-figures-reveal-unemployment-levels-59631/ |date=8 March 2012 }} - Inside Ireland, 7 March 2012</ref>\n\nHowever, since 2014, Ireland has seen strong economic growth, dubbed as the \"[[Celtic Phoenix]]\".\n\n==Northern Ireland (1921\u2013present)==\n{{Main|History of Northern Ireland}}\n\n===\"A Protestant state\" (1921\u20131972)===\nThe 1920 Government of Ireland Bill created the state of [[Northern Ireland]], which consisted of the six northeastern counties of Londonderry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Antrim, Down and Armagh.<ref>Paseta, Senia: \"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", p. 102. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> From 1921 to 1972, Northern Ireland was governed by a [[Ulster Unionist Party|Unionist]] government, based at [[Stormont, Belfast|Stormont]] in east Belfast. Unionist leader and first Prime Minister, [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], declared that it would be \"a Protestant State for a Protestant People\". Craig's goal was to form and preserve Protestant authority in the new state which was above all an effort to secure a unionist majority. In 1926 the majority of the population in the province were Presbyterian and Anglican therefore solidifying Craig's Protestant political power. The Ulster Unionist Party thereafter formed every government until 1972.<ref>Paseta, Senia: \"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 102\u2013104.

As time went on it became clear that these two rival states would bring about a civil war. After the Second World War, keeping the cohesion within Stormont seemed impossible; increased economic pressures, solidified Catholic unity, and British involvement ultimately led to Stormont's collapse. As the civil rights movement of the United States gained worldwide acknowledgement, Catholics rallied together to achieve a similar socio-political recognition. This resulted in the formation of various organisations such as the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in 1967 and the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) in 1964.<ref>Paseta, Senia: \"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 108\u2013110. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> Non-violent protest became an increasingly important factor in mobilising Catholic sympathies and opinion and thus more effective in generating support than actively violent groups such as the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. However, these non-violent protests posed a problem to Northern Ireland's prime minister Terrance O'Neil (1963) because it hampered his efforts to persuade Catholics in Northern Ireland that they too, like their Protestant counterparts, belong within the United Kingdom. Despite O'Neil's reforming efforts there was growing discontent amongst both Catholics and Unionists. In October 1968 a peaceful civil rights march in Derry turned violent as police brutally beat protesters. The outbreak was televised by international media, and as a result the march was highly publicised which further confirmed the socio-political turmoil in Ireland.<ref>Paseta, Senia: \"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 110\u2013114. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> A violent counter-reaction from conservative unionists led to civil disorder, notably the [[Battle of the Bogside]] and the [[Northern Ireland riots of August 1969]]. To restore order, British troops were deployed to the streets of Northern Ireland at that time.\n\nThe violent outbreaks in the late 1960s encouraged and helped strengthen military groups such as the IRA, who served as the protectors of the working class Catholics who were vulnerable to police and civilian brutality. During the late sixties and early seventies recruitment into the IRA organisation dramatically increased as street and civilian violence worsened. The interjection from the British troops proved to be insufficient to quell the violence and thus solidified the IRA's growing military importance.<ref>Paseta, Senia: \"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 114\u2013116. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> On 30 January 1972 the worst tensions came to a head with the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]]. Paratroops opened fire on civil rights protesters in Derry, killing 13 unarmed civilians. [[Bloody Friday (1972)|Bloody Friday]], Bloody Sunday, and other violent acts in the early 1970s came to be known as [[the Troubles]]. The Stormont parliament was [[Legislative session#Prorogation|prorogued]] in 1972 and abolished in 1973. Paramilitary private armies such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], resulted from a split within the IRA, the [[Official IRA]] and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] fought against the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] and the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]]. Moreover, the [[British army]] and the (largely Protestant) [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) also took part in the chaos that resulted in the deaths of over 3,000 men, women and children, civilians and military. Most of the violence took place in Northern Ireland, but some also spread to England and across the Irish border.\n{{Irish police|clear=\"right\"}}\n\n===Direct rule (1972\u20131999)===\nFor the next 27\u00bd years, with the exception of five months in 1974, Northern Ireland was under \"[[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]]\" with a [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] in the British Cabinet responsible for the departments of the Northern Ireland government. [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|Direct Rule]] was designed to be a temporary solution until Northern Ireland was capable of governing itself again. Principal acts were passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] in the same way as for much of the rest of the UK, but many smaller measures were dealt with by [[Order in Council]] with minimal parliamentary scrutiny.  Attempts were made to establish a power-sharing executive, representing both the nationalist and unionist communities, by the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973|Northern Ireland Constitution Act]] of 1973 and the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] in December 1973. Both acts however did little to create cohesion between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Constitution Act of 1973 formalised the UK government's affirmation of reunification of Ireland by consent only; therefore ultimately delegating the authoritative power of the border question from Stormont to the people of Northern Ireland (and the Republic of Ireland). Conversely, the Sunningdale Agreement included a \"provision of a Council of Ireland which held the right to execute executive and harmonizing functions\". Most significantly, the Sunningdale Agreement brought together political leaders from Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the UK to deliberate for the first time since 1925.<ref>Paseta, Senia :\"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 116\u2013118. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> The Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention and Jim Prior's 1982 assembly were also temporarily implemented; however all failed to either reach consensus or operate in the longer term.\n\nDuring the 1970s British policy concentrated on defeating the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) by military means including the policy of [[Ulsterisation]] (requiring the RUC and British Army reserve [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] to be at the forefront of combating the IRA). Although IRA violence decreased it was obvious that no military victory was on hand in either the short or medium terms. Even Catholics who generally rejected the IRA were unwilling to offer support to a state that seemed to remain mired in [[sectarian]] discrimination, and the Unionists were not interested in Catholic participation in running the state in any case. In the 1980s the IRA attempted to secure a decisive military victory based on massive arms shipments from [[Libya]]. When this failed, senior republican figures began to look to broaden the struggle from purely military means. In time this began a move towards [[TUAS|military cessation]]. In 1985 the Irish and British governments signed the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] signalling a formal partnership in seeking a political solution. The Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA) recognised the Irish government's right to be consulted and heard as well as guaranteed equality of treatment and recognition of the Irish and British identities of the two communities. The agreement also stated that the two governments must implement a cross-border co-operation.<ref>Paseta, Senia :\"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 119\u2013121. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> Socially and economically Northern Ireland suffered the worst levels of unemployment in the UK and although high levels of public spending ensured a slow modernisation of public services and moves towards equality, progress was slow in the 1970s and 1980s. Only in the 1990s, when progress toward peace became tangible, did the economic situation brighten. By then the demographics of Northern Ireland had undergone significant change, and more than 40% of the population was Catholic.\n\n===Devolution and direct rule (1999\u2013present)===\nMore recently, the [[Belfast Agreement]] (\"Good Friday Agreement\") of 10 April 1998 brought \u2013 on 2 December 1999 \u2013 a degree of power sharing to Northern Ireland, giving both [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]] and nationalists control of limited areas of government. However, both the power-sharing Executive and the elected Assembly were suspended between January and May 2000, and from October 2002 until April 2007, following breakdowns in trust between the political parties involving outstanding issues, including \"decommissioning\" of paramilitary weapons, [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|policing reform]] and the removal of [[British army]] bases. In new elections in 2003, the moderate [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]] and (nationalist) [[Social Democrat and Labour Party|Social Democrat and Labour]] parties lost their dominant positions to the more hard-line [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionist]] and (nationalist) [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] parties. On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and on 25 September 2005 international weapons inspectors supervised the full disarmament of the PIRA. Eventually, devolution was restored in April 2007.\n\n==Modern Ireland==\nIreland's economy became more diverse and sophisticated than ever before by integrating itself into the global economy. In 1973, Ireland acceded to the European Economic Community [EEC], precursor to the European Community [EC] and European Union [EU], at the same time as the UK. By the beginning of the 1990s Ireland had transformed itself into a modern industrial economy and generated substantial national income that benefited the entire nation. Although dependence on agriculture still remained high, Ireland's industrial economy produced sophisticated goods that rivalled international competition. Ireland's international economic boom of the 1990s led to its being called a [[Celtic Tiger]].\n\nThe Catholic Church, which once exercised great power, found its influence on socio-political issues in Ireland much reduced. Irish bishops were no longer able to advise and influence the public on how to exercise their political rights. Modern Ireland's detachment of the Church from ordinary life can be explained by the increasing disinterest in Church doctrine by younger generations and the questionable morality of the Church's representatives. A highly publicised case was that of Eamonn Casey, the [[Bishop of Galway]], who resigned abruptly in 1992 after it was revealed that he had had an affair with an American woman and had fathered a child. Further controversies and scandals arose concerning paedophile and child-abusing priests. As a result, many in the Irish public began to question the credibility and effectiveness of the Catholic Church.<ref>Paseta, Senia: \"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 128\u2013141. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> In 2011 Ireland closed its embassy at the Vatican, an apparent result of this growing trend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0218/1224311977327.html|title=Closure of Vatican embassy has wide-ranging implications|date=18 February 2012|work=The Irish Times}}</ref>\n\n==Flags in Ireland==\n[[File:Flag of Ireland.svg|left|180px|thumb|The [[flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]]]]\n[[File:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|left|180px|thumb|The [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]] (See also [[flag of Northern Ireland]])]]\nThe national flag of Ireland is a tricolour of green, white and orange.

Fellow nationalist [[John Mitchel]] said of it: \"I hope to see that flag one day waving as our national banner.\"\n\nAfter its use in the [[1916 Rising]] it became widely accepted by nationalists as the national flag, and was used officially by the [[Irish Republic]] (1919\u201321) and the [[Irish Free State]] (1922\u201337).\n\nIn 1937 when the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was introduced, the tricolour was formally confirmed as the national flag: \"The national flag is the tricolour of green, white and orange.\" While the tricolour today is the official flag of Ireland, it is not an official flag in Northern Ireland although it is sometimes used unofficially.\n\nThe only official flag representing [[Northern Ireland]] is the [[Union Flag]] of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland however its use is controversial.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20951202|title=Flags and symbols|first=Mark|last=Devenport|date=15 January 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref> The [[Ulster Banner]] is sometimes used unofficially as a de facto regional flag for Northern Ireland.\n\nSince Partition, there has been no universally-accepted flag to represent the entire island.

The receding of the ice after the Younger Dryas cold phase of the [[Quaternary glaciation|Quaternary]] around 9700 BC, heralds the beginning of [[Prehistoric Ireland]], which includes the archaeological periods known as the [[Mesolithic]], the [[Neolithic]] from about 4000 BC, the Copper and Bronze Age from about 2300 BC and [[Iron Age]] beginning about 600 BC. Ireland's bronze age begins with the emergence of \"[[Protohistory of Ireland|protohistoric]]\" [[Gaelic Ireland]] in the 2nd Millennium BC and ends with arrival of celtic la T\u00e8ne culture by central Europe \n\nBy the late 4th century AD Christianity had begun to gradually subsume or replace the earlier [[Celtic polytheism]]. By the end of the 6th century it had introduced writing along with a predominantly monastic [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic Christian]] church, profoundly altering Irish society.  [[Viking]] raids and settlement from the late 8th century AD resulted in extensive cultural interchange, as well as innovation in military and transport technology. Many of Ireland's towns were founded at this time as Viking trading posts and coinage made its first appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/art-and-design/what-have-the-vikings-ever-done-for-us-1.625270|title=What have the Vikings ever done for us?|author=|date=|website=The Irish Times}}</ref> Viking penetration was limited and concentrated along coasts and rivers, and ceased to be a major threat to Gaelic culture after the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014.  The [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]] in 1169 resulted again in a partial conquest of the island and marked the beginning of more than 800 years of English political and military involvement in Ireland. Initially successful, Norman gains were rolled back over succeeding centuries as a Gaelic resurgence<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://cora.ucc.ie/handle/10468/2578|title=The Resurgence of Gaelic power in Ireland and Scotland and its wider impact, c.1350-1513|first=Simon Peter|last=Egan|date=18 December 2018|publisher=|via=cora.ucc.ie}}</ref> reestablished Gaelic cultural preeminence over most of the country, apart from the walled towns and the area around [[Dublin]] known as [[The Pale]].\n\nReduced to the control of small pockets, the [[English Crown]] did not make another attempt to conquer the island until after the end of the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1488). This released resources and manpower for overseas expansion, beginning in the early 16th century.  However, the nature of Ireland's decentralised political organisation into small territories (known as [[t\u00faath]]a), martial traditions, difficult terrain and climate and lack of urban infrastructure, meant that attempts to assert Crown authority were slow and expensive. Attempts to impose the new Protestant faith were also successfully resisted by both the Gaelic and Norman-Irish. The new policy fomented the rebellion of the [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[Earl of Kildare]] [[Silken Thomas]] in 1534, keen to defend his traditional autonomy and Catholicism, and marked the beginning of the prolonged [[Tudor period|Tudor]] conquest of Ireland lasting from 1534 to 1603. [[Henry VIII]] proclaimed himself [[King of Ireland]] in 1541 to facilitate the project. Ireland became a potential battleground in the [[Religious wars in Europe|wars]] between Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] and [[Protestant Reformation]] Europe.\n\nEngland's attempts to either conquer or assimilate both the Hiberno-Norman lordships and the Gaelic territories into the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] provided the impetus for ongoing warfare, notable examples being the [[First Desmond Rebellion|1st Desmond Rebellion]], the [[Second Desmond Rebellion|2nd Desmond Rebellion]] and the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]]. This period was marked by the Crown policies of, at first, [[surrender and regrant]], and later, [[Plantations of Ireland|plantation]], involving the arrival of thousands of English and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Protestant]] settlers, and the displacement of both the Hiberno-Normans (or Old English as they were known by then) and the native [[Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic]] landholders. [[Gaelic Ireland]] was finally defeated at the [[battle of Kinsale]] in 1601 which marked the collapse of the Gaelic system and the beginning of Ireland's history as part of the [[British Empire]].\n\nDuring the 17th century, this division between a Protestant landholding minority and a dispossessed Catholic majority was intensified and conflict between them was to become a recurrent theme in Irish history.  Domination of Ireland by the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] was reinforced after two periods of religious war, the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] in 1641-52 and the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite war]] in 1689-91. Political power thereafter rested almost exclusively in the hands of a minority Protestant Ascendancy, while Catholics and members of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|dissenting]] Protestant denominations suffered severe political and economic privations under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]].\n\nOn 1 January 1801, in the wake of the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|United Irishmen Rebellion]], the [[Irish House of Commons|Irish Parliament]] was abolished and Ireland became part of a new [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] formed by the [[Acts of Union 1800]]. Catholics were not granted full rights until [[Catholic Emancipation]] in 1829, achieved by [[Daniel O\u2019Connell]]. The catastrophe of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] struck Ireland in 1845 resulting in over a million deaths from starvation and disease and in a million refugees fleeing the country, mainly to America.  Irish attempts to break away continued with [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell's]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] which strove from the 1880s to attain [[Irish Home Rule Bill|Home Rule]] through the parliamentary constitutional movement, eventually winning the [[Home Rule Act 1914]], although this Act was suspended at the outbreak of [[World War I]].\n\nIn 1916 the [[Easter Rising]] succeeded in turning public opinion against the British establishment after the execution of the leaders by British authorities. It also eclipsed the home rule movement.  In 1922, after the [[Irish War of Independence]] most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom to become the independent [[Irish Free State]] but under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] the six northeastern counties, known as [[Northern Ireland]], remained within the United Kingdom, creating the partition of Ireland. The treaty was opposed by many; their opposition led to the outbreak of the [[Irish Civil War]], in which [[Irish Free State]], or \"pro-treaty\", forces proved victorious. The [[history of Northern Ireland]] has since been dominated by the division of society along sectarian faultlines and conflict between (mainly Catholic) [[Irish Nationalism|Irish nationalist]]s and (mainly Protestant) [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]]. These divisions erupted into [[the Troubles]] in the late 1960s, after civil rights marches were met with opposition by authorities. The violence escalated after the deployment of the British Army to maintain authority led to clashes with nationalist communities. The violence continued for 28 years until an uneasy, but largely successful peace was finally achieved with the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998.\n\n==Prehistory (10,500 BC\u2013AD 400)==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Ireland}}\n\n===Stone Age to Bronze Age===\n[[File:Www.wesleyjohnston.com-users-ireland-maps-historical-ice age.gif|thumb|Ireland during the [[Ice Age]]]]\n\nWhat is known of pre-Christian Ireland comes from references in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writings, [[Irish poetry]] and myth, and archaeology.

Within these kingdoms a rich culture flourished. The society of these kingdoms was dominated by an upper class consisting of aristocratic warriors and learned people, which possibly included [[Druid]]s.\n\nLinguists realised from the 17th century onwards that the language spoken by these people, the [[Goidelic languages]], was a branch of the [[Celtic languages]]. This is usually explained as a result of invasions by [[Celt]]s from the continent. However, other research has postulated that the culture developed gradually and continuously, and that the introduction of Celtic language and elements of Celtic culture may have been a result of cultural exchange with Celtic groups in southwest continental Europe from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.<ref name=\"prospect\">{{cite web|accessdate=30 June 2011|publisher=Prospect Magazine|url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7817|title=Myths of British Ancestry}}</ref><ref name=\"hnn\">{{cite web|accessdate=30 June 2011|publisher=[[George Mason University]] History News Network|url=http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/7406.html|title=DNA Research Links Scots, Irish And Welsh To North-western Spain}}</ref>\n\nThe hypothesis that the native Late Bronze Age inhabitants gradually absorbed Celtic influences has since been supported by some recent genetic research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/capelli2_CB.pdf|title=A Y Chromosne Census of the British Isles (pdf)|website=Familytreedna.com|accessdate=15 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901035019/http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/capelli2_CB.pdf|archive-date=1 September 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans referred to Ireland as Scotia AD 500, and later [[Hibernia]]. [[Ptolemy]], in AD 100, recorded Ireland's geography and tribes. Ireland was never a part of the [[Roman Empire]], but Roman influence was often projected well beyond its borders. [[Tacitus]] writes that an exiled Irish prince was with [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] in [[Roman Britain]] and would return to seize power in Ireland. [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] tells us that Roman \"arms had been taken beyond the shores of Ireland\". In recent years, some experts have hypothesized that Roman-sponsored Gaelic forces (or perhaps even Roman regulars) mounted some kind of invasion around AD 100,<ref name='ba-n014-0596'>{{cite web|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba14/ba14feat.html|publisher=British Archaeology|title=Yes, the Romans did invade Ireland}}</ref> but the exact relationship between Rome and the dynasties and peoples of Hibernia remains unclear.\n\nIrish confederations (the [[Scoti]]) attacked and some settled in [[Great Britain|Britain]] during the [[Great Conspiracy]] of 367.  In particular, the [[D\u00e1l Riata]] settled in western Scotland and the [[Western Isles]].\n\n==Early Christian Ireland (400\u2013800)==\n{{Main|History of Ireland (400\u2013800)}}\n[[File:Glendalough monastery.jpg|thumb|[[Kevin of Glendalough|Kevin's]] monastery at [[Glendalough]], [[County Wicklow]]]]\n\nThe middle centuries of the first millennium AD marked great changes in Ireland. Politically, what appears to have been a prehistoric emphasis on tribal affiliation had been replaced by the 8th century by patrilineal dynasties ruling the island's kingdoms. Many formerly powerful kingdoms and peoples disappeared. Irish pirates struck all over the coast of western Britain in the same way that the Vikings would later attack Ireland. Some of these founded entirely new kingdoms in Pictland and, to a lesser degree, in parts of Cornwall, Wales, and Cumbria. The [[Attacotti]] of south [[Leinster]] may even have served in the Roman military in the mid-to-late 300s.<ref>*Philip Rance, 'Attacotti, D\u00e9isi and Magnus Maximus: the Case for Irish Federates in Late Roman Britain\u2019, ''Britannia'' 32 (2001), pp. 243\u2013270</ref>\n\nPerhaps it was some of the latter returning home as rich mercenaries, merchants, or slaves stolen from Britain or Gaul, that first brought the Christian faith to Ireland. Some early sources claim that there were missionaries active in southern Ireland long before [[St. Patrick]]. Whatever the route, and there were probably many, this new faith was to have the most profound effect on the Irish.\n\nTradition maintains that in A.D. 432, [[Saint Patrick|St. Patrick]] arrived on the island and, in the years that followed, worked to convert the Irish to Christianity. St Patrick's ''Confession'', in Latin, written by him is the earliest Irish historical document. It gives some information about the Saint.<ref>MacAmnaidh, S. 2013. ''Irish History.'' Parragon Books Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1-4723-2723-9}}</ref> On the other hand, according to [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], a contemporary chronicler, [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|Palladius]] was sent to Ireland by the Pope in 431 as ''\"first Bishop to the Irish believing in Christ\"'', which demonstrates that there were already Christians living in Ireland. Palladius seems to have worked purely as Bishop to Irish Christians in the Leinster and Meath kingdoms, while Patrick \u2013 who may have arrived as late as 461 \u2013 worked first and foremost as a missionary to the pagan Irish, in the more remote kingdoms in Ulster and Connacht.\n[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|A page from the [[Book of Kells]] that opens the [[Gospel of John]]]]\n\nPatrick is traditionally credited with preserving and codifying Irish laws and changing only those that conflicted with Christian practices. He is credited with introducing the [[Roman alphabet]], which enabled Irish monks to preserve parts of the extensive oral literature. The historicity of these claims remains the subject of debate and there is no direct evidence linking Patrick with any of these accomplishments. The myth of Patrick, as scholars refer to it, was developed in the centuries after his death.<ref>[[Carmel McCaffrey]], Leo Eaton \"In Search of Ancient Ireland\" Ivan R Dee (2002)PBS 2002</ref>\n\nIrish scholars excelled in the study of [[Latin]] learning and Christian theology in the monasteries that flourished shortly thereafter. [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Missionaries from Ireland]] to England and [[Continental Europe]] spread news of the flowering of learning, and scholars from other nations came to Irish monasteries. The excellence and isolation of these monasteries helped preserve Latin learning during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The period of [[Insular art]], mainly in the fields of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, metalworking, and sculpture flourished and produced such treasures as the [[Book of Kells]], the [[Ardagh Chalice]], and the many carved [[high cross|stone crosses]] that dot the island. Insular style was to be a crucial ingredient in the formation of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles throughout Western Europe. Sites dating to this period include [[clochan]]s, [[ringfort]]s and [[promontory fort]]s.\n\n[[Francis John Byrne]] describes the effect of the epidemics which occurred during this era:\n<blockquote>\nThe plagues of the 660s and the 680s had a traumatic effect on Irish society. The golden age of the saints was over, together with the generation of kings who could fire a [[saga]]-writer's imagination. The literary tradition looks back to the reign of the sons of [[Aed Slaine]] (Diarmait and Blathmac, who died in 665) as to the end of an era. Antiquaries, [[brehon]]s, [[Genealogy|genealogists]] and [[Hagiography|hagiographers]], felt the need to collect ancient traditions before they were totally forgotten. Many were in fact swallowed by oblivion; when we examine the writing of [[Tirechan]] we encounter obscure references to tribes which are quite unknown to the later genealogical tradition. The laws describe a ... society that was [[obsolescent]], and the meaning and use of the word ''moccu''<ref>Meaning \"pertaining to the tribe of . .\", or roughly equivalent to the later \"Mc\" or \"Mac\"</ref> dies out with archaic [[Old Irish]] at the beginning of the new century.<ref>\"Tribes and Tribalism in Early Ireland\", [[\u00c9riu (journal)]] 22, 1971, p. 153</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe first English involvement in Ireland took place in this period. Tullylease, [[Abbey of Rathmelsigi|Rath Melsigi]] and [[Mayo, County Mayo|Maigh Eo na Saxain]] were founded by 670 for English students who wished to study or live in Ireland. In summer 684, an English expeditionary force sent by [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]]n King [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|Ecgfrith]] raided Brega.\n\n==Early medieval and Viking era (800\u20131166)==\n{{Main|History of Ireland (800\u20131169)}}\n[[File:Viking Ireland.png|thumb|Map showing the [[Longphort|Viking settlements]] in Ireland]]\nThe first recorded [[Viking]] raid in Irish history occurred in 795 AD when Vikings from [[Norway]] looted the island. Early Viking raids were generally fast-paced and small in scale. These early raids interrupted the golden age of Christian Irish culture and marked the beginning of two centuries of intermittent warfare, with waves of Viking raiders plundering monasteries and towns throughout Ireland. Most of those early raiders came from western Norway.\n\nThe Vikings were expert sailors, who travelled in [[longship]]s, and by the early 840s, had begun to establish settlements along the Irish coasts and to spend the winter months there. The longships were technologically advanced, allowing them to travel faster through the narrow rivers. Vikings founded settlements in several places; most famously in [[Dublin]]. Most of the settlements were near the water, allowing the Vikings to trade using their longships. Written accounts from this time (early to mid 840s) show that the Vikings were moving further inland to attack (often using rivers) and then retreating to their coastal headquarters.\n\nIn 852, the Vikings landed in [[Dublin Bay]] and established a fortress. Dublin became the centre for trade of many goods, especially slaves. Bringing back new ideas and motivations, they began settling more permanently. In the tenth century an earthen bank was constructed around the city with a second larger bank built outside that in the eleventh century. On the interior of the town, an extensive series of defences have been excavated at Fishamble Street, Dublin. The site featured nine waterfronts, including two possible flood banks and two positive defensive embankments during the Viking Age. The early embankments were non-defensive, being only one metre high, and it is uncertain how much of the site they encircled. After several generations a group of mixed Irish and Norse ethnic background arose, the ''[[Norse\u2013Gaels|Gall-Gaels]]'', '(''Gall'' being the Old Irish word for foreign).\n\nThe second wave of Vikings made stations at winter-bases called [[longphort]]s to serve as control centres to exert a more localized force on the island through raiding. The third wave in 917 established towns as not only control centres, but also as centres of trade to enter into Irish economy and greater Western Europe. Returning to Dublin, they set up a market town. Over the next century a great period of economic growth would spread across the pastoral country. The Vikings introduced the concept of international trade to the Irish,{{dubious|date=May 2018}} as well as popularizing a silver based economy with local trade and the first minting of coins in 997.\n\nIn 902 [[M\u00e1el Finnia mac Flannacain]] of Brega and [[Cerball mac Muirec\u00e1in]] of Leinster joined forces against Dublin, and \"The heathens were driven from Ireland, i.e. from the fortress of \u00c1th Cliath [Dublin]\".<ref group=\"note\">[[#AU|AU 902.2]] Note that the untranslated text [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100001A.html] reads: \"Indarba n-gennti a h-Ere, .\u00ed. longport Atha Cliath o Mael Findia m.

The [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014 began the decline of Viking power in Ireland but the towns which Vikings had founded continued to flourish, and trade became an important part of the Irish economy.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Norman Ireland (1168\u20131535)==\n{{Main|History of Ireland (1169\u20131536)}}\n\n===Arrival of the Normans===\n{{Main|Norman invasion of Ireland}}\n[[File:Ireland tower house near quin county clare.jpg|thumb|A tower house near [[Quin, County Clare]]. The Normans consolidated their presence in Ireland by building hundreds of castles and towers such as this.]]\n\nBy the 12th century, Ireland was divided politically into a shifting hierarchy of [[petty kingdom]]s and over-kingdoms. Power was exercised by the heads of a few regional dynasties vying against each other for supremacy over the whole island. One of these men, King [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] of [[Leinster]] was forcibly exiled by the new High King, [[Ruaidri mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] of the Western kingdom of Connacht. Fleeing to [[Aquitaine]], Diarmait obtained permission from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] to recruit [[Normans|Norman]] knights to regain his kingdom. The first Norman knights landed in Ireland in 1167, followed by the main forces of Normans, Welsh and [[Flanders|Flemings]]. Several counties were restored to the control of Diarmait, who named his son-in-law, the Norman [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]], known as Strongbow, heir to his kingdom. This troubled King Henry, who feared the establishment of a rival Norman state in Ireland. Accordingly, he resolved to establish his authority.  In 1177 Prince [[John Lackland]] was made [[Lord of Ireland]] by his father [[Henry II of England]] at the [[Council of Oxford]].<ref>Connolly, S.J., ''The Oxford Companion to Irish History'', 2007, Oxford Univ. Press. p.423. {{ISBN|978-0-19-923483-7}}</ref>\n\nWith the authority of the papal bull [[Laudabiliter]] from [[Adrian IV]], Henry landed with a large fleet at [[Waterford]] in 1171, becoming the first [[King of England]] to set foot on Irish soil. Henry awarded his Irish territories to his younger son John with the title ''Dominus Hiberniae'' (\"Lord of Ireland\"). When John unexpectedly succeeded his brother as [[John of England|King John of England]], the \"[[Lordship of Ireland]]\" fell directly under the English Crown.\n<div style=\"float:left;\">[[File:Www.wesleyjohnston.com-users-ireland-maps-historical-map1014.gif|thumb|left|Ireland in 1014: a patchwork of rival kingdoms]]</div>\n<div style=\"float:left;\">[[File:www.wesleyjohnston.com-users-ireland-maps-historical-map1300.gif|thumb|left|The extent of Norman control of Ireland in 1300]]</div>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Lordship of Ireland===\n{{Main|Lordship of Ireland}}\nThe Normans initially controlled the entire east coast, from [[Waterford]] to eastern [[Ulster]], and penetrated a considerable distance inland as well. The counties were ruled by many smaller kings. The first Lord of Ireland was King John, who visited Ireland in 1185 and 1210 and helped consolidate the Norman-controlled areas, while ensuring that the many Irish kings swore fealty to him.\n\nThroughout the thirteenth century the policy of the English Kings was to weaken the power of the Norman Lords in Ireland. For example, King John encouraged [[Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster|Hugh de Lacy]] to destabilise and then overthrow the Lord of Ulster, before naming him as the first Earl of Ulster. The [[Hiberno-Norman]] community suffered from a series of invasions that ceased the spread of their settlement and power. Politics and events in Gaelic Ireland served to draw the settlers deeper into the orbit of the Irish.\n\n===Gaelic resurgence and Norman decline===\n[[File:Durer-Irish-16thC.jpg|thumb|right|Irish soldiers, 1521 \u2013 by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]].]]\nBy 1261 the weakening of the [[Normans]] had become manifest when [[F\u00ednghin Mac Carthaigh|Fineen MacCarthy]] defeated a Norman army at the [[Battle of Callann]]. The war continued between the different lords and earls for about 100 years, causing much destruction, especially around Dublin. In this chaotic situation, local Irish lords won back large amounts of land that their families had lost since the conquest and held them after the war was over.\n\nThe [[Black Death]] arrived in Ireland in 1348. Because most of the English and Norman inhabitants of Ireland lived in towns and villages, the plague hit them far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the country again. The English-controlled territory shrank to a fortified area around Dublin ([[the Pale]]), whose rulers had little real authority outside (beyond the Pale).\n\nBy the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared. England's attentions were diverted by the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The [[Lordship of Ireland]] lay in the hands of the powerful Fitzgerald [[Earl of Kildare]], who dominated the country by means of military force and alliances with Irish lords and clans. Around the country, local Gaelic and [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] lords expanded their powers at the expense of the English government in Dublin but the power of the Dublin government was seriously curtailed by the introduction of [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] in 1494. According to this act the Irish Parliament was essentially put under the control of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]].\n\n==Early modern Ireland (1536\u20131691)==\n{{Main|History of Ireland (1536\u20131691)}}\n\n===Conquest and rebellion===\n{{Main|Tudor conquest of Ireland|Kingdom of Ireland}}\nFrom 1536, Henry VIII of England decided to reconquer Ireland and bring it under crown control. The Fitzgerald dynasty of [[Earl of Kildare|Kildare]], who had become the effective rulers of Ireland in the 15th century, had become unreliable allies of the Tudor monarchs. They had invited [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] troops into Dublin to crown the [[Yorkist]] pretender, [[Lambert Simnel]] as [[King of England]] in 1487. Again in 1536, [[Silken Thomas]] Fitzgerald went into open rebellion against the crown. Having put down this rebellion, Henry resolved to bring Ireland under English government control so the island would not become a base for future rebellions or foreign invasions of England. In 1541, he upgraded Ireland from a lordship to a full [[Kingdom of Ireland|Kingdom]]. Henry was proclaimed King of Ireland at a meeting of the Irish Parliament that year. This was the first meeting of the Irish Parliament to be attended by the [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic Irish]] chieftains as well as the [[Hiberno-Norman]] aristocracy. With the institutions of government in place, the next step was to extend the control of the English Kingdom of Ireland over all of its claimed territory. This took nearly a century, with various English administrations either negotiating or fighting with the independent Irish and Old English lords. The [[Spanish Armada in Ireland]] suffered heavy losses during an extraordinary season of storms in the autumn of 1588. Among the survivors was Captain [[Francisco de Cuellar]], who gave a remarkable account of his experiences on the run in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro63.shtml 'The Wild Irish are Barbarous and Most Filthy in their Diet'], bbc.co.uk</ref>\n\nThe re-conquest was completed during the reigns of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] and [[James I of England|James I]], after several brutal conflicts. (See the [[Desmond Rebellions]], 1569\u201373 and 1579\u201383, and the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]], 1594\u20131603, for details.) After this point, the English authorities in Dublin established real control over Ireland for the first time, bringing a centralised government to the entire island, and successfully disarmed the native lordships. In 1614 the Catholic majority in the Irish Parliament was overthrown through the creation of numerous new boroughs which were dominated by the new settlers. However, the English were not successful in converting the Catholic Irish to the Protestant religion and the brutal methods used by crown authority (including resorting to [[martial law]]) to bring the country under English control, heightened resentment of English rule.\n\nFrom the mid-16th to the early 17th century, crown governments had carried out a policy of land confiscation and [[colonisation]] known as [[Plantations of Ireland|Plantations]]. Scottish and English Protestant colonists were sent to the provinces of [[Munster]], [[Ulster]] and the counties of [[Laois]] and [[Offaly]]. These Protestant settlers replaced the Irish Catholic landowners who were removed from their lands. These settlers formed the ruling class of future British appointed administrations in Ireland. Several [[Penal Laws]], aimed at Catholics, Baptists and Presbyterians, were introduced to encourage conversion to the established ([[Anglican]]) [[Church of Ireland]].\n\n===Wars and penal laws===\n\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell by Samuel Cooper.jpg|left|thumb|After an unusually bitter Irish Catholic rebellion and civil war, [[Oliver Cromwell]], on behalf of the English Commonwealth, re-conquered Ireland by invasion which lasted from 1649 to 1651. Under Cromwell's government, landownership in Ireland was transferred overwhelmingly to [[Puritan]] soldiery and commercial undertakers to pay for the war.]]\n\nThe 17th century was perhaps the bloodiest in Ireland's history. Two periods of war (1641\u201353 and 1689\u201391) caused huge loss of life. The ultimate dispossession of most of the Irish Catholic landowning class was engineered, and recusants were subordinated under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]].\n\nDuring the 17th century, Ireland was convulsed by [[Irish Confederate Wars|eleven years of warfare]], beginning with the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|Rebellion of 1641]], when Irish Catholics rebelled against the domination of English and Protestant settlers. The Catholic gentry briefly ruled the country as [[Confederate Ireland]] (1642\u20131649) against the background of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] until [[Oliver Cromwell]] [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|reconquered]] Ireland in 1649\u20131653 on behalf of the [[English Commonwealth]]. Cromwell's conquest was the most brutal phase of the war. By its close, around half of Ireland's pre-war population was killed or exiled as slaves, where many died due to harsh conditions. As retribution for the rebellion of 1641, the better-quality remaining lands owned by Irish Catholics were confiscated and [[Cromwellian Plantation|given to British settlers]]. Several hundred remaining native landowners were transplanted to [[Connacht]].\n\n[[File:King James II by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[James II of England]] by [[Sir Godfrey Kneller]].<br>Forty years later, Irish Catholics, known as \"Jacobites\", fought for James from 1688 to 1691, but failed to restore James to the throne of Ireland, England and Scotland.]]\nIreland became the main battleground after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, when the Catholic [[James II of England|James II]] left London and the [[Convention Parliament (1689)|English Parliament]] replaced him with [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. The wealthier Irish Catholics backed James to try to reverse the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] and land confiscations, whereas Protestants supported William and Mary in this \"Glorious Revolution\" to preserve their property in the country. James and William fought for the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in the [[Williamite war in Ireland|Williamite War]], most famously at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, where James's outnumbered forces were defeated.\n\n====Indentured Labour====\nFrom the 15th to the 18th century, Irish, English, Scots and Welsh prisoners were transported for forced labour in the Caribbean to work off their term of punishment. Even larger numbers came voluntarily as indentured servants. In the 18th century they were sent to the American colonies, and in the early 19th century to Australia.<ref>Kristen Block and Jenny Shaw,  \"Subjects Without an Empire: The Irish in the Early Modern Caribbean,\" ''Past & Present'' (2011) 210#1 pp 33-60.</ref><ref>Hilary McD.

In 1654 the British parliament gave [[Oliver Cromwell]] a free hand to banish Irish \"undesirables\". Cromwell rounded up Catholics throughout the Irish countryside and placed them on ships bound for the [[Caribbean]], mainly the island of [[Barbados]]. By 1655, 12,000 political prisoners had been forcibly shipped to Barbados and into indentured servitude.<ref name=\"Ph.D.1997\">{{cite book|author=Junius P Rodriguez, PhD|title=The historical encyclopedia of world slavery. 1.

Nevertheless, there was a growing Catholic cultural awakening underway.<ref>Ian McBride, ''Eighteenth-Century Ireland: The Isle of Slaves - The Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland'' (2009 ch 6-7</ref>  There were two Protestant groups.  The Presbyterians in Ulster in the North lived in much better economic conditions, but had virtually no political power. Power was held by a small group of Anglo-Irish families, who were  loyal to the Anglican Church of Ireland.  They owned the great bulk of the farmland, where the work was done by the Catholic peasants.  Many of these families lived in England and were absentee landlords, whose loyalty was basically to England.  The Anglo-Irish who lived in Ireland became increasingly identified as Irish nationalists, and were resentful of the English control of their island.  Their spokesmen, such as [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Edmund Burke]], sought more local control.<ref>R. F. Foster, ''Modern Ireland: 1600-1972'' (1988) pp 153-225</ref>\n\n[[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] resistance in Ireland was finally ended after the [[Battle of Aughrim]] in July 1691. The [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] that had been relaxed somewhat after the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] were reinforced more thoroughly after this war, as the infant [[Anglo-Irish]] Ascendency wanted to ensure that the Irish Roman Catholics would not be in a position to repeat their rebellions. Power was held by the 5% who were Protestants belonging to the Church of Ireland. They controlled  all major sectors of the Irish economy, the bulk of the farmland, the \nlegal system, local government and held strong majorities in both houses of the Irish Parliament.  They strongly distrusted the Presbyterians in Ulster, and were convinced that the Catholics should have minimal rights.   They did not have full political control because the government in London had superior authority and treated Ireland like a backward colony.  When the American colonies revolted in the 1770s, the Ascendency wrested multiple concessions to strengthen its power. They did not seek independence because they knew they were heavily outnumbered and ultimately depended upon the British Army to guarantee their security.<ref>Harry T. Dickinson, \"Why did the American Revolution not spread to Ireland?.\" ''Valahian Journal of Historical Studies'' #18-19 (2012) pp: 155-180.

Some [[absentee landlord]]s managed their estates inefficiently, and food tended to be produced for export rather than for domestic consumption. Two very cold winters near the end of the [[Little Ice Age]] led directly to a [[Irish Famine (1740\u20131741)|famine between 1740 and 1741]], which killed about 400,000 people and caused over 150,000 Irish to leave the island. In addition, Irish exports were reduced by the [[Navigation Acts]] from the 1660s, which placed tariffs on Irish products entering England, but exempted English goods from tariffs on entering Ireland. Despite this most of the 18th century was relatively peaceful in comparison with the preceding two centuries, and the population doubled to over four million.\n\nBy the 18th century, the [[Anglo-Irish]] ruling class had come to see Ireland, not England, as their native country.<ref>R. F. Foster, ''Modern Ireland: 1600-1972'' (1988) p 178</ref> A Parliamentary faction led by [[Henry Grattan]] agitated for a more favourable trading relationship with Great Britain and for greater legislative independence for the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. However, reform in Ireland stalled over the more radical proposals toward [[Catholic Emancipation|enfranchising Irish Catholics]]. This was partially enabled in 1793, but Catholics could not yet become members of the Irish Parliament, or become government officials. Some were attracted to the more militant example of the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.\n\nPresbyterians and Dissenters too faced persecution on a lesser scale, and in 1791 a group of dissident Protestant individuals, all of whom but two were Presbyterians, held the first meeting of what would become the [[Society of the United Irishmen]]. Originally they sought to reform the Irish Parliament which was controlled by those belonging to the state church; seek Catholic Emancipation; and help remove religion from politics. When their ideals seemed unattainable they became more determined to use force to overthrow British rule and found a non-sectarian republic. Their activity culminated in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], which was bloodily suppressed.\n\nIreland was a separate kingdom ruled by King George III of Britain; he set policy for Ireland through his appointment of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] or viceroy. In practice, the viceroys lived in England and the affairs in the island were largely controlled by an elite group of Irish Protestants known as \"undertakers.\"  The system changed in 1767, with the appointment of an English politician who became a very strong Viceroy. George Townshend served 1767-72 and was in residence in The Castle in Dublin. Townsend had the strong support of both the King and the British cabinet in London, and all major decisions were basically made in London.  The Ascendancy complained, and obtained a series of new laws in the 1780s that made the Irish Parliament effective and independent of the British Parliament, although still under the supervision of the king and his Privy Council.<ref>R.F. Foster, ''Modern Ireland 1600-1972'' (1988) pp 226-40</ref>\n\nLargely in response to the 1798 rebellion, Irish self-government was ended altogether by the provisions of the [[Acts of Union 1800]] (which abolished the Irish Parliament of that era).<ref>R.

The merger created a new political entity called [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] with effect from 1 January 1801. Part of the agreement forming the basis of union was that the [[Test Act]] would be repealed to remove any remaining discrimination against Roman Catholics, [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Presbyterians]], [[Baptists]] and other dissenter religions in the newly United Kingdom. However, King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], invoking the provisions of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] controversially and adamantly blocked attempts by Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]]. Pitt resigned in protest, but his successor [[Henry Addington]] and his new cabinet failed to legislate to repeal or change the [[Test Act]]. This was followed by the first [[Irish Reform Act 1832]], which allowed Catholic members of parliament but raised the property qualification to \u00a310 effectively removing the poorer Irish freeholders from [[Suffrage|the franchise]].\n\nIn 1823 an enterprising Catholic lawyer, [[Daniel O'Connell]], known in Ireland as 'The Liberator' began an ultimately successful Irish campaign to achieve emancipation, and to be seated in the Parliament. This culminated in O'Connell's successful election in the Clare by-election, which revived the parliamentary efforts at reform.\n\nThe [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]] was eventually approved by the UK parliament under the leadership of the Dublin-born Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]. This indefatigable Anglo-Irish statesman, a former Chief Secretary for Ireland, and hero of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], successfully guided the legislation through both houses of Parliament. By threatening to resign, he persuaded King George IV to sign the bill into law in 1829. The continuing obligation of Roman Catholics to fund the established [[Church of Ireland]], however, led to the sporadic skirmishes of the [[Tithe War]] of 1831\u201338. The Church was disestablished by the [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone government]] in 1867. The continuing enactment of parliamentary reform during the ensuing administrations further extended the initially limited franchise. Daniel O'Connell M.P. later led the [[Repeal Association]] in an unsuccessful campaign to undo the [[Act of Union 1800]].<ref>Kee, Robert. ''The Green Flag''. London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1972. pp. 187\u2013243</ref>\n\nThe [[Great Irish Famine]] (''An Gorta M\u00f3r'') was the second of Ireland's \"Great Famines\". It struck the country during 1845\u201349, with [[potato blight]], exacerbated by the political factors of the time<ref>Cecil Woodham-Smith, ''The Great Hunger'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991, p. 19. {{ISBN|978-0-14-014515-1}}</ref> leading to mass starvation and emigration. The impact of emigration in Ireland was severe; the population dropped from over 8 million before the Famine to 4.4 million in 1911. [[Irish language|Gaelic]] or Irish, once the island's spoken language, declined in use sharply in the nineteenth century as a result of the Famine and the creation of the [[national school (Ireland)|National School]] education system, as well as hostility to the language from leading Irish politicians of the time; it was largely replaced by English.\n\nOutside mainstream nationalism, a series of violent rebellions by Irish republicans took place in 1803, under [[Robert Emmet]]; in 1848 a [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|rebellion]] by the [[Young Irelanders]], most prominent among them, [[Thomas Francis Meagher]]; and in 1867, [[Fenian Rising|another insurrection]] by the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]. All failed, but ''physical force nationalism'' remained an undercurrent in the nineteenth century.\n[[File:Family evicted by their landlord during the Irish Land War c1879.jpg|thumb|Irish family evicted at Moyasta, County Clare during [[Land War]], c.1879]]\nA central issue throughout the 19th and early 20th century was land ownership. A small group of about 10,000 English families owned practically all the farmland; Most were permanent residents of England, and seldom presented the land. They rented it out to Irish tenant farmers.  Falling behind in rent payments meant eviction, and very bad feelings \u2013 often violence.<ref>Michael J.

[[William O'Brien]] played a leading role in the 1902 [[Land Conference]] to pave the way for the most advanced social legislation in Ireland since the Union, the [[Wyndham Land Purchase Act]] of 1903. This Act set the conditions for the break-up of large estates and gradually devolved to rural landholders, and tenants' ownership of the lands. It effectively ended the era of the [[absentee landlord]], finally resolving the Irish Land Question.\n\nIn the 1870s the issue of Irish self-government again became a major focus of debate under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], founder of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] made two unsuccessful attempts to pass [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule]] in 1886 and 1893. Parnell's leadership ended when he was implicated in a divorce scandal that gained international publicity in 1890. He had been secretly living for years with [[Katherine Parnell|Katherine O'Shea]], the long-separated wife of a fellow Irish MP. Disaster came quickly: Gladstone and the Liberal Party refused to cooperate with him; his party split; the Irish Catholic bishops led the successful effort to crush his minority faction at by-elections.  Parnell fought for control to the end, but his body was collapsing and he died in 1891 at age 45.\n\nAfter the introduction of the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] which broke the power of the [[Protestant Ascendancy|landlord-dominated]] \"Grand Juries\", passing for the first time democratic control of local affairs into the hands of the people through elected Local County Councils, the debate over full Home Rule led to tensions between [[Irish nationalist]]s and [[Unionists (Ireland)|Irish unionists]] (those who favoured maintenance of the Union). Most of the island was predominantly nationalist, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and agrarian. The northeast, however, was predominantly unionist, Protestant and industrialised. Unionists feared a loss of political power and economic wealth in a predominantly rural, nationalist, Catholic home-rule state. Nationalists believed they would remain economically and politically second-class citizens without self-government. Out of this division, two opposing sectarian movements evolved, the Protestant ''[[Orange Order]]'' and the Catholic ''[[Ancient Order of Hibernians]]''.\n\n==Home Rule, Easter Rising and War of Independence (1912\u20131922)==\n{{main|Irish revolutionary period}}\n{{unbalanced|section|date=May 2019}}\nHome Rule became certain when in 1910 the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) under [[John Redmond]] held the balance of power in [[British House of Commons|Commons]] and the third Home Rule Bill was introduced in 1912. Unionist resistance was immediate with the formation of the [[Ulster Volunteers]]. In turn the [[Irish Volunteers]] were established to oppose them and enforce the introduction of self-government.\n[[File:Easter Proclamation of 1916.png|left|thumb|The [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Easter Proclamation]], issued by Leaders of the Easter Rising]]\n\nIn September 1914, just as the [[First World War]] broke out, the UK Parliament passed the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]] to establish self-government for Ireland, but it was suspended for the duration of the war. To ensure implementation of Home Rule after the war, nationalist leaders and the IPP under Redmond supported with [[Ireland and World War I|Ireland's participation]] in the British and [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] war effort under the [[Triple Entente]] against the expansion of [[Central Powers]]. The core of the Irish Volunteers were against this decision, but the majority left to form the [[National Volunteers]] who enlisted in [[Irish military diaspora#'Irish' named units of the British Army|Irish regiments]] of the [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]], the [[10th (Irish) Division|10th]] and [[16th (Irish) Division]]s, their Northern counterparts in the [[36th (Ulster) Division]]. Before the war ended, Britain made two concerted efforts to implement Home Rule, one in May 1916 and again with the [[Irish Convention]] during 1917\u20131918, but the Irish sides (Nationalist, Unionist) were unable to agree to terms for the temporary or permanent exclusion of Ulster from its provisions.\n\nThe period 1916\u20131921 was marked by political violence and upheaval, ending in the [[partition of Ireland]] and independence for 26 of its 32 counties. A failed militant attempt was made to gain separate independence for Ireland with the 1916 [[Easter Rising]], an insurrection in Dublin. Though support for the insurgents was small, the violence used in its suppression led to a swing in support of the rebels. In addition, the unprecedented [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|threat of Irishmen being conscripted]] to the [[British Army]] in 1918 (for service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as a result of the German [[Spring Offensive]]) accelerated this change. In the [[1918 Irish general election|December 1918 elections]] [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], the party of the rebels, won three-quarters of all seats in Ireland, twenty-seven [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s of which assembled in Dublin on 21 January 1919 to form a 32-county [[Irish Republic]] Parliament, the first [[First D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] [[Declaration of Independence (Ireland)|unilaterally declaring]] sovereignty over the entire island.\n\n{{IrishParliaments|clear=\"right\"}}\nUnwilling to negotiate any understanding with Britain short of complete independence, the [[Irish Republican Army]], the army of the newly declared Irish Republic, waged a guerilla war (the [[Irish War of Independence]]) from 1919 to 1921. In the course of the fighting and amid much acrimony, the Fourth [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] implemented Home Rule while separating the island into what the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British government]]'s Act termed \"[[Northern Ireland]]\" and \"[[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]\". In July 1921 the Irish and British governments agreed to a truce that halted the war. In December 1921 representatives of both governments signed an [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. The Irish delegation was led by [[Arthur Griffith]] and [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. This abolished the [[Irish Republic]] and created the [[Irish Free State]], a self-governing [[Dominion]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in the manner of Canada and Australia. Under the Treaty, [[Northern Ireland]] could opt out of the Free State and stay within the United Kingdom: it promptly did so. In 1922 both parliaments [[Second D\u00e1il#The Treaty|ratified the Treaty]], formalising independence for the 26-county Irish Free State (which renamed itself ''Ireland'' in 1937, and [[Republic of Ireland Act|declared itself a republic]] in 1949); while the 6-county Northern Ireland, gaining Home Rule for itself, remained part of the United Kingdom. For most of the next 75 years, each territory was strongly aligned to either [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] or [[Protestant]] ideologies, although this was more marked in the six counties of Northern Ireland.\n\n==Free State and Republic (1922\u2013present)==\n{{main|History of the Republic of Ireland|Irish Free State|Republic of Ireland|Names of the Irish state}}\n[[File:Ei-map.svg|left|thumb|Political map of Ireland]]\n\nThe treaty to sever the Union divided the republican movement into ''anti-Treaty'' (who wanted to fight on until an Irish Republic was achieved) and ''pro-Treaty'' supporters (who accepted the Free State as a first step towards full independence and unity). Between 1922 and 1923 both sides fought the bloody [[Irish Civil War]]. The new Irish Free State government defeated the anti-Treaty remnant of the [[Irish Republican Army]], imposing [[Executions during the Irish Civil War|multiple executions]]. This division among nationalists still colours Irish politics today, specifically between the two leading Irish political parties, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]].\n\nThe new Irish Free State (1922\u201337) existed against the backdrop of the growth of dictatorships in mainland Europe and a major [[Great depression|world economic downturn]] in 1929. In contrast with many contemporary European states it remained a democracy. Testament to this came when the losing faction in the Irish civil war, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s Fianna F\u00e1il, was able to take power peacefully by winning the [[1932 Irish general election|1932 general election]]. Nevertheless, until the mid-1930s, considerable parts of Irish society saw the Free State through the prism of the civil war, as a repressive, British-imposed state. It was only the peaceful change of government in 1932 that signalled the final acceptance of the Free State on their part. In contrast to many other states in the period, the Free State remained financially solvent as a result of low government expenditure, despite the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War|Economic War]] with Britain. However, unemployment and emigration were high. The population declined to a low of 2.7 million recorded in the 1961 census.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] had a powerful influence over the Irish state for much of its history. The clergy's influence meant that the Irish state had very conservative social policies, forbidding, for example, divorce, [[contraception]], abortion, pornography as well as encouraging the [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland|censoring and banning]] of many books and films. In addition the Church largely controlled the State's hospitals, schools and remained the largest provider of many other social services.\n\nWith the partition of Ireland in 1922, 92.6% of the Free State's population were Catholic while 7.4% were Protestant.<ref>M.E.Collins, Ireland 1868\u20131966, (1993) p. 431)</ref> By the 1960s the Protestant population had fallen by half. Although emigration was high among all the population, due to a lack of economic opportunity, the rate of Protestant emigration was disproportionate in this period. Many Protestants left the country in the early 1920s, either because they felt unwelcome in a predominantly Catholic and nationalist state, because they were afraid due to the burning of Protestant homes (particularly of the old landed class) by republicans during the civil war, because they regarded themselves as British and did not wish to live in an independent Irish state, or because of the economic disruption caused by the recent violence. The Catholic Church had also issued a decree, known as [[Ne Temere]], whereby the children of marriages between Catholics and Protestants had to be brought up as Catholics. From 1945, the emigration rate of Protestants fell and they became less likely to emigrate than Catholics.\n[[File:President's Trip to Europe- Motorcade in Dublin. President Kennedy, motorcade, spectators. Dublin, Ireland - NARA - 194227.jpg|thumb|President [[John F. Kennedy]] in motorcade in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] on 27 June 1963]]\n\nIn 1937 a new [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] re-established the state as ''Ireland'' (or ''[[\u00c9ire]]'' in Irish). The state remained neutral throughout [[World War II]] (see ''[[Irish neutrality]]''), which saved it from much of the horrors of the war, although tens of thousands volunteered to serve in the British forces. Ireland was also impacted by food rationing, and coal shortages; [[B\u00f3rd na M\u00f3na|peat production]] became a priority during this time. Though nominally neutral, recent studies have suggested a far greater level of involvement by the South with the Allies than was realised, with [[D Day]]'s date set on the basis of secret weather information on Atlantic storms supplied by Ireland. ''For more detail on 1939\u201345, see main article [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]''.\n\nIn 1949, Ireland left the British [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and was formally declared a republic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/70-years-since-ireland-became-a-republic-4597795-Apr2019/|title=Today marks 70 years since Ireland became a republic|first=Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed|last=Aodha|website=TheJournal.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Ireland underwent a major economic change under reforming [[Taoiseach]] (prime minister) [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] and Secretary of the Department of Finance [[T.K. Whitaker]], who produced a series of economic plans. Free second-level education was introduced by [[Donogh O'Malley]] as Minister for Education in 1968. From the early 1960s, Ireland sought admission to the [[European Economic Community]] but, because 90% of exports were to the United Kingdom market, it did not do so until the UK did, in 1973.\n\nGlobal economic problems in the 1970s, augmented by a set of misjudged economic policies followed by governments, including that of Taoiseach [[Jack Lynch]], caused the Irish economy to stagnate. [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland discouraged foreign investment. Devaluation was enabled when the Irish Pound, or Punt, was established as a separate currency in 1979, breaking the link with the UK's [[Pound sterling|sterling]]. However, economic reforms in the late 1980s, helped by investment from the [[European Community]], led to the emergence of one of the world's highest economic growth rates, with mass immigration (particularly of people from Asia and Eastern Europe) as a feature of the late 1990s. This period came to be known as the [[Celtic Tiger]] and was focused on as a model for economic development in the former Eastern Bloc states, which entered the [[European Union]] in the early 2000s (decade). Property values had risen by a factor of between four and ten between 1993 and 2006, in part fuelling the boom.\n\nIrish society adopted relatively liberal social policies during this period. Divorce was legalised, homosexuality decriminalised, and abortion in limited cases was allowed by the Irish Supreme Court in the [[X Case]] legal judgement. Major scandals in the Roman Catholic Church, both sexual and financial, coincided with a widespread decline in religious practice, with weekly attendance at Roman Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] dropping by half in twenty years. [[Public inquiries in the Republic of Ireland|A series of tribunals]] set up from the 1990s have investigated alleged malpractices by politicians, the Catholic clergy, judges, hospitals and the Garda\u00ed (police).\n\nIreland's new found prosperity ended abruptly in 2008 when the [[bank|banking system]] collapsed due to the [[Irish property bubble]] bursting. Some 25-26% of GDP was needed to bail out failing Irish banks and force banking sector consolidation. This was the largest banking bailout for any country in history, in comparison only 7\u20138% of GDP was needed to bail out failing Finnish banks in its banking crisis in the 1990s. This resulted in a major [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial and political crisis]] as Ireland entered a [[recession]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/indicators/default.aspx?id=1NQQ17A|title=Central Statistics Office Ireland Key short-term economic indicators:Gross Domestic Product (GDP)|website=Cso.ie|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref> Emigration rose to 1989 levels as the unemployment rate rose from 4.2% in 2007 to reach 14.6% as of February 2012.<ref>[http://insideireland.ie/2012/03/07/cso-figures-reveal-unemployment-levels-59631/ CSO figures reveal unemployment levels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308225201/http://insideireland.ie/2012/03/07/cso-figures-reveal-unemployment-levels-59631/ |date=8 March 2012 }} - Inside Ireland, 7 March 2012</ref>\n\nHowever, since 2014, Ireland has seen strong economic growth, dubbed as the \"[[Celtic Phoenix]]\".\n\n==Northern Ireland (1921\u2013present)==\n{{Main|History of Northern Ireland}}\n\n===\"A Protestant state\" (1921\u20131972)===\nThe 1920 Government of Ireland Bill created the state of [[Northern Ireland]], which consisted of the six northeastern counties of Londonderry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Antrim, Down and Armagh.<ref>Paseta, Senia: \"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", p. 102. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> From 1921 to 1972, Northern Ireland was governed by a [[Ulster Unionist Party|Unionist]] government, based at [[Stormont, Belfast|Stormont]] in east Belfast. Unionist leader and first Prime Minister, [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], declared that it would be \"a Protestant State for a Protestant People\". Craig's goal was to form and preserve Protestant authority in the new state which was above all an effort to secure a unionist majority. In 1926 the majority of the population in the province were Presbyterian and Anglican therefore solidifying Craig's Protestant political power.

As time went on it became clear that these two rival states would bring about a civil war. After the Second World War, keeping the cohesion within Stormont seemed impossible; increased economic pressures, solidified Catholic unity, and British involvement ultimately led to Stormont's collapse. As the civil rights movement of the United States gained worldwide acknowledgement, Catholics rallied together to achieve a similar socio-political recognition. This resulted in the formation of various organisations such as the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in 1967 and the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) in 1964.<ref>Paseta, Senia: \"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 108\u2013110. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> Non-violent protest became an increasingly important factor in mobilising Catholic sympathies and opinion and thus more effective in generating support than actively violent groups such as the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. However, these non-violent protests posed a problem to Northern Ireland's prime minister Terrance O'Neil (1963) because it hampered his efforts to persuade Catholics in Northern Ireland that they too, like their Protestant counterparts, belong within the United Kingdom. Despite O'Neil's reforming efforts there was growing discontent amongst both Catholics and Unionists. In October 1968 a peaceful civil rights march in Derry turned violent as police brutally beat protesters. The outbreak was televised by international media, and as a result the march was highly publicised which further confirmed the socio-political turmoil in Ireland.<ref>Paseta, Senia: \"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 110\u2013114. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> A violent counter-reaction from conservative unionists led to civil disorder, notably the [[Battle of the Bogside]] and the [[Northern Ireland riots of August 1969]]. To restore order, British troops were deployed to the streets of Northern Ireland at that time.\n\nThe violent outbreaks in the late 1960s encouraged and helped strengthen military groups such as the IRA, who served as the protectors of the working class Catholics who were vulnerable to police and civilian brutality. During the late sixties and early seventies recruitment into the IRA organisation dramatically increased as street and civilian violence worsened. The interjection from the British troops proved to be insufficient to quell the violence and thus solidified the IRA's growing military importance.<ref>Paseta, Senia: \"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 114\u2013116. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> On 30 January 1972 the worst tensions came to a head with the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]]. Paratroops opened fire on civil rights protesters in Derry, killing 13 unarmed civilians. [[Bloody Friday (1972)|Bloody Friday]], Bloody Sunday, and other violent acts in the early 1970s came to be known as [[the Troubles]]. The Stormont parliament was [[Legislative session#Prorogation|prorogued]] in 1972 and abolished in 1973. Paramilitary private armies such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], resulted from a split within the IRA, the [[Official IRA]] and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] fought against the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] and the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]]. Moreover, the [[British army]] and the (largely Protestant) [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) also took part in the chaos that resulted in the deaths of over 3,000 men, women and children, civilians and military. Most of the violence took place in Northern Ireland, but some also spread to England and across the Irish border.\n{{Irish police|clear=\"right\"}}\n\n===Direct rule (1972\u20131999)===\nFor the next 27\u00bd years, with the exception of five months in 1974, Northern Ireland was under \"[[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]]\" with a [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] in the British Cabinet responsible for the departments of the Northern Ireland government. [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|Direct Rule]] was designed to be a temporary solution until Northern Ireland was capable of governing itself again. Principal acts were passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] in the same way as for much of the rest of the UK, but many smaller measures were dealt with by [[Order in Council]] with minimal parliamentary scrutiny.  Attempts were made to establish a power-sharing executive, representing both the nationalist and unionist communities, by the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973|Northern Ireland Constitution Act]] of 1973 and the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] in December 1973. Both acts however did little to create cohesion between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Constitution Act of 1973 formalised the UK government's affirmation of reunification of Ireland by consent only; therefore ultimately delegating the authoritative power of the border question from Stormont to the people of Northern Ireland (and the Republic of Ireland). Conversely, the Sunningdale Agreement included a \"provision of a Council of Ireland which held the right to execute executive and harmonizing functions\". Most significantly, the Sunningdale Agreement brought together political leaders from Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the UK to deliberate for the first time since 1925.<ref>Paseta, Senia :\"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 116\u2013118. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> The Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention and Jim Prior's 1982 assembly were also temporarily implemented; however all failed to either reach consensus or operate in the longer term.\n\nDuring the 1970s British policy concentrated on defeating the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) by military means including the policy of [[Ulsterisation]] (requiring the RUC and British Army reserve [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] to be at the forefront of combating the IRA). Although IRA violence decreased it was obvious that no military victory was on hand in either the short or medium terms. Even Catholics who generally rejected the IRA were unwilling to offer support to a state that seemed to remain mired in [[sectarian]] discrimination, and the Unionists were not interested in Catholic participation in running the state in any case. In the 1980s the IRA attempted to secure a decisive military victory based on massive arms shipments from [[Libya]]. When this failed, senior republican figures began to look to broaden the struggle from purely military means. In time this began a move towards [[TUAS|military cessation]]. In 1985 the Irish and British governments signed the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] signalling a formal partnership in seeking a political solution. The Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA) recognised the Irish government's right to be consulted and heard as well as guaranteed equality of treatment and recognition of the Irish and British identities of the two communities. The agreement also stated that the two governments must implement a cross-border co-operation.<ref>Paseta, Senia :\"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 119\u2013121. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> Socially and economically Northern Ireland suffered the worst levels of unemployment in the UK and although high levels of public spending ensured a slow modernisation of public services and moves towards equality, progress was slow in the 1970s and 1980s. Only in the 1990s, when progress toward peace became tangible, did the economic situation brighten. By then the demographics of Northern Ireland had undergone significant change, and more than 40% of the population was Catholic.\n\n===Devolution and direct rule (1999\u2013present)===\nMore recently, the [[Belfast Agreement]] (\"Good Friday Agreement\") of 10 April 1998 brought \u2013 on 2 December 1999 \u2013 a degree of power sharing to Northern Ireland, giving both [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]] and nationalists control of limited areas of government. However, both the power-sharing Executive and the elected Assembly were suspended between January and May 2000, and from October 2002 until April 2007, following breakdowns in trust between the political parties involving outstanding issues, including \"decommissioning\" of paramilitary weapons, [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|policing reform]] and the removal of [[British army]] bases. In new elections in 2003, the moderate [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]] and (nationalist) [[Social Democrat and Labour Party|Social Democrat and Labour]] parties lost their dominant positions to the more hard-line [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionist]] and (nationalist) [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] parties. On 28 July 2005, the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and on 25 September 2005 international weapons inspectors supervised the full disarmament of the PIRA. Eventually, devolution was restored in April 2007.\n\n==Modern Ireland==\nIreland's economy became more diverse and sophisticated than ever before by integrating itself into the global economy. In 1973, Ireland acceded to the European Economic Community [EEC], precursor to the European Community [EC] and European Union [EU], at the same time as the UK. By the beginning of the 1990s Ireland had transformed itself into a modern industrial economy and generated substantial national income that benefited the entire nation. Although dependence on agriculture still remained high, Ireland's industrial economy produced sophisticated goods that rivalled international competition. Ireland's international economic boom of the 1990s led to its being called a [[Celtic Tiger]].\n\nThe Catholic Church, which once exercised great power, found its influence on socio-political issues in Ireland much reduced. Irish bishops were no longer able to advise and influence the public on how to exercise their political rights. Modern Ireland's detachment of the Church from ordinary life can be explained by the increasing disinterest in Church doctrine by younger generations and the questionable morality of the Church's representatives. A highly publicised case was that of Eamonn Casey, the [[Bishop of Galway]], who resigned abruptly in 1992 after it was revealed that he had had an affair with an American woman and had fathered a child. Further controversies and scandals arose concerning paedophile and child-abusing priests. As a result, many in the Irish public began to question the credibility and effectiveness of the Catholic Church.<ref>Paseta, Senia: \"Modern Ireland: A Very Short Introduction\", pp. 128\u2013141. Oxford University Press, 2003</ref> In 2011 Ireland closed its embassy at the Vatican, an apparent result of this growing trend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0218/1224311977327.html|title=Closure of Vatican embassy has wide-ranging implications|date=18 February 2012|work=The Irish Times}}</ref>\n\n==Flags in Ireland==\n[[File:Flag of Ireland.svg|left|180px|thumb|The [[flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]]]]\n[[File:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|left|180px|thumb|The [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]] (See also [[flag of Northern Ireland]])]]\nThe national flag of Ireland is a tricolour of green, white and orange. This flag, which bears the colours green for Irish Catholics, orange for Irish Protestants, and white for the desired peace between them, dates to the mid-19th century.<ref>[https://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/The_National_Flag/ National Flag] Department of the Taoiseach}</ref> The tricolour was first unfurled in public by [[Young Ireland]]er [[Thomas Francis Meagher]] who, using the symbolism of the flag, explained his vision as follows: ''\"The white in the centre signifies a lasting truce between the \"Orange\" and the \"Green,\" and I trust that beneath its folds the hands of the Irish Protestant and the Irish Catholic may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhood\"''. Fellow nationalist [[John Mitchel]] said of it: \"I hope to see that flag one day waving as our national banner.\"\n\nAfter its use in the [[1916 Rising]] it became widely accepted by nationalists as the national flag, and was used officially by the [[Irish Republic]] (1919\u201321) and the [[Irish Free State]] (1922\u201337).\n\nIn 1937 when the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was introduced, the tricolour was formally confirmed as the national flag: \"The national flag is the tricolour of green, white and orange.\" While the tricolour today is the official flag of Ireland, it is not an official flag in Northern Ireland although it is sometimes used unofficially.\n\nThe only official flag representing [[Northern Ireland]] is the [[Union Flag]] of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland however its use is controversial.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20951202|title=Flags and symbols|first=Mark|last=Devenport|date=15 January 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref> The [[Ulster Banner]] is sometimes used unofficially as a de facto regional flag for Northern Ireland.\n\nSince Partition, there has been no universally-accepted flag to represent the entire island. As a provisional solution for certain sports fixtures, the Flag of the [[Provinces of Ireland|Four Provinces]] enjoys a certain amount of general acceptance and popularity.\n{{Clear}}\nHistorically a number of flags have been used, including:\n*[[Saint Patrick's Flag]] (St Patrick's Saltire, St Patrick's Cross) which represented Ireland on the [[Union Flag]] after the Act of Union;\n*a green flag with a harp (used by most nationalists in the 19th century and which is also the flag of [[Leinster]]);\n*a blue flag with a harp used from the 18th century onwards by many nationalists (now the standard of the [[President of Ireland]]);\n*the [[Irish tricolour]].\n\nSt Patrick's Saltire was formerly used to represent the island of Ireland by the all-island [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] (IRFU), before adoption of the four-provinces flag. The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) uses the tricolour to represent the whole island.\n\n==Historiography==\n{{further|List of Irish historians}}\nIreland has a very large historiography, contributed by scholars in Ireland, North America, and Britain.<ref>For example {{cite book|author=Richard Bourke and Ian McBride, eds.|title=The Princeton History of Modern Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTRJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1|year=2016|publisher=Princeton University Press}}; and S.

Squadron Leader Moore (the duty medical officer) saw the accident and, accompanied by [[Leading Aircraftman]] Icke, a medical orderly, proceeded to the scene. Squadron Leader Moore directed the removal of the rear gunner, who was dazed and sitting amongst the burning wreckage, to a place of safety. The aircraft was now enveloped in flames and ammunition was exploding. Nevertheless, despite the intense heat and the danger from exploding oxygen bottles this officer and airman entered the burning wreckage in an attempt to rescue another member of the crew who was pinned down.
