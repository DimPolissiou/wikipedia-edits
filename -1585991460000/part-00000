Although it fought entirely in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], it was composed of regiments from three Western states that are now within the region of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Noted for its strong discipline, its unique uniform appearance and its tenacious fighting ability, the Iron Brigade suffered the highest percentage of casualties of any brigade in the war.\n\nThe nickname \"Iron Brigade\", with its connotation of fighting men with iron dispositions, was applied formally or informally to a number of units in the Civil War and in later conflicts. The Iron Brigade of the West was the unit that received the most lasting publicity in its use of the nickname.\n\n==Nickname==\n\nThe Iron Brigade initially consisted of the [[2nd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment|2nd]], [[6th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment|6th]], and [[7th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]s, the [[19th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment|19th Indiana]], Battery B of the [[4th Regiment of Artillery|4th U.S. Light Artillery]], and was later joined by the [[24th Michigan Volunteer Infantry|24th Michigan]]. This particular composition of men, from the three Western states, led it to be sometimes referred to as the \"Iron Brigade of the West\". They were known throughout the war as the \"Black Hats\" because of the black 1858 model [[Hardee hat]]s issued to Army [[Regular Army (United States)|regulars]], rather than the blue [[kepi]]s worn by most other Union Army units.\n\nThe all-Western brigade, composed of Wisconsin, Michigan and Indiana troops, earned their famous nickname, while under the command of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[John Gibbon]], who led the brigade into its first battle. On August 28, 1862, during the preliminary phases of the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], it stood up against attacks from a superior force under [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen]] [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson]] on the Brawner farm. The designation \"Iron Brigade\" is said to have originated during the brigade's action at Turners Gap, during the [[Battle of South Mountain]], a prelude to the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862. [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Joseph Hooker]], commanding [[I Corps (ACW)|I Corps]], approached Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]], seeking orders. As the Western men advanced up the National Road, forcing the Confederate line all the way back to the gap, McClellan asked, \"What troops are those fighting in the Pike?\" Hooker replied, \"[Brigadier] General Gibbon's brigade of Western men.\" McClellan stated, \"They must be made of iron.\" Hooker said that the brigade had performed even more superbly at Second Bull Run; to this, McClellan said that the brigade consisted of the \"best troops in the world\". Hooker supposedly was elated and rode off without his orders. There are a few stories related to the origin, but the men immediately adopted the name, which was quickly used in print after South Mountain.<ref>Herdegen, p. 244.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Iron Brigade 7th Wisconsin Group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Union Army]] soldiers in the [[7th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], Company I, of the Iron Brigade, in [[Virginia]], 1862]]\n[[File:Rufus King Civil War General - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Rufus King (general)|Rufus King]], the founder and original commander of the Wisconsin Iron Brigade]]\n[[File:John Gibbon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Gibbon]], the commander of the combined three-state Western Iron Brigade]]\n\nThe unit that eventually became known as the Iron Brigade was activated on October 1, 1861, upon the arrival in [[Washington, D.C.]], of the 7th Wisconsin. It was combined into a brigade with the 2nd and 6th Wisconsin, and the 19th Indiana, under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Rufus King (general)|Rufus King]] and were originally known as King's Wisconsin Brigade. The governor of Wisconsin, [[Alexander Randall]], had hoped to see the formation of an entirely Wisconsin brigade, but the Army unwittingly frustrated his plans by transferring the [[5th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment|5th Wisconsin]] from King's brigade and including the Hoosiers instead.<ref>Nolan, p. 28.</ref> This brigade was initially designated the 3rd Brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]]'s division of the Army of the Potomac, and then the 3rd Brigade, I Corps.<ref>Eicher, p. 334.</ref>\n\nMcDowell's I Corps did not join the bulk of the Army of the Potomac in the [[Peninsula Campaign]]. In June 1862 it was redesignated the III Corps of Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] [[Army of Virginia]]. Now under the command of [[John Gibbon]], a regular Army officer from [[North Carolina]] who chose to stay with the Union,<ref>Dorsey, p. 50.</ref> King's brigade was designated the 4th Brigade, 1st Division, III Corps, and it saw its first combat in the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]]. Almost immediately following the Union defeat in the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], the III Corps was transferred back to the Army of the Potomac and redesignated the I Corps, under the command of [[Joseph Hooker]]; Gibbon's brigade became the 4th Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps.\n\nThe [[24th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] joined the brigade on October 8, 1862, prior to the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] in December. On February 27, 1863, the brigade, now under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Solomon Meredith]], was redesignated the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps.\n\nThe brigade commanders, disregarding temporary assignments, were:\n\nBrig. Gen. Rufus King: September 28, 1861 &ndash; May 7, 1862<br/>\nBrig. Gen. John Gibbon: May 7, 1862 &ndash; November 4, 1862<br/>\nBrig. Gen. Solomon Meredith: November 25, 1862 &ndash; July 1, 1863 (wounded at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]])\n\nThe Iron Brigade lost its all-Western status on July 16, 1863, following its crippling losses at Gettysburg, when the 167th Pennsylvania was incorporated into it. However, the brigade that succeeded it, which included the survivors of the Iron Brigade, was commanded by:\n\nCol. [[William W. Robinson]] (of the 7th Wisconsin): July 1, 1863 &ndash; March 25, 1864<br/>\nBrig. Gen. [[Lysander Cutler]] (6th Wisconsin): March 25, 1864 &ndash; May 6, 1864<br/>\nCol. [[William W. Robinson]]: May 6, 1864 &ndash; June 7, 1864<br/>\nBrig. Gen. [[Edward S. Bragg]] (6th Wisconsin): June 7, 1864 &ndash; February 10, 1865<br/>\nCol. [[John A. Kellogg]] (6th Wisconsin): February 28, 1865 &ndash; April 27, 1865<br/>\nCol. [[Henry A. Morrow]] (24th Michigan): April 27, 1863 &ndash; June 5, 1865\n\nIn June 1865, the units of the surviving brigade were separated and reassigned to the [[Army of the Tennessee]].\n\nThe brigade fought in the battles of [[Northern Virginia Campaign|Second Bull Run]], [[Maryland Campaign|Antietam]], [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], [[Gettysburg Campaign|Gettysburg]], [[Battle of Mine Run|Mine Run]], [[Overland Campaign|Overland]], [[Siege of Petersburg|Richmond-Petersburg]], and [[Appomattox Campaign|Appomattox]].\n\nThe brigade took pride in its designation, \"1st Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps\", under which it played a prominent role in the first day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1, 1863. It repulsed the first [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] offensive through Herbst's Woods, capturing much of Brig. Gen. [[James J. Archer]]'s brigade, and Archer himself. The 6th Wisconsin (along with 100 men of the brigade guard) are remembered for their famous charge on an unfinished railroad cut north and west of the town, where they captured the flag of the 2nd Mississippi and took hundreds of Confederate prisoners.<ref>Herdegen, Beaudot, p. 207.</ref>\n\nThe Iron Brigade, proportionately, suffered the most casualties of any brigade in the Civil War. For example, 61% (1,153 out of 1,885) were casualties at Gettysburg. Similarly, the 2nd Wisconsin, which suffered 77% casualties at Gettysburg, suffered the third highest total throughout the war; it was third behind the 24th Michigan (also an Iron Brigade regiment) as well as the [[1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry|1st Minnesota]] in total casualties at Gettysburg. The Michigan regiment lost 397 out of 496 soldiers, an 80% casualty rate.  The 1st Minnesota actually suffered the highest casualty percentage of any Union regiment in a single Civil War engagement during the battle of Gettysburg, losing 216 out of 262 men (82%). {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe last surviving member of the Iron Brigade, Josiah E. Cass of [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], died on 2 December 1947 of a fractured hip suffered in a fall.

The state militia uniforms were eventually replaced to avoid being mistaken as [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldiers. From a rare, degraded, [[tintype]] photograph, circa 1861.]]\n\nThe uniform of the Iron brigade differed some what to the standard uniform of the Union army at the time. It was designed to be more of a dress uniform that resembled a suit rather than the more common infantry men's kit. It consisted of:\n\nA Hardee black hat: A tall blocked, brimmed black hat, featuring a brass infantry bugle, a red I Corps circle patch and brass numbers/letters of the front to indicate units and companies. A brass eagle badge on the side used to hold the brim up in a slouch, and finally an ostrich feather plume.\n\nUnion Frock coat.: A long, dark blue coat that came down to the mid thighs, resembling that of an officers coat. Fitted with a single breasted row of nine brass buttons, each with the federal eagle on them. The cuffs and collars had light blue trimming and two smaller brass buttons on the cuffs. The inside of the coat was lined with cotton to make a better fit.\n\nLight/dark blue trousers: depending on the period of the war and unit, trousers versed from light, sky blue to a dark blue the same colour as the coat. The trouser extended from the mid waist down to the ankles and had a pocket on either side.\n\nWhite canvas gaiter: white canvas leggings with leather straps to prevent stones and dirt getting into the shoes whilst in the field.\n\nAll other equipment not mentioned included standard field equipment of the Union army consisting of canteens, belts, cartridge box, bayonet and scabbard, haversack and other various items of kit.\n\n==Weapons==\n\nSee [[Lorenz rifle]]\n\n\"On the Union side, continental European firearms were mostly distributed to the Western armies--as such, the Lorenz Rifle was relatively uncommon in the Army of the Potomac (although two regiments of the famous Iron Brigade carried them) but heavily used by the [[Army of the Cumberland]] and Army of Tennessee.\"{{who|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Other Iron Brigades==\n===Union Army===\nThere have been other brigades known by the same name. Another brigade in the [[Army of the Potomac]] had previously been known as the Iron Brigade, later the \"[[Eastern Iron Brigade|Iron Brigade of the East]]\" or \"First Iron Brigade\", to avoid confusion. This unit was the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps, prior to Meredith's brigade getting that designation. It consisted of the [[22nd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|22nd New York]], [[24th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|24th New York]], [[30th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|30th New York]], [[14th Regiment (New York State Militia)]], and [[2nd United States Volunteer Sharpshooter Regiment|2nd U.S. Sharpshooters]].

Although it fought entirely in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], it was composed of regiments from three Western states that are now within the region of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Noted for its strong discipline, its unique uniform appearance and its tenacious fighting ability, the Iron Brigade suffered the highest percentage of casualties of any brigade in the war.\n\nThe nickname \"Iron Brigade\", with its connotation of fighting men with iron dispositions, was applied formally or informally to a number of units in the Civil War and in later conflicts. The Iron Brigade of the West was the unit that received the most lasting publicity in its use of the nickname.\n\n==Nickname==\n\nThe Iron Brigade initially consisted of the [[2nd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment|2nd]], [[6th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment|6th]], and [[7th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]s, the [[19th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment|19th Indiana]], Battery B of the [[4th Regiment of Artillery|4th U.S. Light Artillery]], and was later joined by the [[24th Michigan Volunteer Infantry|24th Michigan]]. This particular composition of men, from the three Western states, led it to be sometimes referred to as the \"Iron Brigade of the West\". They were known throughout the war as the \"Black Hats\" because of the black 1858 model [[Hardee hat]]s issued to Army [[Regular Army (United States)|regulars]], rather than the blue [[kepi]]s worn by most other Union Army units.\n\nThe all-Western brigade, composed of Wisconsin, Michigan and Indiana troops, earned their famous nickname, while under the command of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[John Gibbon]], who led the brigade into its first battle. On August 28, 1862, during the preliminary phases of the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], it stood up against attacks from a superior force under [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen]] [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson]] on the Brawner farm. The designation \"Iron Brigade\" is said to have originated during the brigade's action at Turners Gap, during the [[Battle of South Mountain]], a prelude to the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862. [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Joseph Hooker]], commanding [[I Corps (ACW)|I Corps]], approached Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]], seeking orders. As the Western men advanced up the National Road, forcing the Confederate line all the way back to the gap, McClellan asked, \"What troops are those fighting in the Pike?\" Hooker replied, \"[Brigadier] General Gibbon's brigade of Western men.\" McClellan stated, \"They must be made of iron.\" Hooker said that the brigade had performed even more superbly at Second Bull Run; to this, McClellan said that the brigade consisted of the \"best troops in the world\". Hooker supposedly was elated and rode off without his orders. There are a few stories related to the origin, but the men immediately adopted the name, which was quickly used in print after South Mountain.<ref>Herdegen, p. 244.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Iron Brigade 7th Wisconsin Group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Union Army]] soldiers in the [[7th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], Company I, of the Iron Brigade, in [[Virginia]], 1862]]\n[[File:Rufus King Civil War General - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Rufus King (general)|Rufus King]], the founder and original commander of the Wisconsin Iron Brigade]]\n[[File:John Gibbon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John Gibbon]], the commander of the combined three-state Western Iron Brigade]]\n\nThe unit that eventually became known as the Iron Brigade was activated on October 1, 1861, upon the arrival in [[Washington, D.C.]], of the 7th Wisconsin. It was combined into a brigade with the 2nd and 6th Wisconsin, and the 19th Indiana, under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Rufus King (general)|Rufus King]] and were originally known as King's Wisconsin Brigade. The governor of Wisconsin, [[Alexander Randall]], had hoped to see the formation of an entirely Wisconsin brigade, but the Army unwittingly frustrated his plans by transferring the [[5th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment|5th Wisconsin]] from King's brigade and including the Hoosiers instead.<ref>Nolan, p. 28.</ref> This brigade was initially designated the 3rd Brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Irvin McDowell]]'s division of the Army of the Potomac, and then the 3rd Brigade, I Corps.<ref>Eicher, p. 334.</ref>\n\nMcDowell's I Corps did not join the bulk of the Army of the Potomac in the [[Peninsula Campaign]]. In June 1862 it was redesignated the III Corps of Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] [[Army of Virginia]]. Now under the command of [[John Gibbon]], a regular Army officer from [[North Carolina]] who chose to stay with the Union,<ref>Dorsey, p. 50.</ref> King's brigade was designated the 4th Brigade, 1st Division, III Corps, and it saw its first combat in the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]]. Almost immediately following the Union defeat in the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], the III Corps was transferred back to the Army of the Potomac and redesignated the I Corps, under the command of [[Joseph Hooker]]; Gibbon's brigade became the 4th Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps.\n\nThe [[24th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] joined the brigade on October 8, 1862, prior to the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] in December. On February 27, 1863, the brigade, now under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Solomon Meredith]], was redesignated the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps.\n\nThe brigade commanders, disregarding temporary assignments, were:\n\nBrig. Gen. Rufus King: September 28, 1861 &ndash; May 7, 1862<br/>\nBrig. Gen. John Gibbon: May 7, 1862 &ndash; November 4, 1862<br/>\nBrig. Gen. Solomon Meredith: November 25, 1862 &ndash; July 1, 1863 (wounded at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]])\n\nThe Iron Brigade lost its all-Western status on July 16, 1863, following its crippling losses at Gettysburg, when the 167th Pennsylvania was incorporated into it. However, the brigade that succeeded it, which included the survivors of the Iron Brigade, was commanded by:\n\nCol. [[William W. Robinson]] (of the 7th Wisconsin): July 1, 1863 &ndash; March 25, 1864<br/>\nBrig. Gen. [[Lysander Cutler]] (6th Wisconsin): March 25, 1864 &ndash; May 6, 1864<br/>\nCol. [[William W. Robinson]]: May 6, 1864 &ndash; June 7, 1864<br/>\nBrig. Gen. [[Edward S. Bragg]] (6th Wisconsin): June 7, 1864 &ndash; February 10, 1865<br/>\nCol. [[John A. Kellogg]] (6th Wisconsin): February 28, 1865 &ndash; April 27, 1865<br/>\nCol. [[Henry A. Morrow]] (24th Michigan): April 27, 1863 &ndash; June 5, 1865\n\nIn June 1865, the units of the surviving brigade were separated and reassigned to the [[Army of the Tennessee]].\n\nThe brigade fought in the battles of [[Northern Virginia Campaign|Second Bull Run]], [[Maryland Campaign|Antietam]], [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], [[Gettysburg Campaign|Gettysburg]], [[Battle of Mine Run|Mine Run]], [[Overland Campaign|Overland]], [[Siege of Petersburg|Richmond-Petersburg]], and [[Appomattox Campaign|Appomattox]].\n\nThe brigade took pride in its designation, \"1st Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps\", under which it played a prominent role in the first day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1, 1863. It repulsed the first [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] offensive through Herbst's Woods, capturing much of Brig. Gen. [[James J. Archer]]'s brigade, and Archer himself. The 6th Wisconsin (along with 100 men of the brigade guard) are remembered for their famous charge on an unfinished railroad cut north and west of the town, where they captured the flag of the 2nd Mississippi and took hundreds of Confederate prisoners.<ref>Herdegen, Beaudot, p. 207.</ref>\n\nThe Iron Brigade, proportionately, suffered the most casualties of any brigade in the Civil War. For example, 61% (1,153 out of 1,885) were casualties at Gettysburg. Similarly, the 2nd Wisconsin, which suffered 77% casualties at Gettysburg, suffered the third highest total throughout the war; it was third behind the 24th Michigan (also an Iron Brigade regiment) as well as the [[1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry|1st Minnesota]] in total casualties at Gettysburg. The Michigan regiment lost 397 out of 496 soldiers, an 80% casualty rate.  The 1st Minnesota actually suffered the highest casualty percentage of any Union regiment in a single Civil War engagement during the battle of Gettysburg, losing 216 out of 262 men (82%). {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe last surviving member of the Iron Brigade, Josiah E.

From a rare, degraded, [[tintype]] photograph, circa 1861.]]\n\nThe uniform of the Iron brigade differed some what to the standard uniform of the Union army at the time. It was designed to be more of a dress uniform that resembled a suit rather than the more common infantry men's kit. It consisted of:\n\nA Hardee black hat: A tall blocked, brimmed black hat, featuring a brass infantry bugle, a red I Corps circle patch and brass numbers/letters of the front to indicate units and companies. A brass eagle badge on the side used to hold the brim up in a slouch, and finally an ostrich feather plume.\n\nUnion Frock coat.: A long, dark blue coat that came down to the mid thighs, resembling that of an officers coat. Fitted with a single breasted row of nine brass buttons, each with the federal eagle on them. The cuffs and collars had light blue trimming and two smaller brass buttons on the cuffs. The inside of the coat was lined with cotton to make a better fit.\n\nLight/dark blue trousers: depending on the period of the war and unit, trousers versed from light, sky blue to a dark blue the same colour as the coat. The trouser extended from the mid waist down to the ankles and had a pocket on either side.\n\nWhite canvas gaiter: white canvas leggings with leather straps to prevent stones and dirt getting into the shoes whilst in the field.\n\nAll other equipment not mentioned included standard field equipment of the Union army consisting of canteens, belts, cartridge box, bayonet and scabbard, haversack and other various items of kit.\n\n==Weapons==\n\nSee [[Lorenz rifle]]\n\n\"On the Union side, continental European firearms were mostly distributed to the Western armies--as such, the Lorenz Rifle was relatively uncommon in the Army of the Potomac (although two regiments of the famous Iron Brigade carried them) but heavily used by the [[Army of the Cumberland]] and Army of Tennessee.\"\n\n==Other Iron Brigades==\n===Union Army===\nThere have been other brigades known by the same name. Another brigade in the [[Army of the Potomac]] had previously been known as the Iron Brigade, later the \"[[Eastern Iron Brigade|Iron Brigade of the East]]\" or \"First Iron Brigade\", to avoid confusion. This unit was the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, I Corps, prior to Meredith's brigade getting that designation. It consisted of the [[22nd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|22nd New York]], [[24th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|24th New York]], [[30th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|30th New York]], [[14th Regiment (New York State Militia)]], and [[2nd United States Volunteer Sharpshooter Regiment|2nd U.S. Sharpshooters]].

The colonial government summoned thousands of British troops to mount major campaigns to overpower the [[M\u0101ori King Movement|K\u012bngitanga (M\u0101ori King) movement]] and also acquire farming and residential land for British settlers.<ref name=\"King 1977, p. 26\">{{cite book |ref=harv |last=King |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael King |year=1977 |title=Te Puea: A Biography |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton  |location=Auckland |page=26 |isbn=0-340-22482-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Dalton |first=B.J. |title=War and Politics in New Zealand 1855\u20131870 |publisher=Sydney University Press  |year=1967 |location=Sydney |page=179}}</ref> Later campaigns were aimed at quashing the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the [[Pai M\u0101rire]] religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of M\u0101ori land and eager to strengthen M\u0101ori identity.<ref name=\"Belich 1986x, pp=204\u2013205\">{{cite book |ref=harv |first=James |last=Belich |year=1986x |title=The New Zealand Wars and the Victorian Interpretation of Racial Conflict |edition=1st |publisher=Penguin |location=Auckland|pages=204\u2013205 |isbn=0-14-011162-X}}</ref>\n\nAt the peak of hostilities in the 1860s, 18,000 British troops, supported by artillery, cavalry and local militia, battled about 4,000 M\u0101ori warriors<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Belich |first=James |authorlink=James Belich (historian) |title=The New Zealand Wars |publisher=Penguin |year=1986a |location=Auckland |pages=126\u2013133 |isbn=0-14-027504-5}}</ref> in what became a gross imbalance of manpower and weaponry.<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=24\u201325}}.</ref> Although outnumbered, the M\u0101ori were able to withstand their enemy with techniques that included anti-artillery bunkers and the use of carefully placed [[p\u0101]], or fortified villages, that allowed them to block their enemy's advance and often inflict heavy losses, yet quickly abandon their positions without significant loss. [[Guerrilla warfare|Guerrilla-style tactics]] were used by both sides in later campaigns, often fought in dense bush. Over the course of the Taranaki and Waikato campaigns, the lives of about 1,800 M\u0101ori and 800 Europeans were lost,<ref name=\"King 1977, p. 26\"/> and total M\u0101ori losses over the course of all the wars may have exceeded 2,100.\n\nViolence over land ownership broke out first in the [[Wairau Valley]] in the [[South Island]] in June 1843, but rising tensions in [[Taranaki]] eventually led to the involvement of British military forces at [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]] in March 1860. The war between the government and K\u012bngitanga M\u0101ori spread to other areas of the [[North Island]], with the biggest single campaign being the [[invasion of the Waikato]] in 1863\u20131864, before hostilities concluded with the pursuits of [[T\u012btokowaru|Riwha T\u012btokowaru]] in Taranaki (1868\u20131869) and Rangatira (chief) [[Te Kooti|Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki]] on the east coast (1868\u20131872).\n\nAlthough M\u0101ori were initially fought by British forces, the New Zealand government developed its own military force, including local militia, rifle volunteer groups, the specialist Forest Rangers and [[k\u016bpapa]] (pro-government M\u0101ori). The government also responded with legislation to imprison M\u0101ori opponents and [[New Zealand land confiscations|confiscate]] expansive areas of the North Island for sale to settlers, with the funds used to cover war expenses<ref name=\"Belich 1986a, p. 126\">{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|p=126}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dalton|1967|pp=181\u2013182}}.</ref>\u2014punitive measures that on the east and west coasts provoked an intensification of M\u0101ori resistance and aggression.\n\n==Background==\nThe 1840 English language version of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] guaranteed that individual M\u0101ori ''[[iwi]]'' (tribes) should have undisturbed possession of their lands, forests, fisheries and other ''[[taonga]]'' (treasures) in return for becoming British subjects, selling land to the government only (the [[Pre-emption right|right of pre-emption]]) and surrendering sovereignty to the British Crown. In the [[Te Reo M\u0101ori|M\u0101ori language]] version of the Treaty, however, the word \"sovereignty\" was translated as ''kawanatanga'' which was a new word meaning \"governance.\"{{sfn|O'Malley|2019|p=26}} This led to considerable disagreement over the meaning of the Treaty.{{sfn|O'Malley|2019|p=26}} Some M\u0101ori wanted to sign in order to consolidate peace and in hopes of ending the long intertribal [[Musket Wars]] (1807\u20131842) others wanted to keep their [[tino rangatiratanga]], such as the [[T\u016bhoe]] in the Uruweras.\n\nAll pre-treaty colonial land-sale deals had taken place directly between two parties. In the early period of contact, M\u0101ori had generally sought trade with Europeans. The British and the French had established [[Mission (station)|mission stations]], and missionaries had received land from iwi for houses, schools, churches, and farms.\n\nTraders, [[Sydney]] [[businessmen]] and the [[New Zealand Company]] had bought large tracts of land before 1840,.<ref>{{cite book |last=Orange |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Orange |title=The Treaty of Waitangi |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=1987 |location=Wellington |pages=32\u201333 |isbn=086861-634-6}}</ref> The Treaty of Waitangi included the right of pre-emption on land sales, and the New Zealand colonial government, pressured by immigrant European settlers, tried to speed up land sales to provide farmland. This met resistance from the [[M\u0101ori King Movement|K\u012bngitanga (M\u0101ori King) movement]] that emerged in the 1850s and opposed further European encroachment.\n\nGovernor [[Thomas Gore Browne]]'s provocative purchase of a disputed block of land at [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]] in 1859 set the government on a collision course with the K\u012bngitanga movement, and the government interpreted the K\u012bngitanga response as a challenge to the Crown's authority.<ref name=\"King 2003, p. 214\">{{cite book|ref=harv |first=Michael |last=King |title=The Penguin History of New Zealand |year=2003 |page=214 |isbn=0-14-301867-1 |publisher=Penguin Books}}</ref> Governor Gore Browne succeeded in bringing 3500 Imperial troops from the Australian colonies to quash this perceived challenge, and within four years a total of 9,000 British troops had arrived in New Zealand, assisted by more than 4,000 colonial and ''[[k\u016bpapa]]'' (pro-government M\u0101ori) fighters as the government sought a decisive victory over the \"rebel\" M\u0101ori.\n\nThe use of a punitive [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscation]] policy from 1865, depriving \"rebel\" M\u0101ori of the means of living, fuelled further M\u0101ori anger and resentment, fanning the flames of conflict in [[Second Taranaki War|Taranaki]] (1863\u20131866) and on the [[East Cape War|east coast]] (1865\u20131866).\n\n==Conflicts==\n\nThe various conflicts of the New Zealand wars span a considerable period, and the causes and outcomes differ widely. The earliest conflicts in the 1840s happened at a time when M\u0101ori were still the predominant power, but by the 1860s settler numbers and resources were much greater. From about 1862 British troops began arriving in much greater number, summoned by Governor [[George Grey]] for his Waikato invasion, and in March 1864 total troop numbers peaked at about 14,000 (9,000 Imperial troops, more than 4,000 colonial and a few hundred ''k\u016bpapa'').<ref name=\"Belich 1986a, pp. 125\u2013133\">{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=125\u2013133}}.</ref>\n\n===Wairau Affray===\n{{Main|Wairau Affray}}\nThe first armed conflict between M\u0101ori and the European settlers took place on 17 June 1843 in the [[Wairau Valley]], in the north of the [[South Island]]. The clash was sparked when settlers led by a representative of the [[New Zealand Company]]\u2014which held a false title deed to a block of land\u2014attempted to clear M\u0101ori off the land ready for surveying. The party also attempted to arrest [[Ng\u0101ti Toa]] chiefs [[Te Rauparaha]] and [[Te Rangihaeata]]. Fighting broke out and 22 Europeans were killed, as well as four to six M\u0101ori. Several Europeans were slain after being captured. In early 1844, the new [[Governor of New Zealand|Governor]], [[Robert FitzRoy]], investigated the incident and declared the settlers were at fault. The Wairau Affray\u2014described as the Wairau Massacre in early texts\u2014was the only armed conflict of the New Zealand Wars to take place in the South Island.<ref>{{harvnb|King|2003|p=182}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Moon |first=Paul |title=FitzRoy: Governor in Crisis 1843\u20131845&#124; |publisher=David Ling Publishing |year=2000 |pages=81\u201398|isbn=0-908990-70-7}}</ref>\n\n===Northern War===\n{{Main|Flagstaff War}}\n[[File:HekeFlagstaff.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hone Heke]] cuts down the flagstaff on Flagstaff Hill at [[Russell, New Zealand|Koror\u0101reka]].]]\n[[File:GeorgeEdwardGrey01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Governor (and later Premier) Sir George Grey in the 1860s.]]\nThe [[Flagstaff War]] took place in the far north of New Zealand, around the [[Bay of Islands]], between March 1845 and January 1846. In 1845 [[George Grey]] arrived in New Zealand to take up his appointment as governor. At this time [[H\u014dne Heke]] challenged the authority of the British, beginning by cutting down the flagstaff on [[Flagstaff Hill, New Zealand|Flagstaff Hill]] at [[Koror\u0101reka]]. The flagstaff had previously flown the colours of [[United Tribes of New Zealand]] but now carried the [[Union Jack]] and therefore symbolised the grievances of Heke and his ally [[Te Ruki Kawiti]], as to changes that had followed the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].\n\nThere were many [[Flagstaff War#Causes|causes of the Flagstaff War]] and Heke had a number of [[Flagstaff War#Grievance of the Ng\u0101puhi|grievances in relation to the Treaty of Waitangi]].

In April 1847 an accidental shooting of a minor Wanganui M\u0101ori chief led to a bloody revenge attack on a settler family; when the perpetrators were captured and hanged, a major raid was launched on the town as a reprisal, with homes plundered and burned and livestock stolen. M\u0101ori besieged the town before mounting a frontal attack in July 1847. A peace settlement was reached in early 1848.<ref>{{harvnb|Cowan|1922a|loc=[http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cow01NewZ-c14.html Chapter14: The War at Wanganui]}}.</ref>\n\n===First Taranaki War===\n{{Main|First Taranaki War}}\nThe catalyst for the First Taranaki War was the disputed sale to [[the Crown]] of a 240 hectare block of land at [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]], despite a veto by the paramount chief of [[Te \u0100ti Awa]] tribe, [[Wiremu K\u012bngi]], and a \"solemn contract\" by local M\u0101ori not to sell. [[Thomas Gore Browne|Governor Browne]] accepted the purchase with full knowledge of the circumstances and tried to occupy the land, anticipating it would lead to armed conflict, and a demonstration of the substantive sovereignty the British believed they had gained in the 1840 [[Treaty of Waitangi]]. Hostilities began on 17 March 1860. The war was fought by more than 3,500 imperial troops brought in from Australia, as well as volunteer soldiers and militia, against M\u0101ori forces that fluctuated between a few hundred and about 1,500.<ref name=\"King 2003, p. 214\"/> After a series of battles and actions the war ended in a ceasefire, with neither side explicitly accepting the peace terms of the other. Total losses among the imperial, volunteer and militia troops are estimated to have been 238, while M\u0101ori casualties totalled about 200. Though there were claims by the British that they had won the war, there were widely held views at the time they had suffered an unfavourable and humiliating result. Historians have also been divided on the result.<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986x|p={{page needed|date=November 2010}} }}.</ref> Historian [[James Belich (historian)|James Belich]] has claimed that M\u0101ori succeeded in thwarting the British bid to impose sovereignty over them, and had therefore been victorious. However, he also states that the M\u0101ori victory was a hollow one, leading to the invasion of the [[Waikato]].\n\n===Invasion of Waikato===\n{{Main|Invasion of Waikato}}\n[[File:The gunboat pioneer at meremere.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The gunboat ''Pioneer'' at [[Meremere]] during the Invasion of the Waikato.]]\n[[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor]] Thomas Gore-Browne began making arrangements for a Waikato campaign to destroy the ''K\u012bngitanga'' stronghold at the close of the First Taranaki War. Preparations were suspended in December 1861 when he was replaced by Sir [[George Edward Grey|George Grey]], but Grey revived plans for an invasion in June 1863. He persuaded the Colonial Office in London to send more than 10,000 Imperial troops to New Zealand and General Sir [[Duncan Cameron (general)|Duncan Cameron]] was appointed to lead the campaign. Cameron used soldiers to build the 18&nbsp;km-long [[Great South Road, New Zealand|Great South Road]] to the border of K\u012bngitanga territory and on 9 July 1863 Grey ordered all M\u0101ori living between [[Auckland]] and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to [[Queen Victoria]] or be expelled south of the Waikato River; when his ultimatum was rejected the vanguard of the army crossed the frontier into K\u012bngitanga territory and established a forward camp. A long series of bush raids on his supply lines forced Cameron to build an extensive network of forts and redoubts through the area. In a continual buildup of force, Cameron eventually had 14,000 British and colonial soldiers at his disposal as well as steamers and armoured vessels for use on the Waikato River. They fought a combined M\u0101ori contingent of about 4,000.<ref name=\"Belich 1986a, pp. 125\u2013127\">{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=125\u2013127}}.</ref>\n\nCameron and his K\u012bngitanga foe engaged in several major battles including the [[Battle of Rangiriri]] and a three-day siege at Orakau, capturing the K\u012bngitanga capital of [[Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia]] in December 1863, before completing their Waikato conquest in April 1864. The Waikato campaign cost the lives of 700 British and colonial soldiers and about 1,000 M\u0101ori.<ref>{{harvnb|King|2003|p=216}}</ref>\n\nThe ''K\u012bngitanga'' M\u0101ori retreated into the rugged interior of the North Island and in 1865 the New Zealand Government confiscated about 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of M\u0101ori land (4% of New Zealand's land area) for white settlement\u2014an action that quickly provoked the [[Second Taranaki War]].\n\n===Second Taranaki War===\n{{Main|Second Taranaki War}}\nBetween 1863 and 1866 there was a resumption of hostilities between M\u0101ori and the New Zealand Government in Taranaki, which is sometimes referred to as the Second Taranaki War. The conflict, which overlapped the wars in [[Waikato]] and [[Tauranga Campaign|Tauranga]], was fuelled by a combination of factors: lingering M\u0101ori resentment over the sale of land at Waitara in 1860 and government delays in resolving the issue; a large-scale [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscation]] policy launched by the government in late 1863; and the rise of the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the [[Pai Marire]] [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of M\u0101ori land and eager to strengthen M\u0101ori identity.<ref name=\"Belich204-5\">{{harvnb|Belich|1986x|pp=204\u2013205}}.</ref> The Hauhau movement became a unifying factor for Taranaki M\u0101ori in the absence of individual M\u0101ori commanders.\n\nThe style of warfare after 1863 differed markedly from that of the 1860\u20131861 conflict, in which M\u0101ori had taken set positions and challenged the army to an open contest. From 1863 the army, working with greater numbers of troops and heavy artillery, systematically took possession of M\u0101ori land by driving off the inhabitants, adopting a \"[[scorched earth]]\" strategy of laying waste to M\u0101ori villages and cultivations, with attacks on villages, whether warlike or otherwise. Historian Brian Dalton noted: \"The aim was no longer to conquer territory, but to inflict the utmost 'punishment' on the enemy; inevitably there was a great deal of brutality, much burning of undefended villages and indiscriminate looting, in which loyal Maoris often suffered.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dalton|1967|p=241}}.</ref> As the troops advanced, the Government built an expanding line of redoubts, behind which settlers built homes and developed farms.

The conflict was sparked by Te Kooti's return to New Zealand after two years of internment on the [[Chatham Islands]], from where he had escaped with almost 200 M\u0101ori prisoners of war and their families. Te Kooti, who had been held without trial on the island for two years, asked that he and his followers be left in peace, but within two weeks they were being pursued by a force of militia, government troops and M\u0101ori volunteers. The pursuit turned into a four-year guerrilla war, involving more than 30 expeditions<ref name=\"Belich 1986a, p. 126\"/> by colonial and M\u0101ori troops against Te Kooti's dwindling number of warriors.\n\nAlthough initially fighting defensively against pursuing government forces, Te Kooti went on the offensive from November 1868, starting with the so-called [[Poverty Bay]] massacre, a well-organised lightning strike against selected European settlers and M\u0101ori opponents in the Matawhero district, in which 51 men, women and children were slaughtered and their homes set alight. The attack prompted another vigorous pursuit by government forces, which included a siege at Ngatapa p\u0101 that came to a bloody end: although Te Kooti escaped the siege, M\u0101ori forces loyal to the government caught and executed more than 130 of his supporters, as well as prisoners he had earlier seized. Dissatisfied with the [[M\u0101ori King Movement]]'s reluctance to continue its fight against European invasion and confiscation, Te Kooti offered M\u0101ori an [[Old Testament]] vision of salvation from oppression and a return to a [[promised land]].

Waikato campaign, although sometimes they represented a single ''hapu'', or clan, within the tribe. Continual presence on battlefields remained difficult for most, however, because of the constant need for tribal labour in their home community, so there was a constant turnover of small tribal groups. At Meremere, Paterangi, Hangatiki and Maungatatauri, between August 1863 and June 1864 M\u0101ori maintained forces of between 1,000 and 2,000 men, but troops were forced to disperse after each campaign because of labour and domestic needs at home. Belich has estimated that the total M\u0101ori mobilisation was at least 4,000 warriors, representing one-third of the total manpower available.<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=128\u2013130}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough they were not part of a structured command system, M\u0101ori generally followed a consistent strategic plan, uniting to build skilfully engineered defensive lines up to {{convert|22|km}} long.

The British set out to fight a European-style war, based on engaging with the opposing forces, besieging and then capturing fortified positions. The British Army were professional soldiers who had experience fighting in various parts of the Empire, many from [[India]] and [[Afghanistan]], and were led by officers who were themselves trained by men who had fought at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].\n\nMany of the M\u0101ori fighters had been raised during the [[Musket Wars]], the decades-long bitter intertribal fighting during which warriors had perfected the art of building defensive fortifications around a ''[[p\u0101]]''. During the Flagstaff War Kawiti and Heke appear to have followed a strategy of drawing the colonial forces into attacking a fortified p\u0101, from which the warriors could fight from a strong defensive position that was secure from cannon fire.\n\nThe word ''p\u0101'' means a fortified strong point near a M\u0101ori village or community. They were built with a view to defence, but primarily they were built to safely store food. Puketapu P\u0101 and then [[Ohaeawai]] P\u0101 were the first of the so-called \"gunfighter ''p\u0101''\", built to engage enemies armed with muskets and cannons. A strong, wooden palisade was fronted with woven flax leaves (''[[Phormium tenax]]'') whose tough, stringy foliage absorbed much of the force of the ammunition.<ref name=\"NZW-O2\">{{cite web |last=Cowan |first=James |title=Flax-masked Palisade |publisher=The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume I (1845\u201364) |pages= |year=1955 |url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/Cow01NewZ-fig-Cow01NewZ053c.html |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref> The palisade was lifted a few centimetres from the ground so muskets could be fired from underneath rather than over the top.

There were trenches and rifle pits to protect the occupants and, later, very effective artillery shelters.<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=294\u2013295}}.</ref> They were usually built so that they were almost impossible to surround completely, but usually presented at least one exposed face to invite attack from that direction. They were cheap and easily built\u2014the L-Pa at [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]] was constructed by 80 men overnight\u2014and they were completely expendable. The British repeatedly mounted often lengthy expeditions to besiege a ''p\u0101'', which would absorb their bombardment and possibly one or two attacks, and then be abandoned by the M\u0101ori. Shortly afterwards, a new ''p\u0101'' would appear in another inaccessible site. ''P\u0101'' like these were built in the dozens, particularly during the [[First Taranaki War]], where they eventually formed a cordon surrounding [[New Plymouth]], and in the Waikato campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=106\u2013107}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:ALEXANDER(1873) p010 ATTACK ON A MAORI PAH.jpg|thumb|230px|Attack on a M\u0101ori ''p\u0101'' by Sir [[James Edward Alexander]], Commander of the [[West Yorkshire Regiment]].]]\nFor a long time, the modern ''p\u0101'' effectively neutralised the overwhelming disparity in numbers and armaments. At [[Battle of Ohaeawai|Ohaeawai P\u0101]] in 1845, at [[Rangiriri]] in 1863 and again at [[Tauranga Campaign|Gate P\u0101]] in 1864, British and colonial forces discovered that frontal attacks on a defended ''p\u0101'' were extremely costly. At Gate P\u0101, during the 1864 [[Tauranga Campaign]], M\u0101ori withstood a day-long bombardment in their underground shelters and trenches. The palisade destroyed, the British troops rushed the ''p\u0101'' whereupon M\u0101ori fired on them from hidden trenches, killing 38 and injuring many more in the most costly battle for the P\u0101keh\u0101 of the New Zealand Wars. The troops retired and M\u0101ori abandoned the ''p\u0101''.<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=178\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nBritish troops soon realised an easy way to neutralise a ''p\u0101''. Although cheap and easy to build, a gunfighter ''p\u0101'' required a significant input of labour and resources. The destruction of the M\u0101ori economic base in the area around the ''p\u0101'' made it difficult for the ''hapu'' to support the fighting men. This was the reasoning behind the bush-scouring expeditions of Chute and McDonnell in the [[Second Taranaki War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|p=239}}.</ref>\n\nThe biggest problem for the M\u0101ori was that their society was ill-adapted to support a sustained campaign. A long campaign would disrupt food supplies and epidemics resulted in significant numbers of deaths among the M\u0101ori.<ref name=\"LMR1874\">{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=Lawrence M. |title=Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams |year=1973 |publisher=Pegasus Press |pages=215\u2013216}}</ref> While the British could defeat M\u0101ori in battle, the defeats were often not decisive. For example, the capture of Ruapekapeka P\u0101 can be considered a British tactical victory, but it was purpose-built as a target for the British, and its loss was not damaging; Heke and Kawiti managed to escape with their forces intact.<ref name=\"Ian McGibbon p.373\">Ian McGibbon, The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Military History, p.373</ref> However the British force consisted of professional soldiers supported by an economic system capable of sustaining them in the field almost indefinitely, in contrast, the M\u0101ori warrior was a part-time fighter who also needed to work on producing food.\n\n==Weapons==\nThe main weapon used by the British forces in the 1860s was the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]]. Properly described as a rifled musket, it was loaded down the barrel like a conventional musket but the barrel was rifled. While muskets were accurate to about 60\u201380&nbsp;m, an 1853 Enfield was accurate to about 300&nbsp;m to 400&nbsp;m in the hands of an experienced soldier; at 100&nbsp;m an experienced soldier could easily hit a human target. The rifle was 1.44&nbsp;m long, weighed 4&nbsp;kg and had a 53&nbsp;cm socket bayonet. This rifle was also commonly used in the [[American Civil War]] by both sides.\n\nThe [[Calisher and Terry carbine]] (short rifle) was ordered by the New Zealand Government from Calisher and Terry, Birmingham gunsmiths in 1861 after earlier fighting against M\u0101ori showed the need for a carbine suited to fighting in heavy bush. This was the favoured weapon of the New Zealand Forest Rangers because of its shortness, its lightness, and its ability to be reloaded while the marksman lay down\u2014unlike the Enfield, which required the soldier to stand to load the powder\u2014and could be loaded on the run. This feature led to a decisive victory for the Forest Rangers at Orakau: several groups of soldiers harried the fleeing M\u0101ori but only the Forest Rangers, equipped with carbines, were able to follow them 10&nbsp;km to the [[Puniu River]] shooting as they went.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stowers |first=Richard |title=Forest Rangers |publisher=self-published |year=1996 |location=Hamilton |page=106 |isbn=0-473-03531-6}}</ref><ref>Von Tempsky, Artist and Adventurer.

The most common revolver appears to have been the five-shot [[Beaumont\u2013Adams revolver|Beaumont\u2013Adams]] .44 percussion revolver. Other revolvers in use were the [[Colt 1851 Navy Revolver|Colt Navy]] .36 1851 model with open top frame. The Colt was favoured by the Forest Rangers because it was light and accurate being a [[single-action]] revolver. Von Tempsky's second company of the Forest Rangers also used the [[Bowie knife]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Stowers |first=Richard |title=Forest Rangers |publisher=self-published |year=1996 |location=Hamilton |pages=270\u2013283 |isbn=0-473-03531-6}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Zealandia_Symonds_Street_Auckland.jpg|thumb|right|New Zealand Wars Memorial in Symonds Street, Auckland.

[[Guerrilla warfare|Guerrilla-style tactics]] were used by both sides in later campaigns, often fought in dense bush.

In the [[Te Reo M\u0101ori|M\u0101ori language]] version of the Treaty, however, the word \"sovereignty\" was translated as ''kawanatanga'' which was a new word meaning \"governance.\"{{sfn|O'Malley|2019|p=26}} This led to considerable disagreement over the meaning of the Treaty.{{sfn|O'Malley|2019|p=26}} Some M\u0101ori wanted to sign in order to consolidate peace and in hopes of ending the long intertribal [[Musket Wars]] (1807\u20131842) others wanted to keep their [[tino rangatiratanga]], such as the [[T\u016bhoe]] in the Uruweras.\n\nAll pre-treaty colonial land-sale deals had taken place directly between two parties. In the early period of contact, M\u0101ori had generally sought trade with Europeans.

The Treaty of Waitangi included the right of pre-emption on land sales, and the New Zealand colonial government, pressured by immigrant European settlers, tried to speed up land sales to provide farmland. This met resistance from the [[M\u0101ori King Movement|K\u012bngitanga (M\u0101ori King) movement]] that emerged in the 1850s and opposed further European encroachment.\n\nGovernor [[Thomas Gore Browne]]'s provocative purchase of a disputed block of land at [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]] in 1859 set the government on a collision course with the K\u012bngitanga movement, and the government interpreted the K\u012bngitanga response as a challenge to the Crown's authority.<ref name=\"King 2003, p. 214\">{{cite book|ref=harv |first=Michael |last=King |title=The Penguin History of New Zealand |year=2003 |page=214 |isbn=0-14-301867-1 |publisher=Penguin Books}}</ref> Governor Gore Browne succeeded in bringing 3500 Imperial troops from the Australian colonies to quash this perceived challenge, and within four years a total of 9,000 British troops had arrived in New Zealand, assisted by more than 4,000 colonial and ''[[k\u016bpapa]]'' (pro-government M\u0101ori) fighters as the government sought a decisive victory over the \"rebel\" M\u0101ori.\n\nThe use of a punitive [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscation]] policy from 1865, depriving \"rebel\" M\u0101ori of the means of living, fuelled further M\u0101ori anger and resentment, fanning the flames of conflict in [[Second Taranaki War|Taranaki]] (1863\u20131866) and on the [[East Cape War|east coast]] (1865\u20131866).\n\n==Conflicts==\n\nThe various conflicts of the New Zealand wars span a considerable period, and the causes and outcomes differ widely.

The party also attempted to arrest [[Ng\u0101ti Toa]] chiefs [[Te Rauparaha]] and [[Te Rangihaeata]]. Fighting broke out and 22 Europeans were killed, as well as four to six M\u0101ori. Several Europeans were slain after being captured. In early 1844, the new [[Governor of New Zealand|Governor]], [[Robert FitzRoy]], investigated the incident and declared the settlers were at fault.

In April 1847 an accidental shooting of a minor Wanganui M\u0101ori chief led to a bloody revenge attack on a settler family; when the perpetrators were captured and hanged, a major raid was launched on the town as a reprisal, with homes plundered and burned and livestock stolen. M\u0101ori besieged the town before mounting a frontal attack in July 1847.

[[Thomas Gore Browne|Governor Browne]] accepted the purchase with full knowledge of the circumstances and tried to occupy the land, anticipating it would lead to armed conflict, and a demonstration of the substantive sovereignty the British believed they had gained in the 1840 [[Treaty of Waitangi]]. Hostilities began on 17 March 1860. The war was fought by more than 3,500 imperial troops brought in from Australia, as well as volunteer soldiers and militia, against M\u0101ori forces that fluctuated between a few hundred and about 1,500.<ref name=\"King 2003, p. 214\"/> After a series of battles and actions the war ended in a ceasefire, with neither side explicitly accepting the peace terms of the other. Total losses among the imperial, volunteer and militia troops are estimated to have been 238, while M\u0101ori casualties totalled about 200. Though there were claims by the British that they had won the war, there were widely held views at the time they had suffered an unfavourable and humiliating result.

Preparations were suspended in December 1861 when he was replaced by Sir [[George Edward Grey|George Grey]], but Grey revived plans for an invasion in June 1863. He persuaded the Colonial Office in London to send more than 10,000 Imperial troops to New Zealand and General Sir [[Duncan Cameron (general)|Duncan Cameron]] was appointed to lead the campaign. Cameron used soldiers to build the 18&nbsp;km-long [[Great South Road, New Zealand|Great South Road]] to the border of K\u012bngitanga territory and on 9 July 1863 Grey ordered all M\u0101ori living between [[Auckland]] and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to [[Queen Victoria]] or be expelled south of the Waikato River; when his ultimatum was rejected the vanguard of the army crossed the frontier into K\u012bngitanga territory and established a forward camp. A long series of bush raids on his supply lines forced Cameron to build an extensive network of forts and redoubts through the area. In a continual buildup of force, Cameron eventually had 14,000 British and colonial soldiers at his disposal as well as steamers and armoured vessels for use on the Waikato River. They fought a combined M\u0101ori contingent of about 4,000.<ref name=\"Belich 1986a, pp. 125\u2013127\">{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=125\u2013127}}.</ref>\n\nCameron and his K\u012bngitanga foe engaged in several major battles including the [[Battle of Rangiriri]] and a three-day siege at Orakau, capturing the K\u012bngitanga capital of [[Ngaruawahia]] in December 1863, before completing their Waikato conquest in April 1864.

The conflict, which overlapped the wars in [[Waikato]] and [[Tauranga Campaign|Tauranga]], was fuelled by a combination of factors: lingering M\u0101ori resentment over the sale of land at Waitara in 1860 and government delays in resolving the issue; a large-scale [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscation]] policy launched by the government in late 1863; and the rise of the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the [[Pai Marire]] [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of M\u0101ori land and eager to strengthen M\u0101ori identity.<ref name=\"Belich204-5\">{{harvnb|Belich|1986x|pp=204\u2013205}}.</ref> The Hauhau movement became a unifying factor for Taranaki M\u0101ori in the absence of individual M\u0101ori commanders.\n\nThe style of warfare after 1863 differed markedly from that of the 1860\u20131861 conflict, in which M\u0101ori had taken set positions and challenged the army to an open contest. From 1863 the army, working with greater numbers of troops and heavy artillery, systematically took possession of M\u0101ori land by driving off the inhabitants, adopting a \"[[scorched earth]]\" strategy of laying waste to M\u0101ori villages and cultivations, with attacks on villages, whether warlike or otherwise. Historian Brian Dalton noted: \"The aim was no longer to conquer territory, but to inflict the utmost 'punishment' on the enemy; inevitably there was a great deal of brutality, much burning of undefended villages and indiscriminate looting, in which loyal Maoris often suffered.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dalton|1967|p=241}}.</ref> As the troops advanced, the Government built an expanding line of redoubts, behind which settlers built homes and developed farms.

The conflict was sparked by Te Kooti's return to New Zealand after two years of internment on the [[Chatham Islands]], from where he had escaped with almost 200 M\u0101ori prisoners of war and their families. Te Kooti, who had been held without trial on the island for two years, asked that he and his followers be left in peace, but within two weeks they were being pursued by a force of militia, government troops and M\u0101ori volunteers. The pursuit turned into a four-year guerrilla war, involving more than 30 expeditions<ref name=\"Belich 1986a, p. 126\"/> by colonial and M\u0101ori troops against Te Kooti's dwindling number of warriors.\n\nAlthough initially fighting defensively against pursuing government forces, Te Kooti went on the offensive from November 1868, starting with the so-called [[Poverty Bay]] massacre, a well-organised lightning strike against selected European settlers and M\u0101ori opponents in the Matawhero district, in which 51 men, women and children were slaughtered and their homes set alight. The attack prompted another vigorous pursuit by government forces, which included a siege at Ngatapa p\u0101 that came to a bloody end: although Te Kooti escaped the siege, M\u0101ori forces loyal to the government caught and executed more than 130 of his supporters, as well as prisoners he had earlier seized.

Waikato campaign, although sometimes they represented a single ''hapu'', or clan, within the tribe. Continual presence on battlefields remained difficult for most, however, because of the constant need for tribal labour in their home community, so there was a constant turnover of small tribal groups. At Meremere, Paterangi, Hangatiki and Maungatatauri, between August 1863 and June 1864 M\u0101ori maintained forces of between 1,000 and 2,000 men, but troops were forced to disperse after each campaign because of labour and domestic needs at home. Belich has estimated that the total M\u0101ori mobilisation was at least 4,000 warriors, representing one-third of the total manpower available.<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=128\u2013130}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough they were not part of a structured command system, M\u0101ori generally followed a consistent strategic plan, uniting to build skilfully engineered defensive lines up to {{convert|22|km}} long. M\u0101ori united under proven military commanders including Rewi Maniapoto and Tikaokao of [[Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto]] and [[Wiremu Tamihana]] of [[Ng\u0101ti Hau\u0101]].<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=131\u2013133}}.</ref>\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nCampaigners on both sides of the New Zealand wars had developed distinctive war strategies and tactics. The British set out to fight a European-style war, based on engaging with the opposing forces, besieging and then capturing fortified positions. The British Army were professional soldiers who had experience fighting in various parts of the Empire, many from [[India]] and [[Afghanistan]], and were led by officers who were themselves trained by men who had fought at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].\n\nMany of the M\u0101ori fighters had been raised during the [[Musket Wars]], the decades-long bitter intertribal fighting during which warriors had perfected the art of building defensive fortifications around a ''[[p\u0101]]''. During the Flagstaff War Kawiti and Heke appear to have followed a strategy of drawing the colonial forces into attacking a fortified p\u0101, from which the warriors could fight from a strong defensive position that was secure from cannon fire.\n\nThe word ''p\u0101'' means a fortified strong point near a M\u0101ori village or community. They were built with a view to defence, but primarily they were built to safely store food. Puketapu P\u0101 and then [[Ohaeawai]] P\u0101 were the first of the so-called \"gunfighter ''p\u0101''\", built to engage enemies armed with muskets and cannons. A strong, wooden palisade was fronted with woven flax leaves (''[[Phormium tenax]]'') whose tough, stringy foliage absorbed much of the force of the ammunition.<ref name=\"NZW-O2\">{{cite web |last=Cowan |first=James |title=Flax-masked Palisade |publisher=The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume I (1845\u201364) |pages= |year=1955 |url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/Cow01NewZ-fig-Cow01NewZ053c.html |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref> The palisade was lifted a few centimetres from the ground so muskets could be fired from underneath rather than over the top. Sometimes there were gaps in the palisade, which led to killing traps. There were trenches and rifle pits to protect the occupants and, later, very effective artillery shelters.<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=294\u2013295}}.</ref> They were usually built so that they were almost impossible to surround completely, but usually presented at least one exposed face to invite attack from that direction. They were cheap and easily built\u2014the L-Pa at [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]] was constructed by 80 men overnight\u2014and they were completely expendable. The British repeatedly mounted often lengthy expeditions to besiege a ''p\u0101'', which would absorb their bombardment and possibly one or two attacks, and then be abandoned by the M\u0101ori. Shortly afterwards, a new ''p\u0101'' would appear in another inaccessible site. ''P\u0101'' like these were built in the dozens, particularly during the [[First Taranaki War]], where they eventually formed a cordon surrounding [[New Plymouth]], and in the Waikato campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=106\u2013107}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:ALEXANDER(1873) p010 ATTACK ON A MAORI PAH.jpg|thumb|230px|Attack on a M\u0101ori ''p\u0101'' by Sir [[James Edward Alexander]], Commander of the [[West Yorkshire Regiment]].]]\nFor a long time, the modern ''p\u0101'' effectively neutralised the overwhelming disparity in numbers and armaments. At [[Battle of Ohaeawai|Ohaeawai P\u0101]] in 1845, at [[Rangiriri]] in 1863 and again at [[Tauranga Campaign|Gate P\u0101]] in 1864, British and colonial forces discovered that frontal attacks on a defended ''p\u0101'' were extremely costly. At Gate P\u0101, during the 1864 [[Tauranga Campaign]], M\u0101ori withstood a day-long bombardment in their underground shelters and trenches. The palisade destroyed, the British troops rushed the ''p\u0101'' whereupon M\u0101ori fired on them from hidden trenches, killing 38 and injuring many more in the most costly battle for the P\u0101keh\u0101 of the New Zealand Wars. The troops retired and M\u0101ori abandoned the ''p\u0101''.<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|pp=178\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nBritish troops soon realised an easy way to neutralise a ''p\u0101''. Although cheap and easy to build, a gunfighter ''p\u0101'' required a significant input of labour and resources. The destruction of the M\u0101ori economic base in the area around the ''p\u0101'' made it difficult for the ''hapu'' to support the fighting men. This was the reasoning behind the bush-scouring expeditions of Chute and McDonnell in the [[Second Taranaki War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Belich|1986a|p=239}}.</ref>\n\nThe biggest problem for the M\u0101ori was that their society was ill-adapted to support a sustained campaign. A long campaign would disrupt food supplies and epidemics resulted in significant numbers of deaths among the M\u0101ori.<ref name=\"LMR1874\">{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=Lawrence M. |title=Te Wiremu: A Biography of Henry Williams |year=1973 |publisher=Pegasus Press |pages=215\u2013216}}</ref> While the British could defeat M\u0101ori in battle, the defeats were often not decisive. For example, the capture of Ruapekapeka P\u0101 can be considered a British tactical victory, but it was purpose-built as a target for the British, and its loss was not damaging; Heke and Kawiti managed to escape with their forces intact.<ref name=\"Ian McGibbon p.373\">Ian McGibbon, The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Military History, p.373</ref> However the British force consisted of professional soldiers supported by an economic system capable of sustaining them in the field almost indefinitely, in contrast, the M\u0101ori warrior was a part-time fighter who also needed to work on producing food.\n\n==Weapons==\nThe main weapon used by the British forces in the 1860s was the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]]. Properly described as a rifled musket, it was loaded down the barrel like a conventional musket but the barrel was rifled. While muskets were accurate to about 60\u201380&nbsp;m, an 1853 Enfield was accurate to about 300&nbsp;m to 400&nbsp;m in the hands of an experienced soldier; at 100&nbsp;m an experienced soldier could easily hit a human target. The rifle was 1.44&nbsp;m long, weighed 4&nbsp;kg and had a 53&nbsp;cm socket bayonet. This rifle was also commonly used in the [[American Civil War]] by both sides.\n\nThe [[Calisher and Terry carbine]] (short rifle) was ordered by the New Zealand Government from Calisher and Terry, Birmingham gunsmiths in 1861 after earlier fighting against M\u0101ori showed the need for a carbine suited to fighting in heavy bush. This was the favoured weapon of the New Zealand Forest Rangers because of its shortness, its lightness, and its ability to be reloaded while the marksman lay down\u2014unlike the Enfield, which required the soldier to stand to load the powder\u2014and could be loaded on the run. This feature led to a decisive victory for the Forest Rangers at Orakau: several groups of soldiers harried the fleeing M\u0101ori but only the Forest Rangers, equipped with carbines, were able to follow them 10&nbsp;km to the [[Puniu River]] shooting as they went.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stowers |first=Richard |title=Forest Rangers |publisher=self-published |year=1996 |location=Hamilton |page=106 |isbn=0-473-03531-6}}</ref><ref>Von Tempsky, Artist and Adventurer.

The most common revolver appears to have been the five-shot [[Beaumont\u2013Adams revolver|Beaumont\u2013Adams]] .44 percussion revolver. Other revolvers in use were the [[Colt 1851 Navy Revolver|Colt Navy]] .36 1851 model with open top frame. The Colt was favoured by the Forest Rangers because it was light and accurate being a [[single-action]] revolver.

Numerous reports by the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] have criticised Crown actions during the wars, and also found that the M\u0101ori, too, had breached the treaty.<ref name=\"Turanganui\">{{cite web |title=Turanga Tangata Turanga Whenua: The Report on the Turanganui a Kiwa Claims |url=http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/summary.asp?reportid={DE526A10-DDDF-45E1-9E09-FEA0F939832D} |publisher=Waitangi Tribunal |accessdate=20 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525041322/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/summary.asp?reportid=%7BDE526A10-DDDF-45E1-9E09-FEA0F939832D%7D |archivedate=25 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As part of the negotiated out-of-court settlements of tribes' historical claims ([[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements]]), as of 2011 the Crown is making formal apologies to tribes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2011/0273/latest/whole.html?search=qs_all%40act%40bill%40regulation_apology_noresel&p=1#dlm3562516 |title=Ng\u0101ti P\u0101hauwera Treaty Claims Settlement Bill 273-2 (2011), Government Bill \u2013 New Zealand Legislation |work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |quote=The Crown unreservedly apologises for not having honoured its obligations to Ng\u0101ti P\u0101hauwera under the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi) and through this settlement, the Crown seeks to atone for its wrongs and to begin the process of healing.

He was the first of the [[Hohenzollern]] kings of Romania to be born in the country; both of his predecessors had been born in Germany and only came to Romania as adults. As such, he was the first member of the Romanian branch of the Hohenzollerns who spoke Romanian as his first language, and was also the first member of the royal family to be raised in the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] faith.<ref>[http://www.cs.kent.edu/~amarcus/Mihai/english/carol2en.html King Carol II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006022008/http://www.cs.kent.edu/~amarcus/Mihai/english/carol2en.html |date=6 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHe possessed a hedonistic personality that contributed to the controversies marring his reign, and his life was marked by numerous scandals, among them marriages to [[Zizi Lambrino]] and [[Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark]], daughter of King [[Constantine I of Greece]]. His continued affairs with [[Magda Lupescu]] obliged him to renounce his succession rights in 1925 and leave the country. Princess Helen eventually divorced him in 1928.\n\nKing Ferdinand died in 1927 and Carol's five-year-old son ascended the throne as [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]]. Carol then returned to Romania in 1930 and replaced his son and the regency that had been in place. His reign was marked by re-alignment with [[Nazi Germany]], adoption of [[Anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] laws and ultimately evolved into a personal dictatorship beginning in 1938. On 6 September 1940, he was forced by his Prime Minister [[Ion Antonescu]] to leave the country and withdraw abroad into exile. He was succeeded by his son Michael.<ref>According to the 1938 Constitution \u2013 article 41, the crown prince Michael immediately had taken the Regency during the absence of his father.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Carol II of Romania in 1918.jpg|right|thumb|Crown Prince Carol of Romania in 1918.]]\nCarol was born in [[Pele\u0219 Castle]]. Carol grew up under the thumb of his dominating grand-uncle, King Carol I, who largely excluded his parents, the German-born [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Crown Prince Ferdinand]] and the British-born [[Marie of Romania|Crown Princess Marie]], from any role in bringing him up.<ref name=\"Sankey pages 63-64\">Sankey, Margaret \"Carol II\" pages 63-64 from ''War in the Balkans: An Encyclopedic History from the Fall of the Ottoman Empire to the Breakup of Yugoslavia'' edited by Richard Hall, Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2014 page 63.</ref> Romania in the early 20th century had a famously relaxed \"Latin\" sexual morality, and the British Princess [[Marie of Romania|Marie of Edinburgh]] who despite or perhaps because of her Victorian upbringing ended up \"going native\", having a long series of affairs with various Romanian men with whom she could obtain more emotional and sexual satisfaction than she could with Ferdinand, who fiercely resented being cuckolded.<ref>Herman, Eleanor ''Sex with the Queen'', New York: HarperCollins, 2009 pages 262-265.</ref> The stern Carol I felt that Marie was unqualified to raise Prince Carol because of her affairs and her young age, as she was only seventeen when Carol was born, while Marie regarded the King as cold, overbearing tyrant who would crush the life out of her son.\n\nAdditionally, the childless Carol I, who had always wanted a son, treated Prince Carol as his surrogate son and thoroughly spoiled him, indulging his every whim. Ferdinand was a rather shy and weak man who was easily overshadowed by the charismatic Marie, who become the most loved member of the Romanian royal family. Growing up, Carol felt ashamed of his father, whom both his grand-uncle and mother pushed around.<ref>Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by [[Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer]], West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 92.</ref> Carol's childhood was spent being caught up in an emotional tug-of-war between Carol I and Marie, who had very different ideas about how to raise him.<ref name=\"Bucur pages 87-118\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 93.</ref> The Romanian historian Marie Bucur described the battle between Carol I and Princess Marie as one between traditional 19th century Prussian conservatism as personified by Carol I versus the 20th century liberal, modernist and sexually liberated values of the \"[[New Woman]]\" as personified by Princess Marie.<ref name=\"Bucur pages 87-118\"/> Aspects of both Marie's and Carol I's personalities were present in Carol II.<ref name=\"Bucur pages 87-118\"/> Largely because of the battle between the King and Marie, Carol ended being both spoiled and deprived of love.<ref name=\"Bucur pages 87-118\"/> \n[[File:King Carol I of Romania with his nephew and great nephew.jpg|left|thumb|King Carol I of Romania with his nephew the future King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]] and grand-nephew Prince Carol.]]\n\n==Early marriages and love affairs==\nDuring his teenage years, Carol acquired the \"playboy\" image that was to become his defining persona for the rest of his life. Carol I expressed some concern at the direction that Prince Carol was taking, as the young Prince's only serious interest was stamp collecting and he spent an inordinate amount of time drinking, partying, chasing after women; young Carol fathered at least two illegitimate children by the teenage schoolgirl Maria Martini by the time that he was 19. Carol rapidly become a favorite of gossip columnists around the world owing to the frequent photographs that appeared in the newspapers showing him at various parties with him holding a drink in one hand and a woman in the other.<ref>Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 95.</ref>\n\nIn order to teach the Prince the value of the [[Prussian virtues]], the King had the Prince commissioned as an officer into a Prussian guards regiment in 1913.<ref name=\"Sankey pages 63-64\"/> His time with the 1st Prussian Guards regiment did not achieve the desired results, and Carol remained the \"playboy prince\". Romania in the early 20th century was an intensely [[Francophile]] nation, indeed perhaps the most Francophile nation in the entire world as the Romanian elite obsessively went about embracing all things French as the model for perfection in everything. To certain extent, Carol was influenced by the prevailing Francophilia, but at the same time he inherited from Carol I, in the words of the American historian Margaret Sankey, a \"profound love of German militarism\" and the idea that all democratic governments were weak governments.<ref name=\"Sankey pages 63-64\"/>\n[[File:Caroltraining.jpg|thumb|left|Crown Prince Carol training during World War I with a [[Chauchat|Chauchat machine gun]]]]\nIn November 1914, Carol joined the [[Senate of Romania|Romanian Senate]], as the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 Constitution]] guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching maturity.<ref>[http://ziua.net/display.php?data=2007-11-29&id=230045 \"Ce citeau rom\u00e2nii acum 68 de ani?\"], ''Ziua'', 29 November 2007.</ref> Known more for his romantic misadventures than for any leadership skills, Carol ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] for \"Charles\") was first married in the Cathedral Church of [[Odessa, Ukraine]], 31 August 1918 (under the [[Operation Faustschlag|occupation of the Central Powers]] at that time), to [[Zizi Lambrino|Joanna Marie Valentina Lambrino]] (1898\u20131953), known as \"Zizi\", the daughter of a Romanian general, Constantin Lambrino. The fact that Carol technically had deserted as he left his post at the Army without permission to marry Zizi Lambrino caused immense controversy at the time.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 94.</ref> The marriage was annulled on 29 March 1919 by the Ilfov County Court. Carol and Zizi continued to live together after the annulment. Their only child, [[Carol Lambrino|Mircea Gregor Carol Lambrino]], was born 8 January 1920.\n\nCarol next married [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark]], who was known in [[Romania]] as Crown Princess Elena, on 10 March 1921 in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. They were second cousins, both of them great-grandchildren of [[Queen Victoria]], as well as third cousins in descent from [[Nicholas I of Russia]]. Helen had known Carol's dissolute behaviour and previous marriage, but was undeterred, being in love with Carol. The intention behind this arranged marriage was to help organise a dynastic alliance between Greece and Romania. Bulgaria had territorial disputes with Greece, Romania and Yugoslavia and all three of the latter states tended to be close during the interwar period owing to their shared fears of the Bulgarians. Helen and Carol's only child, [[Michael I of Romania|Michael]], was born seven months after their marriage, sparking rumours that Michael was conceived out of wedlock. Apparently close at first, Carol and Helen drifted apart. Carol's marriage with Princess Helen was an unhappy one, and he frequently engaged in extramarital affairs.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> The elegant wallflower Helen found the bohemian Carol, with his love of heavy drinking and constant partying, rather too wild for her tastes.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Carol disliked royal and aristocratic women, whom he found too stiff and formal for his tastes, and had an extremely marked preference for commoners, much to the chagrin of his parents.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Carol found low-born women to have the qualities that he sought in a woman, such as informality, spontaneity, humor and passion.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\n==Controversies surrounding Magda Lupescu==\nThe marriage soon collapsed in the wake of Carol's affair with [[Magda Lupescu|Elena \"Magda\" Lupescu]] (1895?\u20131977), the Roman Catholic daughter of a Jewish pharmacist and his Roman Catholic wife. Magda Lupescu had formerly been the wife of Army officer Ion T\u00e2mpeanu. The [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], which dominated Romania's politics, made much of Carol's relationship with Lupescu to argue that he was unqualified to be king. One of the leading figures of the National Liberals was Prince [[Barbu \u0218tirbey]]\u2014who was also Queen Marie's lover\u2014and Carol had a strong dislike of \u0218tirbey, who had humiliated his father via his indiscreetly disguised relationship with Marie, and hence of the National Liberals.<ref>Herman, Eleanor ''Sex with the Queen'', New York: HarperCollins, 2009 page 266.</ref> Knowing that Carol was ill-disposed towards them, the National Liberals waged a sustained campaign to keep him from the throne.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 pages 96-97.</ref> The campaign waged by the National Liberals had less to do with disgust with Carol's relationship with Madame Lupescu than with an effort to remove a potential \"loose cannon\", as Carol made it clear when he succeeded to the throne that he would not be content to let the National Liberals dominate politics in the way that the previous Hohenzollern kings had.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/>\n\nAs a result of the scandal, Carol renounced his right to the throne on 28 December 1925 in favour of his son by Crown Princess Helen, [[Michael of Romania|Michael]] (Mihai), who became king in July 1927. Helen divorced Carol in 1928. After renouncing his right to the throne, Carol moved to Paris, where he lived openly in a common-law relationship with Madame Lupescu.<ref>Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 97.</ref> The National Liberal Party was largely a vehicle for the powerful Br\u0103tianu family to exercise power and, after the National Liberal Prime Minister [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]] died in 1927, the Br\u0103tianus were unable to agree upon a successor, causing the fortunes of the National Liberals to go into decline.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 98.</ref> In the 1928 elections, the National Peasant Party under [[Iuliu Maniu]] won a resounding victory, taking 78% of the vote.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> As Prince [[Prince Nicholas of Romania|Nicolae]], the chief of the Regency Council that governed for King Michael, was known to be friendly with the National Liberals, the new prime minister was determined to dispose of the regency council by bringing back Carol.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/>\n\n==Return to the throne==\n[[File:Juramant Carol II.jpg|300px|thumb|Oath of Carol II in front of parliament, 8 June 1930]]\nReturning to the country on 7 June 1930, in a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] engineered by National Peasant Prime Minister [[Iuliu Maniu]], Carol was recognized by the Parliament as king of Romania the following day. For the next decade he sought to influence the course of Romanian political life, first through manipulation of the rival Peasant and Liberal parties and anti-Semitic factions, and subsequently (January 1938) through a ministry of his own choosing. Carol also sought to build up his own [[Carol II of Romania's cult of personality|personality cult]] against the growing influence of the [[Iron Guard]], for instance by setting up a [[paramilitary]] [[youth organization]] known as ''[[Straja \u021a\u0103rii]]'' in 1935. The American historian [[Stanley G. Payne]] described Carol as \"the most cynical, corrupt and power-hungry monarch who ever disgraced a throne anywhere in twentieth-century Europe\".<ref name=\"Payne, Stanley page 278\">Payne, Stanley ''A History of Fascism, 1914-1945'' Madison: University of Wisconsin, 1996 page 278.</ref> A colorful character, Carol was in the words of the British historian [[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Richard Cavendish]]:<blockquote>\"Dashing, wilful and reckless, a lover of women, champagne and speed, Carol drove racing cars and piloted planes, and on state occasions appeared in operetta uniforms with enough ribbons, chains and orders to sink a small destroyer.\"<ref>{{cite magazine\n | last = Cavendish \t\n | first = Richard \n | title = Death of Carol II of Romania\n | magazine = History Today \n | date=April 2003| url = http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/death-carol-ii-romania\n | accessdate = 2015-11-29}}</ref></blockquote> The Romanian historian Maria Bucur wrote about Carol: <blockquote>\"Of course, he loved luxury; being born to privilege he expected nothing less than the grand lifestyle he saw in the other courts of Europe. Yet his style was not outlandish or grotesque like Nicole Ceau\u0219escu's unique brand of kitsch. He liked things large but relatively simple-his royal palace testifies to that trait. Carol\u2019s true passions were Lupescu, hunting and cars and he spared no expense on them.<br /><br />Carol liked to present an impressive and populist persona to the public, wearing garish military uniforms adorned with medals, and to be the benefactor of every philanthropic endeavor in the land. He loved parades and grandiose festivals and watched them closely, but he was not taken in by these events as more than shows of his power; he did not take them as a show of sincere popularity as Ceau\u0219escu did during his later years.<ref>Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 91</ref></blockquote> Carol had a populist style, depicting himself as the defender of the common man against the corrupt Francophile elites (especially the National Liberals) mixed in with generous elements of nationalism and Eastern Orthodoxy.<ref name=\"ReferenceG\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 pages 100-101</ref> Carol's tendency to throw together populism, authoritarianism, a vaguely xenophobic nationalism and Orthodoxy superficially resembled the style of the Iron Guard, albeit Carol's message was far less passionate than that of [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], \"the Captain\" who preached a message of ferociously xenophobic ultra-nationalism, intense Orthodox mysticism, extremely violent anti-Semitism, a populist disdain for all the elites and a glorification of death in the service of the cause as the most beautiful, glorious, noble and erotic experience in the entire world.<ref name=\"ReferenceG\"/> Codreanu, a man with death fetish had made the Iron Guard into a macabre death cult and often sent his followers out on what were clearly suicidal missions. After committing murders, Iron Guardsmen rarely attempted to flee and instead waited to be arrested as they wanted to be executed for their crimes. Many found the way that Legionaries went to their executions positively giddy and joyful about the prospect of their own deaths, happily proclaiming their deaths were the happiest moment of their life a deeply eerie experience. Carol regarded Codreanu's death fetish together with his claim that the Archangel Michael had told him that God had chosen him to save Romania as evidence that Codreanu was \"crazy\".\n\nCarol had sworn in his coronation oath to uphold the constitution of 1923, a promise he had no intention of keeping and right from the start of his reign, the king meddled in politics to increase his own power.<ref name=\"Payne, Stanley page 278\"/> Carol was an opportunist with no real principles or values other than the belief he was the right man to rule Romania and that what his kingdom needed was a modernizing dictatorship.<ref>Quinlan, Paul ''The Playboy King'', Westpoint: Greenwood Press, 1995 page 116.</ref> Carol ruled via an informal body known as the ''camarilla'' comprising courtiers together with senior diplomats, army officers, politicians and industrialists who were all in some way dependent upon royal favor to advance their careers.<ref name=\"Haynes pages 105-134\">Haynes, Rebecca \"Reluctant Allies?

When Carol broke his own word and continued to live with Madame Lupescu, Maniu resigned in protest in October 1930, and was to emerge as one of Carol's leading enemies.<ref name=\"Haynes pages 105-134\"/> At the same time, Carol' return had prompted a break in the National Liberals with [[Gheorghe I. Br\u0103tianu]] breaking away to found a new party, the [[National Liberal Party-Br\u0103tianu]] that was willing to work with the new king. Despite his dislike of the National Liberals, Maniu's enmity towards Carol left the king with little choice, but to enlist as his allies the break-away factions of the National Liberals against the National Peasants who demanding that Carol banish Lupescu and return to Princess Helen of Greece.\n\nThe \"Red Queen\" as Lupescu was known to the Romanian people on the account of the color of her hair was the most hated woman in 1930s Romania, a woman whom ordinary Romanians saw in the words of the British historian Rebecca Haynes as \"the embodiment of evil\".<ref name=\"Haynes pages 105-134\"/> Princess Helen was widely viewed as the wronged woman while Lupescu was seen as the ''femme fatale'' who had stolen Carol away from the loving arms of Helen. Lupescu was Roman Catholic, but because her father was a Jew, she was widely viewed as Jewish. Lupescu's personality did not win her many friends as she was arrogant, pushy, manipulative and extremely greedy with an insatiable taste for buying the most expensive French clothes, cosmetics and jewelry.<ref name=\"ReferenceH\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 pages 94-95.</ref> At a time when many Romanians were suffering from the Great Depression, Carol's habit of indulging Lupescu's expensive tastes caused much resentment with many of Carol's subjects grumbling that the money would have been better spent on alleviating poverty in the kingdom. Further adding to Lupescu's immense unpopularity was she was a businesswoman who used her connections to the Crown to engage in dubious transactions that usually involved large sums of public money going into her pocket.<ref name=\"Haynes pages 105-134\"/> However the contemporary viewpoint that Carol was a mere puppet of Lupescu is incorrect and Lupescu's influence on political decision-making was much exaggerated at the time.<ref name=\"ReferenceH\"/> Lupescu was primarily interested in enriching herself to support her extravagant lifestyle, and had no real interest in politics beyond protecting her ability to engage in corruption.<ref name=\"ReferenceH\"/> Unlike Carol, Lupescu had utterly no interest in social policy or foreign affairs and was such a self-absorbed narcissist that she was unaware of just how unpopular she was with ordinary people.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 95.</ref> Carol by contrast was interested in the affairs of the state, and through he never sought to deny his relationship with Lupescu, he was careful not to display her too much in public as he knew that this would bring him unpopularity.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\"/>\n\nCarol sought to play the National Liberals, the National Peasant Party and the Iron Guard off against each other with the ultimate aim of making himself master of Romanian politics and disposing of all the parties in Romania.<ref name=\"Payne, Stanley page 278\"/> With regards to the Legion of the Archangel Michael, Carol had no intention of ever letting the Iron Guard come to power, but insofar as the Legion was a disruptive force that weakened both the National Liberals and the National Peasants, Carol welcomed the rise of the Iron Guard in the early 1930s and he sought to use the Legion for his own ends.<ref name=\"Payne, Stanley page 278\"/> On 30 December 1933, the Iron Guard assassinated the National Liberal Prime Minister [[Ion G. Duca]], which led to the first of several bans placed on the Legion.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The assassination of Duca, which was Romania's first political murder since 1862 shocked Carol, who saw the willingness of Codreanu to order the assassination of the Prime Minister as a sign that the egomaniacal Codreanu was getting out of control and that Codreanu would not play the role assigned by the king as a disruptive force threatening the National Liberals and National Peasant alike.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In 1934, when Codreanu was brought to trial for ordering Duca's assassination, he used as his defense that the entire Francophile elite were completely corrupt and not properly Romanian, and as such Duca as just another corrupt National Liberal politician deserved to die. The jury acquitted Codreanu, an act that worried Carol as it showed that Codreanu's revolutionary message that the entire elite needed to be destroyed was winning popular approval. In the spring of 1934 after Codreanu was acquitted, Carol together with the Bucharest police prefect Gavril\u0103 Marinescu and Madame Lupescu were involved in a half-hearted plot to kill Codreanu by poisoning his coffee, an effort that was abandoned before being attempted.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\">Haynes, Rebecca \"Reluctant Allies?

The alliance with France together with an alliance with Poland signed in 1921 and the Little Entente which united Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were the cornerstones of Romanian foreign policy. Starting in 1919, the French had sought to create the ''[[Cordon sanitaire]]'' that would keep both Germany and the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe. Carol did not seek to replace the foreign policy he had inherited in 1930 at first as he regarded the continuation of the ''cordon sanitaire'' as the best guarantee of Romania's independence and territorial integrity, and as such, his foreign policy was essentially pro-French. At the time that Romania signed the alliance with France, the Rhineland region of Germany was demilitarised and the thinking in Bucharest had always been that if Germany should commit any act of aggression anywhere in Eastern Europe, the French would begin an offensive into the ''Reich''. Starting in 1930 when the French began to build the [[Maginot Line]] along their border with Germany, some doubts started to be expressed in Bucharest about whatever the French might actually come to Romania's aid in the event of German aggression. In 1933, Carol had [[Nicolae Titulescu]]-an outspoken champion of collective security under the banner of League of Nations-appointed foreign minister with instructions to use principles of collective security as the building blocks for creating some sort of security structure intended to keep both Germany and the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany'', New York: Enigma Books, 2013 page 251.</ref> Carol and Titulescu personally disliked one another, but Carol wanted Titulescu as a foreign minister as he believed he was the best man for strengthening ties with France and for bringing Great Britain into the affairs of Eastern Europe under the guise of the collective security commitments contained the League Covenant.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 110.</ref>\n\nThe process of ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (coordination) in National Socialist Germany did not extend only to the ''Reich'', but was rather thought of by the National Socialist leadership as a worldwide process in which the NSDAP would take control over all of the ethnic German communities around the entire world. The Foreign Policy Department of the NSDAP headed by [[Alfred Rosenberg]] starting in 1934 had attempted to take over the ''volksdeutsch'' (ethnic German) community in Romania, a policy that greatly offended Carol who regarded this as outrageous German interference in Romania's internal affairs.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 234\">Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II 1937-1939'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 234.</ref> As Romania had half-million ''volksdeutsch'' citizens in the 1930s, the Nazi campaign to take over the German community in Romania was a real concern for Carol, who feared that the German minority might become a fifth column.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 234\"/> In addition, Rosenberg's agents had established contracts with the Romanian extreme right, most notably with the National Christian Party headed by [[Octavian Goga]] and less substantial links with the Iron Guard headed by [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], which further annoyed Carol.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 234\"/> The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote about Carol's foreign policy views that: \"He admired and feared Germany, but feared and disliked the Soviet Union\".<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 236\">Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II 1937-1939'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 236.</ref> The fact that the first leader to visit Nazi Germany (albeit not in an official capacity) was the Hungarian Prime Minister [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]]-who during his visit to Berlin in October 1933 signed an economic treaty that placed Hungary within the German economic sphere of influence-was a source of much alarm to Carol.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\">Leitz, Christian \"Arms as Levers: \"Mat\u00e9riel\" and Raw Materials in Germany's Trade with Romania in the 1930s\" pages 312-332 from ''The International History Review'', Volume 19, Issue # 2, May 1997 page 315</ref> For the entire interwar period, Budapest refused to recognize the frontiers imposed by the Treaty of Trianon and laid claim to [[Transylvania]] region of Romania. Carol like the rest of the Romanian elite was worried by the prospect of an alliance of the revisionist states that rejected the legitimacy of the international order created by the Allies in 1918-20 as indicating that Germany would support Hungary's claims to Transylvania.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> Hungary had territorial disputes with Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, all of which happened to be allies of France. Accordingly, Franco-Hungarian relations were extremely bad during the interwar period, and so it seemed natural that Hungary would ally itself with France's archenemy Germany.\n\nIn 1934, Titulescu played a leading role in creating the [[Balkan Entente]] which brought together Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey in an alliance intended to counter Bulgarian revanchism.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/> The Balkan Entente was intended to be the beginning of an alliance that would bring together all of the anti-revisionist states of Eastern Europe. Like France, Romania was allied to both Czechoslovakia and Poland, but because of the [[Cieszyn|Teschen]] dispute in Silesia, Warsaw and Prague were bitter enemies. Like the diplomats of the Qua d'Orsay, Carol was exasperated by the bitter Polish-Czechoslovak dispute, arguing that it was absurd for anti-revisionist Eastern European states to be feuding with one another in the face of the rise of German and Soviet power.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/> Several times, Carol attempted to mediate the Teschen dispute and thus end the Polish-Czechoslovak feud without much success.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/> Reflecting his initially pro-French orientation, in June 1934 when the French foreign minister [[Louis Barthou]] visited Bucharest to meet with the foreign ministers of the Little Entente of Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, Carol organized lavish celebrations to welcome Barthou that were made to symbolized the enduring Franco-Romanian friendship between the two \"Latin sisters\".<ref name=\"ReferenceL\">Leitz, Christian \"Arms as Levers: \"Mat\u00e9riel\" and Raw Materials in Germany's Trade with Romania in the 1930s\" pages 312-332 from ''The International History Review'', Volume 19, Issue # 2, May 1997 pages 314-315</ref> The German minister to Romania, Count [[Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg]] complained with a disgust in a report to Berlin that everyone in the Romanian elite was an incurable Francophile who told him that Romania would never betray its \"Latin sister\" France.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Carol also considered the possibility that if Romanian-German relations were improved, then perhaps Berlin could be persuaded not to support Budapest in its campaign to regain Transylvania.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> Further pressing Carol towards Germany was the desperate state of the Romanian economy. Even before the Great Depression, Romania had been an extremely poor country and the Depression had hit Romania hard with Romanians been unable to export much owing to the global trade war set off by the American Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which in turn led to a decline in the value of the ''lei'' as Romanian's reserves of foreign exchange were being used up.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> In June 1934, the Romanian finance minister Victor Sl\u0103vescu visited Paris to ask the French to inject millions of francs into Romanian treasury and to lower their tariffs on Romanian goods.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> When the French refused both requests, an annoyed Carol wrote in his diary that the \"Latin sister\" France was behaving in a less than sisterly way towards Romania.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> In April 1936 when Wilhelm Fabricius was appointed German minister in Bucharest, the Foreign Minister Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]] in his instructions to the new minister described Romania as an unfriendly, pro-French state, but suggested that the prospect of more trade with the ''Reich'' might bring the Romanians out of the French orbit.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> Neurath further instructed Fabricius that while Romania was a not a major power in a military sense, it was a state of crucial importance to Germany because of its oil.\n\nCarol often encouraged splits in the political parties to encourage his own ends. In 1935, [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]], the leader of the Transylvanian branch of the National Peasants broke away to form the [[Romanian Front]] with Carol's encouragement.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Haynes, Rebecca \"Reluctant Allies?

A British Foreign Office memo from March 1936 stated that only nations in the world that would apply sanctions on Germany for remilitarizing the Rhineland if the League of Nations should vote for such a step were Britain, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and Romania.<ref>Emmerson, J.T ''The Rhineland Crisis 7 March 1936 A Study in Multilateral Diplomacy'', Ames: Iowa State University Press, 1977 page 171</ref> In the aftermath of the remilitarization of the Rhineland and once it was clear that no sanctions were going to be applied against Germany, Carol started to voice his fears that the days of French influence in Eastern Europe were numbered and Romania might have to seek some understanding with Germany to preserve its independence.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933\u201336'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 page 261.</ref> With continuing the alliance with France, after March 1936 Carol also began a policy of attempting to improve relations with Germany.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany'', New York: Enigma Books, 2013 page 253.</ref>\n\nOn the domestic front, in the summer of 1936 Codreanu and Maniu formed an alliance to oppose the growing power of the Crown and the National Liberal government.<ref>Haynes, Rebecca \"Reluctant Allies?

Br\u0103tianu]] to Germany to meet with [[Adolf Hitler]], the Foreign Minister Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]] and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] to tell them of Romania's desire for a rapprochement with the ''Reich''.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard pages 252-253\">Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany'', New York: Enigma Books, 2013 pages 252-253.</ref> Carol was much relieved when Br\u0103tianu reported that Hitler, Neurath and G\u00f6ring had all reassured him that the ''Reich'' had no interest in supporting Hungarian revanchism, and were neutral on the Transylvania dispute.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard pages 252-253\"/> The decoupling of Berlin's campaign to overthrow the international system created by the Treaty of Versailles from Budapest's campaign to overthrow the system created by the Treaty of Trianon was welcome news to Carol, creating possibility that a greater Germany would not mean a greater Hungary. G\u00f6ring, the newly appointed chief of the [[Four Year Plan]] organization designed to have Germany ready to wage a total war by 1940 was especially interested in Romania's oil, and talked much to Br\u0103tianu about a new era of German-Romanian economic relations.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard pages 252-253\"/> Germany had no almost oil of its own, and throughout the Third Reich control of Romania's oil was a key foreign policy goal.

On 11 February 1938, Carol drafted [[1938 Constitution of Romania|a new constitution]]. Although it was superficially similar to its 1923 predecessor, it was actually a severely authoritarian and corporatist document. The new constitution effectively codified the emergency powers Carol had seized in February, turning his government into a de facto legal dictatorship. It concentrated virtually all governing power in his hands, almost to the point of [[absolute monarchy]]. The new constitution was approved in [[1938 Romanian constitutional referendum|a plebiscite]] held under far-from-secret conditions; voters were required to appear before an election bureau and verbally state whether they approved the constitution; silence was deemed as a \"yes\" vote.

It was not until the summer of 1942 that Germany's first synthetic oil plants finally start operating. It was making painfully obvious to G\u00f6ring in the first months of 1939 that the German economy would not be ready to support a total war by 1940 as the Four Year Plan of 1936 had envisioned while at the same time his economic experts were telling him the ''Reich'' needed to import 400, 000 tons of oil per month while Germany had in fact imported only 61, 000 tons of oil per month in the last four months of 1938.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 175\"/>\n\nHence Wohlthat demanded during his talks with the Romanian Foreign Minister [[Grigore Gafencu]] that Romania nationalize their entire oil industry which was henceforward to controlled by a new corporation owned jointly by the German and Romanian governments while demanding Romania \"respect German export interests\" by only selling their oil to Germany.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 175\"/> In addition, Wohlthat demanded a host of other measures that to all practical purposes would have converted Romania into a German economic colony.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 175\"/> As Carol had no intention of giving in to these demands, the talks in Bucharest went very badly. It was at this point that Carol began what become known as the \"Tilea affair\" when on 17 March 1939 Virgil Tilea, the Romanian minister in London burst unexpectedly into the office of the British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in an agitated state to announce that his country was faced with an imminent German invasion, and asked Halifax for British support.<ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 169-170.</ref> At same time, Carol mobilized five infantry corps on the Hungarian border to guard the supposed invasion.<ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 175-176.</ref> The British \"economic offensive\" in the Balkans was causing Germany very real economic pain as the British bought up Romanian oil that the Germans badly needed, hence their demands for control of the Romanian oil industry that so offended Carol.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 175\"/> As the British believed in Tilea's claims, the \"Tilea affair\" had an immense impact of British foreign policy and led to the [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] government doing a ''volta-face'' from appeasement of Germany to a policy of \"containing\" the ''Reich''.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II 1937-1939'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 pages 540-544.</ref><ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 176-178.</ref> Carol denied, unconvincingly of knowing anything about Tilea was up to in London, but the British warnings to Germany against invading Romania in March 1939 led to the Germans to relax their demands and the latest German-Romanian economic treaty signed on 23 March 1939 was in the words of Watt 'very vague\".<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 176\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 176.</ref> Despite the \"Tilea affair\", Carol had decided that he would refuse to become involved in any diplomacy that would force him to decisively choose between Germany and Britain, and he would never accept any support from the Soviet Union to deter Germany.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 176\"/>\n\nAs part of their new policy of seeking to \"contain\" Germany starting in March 1939, the British sought the construction of the \"peace front\" that was to comprise at a minimum Britain, France, Poland, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Romania, Greece and Yugoslavia.

Balkans\" and threatened to pull out of the Balkan Pact, Gafencu had a summit with the Yugoslav Foreign Minister Aleksandar Cincar-Markovi\u0107 at 21 May 1939 at the Iron Gates to ask the Yugoslavs to stay in the Balkan Pact.<ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 p.291.</ref> However, Cincar-Markovi\u0107's talk of leaving the Balkan Pact turned out to be a ploy by the Yugoslav Regent, Prince Paul, who was backing a plan mooted by the Turkish Foreign Minister [[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu]] to have Bulgaria join the Balkan Pact in exchange for Romania ceding part of the Dobrudja region.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron p.292\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 p.292.</ref> In a letter to Carol, Paul stated that he wanted the Bulgarians \"off my back\" as he afraid of the Italians building up their forces in their new colony of Albania, and asked his friend to make this concession for him.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron p.292\"/> Carol in response stated it was out of the question for him to cede any territory to Bulgarians, partly because he was against giving any of his realm on principle and partly because to cede the Dobrudja would only encourage the Hungarians to renew their claims on Transylvania.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron p.300\"/>\n\nDespite his formal opposition to joining the \"peace front\", Carol did decide to strengthen the [[Balkan Entente]], and especially to strengthen ties with Turkey.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron pages 300-301\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 300-301.</ref> Since Britain and France were working for an alliance with Turkey while at same time holding talks with the Soviet Union, Carol reasoned that if Romania was to be firmly allied to Turkey, that this would be a way of associating Romania with the emerging \"peace front\" without actually joining it.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald

better relations with Bulgaria's archenemy, Greece.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron pages 300-301\"/>\n\nIn July 1939, the king had a major clash with Fritz Fabritius, the leader of Nazified German National Party which was the largest of the ''volksdeutsch'' parties and which joined the National Renaissance Front in January 1939.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 302\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 302.</ref> Fabritius had taken to calling himself the ''F\u00fchrer'', had formed two para-military groups, the National Workers Front and the German Youth, and was holding ceremonies in which members of Romania's 800, 000 strong German minority had to swear personal oaths of loyalty to him.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 302\"/> In early July, Fabritius had during a visit to Munich given a speech in he stated that the Romanian ''volksdeutsch'' were loyal to Germany, not Romania, and spoke of wish to see a \"Greater German ''Reich''\" which would be secured by armed peasant settlements along the Carpathians, Ural and Caucasus mountains.{{fact|date=January 2020}} In this ''Grossraum'' (an untranslatable German word meaning roughly \"greater space\"), only Germans would be allowed to live and those not willing to be Germanized would have to leave.{{fact|date=January 2020}} In response to this speech, when Fabritius returned to Romania, he was summoned to a meeting with C\u0103linescu on 13 July who told him that the king had enough and was going to take action against him.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Fabritius promised to behave, but was expelled from Romania shortly afterwards when one of his staffers accidentally left on a train a briefcase full of documents showing Fabritius's supporters were arming themselves and that ''F\u00fchrer'' Fabritius was being financed by Germany.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn July 1939, when Carol heard rumors that Hungary supported by Germany was planning on invading Romania following a new crisis in Romanian-Hungarian relations caused by complaints from Budapest that the Romanians were mistreating the Magyar minority in Transylvania (which were supported by Berlin), the king ordered general mobilization of his military while taking off in the royal yacht to [[Istanbul]].<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 304\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 304.</ref> During his unexpected trip to Istanbul, Carol held talks with the Turkish President [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] and the Turkish Foreign Minister [[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu]] during which the Turks promised him that Turkey would immediately mobilize its military in the event of an Axis attack on Romania.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 304\"/> The Turks in their turn pressed Carol to sign an alliance with the Soviet Union, something that Carol said very reluctantly he might do if the Turks were to serve as the middlemen and if the Soviets were to promise to recognize the border with Romania.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 304\"/> The show of Romanian resolve supported by Turkey had the effect of causing the Hungarians to back off on their demands against Romania.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 304\"/>\n\nThe news of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact in August 1939, was received with horror by Carol.<ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 470-471.</ref> In August 1939, Carol sought to play off both sides against each other. Carol allowed C\u0103linescu to tell Thierry that the Romanians would destroy their oil fields if the Axis should invade while at the same time Gafencu told the German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] of his firm friendship with Germany, his opposition to the \"peace front\" and of his desire to sell more oil to the Germans.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 471\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 471</ref> After the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, C\u0103linescu advised Carol: \"Germany is the real danger. An alliance with it is tantamount to a protectorate. Only Germany's defeat by France and Britain can ward off the danger\".<ref name=\"Ancel, Jean page 41\"/> On 27 August 1939 Gafencu told Fabricius that Romania would declare neutrality if Germany invaded Poland and that he wanted to sell to Germany some 450, 000 tons of oil per month in exchange for 1 million and half ''Reichmarks'' plus a number of modern German aircraft for free.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 471\"/> Carol met with the German air force attach\u00e9 on 28 August 1939 to congratulate the Germans on the great diplomatic success they had gained with the pact with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 471\"/> Unknown to Carol, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact had in its infamous \"secret protocols\" assigned the Romanian region of Bessarabia to the Soviet Union. In the short run, the German-Soviet pact was a blessing for Carol since Germany now had access to Soviet oil, which reduced the pressure on Romania.\n\n==World War II==\nWhen World War II began with the German aggression against Poland on 1 September 1939, followed up by British and French declarations of war on the ''Reich'' on 3 September 1939, Carol proclaimed neutrality. In doing so Carol violated the letter of the treaty of alliance with Poland signed in 1921 and the spirit of treaty of alliance signed with France in 1926. Carol justified his policy under the grounds that with Germany and the Soviet Union allied in the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 and France holding its forces behind the Maginot line, unwilling to start an offensive into Germany, that neutrality was his only hope of preserving his kingdom's independence.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 79\">Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 79.</ref> As usual with Carol, he sought to play a careful balancing act between the Allies and the Axis, on one hand signing a new economic treaty with Germany while on the other hand allowing for a considerable period of time for the Polish troops to cross into Romania while declining to intern them as international law required; instead the Poles were allowed to travel to [[Constan\u021ba]] to board ships to take them to [[Marseille]] to continue the fight against Germany from France.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 79\"/> The [[Romanian Bridgehead]] remained a key escape route for thousands of Poles in the desperate days of September 1939. It was only receiving a number of furious complaints from Fabricius about the passage of Polish soldiers across Romania that Carol finally started to intern the fleeing Poles.\n\nOn 21 September 1939, Prime Minister C\u0103linescu was assassinated by the Iron Guard in a plot organized out of Berlin, thus silencing the strongest pro-Allied voice amongst Carol's ''camarilla''.<ref>Ancel, Jean ''The History of the Holocaust in Romania'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011 page 42.</ref> The next day, the nine assassins of C\u0103linescu were publicity shot without the benefit of a trial and on the week of 22\u201328 September 1939 242 Iron Guards were the victims of extrajudicial executions.<ref>Ancel, Jean ''The History of the Holocaust in Romania'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011 page 43.</ref> Because of its oil, Romania was considered to be highly important by both sides, and during the [[Phoney War]] of 1939-40 there occurred what Weinberg called a \"silent struggle over Romania's oil\" with the German government doing everything within its power to have as much Romanian oil as possible while the British and French governments equally doing everything possible to deny the ''Reich'' Romanian oil.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 pages 78-79.</ref> The British in particular launched an unsuccessful campaign to sabotage Romanian oil fields and the transportation network that took Romanian oil to Germany.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 79\"/> In January 1940, Carol gave a speech on the radio in which he proclaimed that it was his brilliant handing of foreign policy that kept Romania neutral and safe from danger.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 117\">Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century and After'', London: Routledge, 1997 page 117.</ref> In the same speech, Carol announced that he was going to be building a gigantic defense line around the kingdom and as such, taxes would have to rise to pay for it.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 117\"/> Romanians called the proposed line the Imagiont Line, as the line was considered to be a purely imaginary version of the Maginot line and many of Carol's subjects suspected that the money raised by higher taxes would go to the king's Swiss bank accounts.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 117\"/>\n\nCarol had hedged his bets about whatever to choose between the Allies and the Axis. It was only in late May 1940 when France was clearly losing the war that Carol swung decisively over to the Axis side.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 pages 135-136.</ref> During the later period of the Phoney War after waging a campaign of bloody repression against the Iron Guard, which reached its peak after C\u0103linescu's assassination, Carol began a policy of reaching out to the surviving Iron Guard leaders.<ref>Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

In April 1940, Carol had reached an agreement with Vasile Noveanu, the leader of the underground Iron Guard in Romania, but it was not until early May 1940 that [[Horia Sima]], the leader of the Iron Guards in exile in Germany could be persuaded to support the government.<ref name=\"Haynes pages 700-725\">Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

Romania's elite had been so obsessively Francophile for so long that France's defeat had the effect of discrediting that elite in the eyes of public opinion and led to an upswing of popular support for the pro-German Iron Guard.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 117\"/>\n\nIn amidst of the turn towards the Iron Guard and Germany came a bombshell from abroad. On 26 June 1940, the Soviet Union submitted an ultimatum demanding that Romania hand over the [[Bessarabia]] region (which had been Russian until 1918) and the northern part of Bukovina (which had never been Russian) to the Soviet Union, and threatened war within next two days if the ultimatum was rejected.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 136\">Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 136.</ref> Carol had at one moment considered following the example of Finland in 1939 when faced with a similar Soviet ultimatum, but the outcome of the [[Winter War]] was scarcely an inspiring example.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 136\"/> Carol at first considered rejecting the ultimatum, but upon being informed that the Romanian Army would be no match for the Red Army, agreed to cede Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union. Carol appealed to Berlin for support against the Soviet ultimatum, only to be told to comply with Stalin's demands.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 136\"/> The loss of the regions without any fighting to the Soviet Union was felt to be a national humiliation by the Romanian people, and was a huge blow to Carol's prestige. [[Carol II of Romania's cult of personality|Carol's personality cult]] had by 1940 reached such extreme heights that the withdrawal without any resistance from Bessarabia and northern Bukovina revealed that Carol was a mere man after all, and so badly dented his prestige more than would have been the case if Carol had maintained a more modest image.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 117\"/>\n\nOn 28 June 1940, Sima entered the cabinet as Under-secretary of State at the Ministry of Education .<ref>Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

In particular, Carol proved unwilling to cede Transylvania and had it not been for the diplomatic intervention of Germany and Italy, Romania and Hungary would have gone to war with each other in the summer of 1940.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 184\"/> In the meantime, Carol had on 9 July 1940 imprisoned General [[Ion Antonescu]] after the latter had criticized the king, charging it was the corruption of the royal government that was responsible for the military backwardness of Romania, and hence the loss of Bessarabia.<ref name=\"ReferenceS\">Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

On 1 September 1940, Sima who had resigned from the government gave a speech calling upon Carol to abdicate, and the Iron Guard began to organize demonstrations all over Romania to press for king's abdication.<ref>Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

As the increasingly large crowds started to assemble outside of the royal palace demanding the king's abdication, Carol considered Pop's advice, but was reluctant to have Antonescu as Prime Minister.<ref name=\"ReferenceT\">Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

To apply further pressure on Carol, Pop met with Fabricius on the night of 4 September 1940 to ask him to tell Carol that the ''Reich'' wanted Antonescu as Prime Minister, which led to Fabricius promptly calling Carol to tell him to appoint the general as the prime minister.<ref name=\"ReferenceT\"/> Additionally, the very ambitious General Antonescu who long coveted the Premiership now suddenly started to downplay his long-standing antipathy to Carol, and he suggested that he was prepared to forgive past slights and disputes.\n\nOn 5 September 1940, Antonescu became Prime Minister, and Carol transferred most of his dictatorial powers to him.<ref name=r1>{{in lang|ro}} Delia Radu,[http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2008/08/080801_serial_antonescu_episod1.shtml \"Serialul 'Ion Antonescu \u0219i asumarea istoriei' (1)\"], [[BBC]] Romanian edition, 1 August 2008</ref><ref>''Final Report'', p.320; Morgan, p.85; Ornea, p.326</ref> As Prime Minister, Antonescu was a man acceptable to both the Iron Guard and the traditional elite.<ref name=\"ReferenceU\">Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

As an Army officer, Antonescu was a loner, an arrogant and aloft man with an extremely bad temper who as a consequence was very unpopular with his fellow officers. Antonescu's relations with the politicians were no better, and as such Antonescu was initially unwilling to move against the king until he had some political allies. Carol ordered Antonescu and General [[Dumitru Coroam\u0103]] who commanded the troops in Bucharest to shoot down demonstrators in front of the royal palace, an order that both refused to obey.<ref>Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

October 1999 page 714.</ref> With public opinion solidly against him and with the Army refusing to obey his orders, Carol was forced to abdicate.\n\nConcerning the claim of the American historian Larry Watts that it was Carol that allied Romania to Nazi Germany and that Marshal Ion Antonescu had unwillingly inherited an alliance with Germany in 1940, the Canadian historian Dov Lungu wrote:<blockquote>\"The author's [Watts] claim that Romania's ''de facto'' alliance with Germany under Antonescu was the work of Carol, who began laying its foundations for it as early as 1938, is wide off the mark. Carol's concessions to Germany were made half-heartedly and delayed as much as possible in the hope that the western powers would regain the initiative on the political-diplomatic front and, from September 1939, the military one. He finally did change his country's external economic and political orientation, but only in the spring of 1940, when German hegemony on the Continent seemed imminent. In addition, there is more than a subtle distinction between Carol's request in the last weeks of his rule for the dispatch of a German military mission to train the ill-prepared Romanian Army and Antonescu's decision almost immediately after assuming power to fight on Germany's side until the very end. In fact, in his desire to regain the province of Bessarabia, Antonescu was keener than the Germans' in Romania's participation in an anti-Soviet war\".<ref>Lungu, Dov Review of ''Romanian Cassandra: Ion Antonescu and the Struggle for Reform, 1916-1941'' pages 378-380 from ''The International History Review'', Volume 16, Issue # 2 May 1994 pages 379-380.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Exile==\nForced under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and subsequently [[Hungary|Hungarian]], [[Bulgaria]]n, and [[Germany|German]] pressure to surrender parts of his kingdom to foreign rule, he was finally outmaneuvered by the pro-German administration of Marshal Ion Antonescu, and abdicated in favour of Michael in September 1940. He went into exile, initially in [[Mexico]],<ref>http://www.tkinter.smig.net/Romania/References/CarolHitlerLupescu/index.htm</ref> but ultimately settled in [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]]. Carol and Lupescu settled in [[Mexico City]], where he purchased a house in one of Mexico City's more expensive districts. During World War II, Carol tried to set up a Free Romania movement based in Mexico to overthrow General Antonescu. Carol had hopes that his Free Romania movement would be recognized as a government-in-exile, and would ultimately lead to him being restored. The closest Carol ever got to having his Free Romania movement recognized came in 1942 when President [[Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho]] allowed Carol to stand besides him while reviewing his troops.

As such, the majority of Romanian-Americans in the 1940s were either people who immigrated prior to 1924 or their children; in either case, Carol did not mean much to them. Furthermore, many Romanian-Americans were Jews who neither forgiven nor forgotten that it was Carol who had appointed the anti-Semitic fanatic Goga as Prime Minister in 1937.<ref name=\"Petraru pages 121-197\"/> To improve his image amongst Jews, Carol persuaded Leon Fischer, the former vice-president of the United Romanian Jews of America to write articles on his behalf in American Jewish magazines that portrayed the former king as the friend and protector of the Jews and an enemy of anti-Semitism.<ref name=\"Petraru pages 121-197\"/> The reaction to Fischer's articles was overwhelmingly negative with a flood of letters to the editor who complained bitterly that it was Carol who signed in all of Goga's laws that took away Romanian citizenship from Jews and made it illegal for Romanian Jews to own land and shares in public companies and work as lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc.<ref name=\"Petraru pages 121-197\"/> Furthermore, the writers of the letters noted that Carol allowed these laws to remain on the statute books after dismissing Goga and sarcastically commented that if Carol was the best friend of the Jews in Romania, then Romanian Jews certainly did not need enemies.<ref name=\"Petraru pages 121-197\"/>\n\nCarol's offers to have his Free Romania committee recognized as a government-in-exile was hindered by his unpopularity in his own homeland with many British and American diplomats arguing that supporting the former king was likely to increase public support for General Antonescu. Beyond that, there was a rival Free Romania committee headed by [[Viorel Tilea]] based in London that wanted to have nothing to do with Carol's committee in Mexico City.<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">Petraru, Marius \"The History of the Romanian National Committee\" pages 121-197 from ''The Inauguration of \u201cOrganized Political Warfare\u201d: The Cold War Organizations Sponsored by the National Committee for a Free Europe'' edited by Katalin Kadar Lynn, Budapest: Helena History Press, 2013 pages 128.</ref> Virgil Tilea had as a university student in the 1930s supported the Iron Guard. Unusually for a Romanian in this period, Tilea was an Anglophile rather a Francophile, and had attended Cambridge as an exchange student. Tilea's time in Britain changed his political views as he later stated that seeing many different types of people living in harmony in Britain made him realize that it was not necessary for one ethnic group to dominate all the others as Codreanu had proclaimed, leading him to break with Iron Guard. When General Antonescu was sworn in as Prime Minister as the new \"National Legionary State\", Tilea resigned as Romanian minister in London in protest at the appointment.<ref name=\"ReferenceV\"/> Later in 1940, Tilea formed his Free Romania committee in London that attracted support from a number of Romanians who fled the Antonescu regime into exile.<ref name=\"ReferenceW\">Petraru, Marius \"The History of the Romanian National Committee\" pages 121-197 from ''The Inauguration of \u201cOrganized Political Warfare\u201d: The Cold War Organizations Sponsored by the National Committee for a Free Europe'' edited by Katalin Kadar Lynn, Budapest: Helena History Press, 2013 page 128.</ref>\n\nTilea's Free Committee was not officially recognized by the British government, but was known to have the support of Britain and to be very close to the Polish government-in-exile, which was a major reason why the British spurned the Carol's rival Free Romania committee based in Mexico City, which tended to attract support only from those Romanians who been closely associated with the king's ''camarilla''.<ref>Petraru, Marius \"The History of the Romanian National Committee\" pages 121-197 from ''The Inauguration of \u201cOrganized Political Warfare\u201d: The Cold War Organizations Sponsored by the National Committee for a Free Europe'' edited by Katalin Kadar Lynn, Budapest: Helena History Press, 2013 pages 128-129.</ref> Tilea's committee had an office in Istanbul which regularly sent couriers to a safe house in Bucharest, where messages were exchanged with one of Carol's former prime ministers [[Constantin Argetoianu]] who in turn acted as an emissary for those opposed to Antonescu.<ref name=\"ReferenceW\"/> Argetoianu reported that King Michael was opposed to the Antonescu regime and wanted to stage a coup d'\u00e9tat to depose Antonescu, waiting only for the Allies to invade the Balkans.<ref name=\"ReferenceW\"/> General Antonescu was the dictator, but Romanian army officers took their oath of loyalty to the king, so there was reason to believe in London that the Romanian Army would side with the king against the prime minister if the two came into conflict. From the British viewpoint, associating themselves with Carol's campaign to once again depose his own son would only complicate their dealings with King Michael.\n \nCarol and Magda Lupescu were married in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], on 3&nbsp;June 1947, Magda calling herself Princess Elena von Hohenzollern. In 1947 after the Communist take-over of Romania, a Romanian National Committee was set up to oppose the Communist regime. Carol's efforts to join the Romanian National Committee were rebuffed as all the factions were opposed to him, and Romanian monarchists on the committee made it clear that they regarded King Michael, not his father as the legitimate king of Romania.<ref name=\"Petraru pages 121-197\"/> Carol remained in exile for the rest of his life. He was never to see his son, King Michael, after his 1940 departure from Romania. Michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his funeral.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?data=2006-01-14&id=191689 |title=''Monique Urdareanu on Elena Lupescu and Carol II'' |accessdate=2 August 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613215715/http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?data=2006-01-14&id=191689 |archivedate=13 June 2008 }}, [[Ziua]], 14 January 2006</ref><!-- Pertinent quote: \"Voia mult sa-si vada fiul, dar dupa plecarea din Romania nu l-a mai intalnit niciodata.

He was the first of the [[Hohenzollern]] kings of Romania to be born in the country; both of his predecessors had been born in Germany and only came to Romania as adults. As such, he was the first member of the Romanian branch of the Hohenzollerns who spoke Romanian as his first language, and was also the first member of the royal family to be raised in the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] faith.<ref>[http://www.cs.kent.edu/~amarcus/Mihai/english/carol2en.html King Carol II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006022008/http://www.cs.kent.edu/~amarcus/Mihai/english/carol2en.html |date=6 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHe possessed a hedonistic personality that contributed to the controversies marring his reign, and his life was marked by numerous scandals, among them marriages to [[Zizi Lambrino]] and [[Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark]], daughter of King [[Constantine I of Greece]]. His continued affairs with [[Magda Lupescu]] obliged him to renounce his succession rights in 1925 and leave the country. Princess Helen eventually divorced him in 1928.\n\nKing Ferdinand died in 1927 and Carol's five-year-old son ascended the throne as [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]]. Carol then returned to Romania in 1930 and replaced his son and the regency that had been in place. His reign was marked by re-alignment with [[Nazi Germany]], adoption of [[Anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] laws and ultimately evolved into a personal dictatorship beginning in 1938. On 6 September 1940, he was forced by his Prime Minister [[Ion Antonescu]] to leave the country and withdraw abroad into exile. He was succeeded by his son Michael.<ref>According to the 1938 Constitution \u2013 article 41, the crown prince Michael immediately had taken the Regency during the absence of his father.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Carol II of Romania in 1918.jpg|right|thumb|Crown Prince Carol of Romania in 1918.]]\nCarol was born in [[Pele\u0219 Castle]].

Ferdinand was a rather shy and weak man who was easily overshadowed by the charismatic Marie, who become the most loved member of the Romanian royal family. Growing up, Carol felt ashamed of his father, whom both his grand-uncle and mother pushed around.<ref>Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by [[Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer]], West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 92.</ref> Carol's childhood was spent being caught up in an emotional tug-of-war between Carol I and Marie, who had very different ideas about how to raise him.<ref name=\"Bucur pages 87-118\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 93.</ref> The Romanian historian Marie Bucur described the battle between Carol I and Princess Marie as one between traditional 19th century Prussian conservatism as personified by Carol I versus the 20th century liberal, modernist and sexually liberated values of the \"[[New Woman]]\" as personified by Princess Marie.<ref name=\"Bucur pages 87-118\"/> Aspects of both Marie's and Carol I's personalities were present in Carol II.<ref name=\"Bucur pages 87-118\"/> Largely because of the battle between the King and Marie, Carol ended being both spoiled and deprived of love.<ref name=\"Bucur pages 87-118\"/> \n[[File:King Carol I of Romania with his nephew and great nephew.jpg|left|thumb|King Carol I of Romania with his nephew the future King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]] and grand-nephew Prince Carol.]]\n\n==Early marriages and love affairs==\nDuring his teenage years, Carol acquired the \"playboy\" image that was to become his defining persona for the rest of his life. Carol I expressed some concern at the direction that Prince Carol was taking, as the young Prince's only serious interest was stamp collecting and he spent an inordinate amount of time drinking, partying, chasing after women; young Carol fathered at least two illegitimate children by the teenage schoolgirl Maria Martini by the time that he was 19. Carol rapidly become a favorite of gossip columnists around the world owing to the frequent photographs that appeared in the newspapers showing him at various parties with him holding a drink in one hand and a woman in the other.<ref>Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 95.</ref>\n\nIn order to teach the Prince the value of the [[Prussian virtues]], the King had the Prince commissioned as an officer into a Prussian guards regiment in 1913.<ref name=\"Sankey pages 63-64\"/> His time with the 1st Prussian Guards regiment did not achieve the desired results, and Carol remained the \"playboy prince\". Romania in the early 20th century was an intensely [[Francophile]] nation, indeed perhaps the most Francophile nation in the entire world as the Romanian elite obsessively went about embracing all things French as the model for perfection in everything. To certain extent, Carol was influenced by the prevailing Francophilia, but at the same time he inherited from Carol I, in the words of the American historian Margaret Sankey, a \"profound love of German militarism\" and the idea that all democratic governments were weak governments.<ref name=\"Sankey pages 63-64\"/>\n[[File:Caroltraining.jpg|thumb|left|Crown Prince Carol training during World War I with a [[Chauchat|Chauchat machine gun]]]]\nIn November 1914, Carol joined the [[Senate of Romania|Romanian Senate]], as the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 Constitution]] guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching maturity.<ref>[http://ziua.net/display.php?data=2007-11-29&id=230045 \"Ce citeau rom\u00e2nii acum 68 de ani?\"], ''Ziua'', 29 November 2007.</ref> Known more for his romantic misadventures than for any leadership skills, Carol ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] for \"Charles\") was first married in the Cathedral Church of [[Odessa, Ukraine]], 31 August 1918 (under the [[Operation Faustschlag|occupation of the Central Powers]] at that time), to [[Zizi Lambrino|Joanna Marie Valentina Lambrino]] (1898\u20131953), known as \"Zizi\", the daughter of a Romanian general, Constantin Lambrino. The fact that Carol technically had deserted as he left his post at the Army without permission to marry Zizi Lambrino caused immense controversy at the time.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 94.</ref> The marriage was annulled on 29 March 1919 by the Ilfov County Court. Carol and Zizi continued to live together after the annulment. Their only child, [[Carol Lambrino|Mircea Gregor Carol Lambrino]], was born 8 January 1920.\n\nCarol next married [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark]], who was known in [[Romania]] as Crown Princess Elena, on 10 March 1921 in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. They were second cousins, both of them great-grandchildren of [[Queen Victoria]], as well as third cousins in descent from [[Nicholas I of Russia]]. Helen had known Carol's dissolute behaviour and previous marriage, but was undeterred, being in love with Carol. The intention behind this arranged marriage was to help organise a dynastic alliance between Greece and Romania. Bulgaria had territorial disputes with Greece, Romania and Yugoslavia and all three of the latter states tended to be close during the interwar period owing to their shared fears of the Bulgarians. Helen and Carol's only child, [[Michael I of Romania|Michael]], was born seven months after their marriage, sparking rumours that Michael was conceived out of wedlock. Apparently close at first, Carol and Helen drifted apart. Carol's marriage with Princess Helen was an unhappy one, and he frequently engaged in extramarital affairs.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> The elegant wallflower Helen found the bohemian Carol, with his love of heavy drinking and constant partying, rather too wild for her tastes.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Carol disliked royal and aristocratic women, whom he found too stiff and formal for his tastes, and had an extremely marked preference for commoners, much to the chagrin of his parents.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Carol found low-born women to have the qualities that he sought in a woman, such as informality, spontaneity, humor and passion.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\n==Controversies surrounding Magda Lupescu==\nThe marriage soon collapsed in the wake of Carol's affair with [[Magda Lupescu|Elena \"Magda\" Lupescu]] (1895?\u20131977), the Roman Catholic daughter of a Jewish pharmacist and his Roman Catholic wife. Magda Lupescu had formerly been the wife of Army officer Ion T\u00e2mpeanu. The [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], which dominated Romania's politics, made much of Carol's relationship with Lupescu to argue that he was unqualified to be king. One of the leading figures of the National Liberals was Prince [[Barbu \u0218tirbey]]\u2014who was also Queen Marie's lover\u2014and Carol had a strong dislike of \u0218tirbey, who had humiliated his father via his indiscreetly disguised relationship with Marie, and hence of the National Liberals.<ref>Herman, Eleanor ''Sex with the Queen'', New York: HarperCollins, 2009 page 266.</ref> Knowing that Carol was ill-disposed towards them, the National Liberals waged a sustained campaign to keep him from the throne.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from ''Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe'' edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 pages 96-97.</ref> The campaign waged by the National Liberals had less to do with disgust with Carol's relationship with Madame Lupescu than with an effort to remove a potential \"loose cannon\", as Carol made it clear when he succeeded to the throne that he would not be content to let the National Liberals dominate politics in the way that the previous Hohenzollern kings had.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/>\n\nAs a result of the scandal, Carol renounced his right to the throne on 28 December 1925 in favour of his son by Crown Princess Helen, [[Michael of Romania|Michael]] (Mihai), who became king in July 1927. Helen divorced Carol in 1928.

For the next decade he sought to influence the course of Romanian political life, first through manipulation of the rival Peasant and Liberal parties and anti-Semitic factions, and subsequently (January 1938) through a ministry of his own choosing. Carol also sought to build up his own [[Carol II of Romania's cult of personality|personality cult]] against the growing influence of the [[Iron Guard]], for instance by setting up a [[paramilitary]] [[youth organization]] known as ''[[Straja \u021a\u0103rii]]'' in 1935.

Yet his style was not outlandish or grotesque like Nicole Ceau\u0219escu's unique brand of kitsch. He liked things large but relatively simple-his royal palace testifies to that trait. Carol\u2019s true passions were Lupescu, hunting and cars and he spared no expense on them.<br /><br />Carol liked to present an impressive and populist persona to the public, wearing garish military uniforms adorned with medals, and to be the benefactor of every philanthropic endeavor in the land. He loved parades and grandiose festivals and watched them closely, but he was not taken in by these events as more than shows of his power; he did not take them as a show of sincere popularity as Ceau\u0219escu did during his later years.<ref>Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 91</ref></blockquote> Carol had a populist style, depicting himself as the defender of the common man against the corrupt Francophile elites (especially the National Liberals) mixed in with generous elements of nationalism and Eastern Orthodoxy.<ref name=\"ReferenceG\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 pages 100-101</ref> Carol's tendency to throw together populism, authoritarianism, a vaguely xenophobic nationalism and Orthodoxy superficially resembled the style of the Iron Guard, albeit Carol's message was far less passionate than that of [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], \"the Captain\" who preached a message of ferociously xenophobic ultra-nationalism, intense Orthodox mysticism, extremely violent anti-Semitism, a populist disdain for all the elites and a glorification of death in the service of the cause as the most beautiful, glorious, noble and erotic experience in the entire world.<ref name=\"ReferenceG\"/> Codreanu, a man with death fetish had made the Iron Guard into a macabre death cult and often sent his followers out on what were clearly suicidal missions. After committing murders, Iron Guardsmen rarely attempted to flee and instead waited to be arrested as they wanted to be executed for their crimes. Many found the way that Legionaries went to their executions positively giddy and joyful about the prospect of their own deaths, happily proclaiming their deaths were the happiest moment of their life a deeply eerie experience. Carol regarded Codreanu's death fetish together with his claim that the Archangel Michael had told him that God had chosen him to save Romania as evidence that Codreanu was \"crazy\".\n\nCarol had sworn in his coronation oath to uphold the constitution of 1923, a promise he had no intention of keeping and right from the start of his reign, the king meddled in politics to increase his own power.<ref name=\"Payne, Stanley page 278\"/> Carol was an opportunist with no real principles or values other than the belief he was the right man to rule Romania and that what his kingdom needed was a modernizing dictatorship.<ref>Quinlan, Paul ''The Playboy King'', Westpoint: Greenwood Press, 1995 page 116.</ref> Carol ruled via an informal body known as the ''camarilla'' comprising courtiers together with senior diplomats, army officers, politicians and industrialists who were all in some way dependent upon royal favor to advance their careers.<ref name=\"Haynes pages 105-134\">Haynes, Rebecca \"Reluctant Allies?

When Carol broke his own word and continued to live with Madame Lupescu, Maniu resigned in protest in October 1930, and was to emerge as one of Carol's leading enemies.<ref name=\"Haynes pages 105-134\"/> At the same time, Carol' return had prompted a break in the National Liberals with [[Gheorghe I.

Lupescu was Roman Catholic, but because her father was a Jew, she was widely viewed as Jewish.

Further adding to Lupescu's immense unpopularity was she was a businesswoman who used her connections to the Crown to engage in dubious transactions that usually involved large sums of public money going into her pocket.<ref name=\"Haynes pages 105-134\"/> However the contemporary viewpoint that Carol was a mere puppet of Lupescu is incorrect and Lupescu's influence on political decision-making was much exaggerated at the time.<ref name=\"ReferenceH\"/> Lupescu was primarily interested in enriching herself to support her extravagant lifestyle, and had no real interest in politics beyond protecting her ability to engage in corruption.<ref name=\"ReferenceH\"/> Unlike Carol, Lupescu had utterly no interest in social policy or foreign affairs and was such a self-absorbed narcissist that she was unaware of just how unpopular she was with ordinary people.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 95.</ref> Carol by contrast was interested in the affairs of the state, and through he never sought to deny his relationship with Lupescu, he was careful not to display her too much in public as he knew that this would bring him unpopularity.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\"/>\n\nCarol sought to play the National Liberals, the National Peasant Party and the Iron Guard off against each other with the ultimate aim of making himself master of Romanian politics and disposing of all the parties in Romania.<ref name=\"Payne, Stanley page 278\"/> With regards to the Legion of the Archangel Michael, Carol had no intention of ever letting the Iron Guard come to power, but insofar as the Legion was a disruptive force that weakened both the National Liberals and the National Peasants, Carol welcomed the rise of the Iron Guard in the early 1930s and he sought to use the Legion for his own ends.<ref name=\"Payne, Stanley page 278\"/> On 30 December 1933, the Iron Guard assassinated the National Liberal Prime Minister [[Ion G. Duca]], which led to the first of several bans placed on the Legion.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The assassination of Duca, which was Romania's first political murder since 1862 shocked Carol, who saw the willingness of Codreanu to order the assassination of the Prime Minister as a sign that the egomaniacal Codreanu was getting out of control and that Codreanu would not play the role assigned by the king as a disruptive force threatening the National Liberals and National Peasant alike.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In 1934, when Codreanu was brought to trial for ordering Duca's assassination, he used as his defense that the entire Francophile elite were completely corrupt and not properly Romanian, and as such Duca as just another corrupt National Liberal politician deserved to die. The jury acquitted Codreanu, an act that worried Carol as it showed that Codreanu's revolutionary message that the entire elite needed to be destroyed was winning popular approval. In the spring of 1934 after Codreanu was acquitted, Carol together with the Bucharest police prefect Gavril\u0103 Marinescu and Madame Lupescu were involved in a half-hearted plot to kill Codreanu by poisoning his coffee, an effort that was abandoned before being attempted.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\">Haynes, Rebecca \"Reluctant Allies?

The alliance with France together with an alliance with Poland signed in 1921 and the Little Entente which united Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were the cornerstones of Romanian foreign policy. Starting in 1919, the French had sought to create the ''[[Cordon sanitaire]]'' that would keep both Germany and the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe. Carol did not seek to replace the foreign policy he had inherited in 1930 at first as he regarded the continuation of the ''cordon sanitaire'' as the best guarantee of Romania's independence and territorial integrity, and as such, his foreign policy was essentially pro-French. At the time that Romania signed the alliance with France, the Rhineland region of Germany was demilitarised and the thinking in Bucharest had always been that if Germany should commit any act of aggression anywhere in Eastern Europe, the French would begin an offensive into the ''Reich''. Starting in 1930 when the French began to build the [[Maginot Line]] along their border with Germany, some doubts started to be expressed in Bucharest about whatever the French might actually come to Romania's aid in the event of German aggression. In 1933, Carol had [[Nicolae Titulescu]]-an outspoken champion of collective security under the banner of League of Nations-appointed foreign minister with instructions to use principles of collective security as the building blocks for creating some sort of security structure intended to keep both Germany and the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany'', New York: Enigma Books, 2013 page 251.</ref> Carol and Titulescu personally disliked one another, but Carol wanted Titulescu as a foreign minister as he believed he was the best man for strengthening ties with France and for bringing Great Britain into the affairs of Eastern Europe under the guise of the collective security commitments contained the League Covenant.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\">Bucur, Marie \"Carol II\" pages 87-118 from Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe edited by Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2007 page 110.</ref>\n\nThe process of ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (coordination) in National Socialist Germany did not extend only to the ''Reich'', but was rather thought of by the National Socialist leadership as a worldwide process in which the NSDAP would take control over all of the ethnic German communities around the entire world. The Foreign Policy Department of the NSDAP headed by [[Alfred Rosenberg]] starting in 1934 had attempted to take over the ''volksdeutsch'' (ethnic German) community in Romania, a policy that greatly offended Carol who regarded this as outrageous German interference in Romania's internal affairs.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 234\">Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II 1937-1939'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 234.</ref> As Romania had half-million ''volksdeutsch'' citizens in the 1930s, the Nazi campaign to take over the German community in Romania was a real concern for Carol, who feared that the German minority might become a fifth column.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 234\"/> In addition, Rosenberg's agents had established contracts with the Romanian extreme right, most notably with the National Christian Party headed by [[Octavian Goga]] and less substantial links with the Iron Guard headed by [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], which further annoyed Carol.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 234\"/> The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote about Carol's foreign policy views that: \"He admired and feared Germany, but feared and disliked the Soviet Union\".<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 236\">Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II 1937-1939'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 236.</ref> The fact that the first leader to visit Nazi Germany (albeit not in an official capacity) was the Hungarian Prime Minister [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]]-who during his visit to Berlin in October 1933 signed an economic treaty that placed Hungary within the German economic sphere of influence-was a source of much alarm to Carol.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\">Leitz, Christian \"Arms as Levers: \"Mat\u00e9riel\" and Raw Materials in Germany's Trade with Romania in the 1930s\" pages 312-332 from ''The International History Review'', Volume 19, Issue # 2, May 1997 page 315</ref> For the entire interwar period, Budapest refused to recognize the frontiers imposed by the Treaty of Trianon and laid claim to [[Transylvania]] region of Romania. Carol like the rest of the Romanian elite was worried by the prospect of an alliance of the revisionist states that rejected the legitimacy of the international order created by the Allies in 1918-20 as indicating that Germany would support Hungary's claims to Transylvania.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> Hungary had territorial disputes with Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, all of which happened to be allies of France. Accordingly, Franco-Hungarian relations were extremely bad during the interwar period, and so it seemed natural that Hungary would ally itself with France's archenemy Germany.\n\nIn 1934, Titulescu played a leading role in creating the [[Balkan Entente]] which brought together Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey in an alliance intended to counter Bulgarian revanchism.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/> The Balkan Entente was intended to be the beginning of an alliance that would bring together all of the anti-revisionist states of Eastern Europe. Like France, Romania was allied to both Czechoslovakia and Poland, but because of the [[Cieszyn|Teschen]] dispute in Silesia, Warsaw and Prague were bitter enemies. Like the diplomats of the Qua d'Orsay, Carol was exasperated by the bitter Polish-Czechoslovak dispute, arguing that it was absurd for anti-revisionist Eastern European states to be feuding with one another in the face of the rise of German and Soviet power.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/> Several times, Carol attempted to mediate the Teschen dispute and thus end the Polish-Czechoslovak feud without much success.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/> Reflecting his initially pro-French orientation, in June 1934 when the French foreign minister [[Louis Barthou]] visited Bucharest to meet with the foreign ministers of the Little Entente of Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, Carol organized lavish celebrations to welcome Barthou that were made to symbolized the enduring Franco-Romanian friendship between the two \"Latin sisters\".<ref name=\"ReferenceL\">Leitz, Christian \"Arms as Levers: \"Mat\u00e9riel\" and Raw Materials in Germany's Trade with Romania in the 1930s\" pages 312-332 from ''The International History Review'', Volume 19, Issue # 2, May 1997 pages 314-315</ref> The German minister to Romania, Count [[Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg]] complained with a disgust in a report to Berlin that everyone in the Romanian elite was an incurable Francophile who told him that Romania would never betray its \"Latin sister\" France.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Carol also considered the possibility that if Romanian-German relations were improved, then perhaps Berlin could be persuaded not to support Budapest in its campaign to regain Transylvania.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> Further pressing Carol towards Germany was the desperate state of the Romanian economy. Even before the Great Depression, Romania had been an extremely poor country and the Depression had hit Romania hard with Romanians been unable to export much owing to the global trade war set off by the American Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which in turn led to a decline in the value of the ''lei'' as Romanian's reserves of foreign exchange were being used up.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> In June 1934, the Romanian finance minister Victor Sl\u0103vescu visited Paris to ask the French to inject millions of francs into Romanian treasury and to lower their tariffs on Romanian goods.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> When the French refused both requests, an annoyed Carol wrote in his diary that the \"Latin sister\" France was behaving in a less than sisterly way towards Romania.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> In April 1936 when Wilhelm Fabricius was appointed German minister in Bucharest, the Foreign Minister Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]] in his instructions to the new minister described Romania as an unfriendly, pro-French state, but suggested that the prospect of more trade with the ''Reich'' might bring the Romanians out of the French orbit.<ref name=\"Leitz pages 312-332\"/> Neurath further instructed Fabricius that while Romania was a not a major power in a military sense, it was a state of crucial importance to Germany because of its oil.\n\nCarol often encouraged splits in the political parties to encourage his own ends. In 1935, [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]], the leader of the Transylvanian branch of the National Peasants broke away to form the [[Romanian Front]] with Carol's encouragement.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Haynes, Rebecca \"Reluctant Allies?

A British Foreign Office memo from March 1936 stated that only nations in the world that would apply sanctions on Germany for remilitarizing the Rhineland if the League of Nations should vote for such a step were Britain, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and Romania.<ref>Emmerson, J.T ''The Rhineland Crisis 7 March 1936 A Study in Multilateral Diplomacy'', Ames: Iowa State University Press, 1977 page 171</ref> In the aftermath of the remilitarization of the Rhineland and once it was clear that no sanctions were going to be applied against Germany, Carol started to voice his fears that the days of French influence in Eastern Europe were numbered and Romania might have to seek some understanding with Germany to preserve its independence.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Diplomatic Revolution in Europe 1933\u201336'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970 page 261.</ref> With continuing the alliance with France, after March 1936 Carol also began a policy of attempting to improve relations with Germany.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany'', New York: Enigma Books, 2013 page 253.</ref>\n\nOn the domestic front, in the summer of 1936 Codreanu and Maniu formed an alliance to oppose the growing power of the Crown and the National Liberal government.<ref>Haynes, Rebecca \"Reluctant Allies?

G\u00f6ring, the newly appointed chief of the [[Four Year Plan]] organization designed to have Germany ready to wage a total war by 1940 was especially interested in Romania's oil, and talked much to Br\u0103tianu about a new era of German-Romanian economic relations.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard pages 252-253\"/> Germany had no almost oil of its own, and throughout the Third Reich control of Romania's oil was a key foreign policy goal.

Carol's reasons for appointing Goga Prime Minister were partly because he hoped that anti-Semitic policies Goga would bring in would win him support from the All for Fatherland! voters, and thus weaken the Legion and partly because he hoped that Goga would prove so incompetent as Prime Minister as to provoke such a crisis that would allow him to seize power for himself.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Haynes, Rebecca \"Reluctant Allies?

Carol was personally not an anti-Semite, but in the words of his biographer Paul D. Quinlan the king was \"simply indifferent\" to the sufferings of his Jewish subjects caused by Goga's oppressive anti-Semitic laws.<ref name=\"Quinlan, Paul page 182\">Quinlan, Paul ''The Playboy King'', Westpoint: Greenwood Press, 1995 page 182.</ref> The opportunistic Carol did not believe in antisemitism anymore than he believed in anything else other than power, but if ''raison d'Etat'' meant tolerating an anti-Semitic government as the price of power, Carol was quite prepared to sacrifice the rights of his Jewish subjects.<ref name=\"Quinlan, Paul page 182\"/> At the same time, Goga proved himself a better poet than politician, and there was a crisis atmosphere in early 1938 as the Goga government, which obsessed with solving the \"Jewish Question\" to the exclusion of everything else was clearly floundering. Weinberg wrote about Goga that he was \"Unprepared for office and untouched by any leadership ability...\" and whose clownish antics left diplomats stationed in Bucharest \"half-amused, half-appalled\".<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 236\"/> As Carol had expected, Goga proved to be such an inept leader as to discredit democracy while his anti-Semitic policies ensured that the none of the democratic great powers would object to Carol proclaiming a dictatorship.<ref name=\"ReferenceN\"/>\n\n==The Royal Dictatorship==\n[[File:Regele Carol II si constitutia din 1938.jpg|thumb|Carol signing the 1938 constitution]]\nComing to realize belatedly that he was being used by Carol, Goga had a meeting with Codreanu on 8 February 1938 at the house of [[Ion Gigurtu]] to arrange for a deal under which the Iron Guard would withdraw its candidates from the election in order to ensure that the radical anti-Semitic right would have a majority.<ref>Haynes, Rebecca \"Reluctant Allies?

On 11 February 1938, Carol drafted [[1938 Constitution of Romania|a new constitution]]. Although it was superficially similar to its 1923 predecessor, it was actually a severely authoritarian and corporatist document. The new constitution effectively codified the emergency powers Carol had seized in February, turning his government into a de facto legal dictatorship. It concentrated virtually all governing power in his hands, almost to the point of [[absolute monarchy]]. The new constitution was approved in [[1938 Romanian constitutional referendum|a plebiscite]] held under far-from-secret conditions; voters were required to appear before an election bureau and verbally state whether they approved the constitution; silence was deemed as a \"yes\" vote. Under these conditions, an implausible 99.87 percent were reported as having approved the new charter.<ref name=DD>[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=ro011938 Rum\u00e4nien, 24.

It was not until the summer of 1942 that Germany's first synthetic oil plants finally start operating. It was making painfully obvious to G\u00f6ring in the first months of 1939 that the German economy would not be ready to support a total war by 1940 as the Four Year Plan of 1936 had envisioned while at the same time his economic experts were telling him the ''Reich'' needed to import 400, 000 tons of oil per month while Germany had in fact imported only 61, 000 tons of oil per month in the last four months of 1938.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 175\"/>\n\nHence Wohlthat demanded during his talks with the Romanian Foreign Minister [[Grigore Gafencu]] that Romania nationalize their entire oil industry which was henceforward to controlled by a new corporation owned jointly by the German and Romanian governments while demanding Romania \"respect German export interests\" by only selling their oil to Germany.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 175\"/> In addition, Wohlthat demanded a host of other measures that to all practical purposes would have converted Romania into a German economic colony.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 175\"/> As Carol had no intention of giving in to these demands, the talks in Bucharest went very badly. It was at this point that Carol began what become known as the \"Tilea affair\" when on 17 March 1939 Virgil Tilea, the Romanian minister in London burst unexpectedly into the office of the British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in an agitated state to announce that his country was faced with an imminent German invasion, and asked Halifax for British support.<ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 169-170.</ref> At same time, Carol mobilized five infantry corps on the Hungarian border to guard the supposed invasion.<ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 175-176.</ref> The British \"economic offensive\" in the Balkans was causing Germany very real economic pain as the British bought up Romanian oil that the Germans badly needed, hence their demands for control of the Romanian oil industry that so offended Carol.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 175\"/> As the British believed in Tilea's claims, the \"Tilea affair\" had an immense impact of British foreign policy and led to the [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] government doing a ''volta-face'' from appeasement of Germany to a policy of \"containing\" the ''Reich''.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II 1937-1939'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 pages 540-544.</ref><ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 176-178.</ref> Carol denied, unconvincingly of knowing anything about Tilea was up to in London, but the British warnings to Germany against invading Romania in March 1939 led to the Germans to relax their demands and the latest German-Romanian economic treaty signed on 23 March 1939 was in the words of Watt 'very vague\".<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 176\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 176.</ref> Despite the \"Tilea affair\", Carol had decided that he would refuse to become involved in any diplomacy that would force him to decisively choose between Germany and Britain, and he would never accept any support from the Soviet Union to deter Germany.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 176\"/>\n\nAs part of their new policy of seeking to \"contain\" Germany starting in March 1939, the British sought the construction of the \"peace front\" that was to comprise at a minimum Britain, France, Poland, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Romania, Greece and Yugoslavia. For his part, Carol was obsessed with fears in the first half of 1939 that Hungary with German support would soon attack his kingdom.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron pages 210-211\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 210-211.</ref> On 6 April 1939, a cabinet meeting decided that Romania would not join the \"peace front\", but would seek Anglo-French support for its independence.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron pages 210-211\"/> The same meeting decided that Romania would work to strengthen ties with other Balkan nations, but would seek to prevent the Anglo-French efforts to link the security of the Balkans to the security of Poland.<ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 211.</ref> On 13 April 1939 the British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] speaking in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and the French Premier [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] speaking in the Chamber of Deputies announced a joint Anglo-French \"guarantee\" of the independence of Romania and Greece.<ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 214.</ref> Carol promptly accepted the \"guarantee\". On 5 May 1939, the French Marshal [[Maxime Weygand]] visited Bucharest to meet with Carol and his Prime Minister [[Armand C\u0103linescu]] to discuss Romania's possible participation in the \"peace front\".<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 289\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 289.</ref> Both Carol and C\u0103linescu were supportive, but evasive, saying that they would welcome having the Soviet Union fight against Germany, but would never allow the Red Army to enter Romania even if Germany should invade.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 289\"/> Carol told Weygand: \"I do not wish to let my country be engaged in a war which would result, in a few weeks, in the destruction of its army and the occupation of its territory...We do not wish to be the lighting conductor for the coming storm\".<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 290\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 290.</ref> Carol went on to complain that he had enough equipment for only two-thirds of his army, which also lacked tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy artillery and anti-tank guns while his air force had only about 400 antiquated aircraft of French manufacture that were no match for latest German aircraft.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 290\"/> Weygand reported to Paris that Carol wanted Anglo-French support, but would not fight for the Allies if war came.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 290\"/>\n\nOn 11 May 1939, an Anglo-Romanian agreement was signed under which Britain committed itself to grant Romania a credit of \u00a35 million pound sterling and promised to buy 200, 000 tons of Romanian wheat at above-market prices.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron p.300\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 p.300.</ref> When Yugoslavia reacted negatively to the Anglo-Turkish Declaration of 12 May 1939 promising to \"ensure the establishment of security in the Balkans\" and threatened to pull out of the Balkan Pact, Gafencu had a summit with the Yugoslav Foreign Minister Aleksandar Cincar-Markovi\u0107 at 21 May 1939 at the Iron Gates to ask the Yugoslavs to stay in the Balkan Pact.<ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 p.291.</ref> However, Cincar-Markovi\u0107's talk of leaving the Balkan Pact turned out to be a ploy by the Yugoslav Regent, Prince Paul, who was backing a plan mooted by the Turkish Foreign Minister [[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu]] to have Bulgaria join the Balkan Pact in exchange for Romania ceding part of the Dobrudja region.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron p.292\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 p.292.</ref> In a letter to Carol, Paul stated that he wanted the Bulgarians \"off my back\" as he afraid of the Italians building up their forces in their new colony of Albania, and asked his friend to make this concession for him.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron p.292\"/> Carol in response stated it was out of the question for him to cede any territory to Bulgarians, partly because he was against giving any of his realm on principle and partly because to cede the Dobrudja would only encourage the Hungarians to renew their claims on Transylvania.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron p.300\"/>\n\nDespite his formal opposition to joining the \"peace front\", Carol did decide to strengthen the [[Balkan Entente]], and especially to strengthen ties with Turkey.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron pages 300-301\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 300-301.</ref> Since Britain and France were working for an alliance with Turkey while at same time holding talks with the Soviet Union, Carol reasoned that if Romania was to be firmly allied to Turkey, that this would be a way of associating Romania with the emerging \"peace front\" without actually joining it.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron pages 300-301\"/> Despite the way in which Carol disappointed Paul, he very much wanted to strengthen Yugoslav-Romanian relations as Yugoslavia was one of Romania's few friendly neighbors.<ref

better relations with Bulgaria's archenemy, Greece.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron pages 300-301\"/>\n\nIn July 1939, the king had a major clash with Fritz Fabritius, the leader of Nazified German National Party which was the largest of the ''volksdeutsch'' parties and which joined the National Renaissance Front in January 1939.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 302\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 302.</ref> Fabritius had taken to calling himself the ''F\u00fchrer'', had formed two para-military groups, the National Workers Front and the German Youth, and was holding ceremonies in which members of Romania's 800, 000 strong German minority had to swear personal oaths of loyalty to him.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 302\"/> In early July, Fabritius had during a visit to Munich given a speech in he stated that the Romanian ''volksdeutsch'' were loyal to Germany, not Romania, and spoke of wish to see a \"Greater German ''Reich''\" which would be secured by armed peasant settlements along the Carpathians, Ural and Caucasus mountains.{{fact|date=January 2020}} In this ''Grossraum'' (an untranslatable German word meaning roughly \"greater space\"), only Germans would be allowed to live and those not willing to be Germanized would have to leave.{{fact|date=January 2020}} In response to this speech, when Fabritius returned to Romania, he was summoned to a meeting with C\u0103linescu on 13 July who told him that the king had enough and was going to take action against him.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Fabritius promised to behave, but was expelled from Romania shortly afterwards when one of his staffers accidentally left on a train a briefcase full of documents showing Fabritius's supporters were arming themselves and that ''F\u00fchrer'' Fabritius was being financed by Germany.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn July 1939, when Carol heard rumors that Hungary supported by Germany was planning on invading Romania following a new crisis in Romanian-Hungarian relations caused by complaints from Budapest that the Romanians were mistreating the Magyar minority in Transylvania (which were supported by Berlin), the king ordered general mobilization of his military while taking off in the royal yacht to [[Istanbul]].<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 304\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 304.</ref> During his unexpected trip to Istanbul, Carol held talks with the Turkish President [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] and the Turkish Foreign Minister [[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu]] during which the Turks promised him that Turkey would immediately mobilize its military in the event of an Axis attack on Romania.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 304\"/> The Turks in their turn pressed Carol to sign an alliance with the Soviet Union, something that Carol said very reluctantly he might do if the Turks were to serve as the middlemen and if the Soviets were to promise to recognize the border with Romania.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 304\"/> The show of Romanian resolve supported by Turkey had the effect of causing the Hungarians to back off on their demands against Romania.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 304\"/>\n\nThe news of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact in August 1939, was received with horror by Carol.<ref>Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 470-471.</ref> In August 1939, Carol sought to play off both sides against each other. Carol allowed C\u0103linescu to tell Thierry that the Romanians would destroy their oil fields if the Axis should invade while at the same time Gafencu told the German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] of his firm friendship with Germany, his opposition to the \"peace front\" and of his desire to sell more oil to the Germans.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 471\">Watt, Donald Cameron ''How War Came'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 471</ref> After the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, C\u0103linescu advised Carol: \"Germany is the real danger. An alliance with it is tantamount to a protectorate. Only Germany's defeat by France and Britain can ward off the danger\".<ref name=\"Ancel, Jean page 41\"/> On 27 August 1939 Gafencu told Fabricius that Romania would declare neutrality if Germany invaded Poland and that he wanted to sell to Germany some 450, 000 tons of oil per month in exchange for 1 million and half ''Reichmarks'' plus a number of modern German aircraft for free.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 471\"/> Carol met with the German air force attach\u00e9 on 28 August 1939 to congratulate the Germans on the great diplomatic success they had gained with the pact with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Watt, Donald Cameron page 471\"/> Unknown to Carol, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact had in its infamous \"secret protocols\" assigned the Romanian region of Bessarabia to the Soviet Union. In the short run, the German-Soviet pact was a blessing for Carol since Germany now had access to Soviet oil, which reduced the pressure on Romania.\n\n==World War II==\nWhen World War II began with the German aggression against Poland on 1 September 1939, followed up by British and French declarations of war on the ''Reich'' on 3 September 1939, Carol proclaimed neutrality. In doing so Carol violated the letter of the treaty of alliance with Poland signed in 1921 and the spirit of treaty of alliance signed with France in 1926. Carol justified his policy under the grounds that with Germany and the Soviet Union allied in the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 and France holding its forces behind the Maginot line, unwilling to start an offensive into Germany, that neutrality was his only hope of preserving his kingdom's independence.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 79\">Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 79.</ref> As usual with Carol, he sought to play a careful balancing act between the Allies and the Axis, on one hand signing a new economic treaty with Germany while on the other hand allowing for a considerable period of time for the Polish troops to cross into Romania while declining to intern them as international law required; instead the Poles were allowed to travel to [[Constan\u021ba]] to board ships to take them to [[Marseille]] to continue the fight against Germany from France.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 79\"/> The [[Romanian Bridgehead]] remained a key escape route for thousands of Poles in the desperate days of September 1939. It was only receiving a number of furious complaints from Fabricius about the passage of Polish soldiers across Romania that Carol finally started to intern the fleeing Poles.\n\nOn 21 September 1939, Prime Minister C\u0103linescu was assassinated by the Iron Guard in a plot organized out of Berlin, thus silencing the strongest pro-Allied voice amongst Carol's ''camarilla''.<ref>Ancel, Jean ''The History of the Holocaust in Romania'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011 page page 42.</ref> The next day, the nine assassins of C\u0103linescu were publicity shot without the benefit of a trial and on the week of 22\u201328 September 1939 242 Iron Guards were the victims of extrajudicial executions.<ref>Ancel, Jean ''The History of the Holocaust in Romania'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011 page page 43.</ref> Because of its oil, Romania was considered to be highly important by both sides, and during the [[Phoney War]] of 1939-40 there occurred what Weinberg called a \"silent struggle over Romania's oil\" with the German government doing everything within its power to have as much Romanian oil as possible while the British and French governments equally doing everything possible to deny the ''Reich'' Romanian oil.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 pages 78-79.</ref> The British in particular launched an unsuccessful campaign to sabotage Romanian oil fields and the transportation network that took Romanian oil to Germany.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 79\"/> In January 1940, Carol gave a speech on the radio in which he proclaimed that it was his brilliant handing of foreign policy that kept Romania neutral and safe from danger.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 117\">Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century and After'', London: Routledge, 1997 page 117.</ref> In the same speech, Carol announced that he was going to be building a gigantic defense line around the kingdom and as such, taxes would have to rise to pay for it.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 117\"/> Romanians called the proposed line the Imagiont Line, as the line was considered to be a purely imaginary version of the Maginot line and many of Carol's subjects suspected that the money raised by higher taxes would go to the king's Swiss bank accounts.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 117\"/>\n\nCarol had hedged his bets about whatever to choose between the Allies and the Axis. It was only in late May 1940 when France was clearly losing the war that Carol swung decisively over to the Axis side.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 pages 135-136.</ref> During the later period of the Phoney War after waging a campaign of bloody repression against the Iron Guard, which reached its peak after C\u0103linescu's assassination, Carol began a policy of reaching out to the surviving Iron Guard leaders.<ref>Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4. October 1999 pages 707-708.</ref> Carol felt that a \"tamed\" Iron Guard could be used as a source of popular support. In April 1940, Carol had reached an agreement with Vasile Noveanu, the leader of the underground Iron Guard in Romania, but it was not until early May 1940 that [[Horia Sima]], the leader of the Iron Guards in exile in Germany could be persuaded to support the government.<ref name=\"Haynes pages 700-725\">Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

Romania's elite had been so obsessively Francophile for so long that France's defeat had the effect of discrediting that elite in the eyes of public opinion and led to an upswing of popular support for the pro-German Iron Guard.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 117\"/>\n\nIn amidst of the turn towards the Iron Guard and Germany came a bombshell from abroad. On 26 June 1940, the Soviet Union submitted an ultimatum demanding that Romania hand over the [[Bessarabia]] region (which had been Russian until 1918) and the northern part of Bukovina (which had never been Russian) to the Soviet Union, and threatened war within next two days if the ultimatum was rejected.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 136\">Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 136.</ref> Carol had at one moment considered following the example of Finland in 1939 when faced with a similar Soviet ultimatum, but the outcome of the [[Winter War]] was scarcely an inspiring example.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 136\"/> Carol at first considered rejecting the ultimatum, but upon being informed that the Romanian Army would be no match for the Red Army, agreed to cede Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union. Carol appealed to Berlin for support against the Soviet ultimatum, only to be told to comply with Stalin's demands.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 136\"/> The loss of the regions without any fighting to the Soviet Union was felt to be a national humiliation by the Romanian people, and was a huge blow to Carol's prestige. [[Carol II of Romania's cult of personality|Carol's personality cult]] had by 1940 reached such extreme heights that the withdrawal without any resistance from Bessarabia and northern Bukovina revealed that Carol was a mere man after all, and so badly dented his prestige more than would have been the case if Carol had maintained a more modest image.<ref name=\"Crampton, Richard page 117\"/>\n\nOn 28 June 1940, Sima entered the cabinet as Under-secretary of State at the Ministry of Education .<ref>Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4. October 1999 page 709.</ref> On 1 July 1940, Carol in a radio speech renounced both the 1926 alliance with France and the 1939 Anglo-French \"guarantee\" of Romania, saying that henceforth Romania would seek in its place in the German-dominated \"New Order\" in Europe.<ref name=\"ReferenceQ\">Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

In particular, Carol proved unwilling to cede Transylvania and had it not been for the diplomatic intervention of Germany and Italy, Romania and Hungary would have gone to war with each other in the summer of 1940.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 184\"/> In the meantime, Carol had on 9 July 1940 imprisoned General [[Ion Antonescu]] after the latter had criticized the king, charging it was the corruption of the royal government that was responsible for the military backwardness of Romania, and hence the loss of Bessarabia.<ref name=\"ReferenceS\">Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4. October 1999 page 715.</ref> Both Fabricius and Hermann Neubacher, the man in charge of the Four Year Plan's operations in the Balkans intervened with Carol, saying that Antonescu's \"accidental death\" or being \"shot while trying to escape\" would \"make a very bad impression on the German headquarters\" as Antonescu was known to be a leading advocate of an alliance with Germany.<ref name=\"ReferenceS\"/> On 11 July 1940, Carol had Antonescu freed, but kept under house arrest at the Bis\u021bria monastery.<ref name=\"ReferenceS\"/>\n\nHitler was alarmed about the possibility of a Hungarian-Romanian war which he feared might result in the destruction of Romania's oil fields and/or might lead to the Soviets intervening to seize all of Romania.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 184\"/> At this time, Hitler was already seriously considering invading the Soviet Union in 1941, and if he were to take such a step, he would need Romanian oil to power his military.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 184\"/> At the [[Second Vienna Award]] of 30 August 1940, the German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] and the Italian Foreign Minister Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]] ruled that northern Transylvania was to go to Hungary while southern Transylvania would stay with Romania; a compromise that left both Budapest and Bucharest deeply unhappy with the Vienna award.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 185\">Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 185.</ref> For economic reasons, Romania was far more important to Hitler than was Hungary, but Romania had been allied to France since 1926 and had flirted with joining the British-inspired \"peace front\" in 1939, so Hitler-who personally disliked and mistrusted Carol-felt that Romania deserved to be punished for waiting so long to align with the Axis.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 184\"/> After the fall of Paris in June 1940, the Germans had captured the archives of the Quai d'Orsay and were thus well-informed about the double-line that Carol had pursued until the spring of 1940.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 984\">Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 984.</ref> Extracts from the captured French documents were translated into German for Hitler's reading (Hitler knew no other language other than his native German), who was not impressed with Carol's efforts to forge closer ties with France at the same time proclaiming his friendship towards Germany.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 984\"/> At the same time, Hitler offered Carol a \"guarantee\" of the rest of Romania against further territorial losses, which Carol promptly accepted.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 185\"/>\n\n==Road to Abdication==\nThe acceptance of the Second Vienna Award completely discredited Carol with his people, and in early September 1940 enormous demonstrations broke out all over Romania demanding that Carol abdicate. On 1 September 1940, Sima who had resigned from the government gave a speech calling upon Carol to abdicate, and the Iron Guard began to organize demonstrations all over Romania to press for king's abdication.<ref>Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

October 1999 page 711.</ref> Pop's reasons for advising Carol to have Antonescu as Prime Minister who was partly because Antonescu-who was known to be friendly with the Iron Guard and had been imprisoned under Carol-was believed to have enough of an oppositional background to appease the public and partly because Pop knew that Antonescu for all his Legionary sympathies was a member of the elite and would never turn against it. As the increasingly large crowds started to assemble outside of the royal palace demanding the king's abdication, Carol considered Pop's advice, but was reluctant to have Antonescu as Prime Minister.<ref name=\"ReferenceT\">Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

To apply further pressure on Carol, Pop met with Fabricius on the night of 4 September 1940 to ask him to tell Carol that the ''Reich'' wanted Antonescu as Prime Minister, which led to Fabricius promptly calling Carol to tell him to appoint the general as the prime minister.<ref name=\"ReferenceT\"/> Additionally, the very ambitious General Antonescu who long coveted the Premiership now suddenly started to downplay his long-standing antipathy to Carol, and he suggested that he was prepared to forgive past slights and disputes.\n\nOn 5 September 1940, Antonescu became Prime Minister, and Carol transferred most of his dictatorial powers to him.<ref name=r1>{{in lang|ro}} Delia Radu,[http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2008/08/080801_serial_antonescu_episod1.shtml \"Serialul 'Ion Antonescu \u0219i asumarea istoriei' (1)\"], [[BBC]] Romanian edition, 1 August 2008</ref><ref>''Final Report'', p.320; Morgan, p.85; Ornea, p.326</ref> As Prime Minister, Antonescu was a man acceptable to both the Iron Guard and the traditional elite.<ref name=\"ReferenceU\">Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4.

As an Army officer, Antonescu was a loner, an arrogant and aloft man with an extremely bad temper who as a consequence was very unpopular with his fellow officers. Antonescu's relations with the politicians were no better, and as such Antonescu was initially unwilling to move against the king until he had some political allies. Carol ordered Antonescu and General [[Dumitru Coroam\u0103]] who commanded the troops in Bucharest to shoot down demonstrators in front of the royal palace, an order that both refused to obey.<ref>Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4. October 1999 page 718.</ref> It was only on 6 September 1940, when Antonescu learned of a plot to murder him headed by another member of the ''camarilla'' General Paul Teodorescu that Antonescu joined the chorus demanding Carol's abdication.<ref>Haynes, Rebbecca \" Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 1940\" pages 700-725 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 77, Issue # 4. October 1999 page 714.</ref> With public opinion solidly against him and with the Army refusing to obey his orders, Carol was forced to abdicate.\n\nConcerning the claim of the American historian Larry Watts that it was Carol that allied Romania to Nazi Germany and that Marshal Ion Antonescu had unwillingly inherited an alliance with Germany in 1940, the Canadian historian Dov Lungu wrote:<blockquote>\"The author's [Watts] claim that Romania's ''de facto'' alliance with Germany under Antonescu was the work of Carol, who began laying its foundations for it as early as 1938, is wide off the mark. Carol's concessions to Germany were made half-heartedly and delayed as much as possible in the hope that the western powers would regain the initiative on the political-diplomatic front and, from September 1939, the military one. He finally did change his country's external economic and political orientation, but only in the spring of 1940, when German hegemony on the Continent seemed imminent. In addition, there is more than a subtle distinction between Carol's request in the last weeks of his rule for the dispatch of a German military mission to train the ill-prepared Romanian Army and Antonescu's decision almost immediately after assuming power to fight on Germany's side until the very end. In fact, in his desire to regain the province of Bessarabia, Antonescu was keener than the Germans' in Romania's participation in an anti-Soviet war\".<ref>Lungu, Dov Review of ''Romanian Cassandra: Ion Antonescu and the Struggle for Reform, 1916-1941'' pages 378-380 from ''The International History Review'', Volume 16, Issue # 2 May 1994 pages 379-380.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Exile==\nForced under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and subsequently [[Hungary|Hungarian]], [[Bulgaria]]n, and [[Germany|German]] pressure to surrender parts of his kingdom to foreign rule, he was finally outmaneuvered by the pro-German administration of Marshal Ion Antonescu, and abdicated in favour of Michael in September 1940. He went into exile, initially in [[Mexico]],<ref>http://www.tkinter.smig.net/Romania/References/CarolHitlerLupescu/index.htm</ref> but ultimately settled in [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]]. Carol and Lupescu settled in [[Mexico City]], where he purchased a house in one of Mexico City's more expensive districts. During World War II, Carol tried to set up a Free Romania movement based in Mexico to overthrow General Antonescu. Carol had hopes that his Free Romania movement would be recognized as a government-in-exile, and would ultimately lead to him being restored. The closest Carol ever got to having his Free Romania movement recognized came in 1942 when President [[Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho]] allowed Carol to stand besides him while reviewing his troops. Carol would have liked to operate out of the United States, but the American government refused him permission to enter.<ref>Petraru, Marius \"The History of the Romanian National Committee\" pages 121-197 from ''The Inauguration of \u201cOrganized Political Warfare\u201d: The Cold War Organizations Sponsored by the National Committee for a Free Europe'' edited by Katalin Kadar Lynn, Budapest: Helena History Press, 2013 pages 129.</ref> However, Carol was in contact with two Eastern Orthodox priests living in Chicago, namely Father Glicherie Moraru and Father Alexandru Opreanu who organized an unsuccessful campaign in the [[Romanian-American]] community to pressure the [[American government]] to recognize the \"Free Romania\" committee as the legitimate government of Romania.<ref>Petraru, Marius The History of the Romanian National Committee pages 121-197 from ''The Inauguration of \u201cOrganized Political Warfare\u201d: The Cold War Organizations Sponsored by the National Committee for a Free Europe'' edited by Katalin Kadar Lynn, Budapest: Helena History Press, 2013 pages 128-129.</ref>\n\nTo advance his cause, Carol published a magazine in America called ''The Free Romanian'' and published several books in both Romanian and English.<ref name=\"Petraru pages 121-197\">Petraru, Marius The History of the Romanian National Committee pages 121-197 from ''The Inauguration of \u201cOrganized Political Warfare\u201d: The Cold War Organizations Sponsored by the National Committee for a Free Europe'' edited by Katalin Kadar Lynn, Budapest: Helena History Press, 2013 page 129.</ref> A major problem for Carol's efforts to mobilize the Romanian-American community was in 1924 the U. S government brought in the Immigration Control Act, which drastically limited immigration from Eastern Europe into the United States. As such, the majority of Romanian-Americans in the 1940s were either people who immigrated prior to 1924 or their children; in either case, Carol did not mean much to them. Furthermore, many Romanian-Americans were Jews who neither forgiven nor forgotten that it was Carol who had appointed the anti-Semitic fanatic Goga as Prime Minister in 1937.<ref name=\"Petraru pages 121-197\"/> To improve his image amongst Jews, Carol persuaded Leon Fischer, the former vice-president of the United Romanian Jews of America to write articles on his behalf in American Jewish magazines that portrayed the former king as the friend and protector of the Jews and an enemy of anti-Semitism.<ref name=\"Petraru pages 121-197\"/> The reaction to Fischer's articles was overwhelmingly negative with a flood of letters to the editor who complained bitterly that it was Carol who signed in all of Goga's laws that took away Romanian citizenship from Jews and made it illegal for Romanian Jews to own land and shares in public companies and work as lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc.<ref name=\"Petraru pages 121-197\"/> Furthermore, the writers of the letters noted that Carol allowed these laws to remain on the statute books after dismissing Goga and sarcastically commented that if Carol was the best friend of the Jews in Romania, then Romanian Jews certainly did not need enemies.<ref name=\"Petraru pages 121-197\"/>\n\nCarol's offers to have his Free Romania committee recognized as a government-in-exile was hindered by his unpopularity in his own homeland with many British and American diplomats arguing that supporting the former king was likely to increase public support for General Antonescu. Beyond that, there was a rival Free Romania committee headed by [[Viorel Tilea]] based in London that wanted to have nothing to do with Carol's committee in Mexico City.<ref name=\"ReferenceV\">Petraru, Marius \"The History of the Romanian National Committee\" pages 121-197 from ''The Inauguration of \u201cOrganized Political Warfare\u201d: The Cold War Organizations Sponsored by the National Committee for a Free Europe'' edited by Katalin Kadar Lynn, Budapest: Helena History Press, 2013 pages 128.</ref> Virgil Tilea had as a university student in the 1930s supported the Iron Guard. Unusually for a Romanian in this period, Tilea was an Anglophile rather a Francophile, and had attended Cambridge as an exchange student. Tilea's time in Britain changed his political views as he later stated that seeing many different types of people living in harmony in Britain made him realize that it was not necessary for one ethnic group to dominate all the others as Codreanu had proclaimed, leading him to break with Iron Guard. When General Antonescu was sworn in as Prime Minister as the new \"National Legionary State\", Tilea resigned as Romanian minister in London in protest at the appointment.<ref name=\"ReferenceV\"/> Later in 1940, Tilea formed his Free Romania committee in London that attracted support from a number of Romanians who fled the Antonescu regime into exile.<ref name=\"ReferenceW\">Petraru, Marius \"The History of the Romanian National Committee\" pages 121-197 from ''The Inauguration of \u201cOrganized Political Warfare\u201d: The Cold War Organizations Sponsored by the National Committee for a Free Europe'' edited by Katalin Kadar Lynn, Budapest: Helena History Press, 2013 page 128.</ref>\n\nTilea's Free Committee was not officially recognized by the British government, but was known to have the support of Britain and to be very close to the Polish government-in-exile, which was a major reason why the British spurned the Carol's rival Free Romania committee based in Mexico City, which tended to attract support only from those Romanians who been closely associated with the king's ''camarilla''.<ref>Petraru, Marius \"The History of the Romanian National Committee\" pages 121-197 from ''The Inauguration of \u201cOrganized Political Warfare\u201d: The Cold War Organizations Sponsored by the National Committee for a Free Europe'' edited by Katalin Kadar Lynn, Budapest: Helena History Press, 2013 pages 128-129.</ref> Tilea's committee had an office in Istanbul which regularly sent couriers to a safe house in Bucharest, where messages were exchanged with one of Carol's former prime ministers [[Constantin Argetoianu]] who in turn acted as an emissary for those opposed to Antonescu.<ref name=\"ReferenceW\"/> Argetoianu reported that King Michael was opposed to the Antonescu regime and wanted to stage a coup d'\u00e9tat to depose Antonescu, waiting only for the Allies to invade the Balkans.<ref name=\"ReferenceW\"/> General Antonescu was the dictator, but Romanian army officers took their oath of loyalty to the king, so there was reason to believe in London that the Romanian Army would side with the king against the prime minister if the two came into conflict. From the British viewpoint, associating themselves with Carol's campaign to once again depose his own son would only complicate their dealings with King Michael.\n \nCarol and Magda Lupescu were married in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], on 3&nbsp;June 1947, Magda calling herself Princess Elena von Hohenzollern. In 1947 after the Communist take-over of Romania, a Romanian National Committee was set up to oppose the Communist regime. Carol's efforts to join the Romanian National Committee were rebuffed as all the factions were opposed to him, and Romanian monarchists on the committee made it clear that they regarded King Michael, not his father as the legitimate king of Romania.<ref name=\"Petraru pages 121-197\"/> Carol remained in exile for the rest of his life. He was never to see his son, King Michael, after his 1940 departure from Romania. Michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his funeral.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?data=2006-01-14&id=191689 |title=''Monique Urdareanu on Elena Lupescu and Carol II'' |accessdate=2 August 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613215715/http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?data=2006-01-14&id=191689 |archivedate=13 June 2008 }}, [[Ziua]], 14 January 2006</ref><!-- Pertinent quote: \"Voia mult sa-si vada fiul, dar dupa plecarea din Romania nu l-a mai intalnit niciodata.

His remains were finally returned to the [[Curtea de Arge\u0219 Cathedral|Curtea de Arge\u0219]] monastery in Romania in 2003, the traditional burial ground of Romanian royalty, at the request and expense of the government of Romania. They lie outside the cathedral, the burial place of Romanian kings and queens, as Elena was not of royal blood. Neither of his sons participated in either ceremony.
