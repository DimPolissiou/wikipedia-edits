The underlying physics is shared by other conventional interferometric methods such as [[Phase-contrast microscopy|phase contrast]] or [[Differential interference contrast microscopy|differential interference contrast]], or reflection interference microscopy. The key feature of iSCAT is the detection of elastic scattering from subwavelength particles, also known as [[Rayleigh scattering]], in addition to reflected or transmission signals from supra-wavelength objects. Typically, the challenge is the detection of tiny signals on top of large and complex, speckle-like backgrounds. iSCAT has been used to investigate nanoparticles such as viruses, proteins, lipid vesicles, DNA, exosomes, metal nanoparticles, semiconductor quantum dots, charge carriers and single organic molecules without the need for a fluorescent label.\n\n==Historical background==\nThe principle of interference plays a central role in many imaging methods, including bright-field imaging because it can be described as the interference between the illumination field and the one that has interacted with the object, i.e. through extinction. In fact, even microscopy based on the interference with an external light field is more than one hundred years old.\n\nThe first iSCAT-type of measurements were performed in the biophysics community in the 1990s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=AMOS|first=L.

The resulting terms are the intensity of the reference beam <math>(I_r = |\\overline{E_r}|^2)</math>, the pure scattered light from the object <math>(I_s = |\\overline{E_s}|^2)</math>, and the cross-term <math>(2 E_r E_s \\cos \\phi)</math> which contains a phase  <math>\\phi = \\phi_r - \\phi_s</math>. This phase comprises a [[Gouy phase]] component from the variations of the wave vectors, a scattering phase component from the material properties of the object, and a sinusoidally modulating phase component which depends on the position of the particle.\n\nIn general, the reference beam can take a different path than the scattered light within the optical setup, as long as they are [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] and interfere on the detector. However, the technique becomes simpler and more stable if both beams share the same optical path. Therefore, the reflected light off the cover-slip or the transmitted beam through the sample is typically used as the reference. For the interference to occur, it is necessary that both light waves (scattered light and reference light) are coherent. Interestingly, a light source with a large coherence length on the order of meters or more (like in modern narrow-band laser systems) is typically not needed. In the most common iSCAT realization schemes where the reflected light of a cover-slip is used as a reference and the scattering particle is not more than a few hundreds of nanometers above the glass, even \u201cincoherent\u201d light, e.g. from LED\u2019s, can be used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Daaboul|first=G.G.|last2=Vedula|first2=R.S.|last3=Ahn|first3=S.|last4=Lopez|first4=C.A.|last5=Reddington|first5=A.|last6=Ozkumur|first6=E.|last7=\u00dcnl\u00fc|first7=M.S.|date=January 2011|title=LED-based Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor for quantitative dynamic monitoring of biomolecular interactions|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2010.09.038|journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics|volume=26|issue=5|pages=2221\u20132227|doi=10.1016/j.bios.2010.09.038|issn=0956-5663}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\niSCAT has been used in a large variety of applications.

The resulting terms are the intensity of the reference beam <math>(I_r = |\\overline{E_r}|^2)</math>, the pure scattered light from the object <math>(I_s = |\\overline{E_s}|^2)</math>, and the cross-term <math>(2 E_r E_s \\cos \\phi)</math> which contains a phase  <math>\\phi = \\phi_r - \\phi_s</math>. This phase comprises a Gouy phase component from the variations of the wave vectors, a scattering phase component from the material properties of the object, and a sinusoidally modulating phase component which depends on the position of the particle.\n\nIn general, the reference beam can take a different path than the scattered light within the optical setup, as long as they are coherent and interfere on the detector. However, the technique becomes simpler and more stable if both beams share the same optical path. Therefore, the reflected light off the cover-slip or the transmitted beam through the sample is typically used as the reference. For the interference to occur, it is necessary that both light waves (scattered light and reference light) are coherent. Interestingly, a light source with a large coherence length on the order of meters or more (like in modern narrow-band laser systems) is typically not needed. In the most common iSCAT realization schemes where the reflected light of a cover-slip is used as a reference and the scattering particle is not more than a few hundreds of nanometers above the glass, even \u201cincoherent\u201d light, e.g. from LED\u2019s, can be used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Daaboul|first=G.G.|last2=Vedula|first2=R.S.|last3=Ahn|first3=S.|last4=Lopez|first4=C.A.|last5=Reddington|first5=A.|last6=Ozkumur|first6=E.|last7=\u00dcnl\u00fc|first7=M.S.|date=January 2011|title=LED-based Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor for quantitative dynamic monitoring of biomolecular interactions|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2010.09.038|journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics|volume=26|issue=5|pages=2221\u20132227|doi=10.1016/j.bios.2010.09.038|issn=0956-5663}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\niSCAT has been used in a large variety of applications.

The album's lyrics discuss themes of female empowerment, confidence, love and unity. After having few to no writing credits on their previous two studio albums, the group assumed creative control over their third album and co-wrote more than half of its songs. The album features a guest appearance by American rapper [[Gucci Mane]] and collaborations with several notable [[Record producer|producer]]s such as [[Ammo (musician)|Ammo]], who contributed to their 2016 smash hit \"[[Work from Home]]\", along with [[Poo Bear]] and [[Skrillex]].\n\nThe lead single \"[[Down (Fifth Harmony song)|Down]]\", which features rapper Gucci Mane, was released on June 2, 2017, and received gold certification in the United States. The second single \"[[He Like That]]\" was released on digital and streaming platforms on August 25, 2017. As did the band's previous releases, the sound of ''Fifth Harmony'' is characterized primarily as [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and includes influences from other genres, including [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[tropical house]], [[reggae]],  [[dancehall]], [[synthpop]] and [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]]; it was described as \"versatile\". The song \"[[Angel (Fifth Harmony song)|Angel]]\" was released as the first promotional single on August 11, 2017. The group also released a music video for \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Fifth Harmony song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\" on May 18, 2018, as a goodbye note after their hiatus; it also explains a mysterious, untitled photograph Fifth Harmony uploaded on the social media platforms [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]].\n\nSome critics noted a resemblance between ''Fifth Harmony'' and the band's previous album ''[[7/27]]''. ''Fifth Harmony'' debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 46,000 copies in its first week and becoming Fifth Harmony's fourth top-ten entry and third top-five entry. It also debuted inside the top tens of several countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Ireland and the United Kingdom; in Mexico it debuted at number three and in Spain it debuted at number one. ''Fifth Harmony'' is the group's first album following the departure of [[Camila Cabello]], who left the group in December 2016 to pursue a solo career. The album was promoted with the PSA Tour, between September 2017 and May 2018.\n\n==Background and conception==\nIn 2016, [[Fifth Harmony]] released their second studio album, which is titled ''[[7/27]]''.<ref name=Billboard1>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7632422/camila-cabello-fifth-harmony-exit-inside|title=Inside Camila Cabello's Fifth Harmony Exit: Where Did It All Go Wrong?|magazine= Billboard|access-date= August 16, 2017}}</ref> To promote the album, they embarked on [[the 7/27 Tour]].

The album's lyrics discuss themes of female empowerment, confidence, love and unity. After having few to no writing credits on their previous two studio albums, the group assumed creative control over their third album and co-wrote more than half of its songs. The album features a guest appearance by American rapper [[Gucci Mane]] and collaborations with several notable [[Record producer|producer]]s such as [[Ammo (musician)|Ammo]], who contributed to their 2016 smash hit \"[[Work from Home]]\", along with [[Poo Bear]] and [[Skrillex]].\n\nThe lead single \"[[Down (Fifth Harmony song)|Down]]\", which features rapper Gucci Mane, was released on June 2, 2017, and received gold certification in the United States. The second single \"[[He Like That]]\" was released on digital and streaming platforms on August 25, 2017. As did the band's previous releases, the sound of ''Fifth Harmony'' is characterized primarily as [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and includes influences from other genres, including [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[tropical house]], [[reggae]],  [[dancehall]], [[synthpop]] and [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]]; it was described as \"versatile\". The song \"[[Angel (Fifth Harmony song)|Angel]]\" was released as the first promotional single on August 11, 2017. The group also released a music video for \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Fifth Harmony song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\" on May 18, 2018, as a goodbye note after their hiatus; it also explains a mysterious, untitled photograph Fifth Harmony uploaded on the social media platforms [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]].\n\nSome critics noted a resemblance between ''Fifth Harmony'' and the band's previous album ''[[7/27]]''. ''Fifth Harmony'' debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 46,000 copies in its first week and becoming Fifth Harmony's fourth top-ten entry and third top-five entry. It also debuted inside the top tens of several countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Ireland and the United Kingdom; in Mexico it debuted at number three and in Spain it debuted at number one. ''Fifth Harmony'' is the group's first album following the departure of [[Camila Cabello]], who left the group in December 2016 to pursue a solo career. The album was promoted with the PSA Tour, between September 2017 and May 2018.\n\n==Background and conception==\nIn 2016, [[Fifth Harmony]] released their second studio album, which is titled ''[[7/27]]''.<ref name=Billboard1>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7632422/camila-cabello-fifth-harmony-exit-inside|title=Inside Camila Cabello's Fifth Harmony Exit: Where Did It All Go Wrong?|magazine= Billboard|access-date= August 16, 2017}}</ref> To promote the album, they embarked on [[the 7/27 Tour]].

Following the repercussion of Cabello's departure and speculations about the group's future, the members published another statement saying, \"We have spent the past year and a half (since her initial solo endeavor) trying to communicate to her and her team all of the reasons why we felt Fifth Harmony deserved at least one more album of her time.

Green Poison became a pandemic, resulting in casualties and chaos on a global scale. Facing imminent social collapse, the United States government activated a contingent of domestic [[sleeper agents]] called the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD), or simply \"The Division\", to preserve order and continuity of government. Division agents leverage advanced technology and wide autonomy to deal with threats as they see fit. They are supplemented on the field with an advanced [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] system called ISAC.\n\nBy the beginning of ''The Division 2'', most government and military personnel have evacuated Washington D.C., which has descended into lawlessness. The [[White House]] is controlled by local Division agents and a coalition of first responders called the Joint Task Force (JTF), working to protect civilians and reestablish order. However, most of Washington D.C. has been carved into territories controlled by three competing militias: the Hyenas, a loose coalition of gangs, criminals, and anarchists taking advantage of the chaos for amusement and profit; the Outcasts, fanatical survivors of severe quarantines during the onset of the pandemic, seeking revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection; and the True Sons, a highly organized and ruthless group of disgruntled JTF, [[US Armed Forces]], and paramilitary [[Mutiny|mutineers]] led by Colonel Antwon Ridgeway, who believes that security can only be restored through brutal [[authoritarianism]].\n\nAdditionally, the Acting [[President of the United States]], Andrew Ellis, is considered missing or [[killed in action]] since [[Air Force One]] crash landed near [[Capitol Hill]].\n\n=== Plot ===\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several Division agents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and nationwide communications, suddenly shuts down. The Player's Agent receives a Division distress call from Washington D.C. as a new and larger force begins to attack the settlement. At a fellow agent's urging, they abandon the battle to respond to the call. The Agent arrives in Washington D.C. to find the Division and JTF's local base of operations, the White House, under attack by the Hyenas. After repelling the attack, the Agent is briefed by Manny Ortega, the city's Division controller. The Agent learns that most of the country\u2019s leadership is either dead or missing and the city is mostly controlled by three hostile factions: the Hyenas, the Outcasts, and the True Sons. Ortega instructs the Agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to assist civilian settlements, liberate the city, and restore the SHD network.\n\nOrtega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of [[Air Force One]] but is being held prisoner. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to find Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure. The Agent eventually discovers Ellis and rescues him from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that [[Antivirals|broad spectrum antivirals]] to cure not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exist. However he can only access them with a special briefcase currently held in the True Sons' heavily fortified base at the [[United States Capitol]]. After the Agent repairs the SHD Network, reconnecting Division agents across the country, Ellis vows to restore the United States, no matter the cost. With the tide turning against them, the Hyenas, True Sons, and Outcasts retreat to their final strongholds. With the help of civilian militias and the JTF, the Agent assaults the strongholds and eliminates the leadership of most of the factions, with the Outcasts\u2019 leader Emelline Shaw disappearing during the assault on her stronghold on Roosevelt Island, while recovering Ellis' briefcase from the Capital.\n\nAs the Agent and the Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced [[private military company]] Black Tusk, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis suddenly goes missing with his briefcase, forcing the Agent to head out to find Ellis and repel the Black Tusk. The Agent eventually learns that Black Tusk supplied weapons to the gangs of D.C. and were responsible for sabotaging the SHD network, Ellis has been working with the Black Tusks all along, and that Ellis's predecessor, President Mendez, did not commit suicide as previously believed, but was assassinated by his own Secret Service detail on Black Tusk's orders. Thanks to Ellis, Black Tusk gains possession of the broad spectrum antivirals, planning to transport them out of the city. The Agent successfully raids Black Tusk's stronghold at [[Tidal Basin]], retrieving the antivirals and preventing a missile strike on the White House, although Ellis\u2019 location remains unknown.\n\n===Downloadable content===\n\n=====Episode 1 \u2013 D.C. Outskirts: Expedition=====\nFurther investigation reveals that Outcast leader, Emelline Shaw, survived the Division's assault at the aforementioned stronghold, and that she is currently at her new hideout at the Manning National Zoo. After fighting their way through the Zoo, the Agent manages to destroy Shaw\u2019s heavily armed monorail car and kill her.\n\nThe Agent then joins a large JTF task force in an attack on Camp White Oaks, a heavily wooded former presidential retreat north of DC, which has since been taken over by Black Tusk, with the objective of locating and capturing President Ellis. The main assault force is annihilated when the bridge they are crossing is destroyed by Black Tusk and the remaining team is eventually overrun while trying to secure the main helipad to prevent Ellis\u2019 escape, leaving the Agent to continue the mission alone. The Agent manages to reach the helipad too late as Ellis is evacuated by Black Tusk helicopter, disappearing for the second time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Agent is then sent on an expedition to Kenly College to investigate the recent disappearance of a JTF Squad, where the Outcasts have taken over the campus and severed communications.  There, the Agent removes the Outcasts securing stolen supplies at the College Library, infiltrates the Metro Station and water treatment facility underneath, and destroys the outcast base in the Student Union building.\n\n====Episode 2 \u2013 Pentagon: The Last Castle====\nThe Agent is sent to investigate [[the Pentagon]] after the Division detects heavy Black Tusk activity at the facility. Upon reaching the site, the Agent discovers that Black Tusk is setting up a massive drilling operation in order to access the DARPA laboratories underneath the Pentagon, which hold numerous experimental technologies. The Agent sabotages the drilling operation to delay Black Tusk before stealing data from their servers to figure out what they are after. It is revealed that Black Tusk are after a [[perfusion]] [[bioreactor]], capable of mass producing the antivirals the Division possesses.\n\nThe Agent proceeds into the DARPA lab to find Black Tusk attempting to smuggle the bioreactor out through the tunnel network beneath the Pentagon. The Agent is able to seize the bioreactor and transport it to a nearby helipad, eliminating Black Tusk forces so that the bioreactor can be extracted. Kelso congratulates the Agent, stating that even though they don't have staff qualified to operate the bioreactor yet, they are one step closer to ending the threat of Green Poison.\n\n==== Episode 3 \u2013 Coney Island: The Hunt ====\nThe Agent is sent to the ruins of [[Coney Island]] to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a virologist kidnapped by rogue Division agent Aaron Keener during the events of the previous game. Keener intends to hand Tchernenko over to Black Tusk at Coney Island in exchange for assistance with an unknown project. The Agent is tasked with rescuing Tchernenko to ensure his knowledge doesn't fall into Black Tusk's hands, and enlist his help in creating a vaccine. The Agent successfully infiltrates Black Tusk's defenses and has Tchernenko evacuated to Washington D.C.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Keener never intended to allow Black Tusk to leave with Tchernenko, as the island comes under attack by The Cleaners, a gang of deranged former [[DSNY]] workers that aims to violently purge any potential sources and carriers of the virus. Keener informed The Cleaners of Tchernenko's whereabouts, inciting them to attack Black Tusk so they can kill him. The Agent is forced to fight their way through the Cleaners and Black Tusk while hunting for Keener. After the Agent kills the Black Tusk's commander, Keener hijacks the video feed from a Division drone to gloat at the Agent about his successful [[Betrayal#Double cross|double cross]], escape, and ominous project.\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\n==== Warlords of New York ====\nThe Agent and Alani Kelso helicopter into New York City, answering a distress call from Faye Lau, leader of local Division operations. They find the JTF and Division's base in [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] devastated by a biological weapon deployed by Keener and his allies. The weapon is a newly engineered, instantaneously lethal, derivative of Green Poison called Eclipse. The Agent, Kelso, Lau, and JTF leader Roy Benitez regroup at Haven, a civilian settlement run by Paul Rhodes. \n\nAs Keener's whereabouts are unknown, the group decides to go after his [[Lieutenant|lieutenants]], who act as [[Warlord|warlords]] in four [[Lower Manhattan]] neighborhoods. Keener's warlords are fellow rogue agents convinced or coerced to work for him alongside local gangs: Theo Parnell, an engineering and computer systems expert stationed inside [[The Tombs]] of [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center]]; Vivian Conley, a chemical engineering expert who commands the Cleaners gang from a wrecked oil tanker in [[Two Bridges, Manhattan|Two Bridges]]; Javier Kajika, a covert and guerilla warfare expert based underneath [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]]; and James Dragov, a heavy weapons expert who commands the Rikers gang from the [[New York Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].\n\nThe Agent eliminates the four warlords and recovers intelligence placing Keener on [[Liberty Island]]. The Agent and Kelso commandeer a ferry to Liberty Island, but are attacked by Black Tusk who have suddenly arrived in Manhattan to attack Keener as well. The Agent single-handily fights off Black Tusk to reach Keener's base inside the [[Statue of Liberty Museum]], discovering a [[Surface-to-surface missile|surface to surface missile]] system capable of delivering Eclipse payloads. Keener plans to launch a missile at Manhattan, killing everyone to enable the rise of a new society. The agent successfully destroys the system and defeats Keener in battle. A mortally wounded Keener activates a signal on his modified Division wristwatch before dying.\n\nKeener's signal activates ANNA, an AI analogue to ISAC developed by Parnell to network and coordinate rogue Division agents across the country. It's also revealed that Lau betrayed the Division to ally with Black Tusk at some point, and was their reason for arriving in Manhattan after Keener's location was known. Lau tells Bardon Schaeffer, Black Tusk's leader in Washington D.C., that Keener's rogue agent network will help them end the Division. Back in Haven, Rhodes and Benitez thank and congratulate the Agent, but lament Lau's betrayal. Kelso informs the Agent of a rogue agent cell activated in Washington D.C..\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was developed by [[Massive Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/|title=The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG 247]]|date=March 8, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> Evaluating the feedback from players regarding the [[Tom Clancy's The Division|first game]], Massive Entertainment planned to include more game content at launch and improve the endgame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-on-how-the-division-2-will-be-better-than-/1100-6459041/|title=Ubisoft On How The Division 2 Will Be Better Than The Division 1|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 18, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The game's endgame development was prioritized by Massive Entertainment after hearing players' complaints from the first game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-division-2s-developer-says-first-games-post-launch-response-was-a-nightmare|title=E3 2018: The Division 2's Developer Says First Game's Post-launch Response Was A Nightmare|first=Terri|last=Schwartz|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 11, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The developers have said that the game's main campaign will take around 40 hours to beat, making it twice as long as the original game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/wk543/the-division-2-how-long-is-the-campaign|title=The Division 2: How Long is the Campaign?|first=William|last=Parks|work=[[GameSkinny]]|date=January 20, 2019|accessdate=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game was announced on March 9, 2018, by Ubisoft, with the first gameplay footage being premiered at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018]] in June 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-division-2-will-release-within-a-year-ubisoft-confirms/|title=The Division 2 will release within the next 12 months, Ubisoft confirms|first=Samuel|last=Horti|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=May 12, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> At the Expo, Ubisoft confirmed that the game will be released on March 15, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/ | title = The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018 | first=  Stephany | last = Nunnelly | date = March 8, 2018 | accessdate = March 8, 2018 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> A [[Software release life cycle#Beta|private beta]] was launched prior to the game's release.

Green Poison became a pandemic, resulting in casualties and chaos on a global scale. Facing imminent social collapse, the United States government activated a contingent of domestic [[sleeper agents]] called the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD), or simply \"The Division\", to preserve order and continuity of government. Division agents leverage advanced technology and wide autonomy to deal with threats as they see fit. They are supplemented on the field with an advanced [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] system called ISAC.\n\nBy the beginning of ''The Division 2'', most government and military personnel have evacuated Washington D.C., which has descended into lawlessness. The [[White House]] is controlled by local Division agents and a coalition of first responders called the Joint Task Force (JTF), working to protect civilians and reestablish order. However, most of Washington D.C. has been carved into territories controlled by three competing militias: the Hyenas, a loose coalition of gangs, criminals, and anarchists taking advantage of the chaos for amusement and profit; the Outcasts, fanatical survivors of severe quarantines during the onset of the pandemic, seeking revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection; and the True Sons, a highly organized and ruthless group of disgruntled JTF, [[US Armed Forces]], and paramilitary [[Mutiny|mutineers]] led by Colonel Antwon Ridgeway, who believes that security can only be restored through brutal [[authoritarianism]].\n\nAdditionally, the Acting [[President of the United States]], Andrew Ellis, is considered missing or [[killed in action]] since [[Air Force One]] crash landed near [[Capitol Hill]].\n\n=== Plot ===\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several Division agents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and nationwide communications, suddenly shuts down. The Player's Agent receives a Division distress call from Washington D.C. as a new and larger force begins to attack the settlement. At a fellow agent's urging, they abandon the battle to respond to the call. The Agent arrives in Washington D.C. to find the Division and JTF's local base of operations, the White House, under attack by the Hyenas. After repelling the attack, the Agent is briefed by Manny Ortega, the city's Division controller. The Agent learns that most of the country\u2019s leadership is either dead or missing and the city is mostly controlled by three hostile factions: the Hyenas, the Outcasts, and the True Sons. Ortega instructs the Agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to assist civilian settlements, liberate the city, and restore the SHD network.\n\nOrtega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of [[Air Force One]] but is being held prisoner. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to find Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure. The Agent eventually discovers Ellis and rescues him from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that [[Antivirals|broad spectrum antivirals]] to cure not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exist. However he can only access them with a special briefcase currently held in the True Sons' heavily fortified base at the [[United States Capitol]]. After the Agent repairs the SHD Network, reconnecting Division agents across the country, Ellis vows to restore the United States, no matter the cost. With the tide turning against them, the Hyenas, True Sons, and Outcasts retreat to their final strongholds. With the help of civilian militias and the JTF, the Agent assaults the strongholds and eliminates the leadership of most of the factions, with the Outcasts\u2019 leader Emelline Shaw disappearing during the assault on her stronghold on Roosevelt Island, while recovering Ellis' briefcase from the Capital.\n\nAs the Agent and the Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced [[private military company]] Black Tusk, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis suddenly goes missing with his briefcase, forcing the Agent to head out to find Ellis and repel the Black Tusk. The Agent eventually learns that Black Tusk supplied weapons to the gangs of D.C. and were responsible for sabotaging the SHD network, Ellis has been working with the Black Tusks all along, and that Ellis's predecessor, President Mendez, did not commit suicide as previously believed, but was assassinated by his own Secret Service detail on Black Tusk's orders. Thanks to Ellis, Black Tusk gains possession of the broad spectrum antivirals, planning to transport them out of the city. The Agent successfully raids Black Tusk's stronghold at [[Tidal Basin]], retrieving the antivirals and preventing a missile strike on the White House, although Ellis\u2019 location remains unknown.\n\n===Downloadable content===\n\n=====Episode 1 \u2013 D.C. Outskirts: Expedition=====\nFurther investigation reveals that Outcast leader, Emelline Shaw, survived the Division's assault at the aforementioned stronghold, and that she is currently at her new hideout at the Manning National Zoo. After fighting their way through the Zoo, the Agent manages to destroy Shaw\u2019s heavily armed monorail car and kill her.\n\nThe Agent then joins a large JTF task force in an attack on Camp White Oaks, a heavily wooded former presidential retreat north of DC, which has since been taken over by Black Tusk, with the objective of locating and capturing President Ellis. The main assault force is annihilated when the bridge they are crossing is destroyed by Black Tusk and the remaining team is eventually overrun while trying to secure the main helipad to prevent Ellis\u2019 escape, leaving the Agent to continue the mission alone. The Agent manages to reach the helipad too late as Ellis is evacuated by Black Tusk helicopter, disappearing for the second time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Agent is then sent on an expedition to Kenly College to investigate the recent disappearance of a JTF Squad, where the Outcasts have taken over the campus and severed communications.  There, the Agent removes the Outcasts securing stolen supplies at the College Library, infiltrates the Metro Station and water treatment facility underneath, and destroys the outcast base in the Student Union building.\n\n====Episode 2 \u2013 Pentagon: The Last Castle====\nThe Agent is sent to investigate [[the Pentagon]] after the Division detects heavy Black Tusk activity at the facility. Upon reaching the site, the Agent discovers that Black Tusk is setting up a massive drilling operation in order to access the DARPA laboratories underneath the Pentagon, which hold numerous experimental technologies. The Agent sabotages the drilling operation to delay Black Tusk before stealing data from their servers to figure out what they are after. It is revealed that Black Tusk are after a [[perfusion]] [[bioreactor]], capable of mass producing the antivirals the Division possesses.\n\nThe Agent proceeds into the DARPA lab to find Black Tusk attempting to smuggle the bioreactor out through the tunnel network beneath the Pentagon. The Agent is able to seize the bioreactor and transport it to a nearby helipad, eliminating Black Tusk forces so that the bioreactor can be extracted. Kelso congratulates the Agent, stating that even though they don't have staff qualified to operate the bioreactor yet, they are one step closer to ending the threat of Green Poison.\n\n==== Episode 3 \u2013 Coney Island: The Hunt ====\nThe Agent is sent to the ruins of [[Coney Island]] to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a virologist kidnapped by rogue Division agent Aaron Keener during the events of the previous game. Keener intends to hand Tchernenko over to Black Tusk at Coney Island in exchange for assistance with an unknown project. The Agent is tasked with rescuing Tchernenko to ensure his knowledge doesn't fall into Black Tusk's hands, and enlist his help in creating a vaccine. The Agent successfully infiltrates Black Tusk's defenses and has Tchernenko evacuated to Washington D.C.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Keener never intended to allow Black Tusk to leave with Tchernenko, as the island comes under attack by The Cleaners, a gang of deranged former [[DSNY]] workers that aims to violently purge any potential sources and carriers of the virus. Keener informed The Cleaners of Tchernenko's whereabouts, inciting them to attack Black Tusk so they can kill him. The Agent is forced to fight their way through the Cleaners and Black Tusk while hunting for Keener. After the Agent kills the Black Tusk's commander, Keener hijacks the video feed from a Division drone to gloat at the Agent about his successful [[Betrayal#Double cross|double cross]], escape, and ominous project.\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\n==== Warlords of New York ====\nThe Agent and Alani Kelso helicopter into New York City, answering a distress call from Faye Lau, leader of local Division operations. They find the JTF and Division's base in [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] devastated by a biological weapon deployed by Keener and his allies. The weapon is a newly engineered, instantaneously lethal, derivative of Green Poison called Eclipse. The Agent, Kelso, Lau, and JTF leader Roy Benitez regroup at Haven, a civilian settlement run by Paul Rhodes. \n\nAs Keener's whereabouts are unknown, the group decides to go after his [[Lieutenant|lieutenants]], who act as [[Warlord|warlords]] in four [[Lower Manhattan]] neighborhoods. Keener's warlords are fellow rogue agents convinced or coerced to work for him alongside local gangs: Theo Parnell, an engineering and computer systems expert stationed inside [[The Tombs]] of [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center]]; Vivian Conley, a chemical engineering expert who commands the Cleaners gang from a wrecked oil tanker in [[Two Bridges, Manhattan|Two Bridges]]; Javier Kajika, a covert and guerilla warfare expert based underneath [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]]; and James Dragov, a heavy weapons expert who commands the Rikers gang from the [[New York Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].\n\nThe Agent eliminates the four warlords and recovers intelligence placing Keener on [[Liberty Island]]. The Agent and Kelso commandeer a ferry to Liberty Island, but are attacked by Black Tusk who have suddenly arrived in Manhattan to attack Keener as well. The Agent single-handily fights off Black Tusk to reach Keener's base inside the [[Statue of Liberty Museum]], discovering a [[Surface-to-surface missile|surface to surface missile]] system capable of delivering Eclipse payloads. Keener plans to launch a missile at Manhattan, killing everyone to enable the rise of a new society. The agent successfully destroys the system and defeats Keener in battle. A mortally wounded Keener activates a signal on his modified Division wristwatch before dying.\n\nKeener's signal activates ANNA, an AI analogue to ISAC developed by Parnell to network and coordinate rogue Division agents across the country. It's also revealed that Lau betrayed the Division to ally with Black Tusk at some point, and was their reason for arriving in Manhattan after Keener's location was known. Lau tells Bardon Schaeffer, Black Tusk's leader in Washington D.C., that Keener's rogue agent network will help them end the Division. Back in Haven, Rhodes and Benitez thank and congratulate the Agent, but lament Lau's betrayal. Kelso informs the Agent of a rogue agent cell activated in Washington D.C..\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was developed by [[Massive Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/|title=The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG 247]]|date=March 8, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> Evaluating the feedback from players regarding the [[Tom Clancy's The Division|first game]], Massive Entertainment planned to include more game content at launch and improve the endgame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-on-how-the-division-2-will-be-better-than-/1100-6459041/|title=Ubisoft On How The Division 2 Will Be Better Than The Division 1|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 18, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The game's endgame development was prioritized by Massive Entertainment after hearing players' complaints from the first game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-division-2s-developer-says-first-games-post-launch-response-was-a-nightmare|title=E3 2018: The Division 2's Developer Says First Game's Post-launch Response Was A Nightmare|first=Terri|last=Schwartz|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 11, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The developers have said that the game's main campaign will take around 40 hours to beat, making it twice as long as the original game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/wk543/the-division-2-how-long-is-the-campaign|title=The Division 2: How Long is the Campaign?|first=William|last=Parks|work=[[GameSkinny]]|date=January 20, 2019|accessdate=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game was announced on March 9, 2018, by Ubisoft, with the first gameplay footage being premiered at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018]] in June 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-division-2-will-release-within-a-year-ubisoft-confirms/|title=The Division 2 will release within the next 12 months, Ubisoft confirms|first=Samuel|last=Horti|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=May 12, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> At the Expo, Ubisoft confirmed that the game will be released on March 15, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/ | title = The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018 | first=  Stephany | last = Nunnelly | date = March 8, 2018 | accessdate = March 8, 2018 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> A [[Software release life cycle#Beta|private beta]] was launched prior to the game's release.
