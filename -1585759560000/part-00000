The topography of the Shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages, which explains the glacial deposits of boulders, gravel and sand, and by sea water and post-glacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the Shield. The Canadian Shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes, bogs, streams and rivers. It is rich in the forestry, mineral and hydro-electric resources that are a mainstay of the Quebec economy. [[Primary sector of the economy|Primary industries]] sustain small cities in regions of [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue]], [[Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean]], and [[C\u00f4te-Nord]].\n\n[[File:Mont Tremblant village.jpeg|thumb|alt=|[[Mont Tremblant Resort]], [[Laurentian Mountains]]]]\nThe [[Labrador Peninsula]] is covered by the Laurentian Plateau (or [[Canadian Shield]]), dotted with mountains such as [[Otish Mountains]]. The [[Ungava Peninsula]] is notably composed of D'Youville mountains, Puvirnituq mountains and Pingualuit crater. While low and medium altitude peak from western Quebec to the far north, high altitudes mountains emerge in the [[Capitale-Nationale]] region to the extreme east, along its longitude. In the [[Labrador Peninsula]] portion of the Shield, the far northern region of [[Nunavik]] includes the [[Ungava Peninsula]] and consists of flat [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] inhabited mostly by the [[Inuit]]. Further south lie the [[subarctic]] [[taiga]] of the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] ecoregion and the [[Taiga|boreal forest]] of the [[Central Canadian Shield forests]], where [[spruce]], [[fir]], and [[Populus|poplar]] trees provide raw materials for Quebec's [[Pulp and paper industry in Canada|pulp and paper]] and [[lumber]] industries. Although the area is inhabited principally by the [[Cree]], [[Naskapi]], and [[Innu people|Innu]] [[First Nations]], thousands of temporary workers reside at [[Radisson, Quebec|Radisson]] to service the massive [[James Bay Project|James Bay Hydroelectric Project]] on the [[La Grande River|La Grande]] and [[Eastmain River|Eastmain]] rivers. The southern portion of the shield extends to the [[Laurentian Mountains|Laurentians]], a mountain range just north of the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|Saint Lawrence Lowland]], that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts.\n\nThe [[Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches|Appalachian]] region of Quebec has a narrow strip of ancient mountains along the southeastern border of Quebec.

At that time, French-speaking Canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of Quebec (more than 99%) and British immigration was not going well. To secure the allegiance of the approximately 90,000 French-speaking Canadians to the British crown, first Governor [[James Murray (Quebec governor)|James Murray]] and later Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] promoted the need for change. There was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the French-speaking Canadian subjects and those of newly arrived British subjects.

The Quebec Act offended a variety of interest groups in the British colonies. Land speculators and settlers objected to the transfer of western lands previously claimed by the colonies to a non-representative government.

On November 15, 1976, L\u00e9vesque and the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois won control of the provincial government for the first time. The question of [[sovereignty-association]] was placed before the voters in the [[1980 Quebec referendum]]. During the campaign, [[Pierre Trudeau]] promised that a vote for the \"no\" side was a vote for reforming Canada. Trudeau advocated the [[patriation]] of Canada's Constitution from the United Kingdom. The existing constitutional document, the [[British North America Act]], could only be amended by the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] upon a request by the Canadian parliament.\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque BAnQ P243S1D865.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]]]]\nSixty percent of the Quebec electorate voted against the proposition for sovereignty-association.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1980 Quebec Referendum|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/constitution/topics/1092-6040/|work=Facts and results|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation \u2013 CBC|accessdate=June 29, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531220955/http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/constitution/topics/1092-6040/|archivedate=May 31, 2008}}</ref> Polls showed that the overwhelming majority of English and immigrant Quebecers voted against, and that French Quebecers were almost equally divided, with older voters less in favour and younger voters more in favour.

From the early 17th century, French settlers populating North America were interested in a new cuisine to confront the climate and the needs arising from the work of colonization. Mindful of the same nutritional needs as settlers from [[Acadia]], it has many similarities with Acadian cuisine. Quebec's cuisine has a strong French and Irish influence, although many aspects of Canadian aboriginal cuisine have also had a significant impact on Quebec cuisine. Quebec is most famous for its [[Tourti\u00e8re]], [[P\u00e2t\u00e9 Chinois]], [[Poutine]], [[St. Catherine's taffy]] among others. The temps des sucres (sugar season) is one of the oldest of Quebec culinary traditions. During springtime, many Quebecers go to the [[Sugar house|cabane \u00e0 sucre]] (sugar house) for a traditional meal. The Jewish community of [[Montreal]] has contributed [[Montreal-style bagel]]s and [[Montreal-style smoked meat|smoked meat]] which is similar to [[pastrami]].\n\nQuebec has produced beer since the beginning of colonization especially with the emergence of [[spruce beer]]. In 1668, [[Jean Talon]] founded a brewery in Quebec City, but it closed a decade later. Although many people tried to produce a beer between the 17th and 18th centuries, it is only since the 1980s that the industries had produced on a larger scale. Today there are nearly a hundred breweries and companies, including [[Unibroue]], [[Molson Coors]], [[Labatt]] and many others. Quebec also produces wine, [[ice wine]] and [[ice cider]].\n\nQuebec has produced cheese for centuries. The first cheese-making school in North America was established in Saint-Denis-de-Kamouraska in 1893. It was at this moment that the monks of La Trappe of Oka began to produce the famous [[Oka cheese]]. Today there are over 300 different cheeses in Quebec.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Boston vs. CH au Centre Bell 007.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Montreal Canadiens]] at the [[Bell Centre]]]]\nSports in Quebec constitutes an essential dimension of Quebec culture. The practice of sports and outdoor activities in Quebec was influenced largely by its geography and climate. [[Ice hockey]] remains the national sport. This sport, which was played for the first time on March 3, 1875, at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal and promoted over the years by numerous achievements, including the centenary of the [[Montreal Canadiens]], still raises passions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Canoe inc. |url=http://fr.canoe.ca/sports/nouvelles/hockey/canadiens/archives/2009/12/20091205-065501.html |title=Un anniversaire douloureux |publisher=Fr.canoe.ca |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> Other major sports include [[Canadian football]] with the [[Montreal Alouettes]], soccer with the [[Montreal Impact]], the [[Canadian Grand Prix|Grand Prix du Canada]] Formula 1 racing with drivers such as [[Gilles Villeneuve]] and [[Jacques Villeneuve]], and professional baseball with the former [[Montreal Expos]].

By 1758 at the [[Battle of Carillon]], the [[Flag of Carillon]] would become the basis of Quebec's desire to have its own flag. By 1903, the parent of today's flag had taken shape, known as the \"''[[Fleurdelis\u00e9]]''\".

On this day, the song \"[[Gens du pays]]\" by [[Gilles Vigneault]] is often heard and commonly regarded as Quebec's unofficial anthem. The festivities occur on June 23 and 24 and are celebrated all over Quebec.

The topography of the Shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages, which explains the glacial deposits of boulders, gravel and sand, and by sea water and post-glacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the Shield. The Canadian Shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes, bogs, streams and rivers. It is rich in the forestry, mineral and hydro-electric resources that are a mainstay of the Quebec economy. [[Primary sector of the economy|Primary industries]] sustain small cities in regions of [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue]], [[Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean]], and [[C\u00f4te-Nord]].\n\n[[File:Mont Tremblant village.jpeg|thumb|alt=|[[Mont Tremblant Resort]], [[Laurentian Mountains]]]]\nThe [[Labrador Peninsula]] is covered by the Laurentian Plateau (or [[Canadian Shield]]), dotted with mountains such as [[Otish Mountains]]. The [[Ungava Peninsula]] is notably composed of D'Youville mountains, Puvirnituq mountains and Pingualuit crater. While low and medium altitude peak from western Quebec to the far north, high altitudes mountains emerge in the [[Capitale-Nationale]] region to the extreme east, along its longitude. In the [[Labrador Peninsula]] portion of the Shield, the far northern region of [[Nunavik]] includes the [[Ungava Peninsula]] and consists of flat [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] inhabited mostly by the [[Inuit]]. Further south lie the [[subarctic]] [[taiga]] of the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] ecoregion and the [[Taiga|boreal forest]] of the [[Central Canadian Shield forests]], where [[spruce]], [[fir]], and [[Populus|poplar]] trees provide raw materials for Quebec's [[Pulp and paper industry in Canada|pulp and paper]] and [[lumber]] industries. Although the area is inhabited principally by the [[Cree]], [[Naskapi]], and [[Innu people|Innu]] [[First Nations]], thousands of temporary workers reside at [[Radisson, Quebec|Radisson]] to service the massive [[James Bay Project|James Bay Hydroelectric Project]] on the [[La Grande River|La Grande]] and [[Eastmain River|Eastmain]] rivers. The southern portion of the shield extends to the [[Laurentian Mountains|Laurentians]], a mountain range just north of the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|Saint Lawrence Lowland]], that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts.\n\nThe [[Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches|Appalachian]] region of Quebec has a narrow strip of ancient mountains along the southeastern border of Quebec.

The Quebec Act offended a variety of interest groups in the British colonies. Land speculators and settlers objected to the transfer of western lands previously claimed by the colonies to a non-representative government.

From the early 17th century, French settlers populating North America were interested in a new cuisine to confront the climate and the needs arising from the work of colonization. Mindful of the same nutritional needs as settlers from [[Acadia]], it has many similarities with Acadian cuisine. Quebec's cuisine has a strong French and Irish influence, although many aspects of Canadian aboriginal cuisine have also had a significant impact on Quebec cuisine. Quebec is most famous for its [[Tourti\u00e8re]], [[P\u00e2t\u00e9 Chinois]], [[Poutine]], [[St. Catherine's taffy]] among others. The temps des sucres (sugar season) is one of the oldest of Quebec culinary traditions. During springtime, many Quebecers go to the [[Sugar house|cabane \u00e0 sucre]] (sugar house) for a traditional meal. The Jewish community of [[Montreal]] has contributed [[Montreal-style bagel]]s and [[Montreal-style smoked meat|smoked meat]] which is similar to [[pastrami]].\n\nQuebec has produced beer since the beginning of colonization especially with the emergence of [[spruce beer]]. In 1668, [[Jean Talon]] founded a brewery in Quebec City, but it closed a decade later. Although many people tried to produce a beer between the 17th and 18th centuries, it is only since the 1980s that the industries had produced on a larger scale. Today there are nearly a hundred breweries and companies, including [[Unibroue]], [[Molson Coors]], [[Labatt]] and many others. Quebec also produces wine, [[ice wine]] and [[ice cider]].\n\nQuebec has produced cheese for centuries. The first cheese-making school in North America was established in Saint-Denis-de-Kamouraska in 1893. It was at this moment that the monks of La Trappe of Oka began to produce the famous [[Oka cheese]]. Today there are over 300 different cheeses in Quebec.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Boston vs. CH au Centre Bell 007.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Montreal Canadiens]] at the [[Bell Centre]]]]\nSports in Quebec constitutes an essential dimension of Quebec culture. The practice of sports and outdoor activities in Quebec was influenced largely by its geography and climate. [[Ice hockey]] remains the national sport.

When [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded [[Qu\u00e9bec City]] in 1608, his ship hoisted the merchant flag of a white cross on a blue background. By 1758 at the [[Battle of Carillon]], the [[Flag of Carillon]] would become the basis of Quebec's desire to have its own flag. By 1903, the parent of today's flag had taken shape, known as the \"''[[Fleurdelis\u00e9]]''\". The flag in its present form with its 4 white \"[[fleur-de-lis]]\" lilies on a blue background with a white cross replaced the [[Union Jack]] on Quebec's [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] on January 21, 1948.\n\n===Other official symbols===\n*The floral emblem of Quebec is the ''[[Iris versicolor]]''.<ref name=\"Qsymbols\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait?id=portrait.drapeau&lang=en|author=Quebec Portal|publisher=Government of Quebec|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=July 12, 2011|title=National Flag and Emblems|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720065807/http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait?id=portrait.drapeau&lang=en|archivedate=July 20, 2011}}</ref>\n*Since 1987 the avian emblem of Quebec has been the [[snowy owl]].<ref name=\"Qsymbols\"/>\n*An official tree, the [[yellow birch]] (''bouleau jaune'', ''merisier''), symbolizes the importance Quebecers give to the forests.

On this day, the song \"[[Gens du pays]]\" by [[Gilles Vigneault]] is often heard and commonly regarded as Quebec's unofficial anthem. The festivities occur on June 23 and 24 and are celebrated all over Quebec. In cities like [[Quebec City|Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[Montreal|Montr\u00e9al]], great shows are organized in the main public places (such as the Abraham plains, [[Quebec City|Qu\u00e9bec]], or Maisonneuve Park, [[Montreal|Montr\u00e9al]]) where several of the most popular Quebec artists relay each others{{clarify|date=September 2012}} until late at night.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal |Canada}}\n* [[Index of Quebec-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Quebec]]\n* <!-- [[Bibliography of Quebec]] -->\n* <!-- {{wikipedia books link|Quebec}} -->\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Journals===\n*{{cite journal\n| title= The CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system cleaves bacteriophage and plasmid DNA\n| last = Garneau, Josiane E.\n| last2 = Dupuis, Marie-\u00c8ve\n| last3 = Villion, Manuela\n| last4 = Romero, Dennis A.\n| last5 = Barrangou, Rodolphe\n| last6 = Boyaval, Patrick\n| last7 = Fremaux, Christophe\n| last8 = Horvath, Philippe\n| last9 = Magad\u00e1n, Alfonso H.\n| year= 2010\n| journal = Nature\n| ref = {{harvid|Dupuis|Villion|Romero|Barrangou|2010}}\n| volume=468\n| issue=7320\n| doi=10.1038/nature09523\n|first1=Josiane E.\n|first2=Marie-\u00c8ve\n|first3=Manuela\n|first4=Dennis A.\n|first5=Rodolphe\n|first6=Patrick\n|first7=Christophe\n|first8=Philippe\n|first9=Alfonso H.\n|pages=67\u201371\n|pmid=21048762\n| bibcode= 2010Natur.468...67G\n}}\n*{{cite journal\n|doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.2002.01201.x\n| last = Demeule, M.\n| last2 = Poirier, J.\n| last3 = Jodoin, J.\n| last4 = Bertrand, Y.\n| last5 = Desrosiers, R.

Phages are classified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) according to [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and nucleic acid.\n\nNineteen families are currently recognized by the ICTV that infect [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Of these, only two families have RNA genomes, and only five families are surrounded by an envelope. Of the viral families with DNA genomes, only two have single-stranded genomes. Eight of the viral families with DNA genomes have circular genomes, while nine have linear genomes. Nine families infect bacteria only, nine infect archaea only, and one (''Tectiviridae'') infects both bacteria and archaea.\n\n[[File:Bacteriophage P22 Casjens Lenk.png|thumb|right|Bacteriophage P22, a member of the ''[[Podoviridae]]'' by morphology due to its short, non-contractile tail]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ '''ICTV classification of prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) viruses'''<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n|- style=\"background:gray;\"\n!Order !!

With ''lytic phages'' such as the [[T4 phage]], bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. As soon as the cell is destroyed, the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect. Lytic phages are more suitable for [[phage therapy]]. Some lytic phages undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition, where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate phage]] going dormant and usually, is temporary.\n\nIn contrast, the ''[[lysogenic cycle]]'' does not result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as [[temperate phage]]s. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it, relatively harmlessly, or may even become established as a [[plasmid]]. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients, then, the [[endogenous]] phages (known as [[prophage]]s) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is replicated in all offspring of the cell. An example of a bacteriophage known to follow the lysogenic cycle and the lytic cycle is the [[phage lambda]] of ''E. coli.''<ref>Mason, Kenneth A., Jonathan B. Losos, Susan R.

Polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, like endolysins are virion-associated proteins to enzymatically degrade the capsular outer layer of their hosts, at the initial step of a tightly programmed phage infection process.\nHost growth conditions also influence the ability of the phage to attach and invade them.<ref name=\"pmid9356254\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Gabashvili | first1 = I.\n| last2 = Khan | first2 = S.\n| last3 = Hayes | first3 = S.\n| last4 = Serwer | first4 = P.\n| title = Polymorphism of bacteriophage T7\n| doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1997.1353\n| journal = Journal of Molecular Biology\n| volume = 273\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 658\u201367\n| year = 1997\n| pmid = 9356254}}</ref> As phage virions do not move independently, they must rely on random encounters with the correct receptors when in solution, such as blood, lymphatic circulation, irrigation, soil water, etc.\n\nMyovirus bacteriophages use a [[hypodermic syringe]]-like motion to inject their genetic material into the cell. After contacting the appropriate receptor, the tail fibers flex to bring the base plate closer to the surface of the cell. This is known as reversible binding. Once attached completely, irreversible binding is initiated and the tail contracts, possibly with the help of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], present in the tail,<ref name=\"Prescott\" /> injecting genetic material through the bacterial membrane. The injection is accomplished through a sort of bending motion in the shaft by going to the side, contracting closer to the cell and pushing back up. Podoviruses lack an elongated tail sheath like that of a myovirus, so instead, they use their small, tooth-like tail fibers enzymatically to degrade a portion of the cell membrane before inserting their genetic material.\n\n=== Synthesis of proteins and nucleic acid ===\nWithin minutes, bacterial [[ribosome]]s start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages, [[RNA replicase]] is synthesized early in the process. Proteins modify the bacterial [[RNA polymerase]] so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host's normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on to become part of new virions within the cell, helper proteins that contribute to the assemblage of new virions, or proteins involved in cell [[lysis]].

The base plates are assembled first, with the tails being built upon them afterward. The head capsids, constructed separately, will spontaneously assemble with the tails. The DNA is packed efficiently within the heads. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.\n=== Release of virions ===\nPhages may be released via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, in a few cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called [[endolysin]], which attacks and breaks down the cell wall [[peptidoglycan]]. An altogether different phage type, the [[filamentous phage]], make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a [[lysogenic]] cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as [[prophage]].\n\n=== Communication ===\nResearch in 2017 revealed that the bacteriophage \u03a63T makes a short viral protein that signals other bacteriophages to lie dormant instead of killing the host bacterium.

Phages are classified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) according to [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and nucleic acid.\n\nNineteen families are currently recognized by the ICTV that infect [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Of these, only two families have RNA genomes, and only five families are surrounded by an envelope. Of the viral families with DNA genomes, only two have single-stranded genomes. Eight of the viral families with DNA genomes have circular genomes, while nine have linear genomes. Nine families infect bacteria only, nine infect archaea only, and one (''Tectiviridae'') infects both bacteria and archaea.\n\n[[File:Bacteriophage P22 Casjens Lenk.png|thumb|right|Bacteriophage P22, a member of the ''[[Podoviridae]]'' by morphology due to its short, non-contractile tail]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ '''ICTV classification of prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) viruses'''<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n|- style=\"background:gray;\"\n!Order !!

With ''lytic phages'' such as the [[T4 phage]], bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. As soon as the cell is destroyed, the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect. Lytic phages are more suitable for [[phage therapy]]. Some lytic phages undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition, where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate phage]] going dormant and usually, is temporary.\n\nIn contrast, the ''[[lysogenic cycle]]'' does not result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as [[temperate phage]]s. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it, relatively harmlessly, or may even become established as a [[plasmid]]. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients, then, the [[endogenous]] phages (known as [[prophage]]s) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is replicated in all offspring of the cell. An example of a bacteriophage known to follow the lysogenic cycle and the lytic cycle is the [[phage lambda]] of ''E. coli.''<ref>Mason, Kenneth A., Jonathan B. Losos, Susan R.

After contacting the appropriate receptor, the tail fibers flex to bring the base plate closer to the surface of the cell. This is known as reversible binding. Once attached completely, irreversible binding is initiated and the tail contracts, possibly with the help of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], present in the tail,<ref name=\"Prescott\" /> injecting genetic material through the bacterial membrane. The injection is accomplished through a sort of bending motion in the shaft by going to the side, contracting closer to the cell and pushing back up.

For RNA-based phages, [[RNA replicase]] is synthesized early in the process. Proteins modify the bacterial [[RNA polymerase]] so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host's normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on to become part of new virions within the cell, helper proteins that contribute to the assemblage of new virions, or proteins involved in cell [[lysis]].

The base plates are assembled first, with the tails being built upon them afterward. The head capsids, constructed separately, will spontaneously assemble with the tails. The DNA is packed efficiently within the heads. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.\n=== Release of virions ===\nPhages may be released via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, in a few cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called [[endolysin]], which attacks and breaks down the cell wall [[peptidoglycan]]. An altogether different phage type, the [[filamentous phage]], make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a [[lysogenic]] cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as [[prophage]].\n\n=== Communication ===\nResearch in 2017 revealed that the bacteriophage \u03a63T makes a short viral protein that signals other bacteriophages to lie dormant instead of killing the host bacterium.

[[Christian Bale]] stars as [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]], alongside [[Michael Caine]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. Eight years after the events of ''The Dark Knight'', merciless revolutionary [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]] forces Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save [[Gotham City]] from nuclear destruction.\n\nChristopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a third film, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 \"[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]\" storyline, the 1986 series ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', and the 1999 storyline \"[[Batman: No Man's Land|No Man's Land]]\". Filming took place from May to November 2011 in locations including [[Jodhpur]], London, [[Nottingham]], Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], and [[Pittsburgh]]. Nolan used [[IMAX]] 70&nbsp;mm film cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture. A vehicle variation of the [[Batplane]] and [[Batcopter]] termed the \"Bat\", an underground prison set, and a new [[Batcave]] set were created specifically for the film. As with ''The Dark Knight'', [[viral marketing]] campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign: developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.\n\n''The Dark Knight Rises'' premiered in [[New York City]] on July 16, 2012. The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. The film received positive reviews, with praise being directed toward the performances, action sequences, screenplay, direction, musical score, and emotional depth, with many critics deeming it a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The consensus at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"ambitious, thoughtful, and potent\". The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the second film in the ''Batman'' film series to earn $1 billion. In addition to being Nolan's highest-grossing film, it became the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved, not the current. Please do NOT adjust!-->seventh-highest-grossing film of all time]], as well as the [[2012 in film|third-highest-grossing film of 2012]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary; if you do, remove something else. -->\nIn [[Uzbekistan]], [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], a mysterious terrorist and former member of the [[League of Shadows]], abducts nuclear physicist Dr. Leonid Pavel from a CIA aircraft.\n\nEight years after the death of District Attorney Harvey Dent, [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Batman]] has disappeared. Organized crime has been eradicated in [[Gotham City]] thanks to the Dent Act giving expanded powers to the police. Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] has kept Dent's murderous rampage as the vigilante [[Two-Face]] a secret and allowed blame for his crimes to fall on Batman. He has prepared a speech to read revealing the truth, but decides not to read it. Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, and [[Wayne Enterprises]] is losing money after Wayne discontinued his fusion reactor project when he learned that it could be weaponized.\n\nBane sets up his base in the city sewers, and prompts Wayne's corporate rival John Daggett to buy Wayne's fingerprints. Cat burglar [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] obtains Wayne's prints from [[Wayne Manor]] for Daggett, but she is double-crossed at the exchange and alerts the police. Gordon and the police arrive and pursue Bane and Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Kyle flees. The henchmen capture Gordon and take him to Bane. Gordon escapes and is found by rookie officer [[Robin in other media#The Dark Knight Rises|John Blake]]. Blake, a fellow orphan who deduced Wayne's secret identity, confronts him and convinces him to return as Batman.\n\nBane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange by using Wayne's fingerprints in a series of transactions that leaves Wayne bankrupt. Batman resurfaces for the first time in eight years while intercepting Bane and his subordinates. Wayne's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], is convinced that Wayne is not strong enough to fight Bane, and resigns in an attempt to save him. Wayne finds comfort in new Wayne Enterprises CEO Miranda Tate, and the two become lovers. Using the stolen transactions, Bane expands his operations and kills Daggett.\n \nKyle agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill [[Ra's al Ghul|Ra's al Ghul's]] mission to destroy Gotham. Batman fights Bane in a lengthy brawl but Bane defeats him, dealing a crippling blow to his back before taking him abroad to an underground prison where escape is virtually impossible. The inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who was born and raised in the prison before escaping \u2014 the only prisoner to have done so.\n\nBane lures Gotham's police into the sewers and uses explosives, trapping them and destroying bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia during a football game and forces Pavel to convert the reactor core into a decaying [[neutron bomb]]. Bane reads Gordon's speech to the crowd, and releases the prisoners of [[Blackgate Penitentiary]], causing anarchy in the city while exiling and killing Gotham's elite in [[kangaroo court]]s presided over by [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]].\n\nMonths later, Wayne escapes from the prison and returns to Gotham. Batman frees the police and they clash with Bane's army in the streets; during the battle, Batman overpowers Bane. Tate intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself as [[Talia al Ghul]], Ra's al Ghul's daughter. She activates the bomb's detonator, but Gordon blocks her signal. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle arrives and kills Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses his aerial craft, the [[Batplane|Bat]], to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. Before takeoff, Batman indirectly reveals his identity to Gordon.\n\nIn the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and honored as a hero. Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage and Wayne's estate is left to Alfred. Gordon finds the [[Bat Signal]] repaired, while [[Lucius Fox]] discovers that Wayne fixed the malfunctioning auto-pilot on the Bat. While vacationing in [[Florence]], Alfred discovers that Bruce is alive and in a relationship with Kyle. Blake resigns from the [[GCPD]] and receives a parcel from Wayne leading him to the [[Batcave]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Please re-arrange the cast according to how the film's poster does, e.g.: Bale, Caine, Oldman, Hathaway, Hardy-->\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<br>A billionaire socialite who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld, as a feared vigilante.

Nolan, feeling that the use of [[film stock]] in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of [[digital cinematography]] and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option.<ref name=\"Traditionalist\"/><ref name=\"filmvsdigital\"/> Nolan explained; \"I wanted to give them a chance to see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [on] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one.\"<ref name=\"Traditionalist\"/>\n\n===Design===\n\n====Costume design====\n[[File:Bane Tom Hardy5.jpg|thumb|upright|A digitally mapped model of Tom Hardy's face and skull was used to design and construct Bane's mask.]]\n[[Costume designer]] [[Lindy Hemming]] explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, \"keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function.\" In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look \"like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places. We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent. His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform.\" Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look \"animalistic\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/><ref name=\"Design2\"/><ref name=\"Design5\"/> Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with [[shearling]].<ref name=\"Design4\"/>\n\nThe [[Batsuit]] consisted of 110 separate pieces, each of which had to be replicated dozens of times over the course of the production. The base layer was made of a [[polyester]] mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Christian Bale. The suit remained unchanged for the film since ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\nIn creating Selina Kyle's catsuit, two layers of material were used, with the outer layer being [[polyurethane]] coated spandex, embossed with a hexagonal pattern. The catsuit also consisted of elbow-length gloves, a utility belt, and thigh-high boots with spike heels.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\n====Production design====\n[[Concept artist]] Tully Summers commented on Nolan's style of [[cinematography]] when asked about the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for ''[[Men in Black 3]]'': \"The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is a war film.\" Producer [[Emma Thomas]] stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that \"it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\"/>\n\nThe film introduces a vehicle that has been compared with the [[Batplane]] and the [[Batcopter]], dubbed \"the Bat\". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to \"fit into the same family\" as the Tumbler and the [[Batpod]]. The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the [[Harrier Jump Jet]], [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]] and the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache]].<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over [[computer-generated imagery]]. In order to make the Bat \"fly\", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/><ref name=\"Design3\"/><ref name=\"Design6\"/>\n\nWhen designing the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon the idea of flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Another set was designed at Cardington as an \"underground prison\", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a {{convert|120|foot|m}} vertical shaft leading to the surface.

[[James Newton Howard]] was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for ''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight'', but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of ''Inception'' would make him seem like a \"third wheel\".<ref name=\"Howard\" /> Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores, but explains that he wanted to go in a \"completely different direction\" for Bane's theme. While the theme accompanying Selina Kyle is deliberately ambiguous, the musical thread spanning throughout the trilogy was composed exclusively for Bruce Wayne.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\nThe film features a prevalent [[Moroccan Arabic|Moroccan]] chant of the phrase ''deshi basara'' (proper transliteration: ''T\u012bj\u012b basara\u2019ah'') ([[Arabic]]: \u062a\u064a\u062c\u064a \u0628\u0633\u0631\u0639\u0629), which translates to \"rise up\" (literally: \"come quickly\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/07/25/hans-zimmer-speaks-on-the-deshi-basara-chant-in-the-dark-knight-rises/28983/ |title=Hans Zimmer Speaks On The \"Deshi Basara\" Chant In \"The Dark Knight Rises\" |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109150657/http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/07/25/hans-zimmer-speaks-on-the-deshi-basara-chant-in-the-dark-knight-rises/28983/ |archivedate=January 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Eisenberg |first=Eric |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Part-Dark-Knight-Rises-Score-By-Recording-Yourself-Chanting-27748.html |title=Be Part of the Dark Knight Rises Score By Recording Yourself Chanting |work=CinemaBlend.com |date=November 4, 2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> In November 2011, Zimmer [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] online audio recordings of the chant to be used in the film's score.<ref name=\"Music1\"/><ref name=\"TDKRChant\"/> When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, \"The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing. We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind.\"<ref name=\"Music2\"/>\n\n==Marketing==\nThe official website launched in May 2011, introducing a viral marketing campaign similar to the one used to promote ''The Dark Knight''. The website streamed an encrypted audio file described by users as chanting. Users decrypted the audio to the Twitter hashtag, \"#TheFireRises\". Warner Bros. removed a pixel from the webpage for every tweet using the hashtag. The website revealed the first official image of Bane.<ref name=\"Marketing1\"/>\n\nIn July 2011, a teaser trailer leaked online before its official release with ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''.<ref name=Davis/> The studio released the teaser three days after the leak. The trailer received mixed responses; Stephen Spencer Davis of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote it successfully built hype,<ref name=Davis /> while Kofi Outlaw of ScreenRant showed disappointment, claiming it was more of an \"announcement trailer\" than an actual teaser trailer. Outlaw criticized the quality, writing that a scene depicting Commissioner Gordon in a hospital bed was overly dramatic, had \"hammy\" dialogue, and was difficult to understand due to Gordon's labored breathing. Outlaw wrote that the sweeping shot of Gotham City had poor CGI and was too reminiscent of the ''Inception'' trailer.<ref name=Outlaw/> The theatrical trailer leaked online, like the teaser trailer, before being released the following week attached to theatrical prints of ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]''.<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer1\"/><ref name=\"Marketing3\"/><ref name=\"Marketing4\"/> Critics noted political undertones with dialogue foreshadowing the theme of [[Economic inequality|income inequality]] and an \"[[Occupy movement|Occupy Gotham]]\" campaign within the world of the story.<ref name=\"Marketing5\"/><ref name=\"Marketing6\"/><ref name=\"Marketing8\"/> Receiving more than 12.5&nbsp;million views in the first 24 hours after its release, the trailer set the record for most combined downloads from [[iTunes]], beating the previous record held by ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"Marketing9\"/> However, the second trailer for ''The Avengers'' again set the record with 13.7&nbsp;million downloads.<ref name=\"NYDailyNews\" /> Warner Bros. attached a second theatrical trailer for ''The Dark Knight Rises'' to theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''. An \"unnamed\" Warner Brothers executive clarified that \"We see this placement as a good strategic decision. We always want our trailers to be seen with films that people want to see\u2014and a lot of people will be going to The Avengers!\" The executive also commented that the trailer will \"provide the best potential exposure for TDKR.\"<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer2\"/> Warner Bros. released the trailer online on April 30, 2012, approximately four days before they attached it to theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer3\"/>\n\nContinuing a method used with ''The Dark Knight'' whereby the opening sequence of the film was attached to IMAX prints of ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' seven months before release,<ref name=TDKopening/> a six-minute prologue of ''The Dark Knight Rises'' was attached to 70mm IMAX prints of ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol]]'', again approximately seven months before release.<ref name=\"6Minutes\"/> Critical reaction to the prologue was positive,<ref name=\"MarketingProlog1\"/><ref name=\"MarketingProlog2\"/><ref name=\"MarketingProlog3\"/> with one critic commenting that \"no one gets to make a film on this kind of scale anymore. Except for Christopher Nolan,\" though a round-up of reviews highlighted the way many critics found Tom Hardy's dialogue very difficult to hear.<ref name=\"MarketingProlog4\"/> Addressing the issue in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Nolan said \"I think when people see the film, things will come into focus. Bane is very complex and very interesting and when people see the finished film people will be very entertained by him.\"<ref name=\"BaneVoice\" />\n\n[[File:Batsignal at Highmark building.jpg|thumb|The [[bat-signal]] projected against the [[Fifth Avenue Place (Pittsburgh)|Fifth Avenue Place]] during filming in [[Pittsburgh]].]]\nViral marketing campaigns for the film continued as magazine companies ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' received \"CIA documents\" concerning a \"Dr. Leonid Pavel\", with its mugshot connected to actor Alon Abutbul. According to the first document, Pavel is a missing Russian [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], while the second document appears to be an edited transcript of a conversation discussing the handover of Dr. Pavel to the CIA by Georgian separatists, but with most of the conversation redacted.<ref name=\"Marketing2\"/> These were later shown to be plot elements of the six-minute prologue.<ref name=\"MarketingProlog1\"/> The official Twitter account later linked to another censored document, this time, referencing \"Operation Early Bird\". A website of the same name was discovered, revealing a countdown timer. When the countdown finished, the site presented a map showing all available theaters that would be screening the film's prologue earlier than its release.<ref name=\"Earlybird\"/><ref name=\"Earlybird2\"/> Various websites received a package that included a cylinder map of \"strike zones\", and a \"fire rises\" [[T-shirt]].<ref name=\"Marketing12\"/> In April 2012, the film's official website was updated with a \"dossier\" on a suspect named \"John Doe\" also known as \"the Batman\" for an arrest, with a list of several accusations. The premise of the campaign starts when the mayor of Gotham City \"redoubles\" the effort to capture Batman and anyone supporting his return in preparation for the upcoming \"Harvey Dent Day\". The site also includes an extensive list of real-world locations where \"graffiti related to movement in support of the vigilante's return\" is located. For each tweet of a specific location marked on the list, a frame of the second theatrical trailer for the film was released on a separate website.<ref name=\"Marketing21\"/>\n\nIn January 2012, six months prior to the film's release, tickets for midnight IMAX showings in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles went on sale and sold out immediately. Purchased tickets surfaced for sale online for over $100, compared with their original price of $17.50.<ref name=\"Marketing10\" />\n\n[[File:2012 British GP - Lotus.jpg|thumb|Formula One team [[Lotus F1]] carried a special livery to promote ''The Dark Knight Rises'' at the [[2012 British Grand Prix]].]]\nAt the [[American International Toy Fair]], [[Mattel]] unveiled figures for Batman, Bane, and Catwoman, and Batman's flying vehicle, the Bat.

We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story.

[[Christian Bale]] stars as [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]], alongside [[Michael Caine]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. Eight years after the events of ''The Dark Knight'', merciless revolutionary [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]] forces Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save [[Gotham City]] from nuclear destruction.\n\nChristopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a third film, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 \"[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]\" storyline, the 1986 series ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', and the 1999 storyline \"[[Batman: No Man's Land|No Man's Land]]\". Filming took place from May to November 2011 in locations including [[Jodhpur]], London, [[Nottingham]], Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], and [[Pittsburgh]]. Nolan used [[IMAX]] 70&nbsp;mm film cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture. A vehicle variation of the [[Batplane]] and [[Batcopter]] termed the \"Bat\", an underground prison set, and a new [[Batcave]] set were created specifically for the film. As with ''The Dark Knight'', [[viral marketing]] campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign: developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.\n\n''The Dark Knight Rises'' premiered in [[New York City]] on July 16, 2012. The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. The film received positive reviews, with praise being directed toward the performances, action sequences, screenplay, direction, musical score, and emotional depth, with many critics deeming it a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The consensus at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"ambitious, thoughtful, and potent\". The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the second film in the ''Batman'' film series to earn $1 billion. In addition to being Nolan's highest-grossing film, it became the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved, not the current. Please do NOT adjust!-->seventh-highest-grossing film of all time]], as well as the [[2012 in film|third-highest-grossing film of 2012]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary; if you do, remove something else. -->\nIn [[Uzbekistan]], [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], a mysterious terrorist and former member of the [[League of Shadows]], abducts nuclear physicist Dr. Leonid Pavel from a CIA aircraft.\n\nEight years after the death of District Attorney Harvey Dent, [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Batman]] has disappeared. Organized crime has been eradicated in [[Gotham City]] thanks to the Dent Act giving expanded powers to the police. Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] has kept Dent's murderous rampage as the vigilante [[Two-Face]] a secret and allowed blame for his crimes to fall on Batman. He has prepared a speech to read revealing the truth, but decides not to read it. Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, and [[Wayne Enterprises]] is losing money after Wayne discontinued his fusion reactor project when he learned that it could be weaponized.\n\nBane sets up his base in the city sewers, and prompts Wayne's corporate rival John Daggett to buy Wayne's fingerprints. Cat burglar [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] obtains Wayne's prints from [[Wayne Manor]] for Daggett, but she is double-crossed at the exchange and alerts the police. Gordon and the police arrive and pursue Bane and Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Kyle flees. The henchmen capture Gordon and take him to Bane. Gordon escapes and is found by rookie officer [[Robin in other media#The Dark Knight Rises|John Blake]]. Blake, a fellow orphan who deduced Wayne's secret identity, confronts him and convinces him to return as Batman.\n\nBane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange by using Wayne's fingerprints in a series of transactions that leaves Wayne bankrupt. Batman resurfaces for the first time in eight years while intercepting Bane and his subordinates. Wayne's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], is convinced that Wayne is not strong enough to fight Bane, and resigns in an attempt to save him. Wayne finds comfort in new Wayne Enterprises CEO Miranda Tate, and the two become lovers. Using the stolen transactions, Bane expands his operations and kills Daggett.\n \nKyle agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill [[Ra's al Ghul|Ra's al Ghul's]] mission to destroy Gotham. Batman fights Bane in a lengthy brawl but Bane defeats him, dealing a crippling blow to his back before taking him abroad to an underground prison where escape is virtually impossible. The inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who was born and raised in the prison before escaping \u2014 the only prisoner to have done so.\n\nBane lures Gotham's police into the sewers and uses explosives, trapping them and destroying bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia during a football game and forces Pavel to convert the reactor core into a decaying [[neutron bomb]]. Bane reads Gordon's speech to the crowd, and releases the prisoners of [[Blackgate Penitentiary]], causing anarchy in the city while exiling and killing Gotham's elite in [[kangaroo court]]s presided over by [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]].\n\nMonths later, Wayne escapes from the prison and returns to Gotham. Batman frees the police and they clash with Bane's army in the streets; during the battle, Batman overpowers Bane. Tate intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself as [[Talia al Ghul]], Ra's al Ghul's daughter. She activates the bomb's detonator, but Gordon blocks her signal. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle arrives and kills Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses his aerial craft, the [[Batplane|Bat]], to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. Before takeoff, Batman indirectly reveals his identity to Gordon.\n\nIn the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and honored as a hero. Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage and Wayne's estate is left to Alfred. Gordon finds the [[Bat Signal]] repaired, while [[Lucius Fox]] discovers that Wayne fixed the malfunctioning auto-pilot on the Bat. While vacationing in [[Florence]], Alfred discovers that Bruce is alive and in a relationship with Kyle. Blake resigns from the [[GCPD]] and receives a parcel from Wayne leading him to the [[Batcave]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Please re-arrange the cast according to how the film's poster does, e.g.: Bale, Caine, Oldman, Hathaway, Hardy-->\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<br>A billionaire socialite who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld, as a feared vigilante. Nolan has stated that, due to the eight-year gap between ''The Dark Knight'' and ''The Dark Knight Rises'', \"he's an older Bruce Wayne; he's not in a great state.\"<ref name=EightYears /> Bale employed a martial arts discipline called the [[Keysi Fighting Method]], now modified for Wayne's current state and Bane's style.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Bale has stated that ''The Dark Knight Rises'' will be his final Batman film.<ref name=\"Inquirer\" /> Bale acknowledged that Batman is \"not a healthy individual, this is somebody that is doing good, but he's right on the verge of doing bad\".<ref name=\"NYDailyNewsWayne\"/> Bale clarifies that \"He doesn't want to forget [his parents' deaths]. He wants to maintain that anger he felt at that injustice\".<ref name=\"NME\"/> Bale felt bittersweet about leaving the franchise, saying that it was like \"saying goodbye to an old friend.\"<ref name=\"ColliderWayne\"/>\n* [[Michael Caine]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]:<ref name=\"Boucher\"/><br>Bruce's trusted butler and confidant, who acts as a father figure to Wayne but is unable to accept Wayne's desire to revive his Batman persona, even resigning from his position to impress the seriousness of his position upon him.

Nolan, feeling that the use of [[film stock]] in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of [[digital cinematography]] and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option.<ref name=\"Traditionalist\"/><ref name=\"filmvsdigital\"/> Nolan explained; \"I wanted to give them a chance to see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [on] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one.\"<ref name=\"Traditionalist\"/>\n\n===Design===\n\n====Costume design====\n[[File:Bane Tom Hardy5.jpg|thumb|upright|A digitally mapped model of Tom Hardy's face and skull was used to design and construct Bane's mask.]]\n[[Costume designer]] [[Lindy Hemming]] explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, \"keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function.\" In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look \"like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places. We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent. His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform.\" Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look \"animalistic\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/><ref name=\"Design2\"/><ref name=\"Design5\"/> Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with [[shearling]].<ref name=\"Design4\"/>\n\nThe [[Batsuit]] consisted of 110 separate pieces, each of which had to be replicated dozens of times over the course of the production. The base layer was made of a [[polyester]] mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Christian Bale. The suit remained unchanged for the film since ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\nIn creating Selina Kyle's catsuit, two layers of material were used, with the outer layer being [[polyurethane]] coated spandex, embossed with a hexagonal pattern. The catsuit also consisted of elbow-length gloves, a utility belt, and thigh-high boots with spike heels.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\n====Production design====\n[[Concept artist]] Tully Summers commented on Nolan's style of [[cinematography]] when asked about the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for ''[[Men in Black 3]]'': \"The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is a war film.\" Producer [[Emma Thomas]] stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that \"it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\"/>\n\nThe film introduces a vehicle that has been compared with the [[Batplane]] and the [[Batcopter]], dubbed \"the Bat\". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to \"fit into the same family\" as the Tumbler and the [[Batpod]]. The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the [[Harrier Jump Jet]], [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]] and the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache]].<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over [[computer-generated imagery]]. In order to make the Bat \"fly\", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/><ref name=\"Design3\"/><ref name=\"Design6\"/>\n\nWhen designing the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon the idea of flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Another set was designed at Cardington as an \"underground prison\", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a {{convert|120|foot|m}} vertical shaft leading to the surface. Exteriors above the prison were filmed in Jodhpur, India, chosen because the \"forbidding landscape added to the desolation\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{main|The Dark Knight Rises (soundtrack)}}\nIn an interview in October 2010, composer [[Hans Zimmer]] confirmed that he would be returning to score ''The Dark Knight Rises.'' [[James Newton Howard]] was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for ''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight'', but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of ''Inception'' would make him seem like a \"third wheel\".<ref name=\"Howard\" /> Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores, but explains that he wanted to go in a \"completely different direction\" for Bane's theme. While the theme accompanying Selina Kyle is deliberately ambiguous, the musical thread spanning throughout the trilogy was composed exclusively for Bruce Wayne.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\nThe film features a prevalent [[Moroccan Arabic|Moroccan]] chant of the phrase ''deshi basara'' (proper transliteration: ''T\u012bj\u012b basara\u2019ah'') ([[Arabic]]: \u062a\u064a\u062c\u064a \u0628\u0633\u0631\u0639\u0629), which translates to \"rise up\" (literally: \"come quickly\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/07/25/hans-zimmer-speaks-on-the-deshi-basara-chant-in-the-dark-knight-rises/28983/ |title=Hans Zimmer Speaks On The \"Deshi Basara\" Chant In \"The Dark Knight Rises\" |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109150657/http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/07/25/hans-zimmer-speaks-on-the-deshi-basara-chant-in-the-dark-knight-rises/28983/ |archivedate=January 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Eisenberg |first=Eric |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Part-Dark-Knight-Rises-Score-By-Recording-Yourself-Chanting-27748.html |title=Be Part of the Dark Knight Rises Score By Recording Yourself Chanting |work=CinemaBlend.com |date=November 4, 2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> In November 2011, Zimmer [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] online audio recordings of the chant to be used in the film's score.<ref name=\"Music1\"/><ref name=\"TDKRChant\"/> When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, \"The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing. We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind.\"<ref name=\"Music2\"/>\n\n==Marketing==\nThe official website launched in May 2011, introducing a viral marketing campaign similar to the one used to promote ''The Dark Knight''. The website streamed an encrypted audio file described by users as chanting. Users decrypted the audio to the Twitter hashtag, \"#TheFireRises\". Warner Bros. removed a pixel from the webpage for every tweet using the hashtag. The website revealed the first official image of Bane.<ref name=\"Marketing1\"/>\n\nIn July 2011, a teaser trailer leaked online before its official release with ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''.<ref name=Davis/> The studio released the teaser three days after the leak. The trailer received mixed responses; Stephen Spencer Davis of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote it successfully built hype,<ref name=Davis /> while Kofi Outlaw of ScreenRant showed disappointment, claiming it was more of an \"announcement trailer\" than an actual teaser trailer. Outlaw criticized the quality, writing that a scene depicting Commissioner Gordon in a hospital bed was overly dramatic, had \"hammy\" dialogue, and was difficult to understand due to Gordon's labored breathing. Outlaw wrote that the sweeping shot of Gotham City had poor CGI and was too reminiscent of the ''Inception'' trailer.<ref name=Outlaw/> The theatrical trailer leaked online, like the teaser trailer, before being released the following week attached to theatrical prints of ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]''.<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer1\"/><ref name=\"Marketing3\"/><ref name=\"Marketing4\"/> Critics noted political undertones with dialogue foreshadowing the theme of [[Economic inequality|income inequality]] and an \"[[Occupy movement|Occupy Gotham]]\" campaign within the world of the story.<ref name=\"Marketing5\"/><ref name=\"Marketing6\"/><ref name=\"Marketing8\"/> Receiving more than 12.5&nbsp;million views in the first 24 hours after its release, the trailer set the record for most combined downloads from [[iTunes]], beating the previous record held by ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"Marketing9\"/> However, the second trailer for ''The Avengers'' again set the record with 13.7&nbsp;million downloads.<ref name=\"NYDailyNews\" /> Warner Bros. attached a second theatrical trailer for ''The Dark Knight Rises'' to theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''. An \"unnamed\" Warner Brothers executive clarified that \"We see this placement as a good strategic decision. We always want our trailers to be seen with films that people want to see\u2014and a lot of people will be going to The Avengers!\" The executive also commented that the trailer will \"provide the best potential exposure for TDKR.\"<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer2\"/> Warner Bros. released the trailer online on April 30, 2012, approximately four days before they attached it to theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer3\"/>\n\nContinuing a method used with ''The Dark Knight'' whereby the opening sequence of the film was attached to IMAX prints of ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' seven months before release,<ref name=TDKopening/> a six-minute prologue of ''The Dark Knight Rises'' was attached to 70mm IMAX prints of ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol]]'', again approximately seven months before release.<ref name=\"6Minutes\"/> Critical reaction to the prologue was positive,<ref name=\"MarketingProlog1\"/><ref name=\"MarketingProlog2\"/><ref name=\"MarketingProlog3\"/> with one critic commenting that \"no one gets to make a film on this kind of scale anymore. Except for Christopher Nolan,\" though a round-up of reviews highlighted the way many critics found Tom Hardy's dialogue very difficult to hear.<ref name=\"MarketingProlog4\"/> Addressing the issue in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Nolan said \"I think when people see the film, things will come into focus. Bane is very complex and very interesting and when people see the finished film people will be very entertained by him.\"<ref name=\"BaneVoice\" />\n\n[[File:Batsignal at Highmark building.jpg|thumb|The [[bat-signal]] projected against the [[Fifth Avenue Place (Pittsburgh)|Fifth Avenue Place]] during filming in [[Pittsburgh]].]]\nViral marketing campaigns for the film continued as magazine companies ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' received \"CIA documents\" concerning a \"Dr. Leonid Pavel\", with its mugshot connected to actor Alon Abutbul. According to the first document, Pavel is a missing Russian [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], while the second document appears to be an edited transcript of a conversation discussing the handover of Dr. Pavel to the CIA by Georgian separatists, but with most of the conversation redacted.<ref name=\"Marketing2\"/> These were later shown to be plot elements of the six-minute prologue.<ref name=\"MarketingProlog1\"/> The official Twitter account later linked to another censored document, this time, referencing \"Operation Early Bird\". A website of the same name was discovered, revealing a countdown timer. When the countdown finished, the site presented a map showing all available theaters that would be screening the film's prologue earlier than its release.<ref name=\"Earlybird\"/><ref name=\"Earlybird2\"/> Various websites received a package that included a cylinder map of \"strike zones\", and a \"fire rises\" [[T-shirt]].<ref name=\"Marketing12\"/> In April 2012, the film's official website was updated with a \"dossier\" on a suspect named \"John Doe\" also known as \"the Batman\" for an arrest, with a list of several accusations. The premise of the campaign starts when the mayor of Gotham City \"redoubles\" the effort to capture Batman and anyone supporting his return in preparation for the upcoming \"Harvey Dent Day\". The site also includes an extensive list of real-world locations where \"graffiti related to movement in support of the vigilante's return\" is located. For each tweet of a specific location marked on the list, a frame of the second theatrical trailer for the film was released on a separate website.<ref name=\"Marketing21\"/>\n\nIn January 2012, six months prior to the film's release, tickets for midnight IMAX showings in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles went on sale and sold out immediately. Purchased tickets surfaced for sale online for over $100, compared with their original price of $17.50.<ref name=\"Marketing10\" />\n\n[[File:2012 British GP - Lotus.jpg|thumb|Formula One team [[Lotus F1]] carried a special livery to promote ''The Dark Knight Rises'' at the [[2012 British Grand Prix]].]]\nAt the [[American International Toy Fair]], [[Mattel]] unveiled figures for Batman, Bane, and Catwoman, and Batman's flying vehicle, the Bat. The Mattel figures were also released in the \"Movie Masters\" line, featuring more highly detailed and articulated presentation, and Quiktek versions that feature interchangeable accessories. [[Lego]] released building sets and mini-figures based on the film and incorporating other DC Comic characters. Additionally, [[Funko]] released a series of [[plush]] toys, [[Mezco Toyz]] released vinyl figures, and [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]] released the Batman Tumbler car.<ref name=\"Marketing11\" /> Other partners include [[Jakks Pacific]], who created novelty and large-scale figures and plush toys,<ref name=\"Marketing13\"/> and PPW Toys, who created a Batman themed [[Mr. Potato Head]].<ref name=\"Marketing14\"/> Various clothing items including shoes, T-shirts, hats and wallets were also produced.<ref name=\"Marketing15\"/>\n\nA video game of the same name was released on the same day as the release of the film for the [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices for promoting the movie. The game features an [[open world]] with primary focus on stealth and combat. The combat system of the game is inspired from [[Batman: Arkham Asylum|Arkham Asylum]] and [[Batman: Arkham City|Arkham City]]. It takes place in Gotham City, with a somewhat similar but still significantly different plot from that of the movie.
