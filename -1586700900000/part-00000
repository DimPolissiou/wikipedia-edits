According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent.<ref name=\":0\" /> The discomfort is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein they try to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | last1 = Festinger | first1 = L. | year = 1962 | title = Cognitive dissonance | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 207 | issue = 4| pages = 93\u2013107 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1062-93| pmid = 13892642 | bibcode = 1962SciAm.207d..93F }}</ref><ref name=\"Festinger, L. 1957\">Festinger, L. (1957). ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance''. California: Stanford University Press.</ref>\n\nIn ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance'' (1957), [[Leon Festinger]] proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency to function mentally in the [[Reality|real world]]. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance. They tend to make changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance or by avoiding circumstances and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance.<ref name=\"Festinger, L. 1957\"/>\n\nCoping with the nuances of contradictory ideas or experiences is mentally stressful. It requires energy and effort to sit with those seemingly opposite things that all seem true. Festinger argued that some people would inevitably resolve dissonance by blindly believing whatever they wanted to believe.\n\n== Relations among cognitions ==\nTo function in the [[reality]] of modern society, human beings continually adjust the correspondence of their mental attitudes and personal actions; such continual adjustments, between cognition and action, result in one of three relationships with reality:<ref name=\" Festinger, L. 1957\"/>\n# Consonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions consistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out to dinner, and ordering water rather than wine)\n# Irrelevant relationship: Two cognitions or actions unrelated to each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out and wearing a shirt)\n# Dissonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions inconsistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, but then drinking more wine)\n\n=== Magnitude of dissonance ===\nThe term \"magnitude of dissonance\" refers to the level of discomfort caused to the person. This can be caused by the relationship between two differing internal beliefs, or an action that is incompatible with the beliefs of the person.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Festinger|first=Leon|date=October 1962|title=Cognitive Dissonance|url=|journal=Scientific American|volume=207|issue=4|pages=93\u2013106|via=JSTOR|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1062-93|pmid=13892642}}</ref> Two factors determine the degree of psychological dissonance caused by two conflicting cognitions or by two conflicting actions:\n\n# The importance of cognitions: the greater the personal value of the elements, the greater the magnitude of the dissonance in the relation. When the value of the importance of the two dissonant items is high, it is difficult to determine which action or thought is correct. Both have had a place of truth, at least subjectively, in the mind of the person. Therefore, when the ideals or actions now clash, it is difficult for the individual to decide which takes priority.\n# Ratio of cognitions: the proportion of dissonant-to-consonant elements. There is a level of discomfort within each person that is acceptable for living. When a person is within that comfort level, the dissonant factors do not interfere with functioning. However, when dissonant factors are abundant and not enough that are in line with each other, we go through a process to regulate and bring the ratio back to an acceptable level. Once a subject chooses to keep one of the dissonant factors, they quickly forget the other to restore peace of mind.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boring|first=E.

To function by that expectation of existential consistency, people continually reduce their cognitive dissonance in order to align their cognitions (perceptions of the world) with their actions.\n\nThe creation and establishment of psychological consistency allows the person afflicted with cognitive dissonance to lessen mental stress by actions that reduce the magnitude of the dissonance, realized either by changing with or by justifying against or by being indifferent to the existential contradiction that is inducing the mental stress.<ref name=\"Festinger, L. 1957\"/> In practice, people reduce the magnitude of their cognitive dissonance in four ways:\n# Change the behavior or the cognition (\"I'll eat no more of this doughnut.\")\n# Justify the behavior or the cognition, by changing the conflicting cognition (\"I'm allowed to cheat my diet every once in a while.\")\n# Justify the behavior or the cognition by adding new behaviors or cognitions (\"I'll spend thirty extra minutes at the gymnasium to work off the doughnut.\")\n# Ignore or deny information that conflicts with existing beliefs (\"This doughnut is not a high-sugar food.\")\n\nThree cognitive biases are components of dissonance theory. The bias that one does not have any biases, the bias that one is \"better, kinder, smarter, more moral and nicer than average\" and [[confirmation bias]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tavris |first1=Carol |authorlink1=Carol Tavris |last2=Aronson |first2=Elliot |authorlink2=Elliot Aronson |title=Why We Believe -- Long After We Shouldn't |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=51\u201353 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/why_we_believe_long_after_we_shouldnt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105182429/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/why_we_believe_long_after_we_shouldnt |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-11-05 |accessdate=5 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThat a consistent psychology is required for functioning in the real world also was indicated in the results of ''The Psychology of Prejudice'' (2006), wherein people facilitate their functioning in the real world by employing human categories (i.e. sex and [[gender]], age and race, etc.) with which they manage their social interactions with other people.\n\nThe study ''Patterns of Cognitive Dissonance-reducing Beliefs Among Smokers: A Longitudinal Analysis from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey'' (2012) indicated that smokers use justification beliefs to reduce their cognitive dissonance about smoking tobacco and the negative consequences of smoking it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libcblog.nl/articles/facing-the-facts-the-cognitive-dissonance-behind-smoking|title=LIBC Blog - Articles - Facing the facts: The cognitive dissonance behind smoking|website=www.libcblog.nl|language=en|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\n# Continuing smokers (Smoking and no attempt to quit since the previous round of study.)\n# Successful quitters (Quit during the study and did not use tobacco from the time of the previous round of study.)\n#Failed quitters (Quit during the study, but relapsed to smoking at the time of the study.)\n\nTo reduce cognitive dissonance, the participant smokers adjusted their beliefs to correspond with their actions:\n\n# Functional beliefs (\"Smoking calms me down when I am stressed or upset.\"; \"Smoking helps me concentrate better.\"; \"Smoking is an important part of my life.\" and \"Smoking makes it easier for me to socialize.\")\n# Risk-minimizing beliefs (\"The medical evidence that smoking is harmful is exaggerated.\"; \"One has to die of something, so why not enjoy yourself and smoke?\" and \"Smoking is no more risky than many other things people do.\")<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Fotuhi|first1=  Omid |first2 = Geoffrey T.|last2=Fong|first3= Mark P.|last3 = Zanna|first4 = Ron|last4 = Borland|first5 = Hua-Hie|last5 = Yong|first6 = K Michael |last6 = Cummings|display-authors = 3|journal = Tobacco Control |date=2013|doi = 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2011-050139|pmid=  22218426 |pmc=  4009366 |title = Patterns of cognitive dissonance-reducing beliefs among smokers: a longitudinal analysis from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey|volume = 22|issue=  1 |pages = 52\u201358}}</ref>\n\n==Paradigms==\nThere are four theoretic paradigms of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people suffer when exposed to information that is inconsistent with their [[belief]]s, [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s or [[Value (ethics)|values]]: Belief Disconfirmation, Induced Compliance, Free Choice, and Effort Justification, which respectively explain what happens after a person acts inconsistently, relative to his or her intellectual perspectives; what happens after a person makes decisions and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested in a given perspective shall\u2014when confronted with contrary evidence\u2014expend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective.\n\n===Belief disconfirmation===\nThe contradiction of a belief, ideal, or system of values causes cognitive dissonance that can be resolved by changing the challenged belief, yet, instead of effecting change, the resultant mental stress restores psychological consonance to the person by misperception, rejection, or refutation of the contradiction, seeking moral support from people who share the contradicted beliefs or acting to persuade other people that the contradiction is unreal.<ref>Harmon-Jones, Eddie, \"A Cognitive Dissonance Theory Perspective on Persuasion\", in ''The Persuasion Handbook: Developments in Theory and Practice'', James Price Dillard, Michael Pfau, Eds. 2002.

At the determined place and time, the cult assembled; they believed that only they would survive planetary destruction; yet the spaceship did not arrive to Earth. The confounded prophecy caused them acute cognitive-dissonance: Had they been victims of a hoax? Had they vainly donated away their material possessions? To resolve the dissonance between apocalyptic, end-of-the-world religious beliefs and earthly, [[Reality|material reality]], most of the cult restored their psychological consonance by choosing to believe a less mentally-stressful idea to explain the missed landing: that the aliens had given planet Earth a second chance at existence, which, in turn, empowered them to re-direct their religious cult to environmentalism and social advocacy to end human damage to planet Earth. On overcoming the confounded belief by changing to global environmentalism, the cult increased in numbers by [[proselytism]].<ref>Festinger, L., Riecken, H.W., Schachter, S.

When he died of a stroke in 1994, instead of accepting that their Rebbe was not the Messiah, some of the congregation proved indifferent to that contradictory fact and continued claiming that [[Chabad messianism#The belief that Schneerson would still be the Messiah after his death|Schneerson was the Messiah]] and that he would soon return from the dead.<ref>Berger, David (2008).

The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor) and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. Subjects of one group were paid twenty dollars ($20); those in a second group were paid one dollar ($1) and those in the control group were not asked to speak with the imposter-subject.<ref name=FestingerCarlsmith1959>{{Cite journal|last=Festinger|first=Leon|last2=Carlsmith|first2=James M.|date=1959|title=Cognitive consequences of forced compliance.|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=58|issue=2|pages=203\u2013210|doi=10.1037/h0041593|pmid=13640824|citeseerx = 10.1.1.497.2779|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1175d871805a45bdbff73c474d1ee457fdcb60bc}}</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did either the subjects in the first group (paid $20) or the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance between the conflicting cognitions. \"I told someone that the task was interesting\" and \"I actually found it boring.\" The subjects paid one dollar were induced to comply, compelled to internalize the \"interesting task\" mental attitude because they had no other justification.

Acharya of Stanford, Blackwell and Sen of Harvard state CD increases when an individual commits an act of violence toward someone from a different ethnic or racial group and decreases when the individual does not commit any such act of violence. Research from Acharya, Blackwell and Sen shows that individuals committing violence against members of another group develop hostile attitudes towards their victims as a way of minimizing CD. Importantly, the hostile attitudes may persist even after the violence itself declines (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015). The application provides a social psychological basis for the constructivist viewpoint that ethnic and racial divisions can be socially or individually constructed, possibly from acts of violence (Fearon and Laitin, 2000). Their framework speaks to this possibility by showing how violent actions by individuals can affect individual attitudes, either ethnic or racial animosity (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015).\n\n=== Consumer behavior<!-- This section is not an application of research, and is questionable regarding ethics --> ===\nThree  main conditions exist for provoking cognitive dissonance when buying: (i) The decision to purchase must be important, such as the sum of money to spend; (ii) The psychological cost; and (iii)  The purchase is personally relevant to the consumer.

Festinger theorized that cognitive dissonance usually arises when a person holds two or more incompatible beliefs simultaneously.<ref name=\"simplypsychology.org\"/> This is a normal occurrence since people encounter different situations that invoke conflicting thought sequences. This conflict results in a psychological discomfort. According to Festinger, people experiencing a thought conflict try to reduce the psychological discomfort by attempting to achieve an emotional equilibrium. This equilibrium is achieved in three main ways. First, the person may downplay the importance of the dissonant thought. Second, the person may attempt to outweigh the dissonant thought with consonant thoughts. Lastly, the person may incorporate the dissonant thought into their current belief system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/communication-theories/sorted-by-cluster/Interpersonal-Communication-and-Relations/cognitive-dissonance-theory/|title=Interpersonal Communication and Relations {{!}} Cognitive Dissonance theory|website=Universiteit Twente|access-date=2019-03-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331104119/https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/communication-theories/sorted-by-cluster/Interpersonal-Communication-and-Relations/cognitive-dissonance-theory/|archivedate=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nDissonance plays an important role in persuasion. To persuade people, you must cause them to experience dissonance, and then offer your proposal as a way to resolve the discomfort.  Although there is no guarantee your audience will change their minds, the theory maintains that without dissonance, there can be no persuasion.  Without a feeling of discomfort, people are not motivated to change.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Communication Theory|last=Infante|first=Dominic A.|publisher=Kendall Hunt|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=157\u2013158}}</ref>\n\n=== Artificial Intelligence ===\nIt is hypothesized that introducing cognitive dissonance into [[machine learning]] may be able to assist in the long-term aim of developing 'creative autonomy' on the part of agents, including in multi-agent systems (such as games),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pasquier|first=Philippe|last2=Chaib-draa|first2=Brahim|date=2005|title=Agent communication pragmatics: the cognitive coherence approach|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|volume=6|issue=4|pages=364\u2013395|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2005.03.002|issn=1389-0417}}</ref> and ultimately to the development of 'strong' forms of artificial intelligence, including [[artificial general intelligence]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jennings|first=Kyle E.|date=2010-10-02|title=Developing Creativity: Artificial Barriers in Artificial Intelligence|journal=Minds and Machines|volume=20|issue=4|pages=489\u2013501|doi=10.1007/s11023-010-9206-y|issn=0924-6495|doi-access=free}}</ref>  \n\n== Alternative paradigms ==\n[[File:Honor\u00e9 Daumier 018.jpg|thumb|150px|Dissonant self-perception: A lawyer can experience cognitive dissonance if he must defend as innocent a client he thinks is guilty.

The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person is in the same position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.<ref name=\"Bem, D. 1967\"/>\n\nAs such, the experimental subjects of the Festinger and Carlsmith study (''Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance'', 1959) inferred their mental attitudes from their own behaviour. When the subject-participants were asked: \"Did you find the task interesting?\", the participants decided that they must have found the task interesting, because that is what they told the questioner.

The psychological process of cost-benefit comparisons helps the person to assess and justify the feasibility (spending money) of an economic decision, and is the basis for determining if the benefit outweighs the cost, and to what extent. Moreover, although the method of cost-benefit analysis functions in economic circumstances, men and women remain psychologically inefficient at comparing the costs against the benefits of their economic decision.<ref name=Dupuit1969>Dupuit, J.

Among the ways for coping, the person can choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent with his or her current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be consonant with a current behavior; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to that course of behavior.\n\nCognitive dissonance produces a state of [[affect (psychology)|negative affect]], which motivates the person to reconsider the causative behavior in order to resolve the psychological inconsistency that caused the mental stress.<ref>(Beckmann and Kuhl, 1984, Harmon-Jones, 1999, Harmon-Jones, 2000a, Jones and Gerard, 1967, McGregor et al., 1999 and Newby-Clark ''et al.'', 2002)</ref> As the afflicted person works towards a behavioral commitment, the motivational process then is activated in the left [[frontal cortex]] of the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Beckmann | first1 = J | last2 = Kuhl | first2 = J | year = 1984 | title = Altering Information to Gain Action Control: Functional Aspects of Human Information Processing in Decision Making | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 224\u2013237 | doi=10.1016/0092-6566(84)90031-x}}</ref><!-- <ref>Harmon-Jones, E., 1999. \u201cToward an Understanding of the Motivation Underlying Dissonance Processes: Is Feeling Personally Responsible for the Production of Aversive Consequences Necessary to Cause Dissonance Effects?\u201d in ''Cognitive Dissonance: Perspectives on a Pivotal Theory in Social Psychology''.

Therefore, the brain is an inference machine that attempts to actively predict and explain its sensations. Crucial to this inference is the minimization of [[predictive coding|prediction error]]. The predictive dissonance account proposes that the motivation for cognitive dissonance reduction is related to an organism's active drive for reducing prediction error. Moreover, it proposes that human (and perhaps other animal) brains have evolved to selectively ignore contradictory information (as proposed by dissonance theory) to prevent the [[overfitting]] of their predictive cognitive models to local and thus non-generalizing conditions. The predictive dissonance account is highly compatible with the action-motivation model since, in practice, prediction error can arise from unsuccessful behavior.\n\n== Neuroscience findings ==\nTechnological advances are allowing psychologists to study the biomechanics of cognitive dissonance.\n\n=== Visualization ===\nThe study ''Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance''<ref name=vanVeenKrug2009>{{Cite journal|last=van Veen|first=Vincent|last2=Krug|first2=Marie K.|last3=Schooler|first3=Jonathan W.|last4=Carter|first4=Cameron S.|date= 2009|title=Neural activity predicts attitude change in cognitive dissonance|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=11|pages=1469\u20131474|doi=10.1038/nn.2413|pmid=19759538| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26817210}}</ref> (Van Veen, Krug, ect, 2009) identified the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm.

(1957). ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance''. California: Stanford University Press.</ref>\n\nIn ''A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance'' (1957), [[Leon Festinger]] proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency to function mentally in the [[Reality|real world]]. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance. They tend to make changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance or by avoiding circumstances and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance.<ref name=\"Festinger, L. 1957\"/>\n\nCoping with the nuances of contradictory ideas or experiences is mentally stressful. It requires energy and effort to sit with those seemingly opposite things that all seem true. Festinger argued that some people would inevitably resolve dissonance by blindly believing whatever they wanted to believe.\n\n== Relations among cognitions ==\nTo function in the [[reality]] of modern society, human beings continually adjust the correspondence of their mental attitudes and personal actions; such continual adjustments, between cognition and action, result in one of three relationships with reality:<ref name=\" Festinger, L. 1957\"/>\n# Consonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions consistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out to dinner, and ordering water rather than wine)\n# Irrelevant relationship: Two cognitions or actions unrelated to each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out and wearing a shirt)\n# Dissonant relationship: Two cognitions or actions inconsistent with each other (e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, but then drinking more wine)\n\n=== Magnitude of dissonance ===\nThe term \"magnitude of dissonance\" refers to the level of discomfort caused to the person. This can be caused by the relationship between two differing internal beliefs, or an action that is incompatible with the beliefs of the person.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Festinger|first=Leon|date=October 1962|title=Cognitive Dissonance|url=|journal=Scientific American|volume=207|issue=4|pages=93\u2013106|via=JSTOR|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1062-93|pmid=13892642}}</ref> Two factors determine the degree of psychological dissonance caused by two conflicting cognitions or by two conflicting actions:\n\n# The importance of cognitions: the greater the personal value of the elements, the greater the magnitude of the dissonance in the relation. When the value of the importance of the two dissonant items is high, it is difficult to determine which action or thought is correct. Both have had a place of truth, at least subjectively, in the mind of the person. Therefore, when the ideals or actions now clash, it is difficult for the individual to decide which takes priority.\n# Ratio of cognitions: the proportion of dissonant-to-consonant elements. There is a level of discomfort within each person that is acceptable for living. When a person is within that comfort level, the dissonant factors do not interfere with functioning. However, when dissonant factors are abundant and not enough that are in line with each other, we go through a process to regulate and bring the ratio back to an acceptable level. Once a subject chooses to keep one of the dissonant factors, they quickly forget the other to restore peace of mind.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boring|first=E.

To function by that expectation of existential consistency, people continually reduce their cognitive dissonance in order to align their cognitions (perceptions of the world) with their actions.\n\nThe creation and establishment of psychological consistency allows the person afflicted with cognitive dissonance to lessen mental stress by actions that reduce the magnitude of the dissonance, realized either by changing with or by justifying against or by being indifferent to the existential contradiction that is inducing the mental stress.<ref name=\"Festinger, L. 1957\"/> In practice, people reduce the magnitude of their cognitive dissonance in four ways:\n# Change the behavior or the cognition (\"I'll eat no more of this doughnut.\")\n# Justify the behavior or the cognition, by changing the conflicting cognition (\"I'm allowed to cheat my diet every once in a while.\")\n# Justify the behavior or the cognition by adding new behaviors or cognitions (\"I'll spend thirty extra minutes at the gymnasium to work off the doughnut.\")\n# Ignore or deny information that conflicts with existing beliefs (\"This doughnut is not a high-sugar food.\")\n\nThree cognitive biases are components of dissonance theory. The bias that one does not have any biases, the bias that one is \"better, kinder, smarter, more moral and nicer than average\" and [[confirmation bias]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tavris |first1=Carol |authorlink1=Carol Tavris |last2=Aronson |first2=Elliot |authorlink2=Elliot Aronson |title=Why We Believe -- Long After We Shouldn't |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=51\u201353 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/why_we_believe_long_after_we_shouldnt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105182429/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/why_we_believe_long_after_we_shouldnt |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-11-05 |accessdate=5 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThat a consistent psychology is required for functioning in the real world also was indicated in the results of ''The Psychology of Prejudice'' (2006), wherein people facilitate their functioning in the real world by employing human categories (i.e. sex and [[gender]], age and race, etc.) with which they manage their social interactions with other people.\n\nThe study ''Patterns of Cognitive Dissonance-reducing Beliefs Among Smokers: A Longitudinal Analysis from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey'' (2012) indicated that smokers use justification beliefs to reduce their cognitive dissonance about smoking tobacco and the negative consequences of smoking it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libcblog.nl/articles/facing-the-facts-the-cognitive-dissonance-behind-smoking|title=LIBC Blog - Articles - Facing the facts: The cognitive dissonance behind smoking|website=www.libcblog.nl|language=en|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\n# Continuing smokers (Smoking and no attempt to quit since the previous round of study.)\n# Successful quitters (Quit during the study and did not use tobacco from the time of the previous round of study.)\n#Failed quitters (Quit during the study, but relapsed to smoking at the time of the study.)\n\nTo reduce cognitive dissonance, the participant smokers adjusted their beliefs to correspond with their actions:\n\n# Functional beliefs (\"Smoking calms me down when I am stressed or upset.\"; \"Smoking helps me concentrate better.\"; \"Smoking is an important part of my life.\" and \"Smoking makes it easier for me to socialize.\")\n# Risk-minimizing beliefs (\"The medical evidence that smoking is harmful is exaggerated.\"; \"One has to die of something, so why not enjoy yourself and smoke?\" and \"Smoking is no more risky than many other things people do.\")<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Fotuhi|first1=  Omid |first2 = Geoffrey T.|last2=Fong|first3= Mark P.|last3 = Zanna|first4 = Ron|last4 = Borland|first5 = Hua-Hie|last5 = Yong|first6 = K Michael |last6 = Cummings|display-authors = 3|journal = Tobacco Control |date=2013|doi = 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2011-050139|pmid=  22218426 |pmc=  4009366 |title = Patterns of cognitive dissonance-reducing beliefs among smokers: a longitudinal analysis from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey|volume = 22|issue=  1 |pages = 52\u201358}}</ref>\n\n==Paradigms==\nThere are four theoretic paradigms of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people suffer when exposed to information that is inconsistent with their [[belief]]s, [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s or [[Value (ethics)|values]]: Belief Disconfirmation, Induced Compliance, Free Choice, and Effort Justification, which respectively explain what happens after a person acts inconsistently, relative to his or her intellectual perspectives; what happens after a person makes decisions and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal.

At the determined place and time, the cult assembled; they believed that only they would survive planetary destruction; yet the spaceship did not arrive to Earth. The confounded prophecy caused them acute cognitive-dissonance: Had they been victims of a hoax? Had they vainly donated away their material possessions? To resolve the dissonance between apocalyptic, end-of-the-world religious beliefs and earthly, [[Reality|material reality]], most of the cult restored their psychological consonance by choosing to believe a less mentally-stressful idea to explain the missed landing: that the aliens had given planet Earth a second chance at existence, which, in turn, empowered them to re-direct their religious cult to environmentalism and social advocacy to end human damage to planet Earth. On overcoming the confounded belief by changing to global environmentalism, the cult increased in numbers by [[proselytism]].<ref>Festinger, L., Riecken, H.W., Schachter, S.

The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance between the conflicting cognitions. \"I told someone that the task was interesting\" and \"I actually found it boring.\" The subjects paid one dollar were induced to comply, compelled to internalize the \"interesting task\" mental attitude because they had no other justification.

Acharya of Stanford, Blackwell and Sen of Harvard state CD increases when an individual commits an act of violence toward someone from a different ethnic or racial group and decreases when the individual does not commit any such act of violence. Research from Acharya, Blackwell and Sen shows that individuals committing violence against members of another group develop hostile attitudes towards their victims as a way of minimizing CD. Importantly, the hostile attitudes may persist even after the violence itself declines (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015). The application provides a social psychological basis for the constructivist viewpoint that ethnic and racial divisions can be socially or individually constructed, possibly from acts of violence (Fearon and Laitin, 2000). Their framework speaks to this possibility by showing how violent actions by individuals can affect individual attitudes, either ethnic or racial animosity (Acharya, Blackwell, Sen 2015).\n\n=== Consumer behavior<!-- This section is not an application of research, and is questionable regarding ethics --> ===\nThree  main conditions exist for provoking cognitive dissonance when buying: (i) The decision to purchase must be important, such as the sum of money to spend; (ii) The psychological cost; and (iii)  The purchase is personally relevant to the consumer.

Festinger theorized that cognitive dissonance usually arises when a person holds two or more incompatible beliefs simultaneously.<ref name=\"simplypsychology.org\"/> This is a normal occurrence since people encounter different situations that invoke conflicting thought sequences. This conflict results in a psychological discomfort. According to Festinger, people experiencing a thought conflict try to reduce the psychological discomfort by attempting to achieve an emotional equilibrium. This equilibrium is achieved in three main ways. First, the person may downplay the importance of the dissonant thought. Second, the person may attempt to outweigh the dissonant thought with consonant thoughts. Lastly, the person may incorporate the dissonant thought into their current belief system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/communication-theories/sorted-by-cluster/Interpersonal-Communication-and-Relations/cognitive-dissonance-theory/|title=Interpersonal Communication and Relations {{!}} Cognitive Dissonance theory|website=Universiteit Twente|access-date=2019-03-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331104119/https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/communication-theories/sorted-by-cluster/Interpersonal-Communication-and-Relations/cognitive-dissonance-theory/|archivedate=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nDissonance plays an important role in persuasion. To persuade people, you must cause them to experience dissonance, and then offer your proposal as a way to resolve the discomfort.  Although there is no guarantee your audience will change their minds, the theory maintains that without dissonance, there can be no persuasion.  Without a feeling of discomfort, people are not motivated to change.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Communication Theory|last=Infante|first=Dominic A.|publisher=Kendall Hunt|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=157\u2013158}}</ref>\n\n=== Artificial Intelligence ===\nIt is hypothesized that introducing cognitive dissonance into [[machine learning]] may be able to assist in the long-term aim of developing 'creative autonomy' on the part of agents, including in multi-agent systems (such as games),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pasquier|first=Philippe|last2=Chaib-draa|first2=Brahim|date=2005|title=Agent communication pragmatics: the cognitive coherence approach|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|volume=6|issue=4|pages=364\u2013395|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2005.03.002|issn=1389-0417}}</ref> and ultimately to the development of 'strong' forms of artificial intelligence, including [[artificial general intelligence]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jennings|first=Kyle E.|date=2010-10-02|title=Developing Creativity: Artificial Barriers in Artificial Intelligence|journal=Minds and Machines|volume=20|issue=4|pages=489\u2013501|doi=10.1007/s11023-010-9206-y|issn=0924-6495|doi-access=free}}</ref>  \n\n== Alternative paradigms ==\n[[File:Honor\u00e9 Daumier 018.jpg|thumb|150px|Dissonant self-perception: A lawyer can experience cognitive dissonance if he must defend as innocent a client he thinks is guilty.

The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person is in the same position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer his or her inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.<ref name=\"Bem, D. 1967\"/>\n\nAs such, the experimental subjects of the Festinger and Carlsmith study (''Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance'', 1959) inferred their mental attitudes from their own behaviour. When the subject-participants were asked: \"Did you find the task interesting?\", the participants decided that they must have found the task interesting, because that is what they told the questioner. Their replies suggested that the participants who were paid twenty dollars had an external incentive to adopt that positive attitude, and likely perceived the twenty dollars as the reason for saying the task was interesting, rather than saying the task actually was interesting.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bem | first1 = D.J. | year = 1965 | title = An Experimental Analysis of Self-persuasion|doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(65)90026-0 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 199\u2013218 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bem, D. 1967\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bem | first1 = D.J. | year = 1967 | title = Self-perception: An Alternative Interpretation of Cognitive Dissonance Phenomena | url = http://dbem.ws/SP%20Theory%20Cognitive%20Dissonance.pdf | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 183\u2013200 | doi = 10.1037/h0024835 | pmid = 5342882 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.323.833 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101122174353/http://dbem.ws/SP%20Theory%20Cognitive%20Dissonance.pdf | archive-date = 2010-11-22 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe theory of self-perception (Bem) and the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger) make identical predictions, but only the theory of cognitive dissonance predicts the presence of unpleasant [[arousal]], of psychological distress, which were verified in laboratory experiments.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zanna | first1 = M. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = J. | year = 1974 | title = Dissonance and the Pill: An Attribution Approach to Studying the Arousal Properties of Dissonance | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 703\u2013709 | doi=10.1037/h0036651| pmid = 4833431 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kiesler | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Pallak | first2 = M.S. | year = 1976 | title = Arousal Properties of Dissonance Manipulations | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 83 | issue = 6| pages = 1014\u20131025 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.83.6.1014| pmid = 996211 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective''<ref name=\"Aronson, E. 1969 pp. 1\u201334\"/> (Aronson, Berkowitz, 1969), [[Elliot Aronson]] linked cognitive dissonance to the [[self-concept]]: That mental stress arises when the conflicts among cognitions threatens the person's positive self-image.

The psychological process of cost-benefit comparisons helps the person to assess and justify the feasibility (spending money) of an economic decision, and is the basis for determining if the benefit outweighs the cost, and to what extent. Moreover, although the method of cost-benefit analysis functions in economic circumstances, men and women remain psychologically inefficient at comparing the costs against the benefits of their economic decision.<ref name=Dupuit1969>Dupuit, J.

Therefore, the brain is an inference machine that attempts to actively predict and explain its sensations. Crucial to this inference is the minimization of [[predictive coding|prediction error]]. The predictive dissonance account proposes that the motivation for cognitive dissonance reduction is related to an organism's active drive for reducing prediction error. Moreover, it proposes that human (and perhaps other animal) brains have evolved to selectively ignore contradictory information (as proposed by dissonance theory) to prevent the [[overfitting]] of their predictive cognitive models to local and thus non-generalizing conditions. The predictive dissonance account is highly compatible with the action-motivation model since, in practice, prediction error can arise from unsuccessful behavior.\n\n== Neuroscience findings ==\nTechnological advances are allowing psychologists to study the biomechanics of cognitive dissonance.\n\n=== Visualization ===\nThe study ''Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance''<ref name=vanVeenKrug2009>{{Cite journal|last=van Veen|first=Vincent|last2=Krug|first2=Marie K.|last3=Schooler|first3=Jonathan W.|last4=Carter|first4=Cameron S.|date= 2009|title=Neural activity predicts attitude change in cognitive dissonance|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=11|pages=1469\u20131474|doi=10.1038/nn.2413|pmid=19759538| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26817210}}</ref> (Van Veen, Krug, ect, 2009) identified the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm.

That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and ''Schadenfreude'' (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the [[insular lobe]], and with increased activity in the [[Striatum|striate nucleus]]; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of [[empathy]] (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).<ref name=JankowskiTakahashi2014/>\n\n'''<big>Modeling in neural networks</big>'''\n\n[[Artificial neural network]] models of cognition provide methods for integrating the results of empirical research about cognitive dissonance and attitudes into a single model that explains the formation of psychological attitudes and the mechanisms to change such attitudes.<ref name=\"read1997\">{{cite journal | last1 = Read | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Vanman | first2 = E.J. | last3 = Miller | first3 = L.C. | year = 1997 | title = Connectionism, Parallel Constraint Satisfaction Processes, and Gestalt Principles: (Re)Introducing Cognitive Dynamics to Social Psychology | doi = 10.1207/s15327957pspr0101_3 | pmid = 15647127 | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 26\u201353 }}</ref> Among the artificial neural-network models that predict how cognitive dissonance might influence a person's attitudes and behavior, are:\n\n* [[Parallel constraint satisfaction processes]]<ref name=\"read1997\"/>\n* The [[Metacognition|meta-cognitive model]] (MCM) of attitudes<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Petty | first1 = R.E. | last2 = Bri\u00f1ol | first2 = P. | last3 = DeMarree | first3 = K.G. | year = 2007 | title = The Meta-Cognitive Model (MCM) of attitudes: Implications for attitude measurement, change, and strength | doi = 10.1521/soco.2007.25.5.657 | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 657\u2013686 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5429159aa8e5dfadbed135abd235d79125c67dba }}</ref>\n* Adaptive connectionist model of cognitive dissonance<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van Overwalle | first1 = F. | last2 = Jordens | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = An adaptive connectionist model of cognitive dissonance | doi = 10.1207/S15327957PSPR0603_6 | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 204\u2013231 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.15.2085 }}</ref>\n* Attitudes as constraint satisfaction model<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Monroe | first1 = B.M. | last2 = Read | first2 = S.J. | year = 2008 | title = A general connectionist model of attitude structure and change: The ACS (Attitudes as Constraint Satisfaction) Model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 115 | issue = 3| pages = 733\u2013759 | pmid = 18729597 | doi=10.1037/0033-295X.115.3.733}}</ref>\n\n=== Contradictions to the theory ===\nBecause cognitive dissonance is a relatively new theory, there are some that are skeptical of the idea.

{"title_page": "Minor Sherlock Holmes characters", "text_new": "{{Use British English|date=December 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2011}}\nThis article features minor characters from the ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' stories by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], and from non-canonical derived works.\n\n== Inspector Baynes ==\n'''Inspector Baynes''' of the [[Surrey]] force appears in the two-part story \"[[The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge]]\", subtitled (i) \"The Singular Experience of Mr John Scott Eccles\", and (ii) \"The Tiger of San Pedro\". He is the only official policeman in the books to have ever matched Sherlock Holmes in his investigative skills. In this story, the reader finds that despite working along different lines, they both arrive at the correct conclusion and solve the case at the same time. In fact, Baynes had misled even Holmes as he used a method similar to one that Holmes often used when he arrested the wrong man and provided inaccurate information to the press in order to lull the true criminal into a false sense of security. Holmes congratulated this inspector and believed that he would go far.\n\nA version of Inspector Baynes appears in the video game ''[[The Testament of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2012),  in which Baynes is employed by [[Scotland Yard]]. In the Japanese puppetry television series ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2014 TV series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2014\u20132015), Baynes is a pupil of [[Beeton School]] as well as Holmes and has a strong sense of rivalry against him. Baynes speaks in a precocious manner and provokes Holmes to find the truth of the disappearance of two pupils, Garcia and Henderson. After that, he provokes Holmes again by posting a message using the [[stick figure]]s of dancing men in the school. [[Y\u014dsuke Asari]] voices him.\n\n== Billy ==\n'''Billy''' is Holmes's young page, appearing in the stories ''[[The Valley of Fear]]'', \"[[The Problem of Thor Bridge]]\" and \"[[The Mazarin Stone]]\". In the latter, he plays a significant role in helping to arrest the lead villain. He is a more significant character in [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes#Sherlock Holmes on stage|all three of Doyle's plays]] featuring Sherlock Holmes, ''[[Sherlock Holmes (play)|Sherlock Holmes; A Drama in Four Acts]]'', ''The Stonor Case'' and ''The Crown Diamond'', and in the spoof ''The Painful Predicament of Sherlock Holmes'' written by [[William Gillette]]. In 1903 [[Charlie Chaplin]] began his career by playing Billy on stage<ref>{{cite book |author=Dick Riley |author2=Pam McAllister |title=The Bedside, Bathtub & Armchair Companion to Sherlock Holmes |url=https://archive.org/details/bedsidebathtubar00dick_0 |url-access=registration |year=1998 |publisher=Continuum |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bedsidebathtubar00dick_0/page/60 60] |isbn=0826411169 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Vincent Starrett]] |title=[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (book)|The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]] |year=1993 |publisher=Otto Penzler Books |pages=142 |isbn=9781883402051 }}</ref> in both the four-act play and Gillette's spoof.\n\nBilly has appeared in the films ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1916 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1916), ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1922 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1922), ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1932 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (film)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1939). In the episode of the TV series ''[[Sherlock (TV Series)|Sherlock]]'' entitled \"The Abominable Bride\", Billy makes an appearance played by Adam Greaves-Neal, who previously played an original character named [[List of Sherlock characters|Archie]] in \"The Sign of Three\" (though presumably Archie drew some inspiration from Billy).\n\n== Inspector Bradstreet ==\n'''Inspector Bradstreet''' is a detective who appears in three short stories: \"[[The Man with the Twisted Lip]]\", \"[[The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle]]\" and \"[[The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb]]\". Doyle described him as \"a tall, stout official... in a peaked cap and [[Frog (fastening)|frogged]] jacket\". [[Sidney Paget]]'s illustrations for the ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' depict him with a full beard. Beyond this little is revealed about him in the [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|canon]].\n\nBradstreet originally served in Scotland Yard's E Division which associates him with the [[Bow Street Runners]], a forerunner of Scotland Yard. He claims to have been in the force since 1862 (\"The Man with the Twisted Lip\") but in June 1889 [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Dr Watson]] writes he is in B Division to oversee \"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\". According to Sherlockian author Jack Tracy, B Division was \"one of the twenty-two administrative divisions of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police Force]]. Its 5.17 square miles include parts of [[south Kensington]] and the south-western section of {{sic|?|[[City and Liberties of Westminster|West-minister]]}}\".<ref>Tracy, Jack. \"The Encyclopaedia Sherlockiana\" 1977 Doubleday & Co.</ref>\n\nIn \"The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb\", he accompanied Holmes to Eyford, a village in Berkshire. According to Jack Tracy's ''The Encyclopaedia Sherlockiana'', he was \"assigned most likely to the central headquarters staff.\" Bradstreet is not a [[martinet]]; in \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\" he could have prosecuted the false beggar, but chose to overlook this action to spare Neville St Clair the trauma of shaming his wife and children.\n\nHe is also featured in [[M. J. Trow]]'s series ''[[M. J. Trow#'Inspector Lestrade' books, based on the character from the Sherlock Holmes stories.|The Adventures of Inspector Lestrade]]''.\n\n[[Herbert Rawlinson]] played Bradstreet in a radio adaptation of \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\" (1946) in ''[[The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dickerson|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Dickerson|title=Sherlock Holmes and His Adventures on American Radio|publisher=BearManor Media|year=2019||page=200|isbn=978-1629335087}}</ref> He was played by [[Ronald Baddiley]] in the 1959 BBC radio dramatisation of \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\", and by [[Victor Brooks (actor)|Victor Brooks]] in the 1965 BBC radio adaptation of the same story.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Waal|first=Ronald Burt|title=The World Bibliography of Sherlock Holmes|year=1974|publisher=Bramhall House|pages=386, 402|isbn=0-517-217597}}</ref> Bradstreet appears four times in [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'': \"The Blue Carbuncle\", \"[[The Man with the Twisted Lip]]\", \"[[The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans]]\" (substituting for [[Inspector Lestrade]], as [[Colin Jeavons]] was unavailable), and a cameo appearance in \"[[The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone]]\". Initially he was played by Brian Miller as a blustering, pompous plodder, then later as much more competent by [[Denis Lill]]. In the [[List of BBC Radio Sherlock Holmes dramatisations|BBC Radio Sherlock Holmes]] series, Bradstreet was played by David Goudge in two episodes in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/2ef20f3c589348368dc5ef289e42d73a|website=BBC Genome: Radio Times|title=The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: The Blue Carbuncle|date=2020|publisher=BBC|access-date=30 March 2020}} See also \"The Engineer's Thumb\".</ref>\n\n== Inspector Gregson ==\n'''Inspector Tobias Gregson''', a [[Scotland Yard]] inspector, was first introduced in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' (1887), and he subsequently appears in \"[[The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter]]\" (1893), \"[[The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge]]\" (1908) and \"[[The Adventure of the Red Circle]]\" (1911). Holmes declares him to be \"the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\" but given Holmes' opinion of the Scotland Yard detectives, this is not sweeping praise. In one of the stories Watson specifically mentions the callous and cool way in which Gregson behaved.\n \nGregson first appears in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' and is a polar opposite of another Yarder Doyle created, [[Inspector Lestrade]]. Lestrade and Gregson are such visual opposites, it indicates the barrier Doyle drew between them to emphasise their professional animosity. Gregson is tall, \"tow-headed\" (fair-haired) in contrast to the shorter Lestrade's dark \"ferretlike\" (narrow) features and has \"fat, square hands\".\n\nOf all the Yarders, Gregson comes the closest to meeting [[Sherlock Holmes]] on intellectual grounds, while acknowledging Holmes's abilities. He even admits to Holmes that he always feels more confident when he has Holmes's aid in a case. Regrettably, he is bound within the confines of the law he serves, and the delay in getting his assistance turns to tragedy in \"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\". He also has some regrettable human flaws. During ''A Study in Scarlet'' he publicly laughs at Lestrade's incorrect assumptions, even though he is also on the wrong trail.\n\nUnlike Lestrade, Gregson overlooks the little grey areas of the law, and in \"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\" overlooks Holmes's breaking of a window in order to enter a premises. The life of [[Mycroft Holmes]]'s fellow lodger is saved by this minor criminal act.\n\nGregson last appears in Doyle's \"The Adventure of the Red Circle\" in events that happen in 1902 but are not published by [[Dr Watson]] until 1911. In this story, Watson observes that:\n<blockquote>Our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence, but never in that of courage. Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this desperate murderer with the same absolutely quiet and businesslike bearing with which he would have ascended the official staircase of Scotland Yard. The Pinkerton man had tried to push past him, but Gregson had firmly elbowed him back.

She normally stays behind at 221B Baker Street, but accompanies Hound and Watson on a few cases, usually any that involve something related to flight, and is shown to be a very skilled driver, pilot, and marksman. She is once kidnapped by Professor Moriarty and his henchmen as a part of a scheme to defeat Hound, though Moriarty vows to never involve her in his schemes after she shows him kindness during the time she's kept as a hostage.

King's series of novels focusing on the detective scholar [[Mary Russell (character)|Mary Russell]].  In this alternative extension of the Holmes mythology, the retired Holmes marries his much younger apprentice and partner.  Russell and Holmes meet after the traumatic death of her family in California when she moves to the farm adjoining Holmes' Sussex home.  Mrs. Hudson takes the young and emotionally fragile Russell under her wing, and Russell comes to think of her as a friend, a second mother, and a rock in the whirl of danger that always surrounds Holmes. The novel ''[[The Murder of Mary Russell]]'' tells Mrs. Hudson's biography over several generations, her meeting and bond with Holmes, and her ties to Russell. The novel appeared after the development of Mrs. Hudson's character in the BBC series [[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]. As in that rendition of the character, Mrs. Hudson has a criminal past and initially met Holmes in unsavory circumstances, in this case when she murdered her father to save Holmes' life.  Holmes buys the Baker St. house for Hudson and establishes her as his landlady.  In typical Holmesian logic, this relieves him of the tedium of homeownership and explains both her forbearance with her tenant and his uncharacteristic affection for her. A skilled actress and con artist, she is comfortable with the criminals who inhabit his world and enjoys playing occasional roles in investigations in which an eminently respectable older woman might be needed. In this series, she is slightly older than Holmes (although Russell and Watson think she is significantly older), born in Scotland, raised in Australia, and an immigrant to England. She acted as a mother surrogate to Billy Mudd, Holmes' first 'Irregular', has one sister who lived to adulthood, and one illegitimate child of her own. Holmes states explicitly that the condition of her remaining in England and their relationship is that Hudson's life prior to the murder is never to be mentioned, that they must never have a sexual or romantic relationship, and that she know that her history as a criminal and murderer will always be present in his mind whenever they interact. To Holmes, Hudson represents a way of solving the ethical problem of what to do with someone who murders to prevent harm, but who may return to criminal activity. His manipulation of Hudson removes Hudson and Mudd from lives as criminals, keeps Hudson's infant from the workhouse, and provides Holmes with a housekeeper and intelligent ally.\n\nIn ''[[Sherlock Holmes' War of the Worlds]]'' (1975) it is suggested that Holmes and the younger Mrs. Hudson had a long-lasting love relationship, obvious to all but the naive Watson.\n\nMrs Hudson is the detective in the novels ''Mrs Hudson and the Spirits' Curse'' (2002),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-425-19845-2 |title=Mrs. Hudson and the Spirits' Curse |date=2004-11-08 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> ''Mrs Hudson and the Malabar Rose'' (2005),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-425-20282-1 |title=Mrs Hudson and the Malabar Rose |date=2005-08-01 |website=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> ''Mrs Hudson and the Lazarus Testament'' (2015), and ''Mrs Hudson and the Samarkand Conspiracy'' (2020) by [[Martin Davies (writer)|Martin Davies]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs. Hudson Series|url=https://www.goodreads.com/series/62509-mrs-hudson|website=Goodreads|date=2020|accessdate=27 February 2020}}</ref> and in Barry S.

She is first introduced in ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'', where she and Watson tentatively become attracted to each other, but only when the case is resolved is he able to propose to her. She is described as blonde with pale skin. At the time she hires Holmes she had been making a living as a [[governess]]. Although at the end of the story the main treasure is lost, she has received six pearls from a [[Chaplet (prayer)|chaplet]] of the [[Agra]] Treasure.\n\nHer father, Captain Arthur Morstan, was a senior captain of an Indian regiment and later stationed near the [[Andaman Islands]]. He disappeared in 1878 under mysterious circumstances that would later be proven to be related to the mystery, ''The Sign of the Four''. Her mother died soon after her birth and she had no other relatives in England, although she was educated there (in accordance with the received wisdom of the time about children in the colony of India) until the age of seventeen. Shortly afterwards her father disappeared and she found work as a governess. Watson and Mary marry in 1889.\n\nMary Morstan is mentioned in passing in \"[[The Adventure of the Crooked Man]]\" and \"[[The Boscombe Valley Mystery]]\", but by the time of \"[[The Adventure of the Norwood Builder]]\" (after Holmes's return) Mary Morstan has died and Watson has returned to his former lodgings in Baker Street.

His character has however been expanded on or fleshed out elsewhere. \n\nIn [[William S. Baring-Gould]]'s biography of Sherlock Holmes, ''[[Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street]]'', it is claimed that Pike is a college acquaintance of Holmes who encourages a young Holmes to try his hand at acting. Here his real name is given as 'Lord Peter'. In [[Peter Ling]]'s radio play for the [[BBC Radio]] series, Pike's real name is said to be Clarence Gable.

Though Watson is rather scathing about Pike, Holmes is more sympathetic towards him, suggesting that Pike is isolated, much like Holmes himself. \n\nIn the American television series ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]],'' Pike appears in the first episode of the second season as one of Holmes' sources in London; details are not seen as Pike moves quickly when delivering a package to Watson.<ref>{{cite web|title=Entertainment Weekly.

He appears in ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'' and is described by Watson as an \"ugly long haired, lop-eared creature, half [[spaniel]] and half [[lurcher]], brown and white in colour, with a very clumsy waddling gait.\" Though used by Holmes, the dog belongs to Mr. Sherman who keeps a menagerie of creatures at No. 3 Pinchin Lane in [[Lambeth]], in London. Toby lives at No. 7 within his house. Holmes states he would \"rather have Toby's help than that of the whole detective force in London\" and requests the dog by name. Holmes uses a different tracking dog while in Cambridge in \"[[The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter]]\".\n\nToby also featured in the 1978 pastische novel ''[[Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula|Sherlock Holmes vs Dracula; or, The Adventures of the Sanguinary Count]]'' by [[Loren D.

He is frequently used by Basil, the eponymous protagonist, as a means of transport and to pick up trails. Toby appears in the video game ''[[The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Serrated Scalpel]]'' (1992) and its sequel ''[[The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Rose Tattoo]]'' (1996). In the video game ''[[The Testament of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2012) and some of the other games in the ''[[Sherlock Holmes (video game series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' video game series, a Basset Hound version of Toby is briefly controlled by the player.\n\nIn the NHK puppetry television series ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2014 TV series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2014\u20132015), Toby is kept by Sherman in a [[shed]] in [[Beeton School]] and assists Holmes in his investigation.

In the video game ''[[Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments]]'' (2014), Wiggins plays a significant role in the last case of the game.\n\n==Non-canonical==\nSome fictional characters associated with Sherlock Holmes are not part of the Conan Doyle canon and were created by other writers.\n\n===Auguste Lupa===\n[[Auguste Lupa]] is  the son of Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler. He appears in two [[pastiche]] novels by author [[John Lescroart]], ''Son of Holmes'' (1986) and ''Rasputin's Revenge'' (1987). Lupa, a secret agent during the First World War, is strongly implied to be the younger version of fictional detective [[Nero Wolfe]] in the mystery series by [[Rex Stout]].\n\n===Enola Holmes===\n[[Enola Holmes]] is the younger sister and youngest sibling of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes. She appears in the series ''[[The Enola Holmes Mysteries]]'' by [[Nancy Springer]] and it could be inferred that she appears in the story ''[[The Copper Beeches]]'' as Violet Hunter, however there is not enough evidence to support the idea. Enola is a very independent and rebellious girl who likes to wear trousers while riding her bike. She becomes a Perditorian, or finder of lost things, when her mother runs away with the gypsies and her brothers try to send her to boarding school. Using her natural cunning which seems to be inherited by every member of the Holmes family, she creates multiple disguises on her quest to be reunited with her mother and evade her brothers.\n\n===Eurus Holmes===\n{{see also|List of Sherlock characters#Eurus Holmes}}\n\nA third Holmes sibling appears as a reference by Mycroft in the BBC ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' series, in the third-season episode \"[[His Last Vow]]\". At the end of the [[The Six Thatchers|first episode of the fourth season]], Mycroft requests to be put through to \"Sherrinford\" (see below).\n\nIn the [[The Lying Detective|second episode of the fourth season]], it was confirmed that Mycroft and Sherlock in fact have a sister named Eurus. She had posed as Faith Smith, the daughter of serial killer Culverton Smith and gave Sherlock a piece of paper which led him to the belief that Culverton Smith was a serial killer. Eurus had also posed as a woman on the bus who John Watson met and later texted, wanting to further their relationship. She also posed as John Watson's therapist and then later revealed herself to be Eurus Holmes, and at the end of the episode shoots John Watson with a handgun.\n\nIn the last episode, \"[[The Final Problem (Sherlock)|The Final Problem]]\", it is revealed that Sherrinford is in fact a high-security complex on an island to house some of the most dangerous criminals in the world, including Eurus. With Eurus having simply shot John with a tranquiliser dart, Sherlock and John stage a scenario where Mycroft will admit Eurus' existence. Mycroft explains that Eurus was the youngest child, eight years younger than Mycroft and one year younger than Sherlock, possessing a transcendent intellect that gave her the potential to be the equivalent of Newton in her era, but she was twisted by her inability to comprehend human feeling, once slicing at her arm to see her own muscles and having to ask the meaning of 'pain'.\n\nAfter a traumatic experience where she was involved in (or perpetrated) the disappearance and death of Sherlock's best friend, and then burned down the family home, she was confined as a child in a mental institution by her uncle, who took charge of her care. The traumatized young Sherlock reinvented his friend in memory as his dog, to lessen the emotional pain, and successfully repressed any memory of her or his childhood friend well into his adult life.\n\nLater, Mycroft assumed responsibility for Eurus, and arranged for her death to be faked to their parents, and for Eurus to be incarcerated in a highly secure prison facility. Despite her incarceration, Mycroft occasionally consulted Eurus for her insight into potential national threats, apparently predicting the dates of three major attempted terrorist attacks on Britain after an hour on Twitter, in exchange for 'favours', including five minutes of unsupervised conversation with Jim Moriarty.\n\nHaving taken subtle control of her prison through her skills at manipulating others, Eurus traps Sherlock, John, and Mycroft in a game which culminates in her ordering Sherlock to shoot either John or Mycroft, only to resort to tranquilising all three of them when Sherlock threatens to shoot himself instead. \n\nAt the conclusion of the episode Eurus has trapped John in the deep well where Eurus left her first victim to drown. Under pressure Sherlock deduces that a childish song she gave as the only 'clue' to what she had done to his disappeared friend was actually a coded message that invited Sherlock to Eurus' room, allowing Sherlock to save his friend by making a genuinely emotional appeal to Eurus, giving her the love of an older brother and a form of relationship he had denied her as a child, which convinces her to stand down. She is returned to incarceration, with Mycroft describing her as reduced to a catatonic state, although she responds in duet when Sherlock plays the violin near her cell.\n\n===Mary Russell===\n{{main|Mary Russell  (character)}}\nMary Russell is a fictional character in a book series by [[Laurie R. King]], focusing on the adventures of Russell and her mentor and, later, husband, an aging Sherlock Holmes.\n\n===Morland Holmes===\n'''Morland Holmes''' is the influential businessman and father of Sherlock and Mycroft, interpreted by [[John Noble]] in the TV adaptation ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]''. According to Sherlock, Morland Holmes doesn't care about his sons, and only does what he does out of a sense of familial obligations. Sherlock says he is a serial absentee, and that he has been so since Sherlock was a boy. He sent Sherlock to boarding school when he was eight years old.\n\n===Raffles Holmes===\n'''Raffles Holmes''', the son of [[Sherlock Holmes]], is a fictional character in the 1906 collection of short stories ''Raffles Holmes and Company'' by [[John Kendrick Bangs]]. He is described as the son of [[Sherlock Holmes]] by Marjorie Raffles, the daughter of gentleman thief [[A.J. Raffles]].\n\n[[Wold Newton family]] theorist [[Win Scott Eckert]] devised an explanation in his ''Original Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Chron4.htm|title=The Original Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology Part IV|website=www.pjfarmer.com}}</ref> to reconcile the existence of Raffles Holmes with canonical information about Sherlock Holmes and A.J. Raffles, which fellow Wold Newton speculator Brad Mengel incorporated into his essay \"Watching the Detectives.\" According to the theory, Holmes married Marjorie in 1883, and she died giving birth to Raffles later that year. Since Raffles and Holmes are contemporaries, it has been suggested that Marjorie was actually Raffles' sister.\n\nEckert further proposed in his ''Crossover Chronology'' that (1) Raffles Holmes was the same character as the \"lovely, lost son\" of Sherlock Holmes referred to in Laurie R. King's Mary Russell novels,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Chron6.htm|title=The Original Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology Part VI|website=www.pjfarmer.com}}</ref> and (2) Raffles Holmes was the father of Creighton Holmes, who is featured in the collection of short stories ''The Adventures of Creighton Holmes'' by Ned Hubbell.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Chron7.htm|title=The Original Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology Part VII|website=www.pjfarmer.com}}</ref>\n\nMengel's online essay was revised for publication in the [[Win Scott Eckert|Eckert]]-edited ''Myths for the Modern Age: Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's Wold Newton Universe'' ([[MonkeyBrain Books]], 2005), a collection of Wold Newton essays by Farmer and several other \"post-Farmerian\" contributors, authorised by Farmer as an extension of his Wold Newton mythos. He does not appear or is ever mentioned in any of the original stories of Sherlock Holmes and is not a creation of Doyle.\n\n===Sherrinford Holmes===\n'''Sherrinford Holmes''' is a proposed elder brother of [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Mycroft Holmes]]. His name is taken from early notes as one of those considered by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] for his detective hero before settling on \"Sherlock Holmes\".<ref name= \"names\">{{cite news |last=Honan |first=William H. |author-link=William H.

If Mycroft were the eldest, he could not play the role he does in four stories of the Sherlock Holmes [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|canon]], so Sherrinford frees them both.  This position is strengthened by the fact that Mycroft's general position as a senior civil servant was a common choice among the younger sons of the gentry.\n\nThe character (as \"Sherringford\") appears along with his brothers in the [[Virgin New Adventures]] [[Doctor Who]] novel ''[[All-Consuming Fire]]'' by [[Andy Lane]], where he is revealed to be the member of a cult worshiping an alien telepathic slug that is mutating him and his followers into an insect-like form; the novel culminates with Holmes being forced to shoot his brother to save Watson.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burt|first=Katyl|title=Sherlock Season 4: Who Are Sherrinford, Eurus, and Redbeard?|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/sherlock/261198/sherlock-season-4-who-are-sherrinford-eurus-and-redbeard|website=[[Den of Geek]]|date=January 15, 2017|accessdate=December 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe also appears, accused of a murder that Sherlock must find him innocent of, in the [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]] [[roleplaying game]] adventure ''The Yorkshire Horrors''.<ref>''[[Cthulhu by Gaslight]]'', Chaosium, 1986  http://www.yog-sothoth.com/cocdbdetail.php?ID=21{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Sherrinford also appears in the Italian comic series ''Storie da Altrove'' (a spin-off of ''[[Martin Myst\u00e8re]]'') as the eldest brother, born nine years before him, of Sherlock himself.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=Carlo Recagno |artist=Cesare Colombi |letterer=Monica Husler |story=La cosa che attende nella nebbia |title=Storie da Altrove |issue=2 |date=November 1999 |publisher=[[Sergio Bonelli Editore]] |location=[[Milan]] |page=46}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic |writer=Carlo Recagno |artist=Giuseppe Palumbo |letterer=Marina Sanfelice |story=L'ombra che sfid\u00f2 Sherlock Holmes |title=Storie da Altrove |issue=3 |date=November 2000 |publisher=[[Sergio Bonelli Editore]] |location=[[Milan]] |page=164}}</ref>\n\n===Sigerson Holmes===\nThe film ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]'' has as its protagonist Sigerson Holmes who Sherlock (a minor character) identifies as a brother of himself and Mycroft.\nThe name \"Sigerson\" is an alias mentioned in passing in a Conan Doyle story as an alias Sherlock used while posing as an explorer.\n\n===Amelia Watson===\nShe is the second wife of Dr. John Watson whose adventures are chronicled in a series of short stories and novels by [[Michael Mallory]]. Amelia Watson is based upon the enigmatic reference to Watson's having left Holmes in 1902 for a wife, which appears in the canonical story ''[[The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier]]'', though the woman in the story is never named or identified, nor mentioned again in the canon.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of detectives, constables, and agents in Sherlock Holmes]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Sherlock Holmes books}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sherlock Holmes minor characters}}\n[[Category:Sherlock Holmes characters| ]]\n[[Category:Sherlock Holmes lists|characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of minor fictional characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=December 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2011}}\nThis article features minor characters from the ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' stories by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], and from non-canonical derived works.\n\n== Inspector Baynes ==\n'''Inspector Baynes''' of the [[Surrey]] force appears in the two-part story \"[[The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge]]\", subtitled (i) \"The Singular Experience of Mr John Scott Eccles\", and (ii) \"The Tiger of San Pedro\". He is the only official policeman in the books to have ever matched Sherlock Holmes in his investigative skills. In this story, the reader finds that despite working along different lines, they both arrive at the correct conclusion and solve the case at the same time. In fact, Baynes had misled even Holmes as he used a method similar to one that Holmes often used when he arrested the wrong man and provided inaccurate information to the press in order to lull the true criminal into a false sense of security. Holmes congratulated this inspector and believed that he would go far.\n\nA version of Inspector Baynes appears in the the video game ''[[The Testament of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2012),  in which Baynes is employed by [[Scotland Yard]]. In the Japanese puppetry television series ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2014 TV series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2014\u20132015), Baynes is a pupil of [[Beeton School]] as well as Holmes and has a strong sense of rivalry against him. Baynes speaks in a precocious manner and provokes Holmes to find the truth of the disappearance of two pupils, Garcia and Henderson. After that, he provokes Holmes again by posting a message using the [[stick figure]]s of dancing men in the school. [[Y\u014dsuke Asari]] voices him.\n\n== Billy ==\n'''Billy''' is Holmes's young page, appearing in the stories ''[[The Valley of Fear]]'', \"[[The Problem of Thor Bridge]]\" and \"[[The Mazarin Stone]]\". In the latter, he plays a significant role in helping to arrest the lead villain. He is a more significant character in [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes#Sherlock Holmes on stage|all three of Doyle's plays]] featuring Sherlock Holmes, ''[[Sherlock Holmes (play)|Sherlock Holmes; A Drama in Four Acts]]'', ''The Stonor Case'' and ''The Crown Diamond'', and in the spoof ''The Painful Predicament of Sherlock Holmes'' written by [[William Gillette]]. In 1903 [[Charlie Chaplin]] began his career by playing Billy on stage<ref>{{cite book |author=Dick Riley |author2=Pam McAllister |title=The Bedside, Bathtub & Armchair Companion to Sherlock Holmes |url=https://archive.org/details/bedsidebathtubar00dick_0 |url-access=registration |year=1998 |publisher=Continuum |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bedsidebathtubar00dick_0/page/60 60] |isbn=0826411169 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[Vincent Starrett]] |title=[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (book)|The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]] |year=1993 |publisher=Otto Penzler Books |pages=142 |isbn=9781883402051 }}</ref> in both the four-act play and Gillette's spoof.\n\nBilly has appeared in the films ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1916 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1916), ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1922 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1922), ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1932 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (film)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1939). In the episode of the TV series ''[[Sherlock (TV Series)|Sherlock]]'' entitled \"The Abominable Bride\", Billy makes an appearance played by Adam Greaves-Neal, who previously played an original character named [[List of Sherlock characters|Archie]] in \"The Sign of Three\" (though presumably Archie drew some inspiration from Billy).\n\n== Inspector Bradstreet ==\n'''Inspector Bradstreet''' is a detective who appears in three short stories: \"[[The Man with the Twisted Lip]]\", \"[[The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle]]\" and \"[[The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb]]\". Doyle described him as \"a tall, stout official... in a peaked cap and [[Frog (fastening)|frogged]] jacket\". [[Sidney Paget]]'s illustrations for the ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' depict him with a full beard. Beyond this little is revealed about him in the [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|canon]].\n\nBradstreet originally served in Scotland Yard's E Division which associates him with the [[Bow Street Runners]], a forerunner of Scotland Yard. He claims to have been in the force since 1862 (\"The Man with the Twisted Lip\") but in June 1889 [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Dr Watson]] writes he is in B Division to oversee \"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\". According to Sherlockian author Jack Tracy, B Division was \"one of the twenty-two administrative divisions of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police Force]]. Its 5.17 square miles include parts of [[south Kensington]] and the south-western section of {{sic|?|[[City and Liberties of Westminster|West-minister]]}}\".<ref>Tracy, Jack. \"The Encyclopaedia Sherlockiana\" 1977 Doubleday & Co.</ref>\n\nIn \"The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb\", he accompanied Holmes to Eyford, a village in Berkshire. According to Jack Tracy's ''The Encyclopaedia Sherlockiana'', he was \"assigned most likely to the central headquarters staff.\" Bradstreet is not a [[martinet]]; in \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\" he could have prosecuted the false beggar, but chose to overlook this action to spare Neville St Clair the trauma of shaming his wife and children.\n\nHe is also featured in [[M. J. Trow]]'s series ''[[M. J. Trow#'Inspector Lestrade' books, based on the character from the Sherlock Holmes stories.|The Adventures of Inspector Lestrade]]''.\n\n[[Herbert Rawlinson]] played Bradstreet in a radio adaptation of \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\" (1946) in ''[[The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dickerson|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Dickerson|title=Sherlock Holmes and His Adventures on American Radio|publisher=BearManor Media|year=2019||page=200|isbn=978-1629335087}}</ref> He was played by [[Ronald Baddiley]] in the 1959 BBC radio dramatisation of \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\", and by [[Victor Brooks (actor)|Victor Brooks]] in the 1965 BBC radio adaptation of the same story.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Waal|first=Ronald Burt|title=The World Bibliography of Sherlock Holmes|year=1974|publisher=Bramhall House|pages=386, 402|isbn=0-517-217597}}</ref> Bradstreet appears four times in [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'': \"The Blue Carbuncle\", \"[[The Man with the Twisted Lip]]\", \"[[The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans]]\" (substituting for [[Inspector Lestrade]], as [[Colin Jeavons]] was unavailable), and a cameo appearance in \"[[The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone]]\". Initially he was played by Brian Miller as a blustering, pompous plodder, then later as much more competent by [[Denis Lill]]. In the [[List of BBC Radio Sherlock Holmes dramatisations|BBC Radio Sherlock Holmes]] series, Bradstreet was played by David Goudge in two episodes in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/2ef20f3c589348368dc5ef289e42d73a|website=BBC Genome: Radio Times|title=The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: The Blue Carbuncle|date=2020|publisher=BBC|access-date=30 March 2020}} See also \"The Engineer's Thumb\".</ref>\n\n== Inspector Gregson ==\n'''Inspector Tobias Gregson''', a [[Scotland Yard]] inspector, was first introduced in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' (1887), and he subsequently appears in \"[[The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter]]\" (1893), \"[[The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge]]\" (1908) and \"[[The Adventure of the Red Circle]]\" (1911). Holmes declares him to be \"the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\" but given Holmes' opinion of the Scotland Yard detectives, this is not sweeping praise. In one of the stories Watson specifically mentions the callous and cool way in which Gregson behaved.\n \nGregson first appears in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' and is a polar opposite of another Yarder Doyle created, [[Inspector Lestrade]]. Lestrade and Gregson are such visual opposites, it indicates the barrier Doyle drew between them to emphasise their professional animosity. Gregson is tall, \"tow-headed\" (fair-haired) in contrast to the shorter Lestrade's dark \"ferretlike\" (narrow) features and has \"fat, square hands\".\n\nOf all the Yarders, Gregson comes the closest to meeting [[Sherlock Holmes]] on intellectual grounds, while acknowledging Holmes's abilities. He even admits to Holmes that he always feels more confident when he has Holmes's aid in a case. Regrettably, he is bound within the confines of the law he serves, and the delay in getting his assistance turns to tragedy in \"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\". He also has some regrettable human flaws. During ''A Study in Scarlet'' he publicly laughs at Lestrade's incorrect assumptions, even though he is also on the wrong trail.\n\nUnlike Lestrade, Gregson overlooks the little grey areas of the law, and in \"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\" overlooks Holmes's breaking of a window in order to enter a premises. The life of [[Mycroft Holmes]]'s fellow lodger is saved by this minor criminal act.\n\nGregson last appears in Doyle's \"The Adventure of the Red Circle\" in events that happen in 1902 but are not published by [[Dr Watson]] until 1911. In this story, Watson observes that:\n<blockquote>Our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence, but never in that of courage. Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this desperate murderer with the same absolutely quiet and businesslike bearing with which he would have ascended the official staircase of Scotland Yard.

I have no doubt that the house might have been purchased at the price which Holmes paid for his rooms during the years that I was with him.\n\nThe landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to interfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem.

She normally stays behind at 221B Baker Street, but accompanies Hound and Watson on a few cases, usually any that involve something related to flight, and is shown to be a very skilled driver, pilot, and marksman. She is once kidnapped by Professor Moriarty and his henchmen as a part of a scheme to defeat Hound, though Moriarty vows to never involve her in his schemes after she shows him kindness during the time she's kept as a hostage.

King's series of novels focusing on the detective scholar [[Mary Russell (character)|Mary Russell]].  In this alternative extension of the Holmes mythology, the retired Holmes marries his much younger apprentice and partner.  Russell and Holmes meet after the traumatic death of her family in California when she moves to the farm adjoining Holmes' Sussex home.  Mrs. Hudson takes the young and emotionally fragile Russell under her wing, and Russell comes to think of her as a friend, a second mother, and a rock in the whirl of danger that always surrounds Holmes. The novel ''[[The Murder of Mary Russell]]'' tells Mrs. Hudson's biography over several generations, her meeting and bond with Holmes, and her ties to Russell. The novel appeared after the development of Mrs. Hudson's character in the BBC series [[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]. As in that rendition of the character, Mrs. Hudson has a criminal past and initially met Holmes in unsavory circumstances, in this case when she murdered her father to save Holmes' life.  Holmes buys the Baker St. house for Hudson and establishes her as his landlady.  In typical Holmesian logic, this relieves him of the tedium of homeownership and explains both her forbearance with her tenant and his uncharacteristic affection for her. A skilled actress and con artist, she is comfortable with the criminals who inhabit his world and enjoys playing occasional roles in investigations in which an eminently respectable older woman might be needed. In this series, she is slightly older than Holmes (although Russell and Watson think she is significantly older), born in Scotland, raised in Australia, and an immigrant to England. She acted as a mother surrogate to Billy Mudd, Holmes' first 'Irregular', has one sister who lived to adulthood, and one illegitimate child of her own. Holmes states explicitly that the condition of her remaining in England and their relationship is that Hudson's life prior to the murder is never to be mentioned, that they must never have a sexual or romantic relationship, and that she know that her history as a criminal and murderer will always be present in his mind whenever they interact. To Holmes, Hudson represents a way of solving the ethical problem of what to do with someone who murders to prevent harm, but who may return to criminal activity. His manipulation of Hudson removes Hudson and Mudd from lives as criminals, keeps Hudson's infant from the workhouse, and provides Holmes with a housekeeper and intelligent ally.\n\nIn ''[[Sherlock Holmes' War of the Worlds]]'' (1975) it is suggested that Holmes and the younger Mrs. Hudson had a long-lasting love relationship, obvious to all but the naive Watson.\n\nMrs Hudson is the detective in the novels ''Mrs Hudson and the Spirits' Curse'' (2002),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-425-19845-2 |title=Mrs. Hudson and the Spirits' Curse |date=2004-11-08 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> ''Mrs Hudson and the Malabar Rose'' (2005),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-425-20282-1 |title=Mrs Hudson and the Malabar Rose |date=2005-08-01 |website=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> ''Mrs Hudson and the Lazarus Testament'' (2015), and ''Mrs Hudson and the Samarkand Conspiracy'' (2020) by [[Martin Davies (writer)|Martin Davies]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs. Hudson Series|url=https://www.goodreads.com/series/62509-mrs-hudson|website=Goodreads|date=2020|accessdate=27 February 2020}}</ref> and in Barry S.

She is first introduced in ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'', where she and Watson tentatively become attracted to each other, but only when the case is resolved is he able to propose to her. She is described as blonde with pale skin. At the time she hires Holmes she had been making a living as a [[governess]]. Although at the end of the story the main treasure is lost, she has received six pearls from a [[Chaplet (prayer)|chaplet]] of the [[Agra]] Treasure.\n\nHer father, Captain Arthur Morstan, was a senior captain of an Indian regiment and later stationed near the [[Andaman Islands]]. He disappeared in 1878 under mysterious circumstances that would later be proven to be related to the mystery, ''The Sign of the Four''. Her mother died soon after her birth and she had no other relatives in England, although she was educated there (in accordance with the received wisdom of the time about children in the colony of India) until the age of seventeen. Shortly afterwards her father disappeared and she found work as a governess. Watson and Mary marry in 1889.\n\nMary Morstan is mentioned in passing in \"[[The Adventure of the Crooked Man]]\" and \"[[The Boscombe Valley Mystery]]\", but by the time of \"[[The Adventure of the Norwood Builder]]\" (after Holmes's return) Mary Morstan has died and Watson has returned to his former lodgings in Baker Street.

His character has however been expanded on or fleshed out elsewhere. \n\nIn [[William S. Baring-Gould]]'s biography of Sherlock Holmes, ''[[Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street]]'', it is claimed that Pike is a college acquaintance of Holmes who encourages a young Holmes to try his hand at acting. Here his real name is given as 'Lord Peter'. In [[Peter Ling]]'s radio play for the [[BBC Radio]] series, Pike's real name is said to be Clarence Gable.

Though Watson is rather scathing about Pike, Holmes is more sympathetic towards him, suggesting that Pike is isolated, much like Holmes himself. \n\nIn the American television series ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]],'' Pike appears in the first episode of the second season as one of Holmes' sources in London; details are not seen as Pike moves quickly when delivering a package to Watson.<ref>{{cite web|title=Entertainment Weekly.

He appears in ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'' and is described by Watson as an \"ugly long haired, lop-eared creature, half [[spaniel]] and half [[lurcher]], brown and white in colour, with a very clumsy waddling gait.\" Though used by Holmes, the dog belongs to Mr. Sherman who keeps a menagerie of creatures at No. 3 Pinchin Lane in [[Lambeth]], in London. Toby lives at No. 7 within his house. Holmes states he would \"rather have Toby's help than that of the whole detective force in London\" and requests the dog by name. Holmes uses a different tracking dog while in Cambridge in \"[[The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter]]\".\n\nToby also featured in the 1978 pastische novel ''[[Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula|Sherlock Holmes vs Dracula; or, The Adventures of the Sanguinary Count]]'' by [[Loren D.

He is frequently used by Basil, the eponymous protagonist, as a means of transport and to pick up trails. Toby appears in the video game ''[[The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Serrated Scalpel]]'' (1992) and its sequel ''[[The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Rose Tattoo]]'' (1996). In the video game ''[[The Testament of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2012) and some of the other games in the ''[[Sherlock Holmes (video game series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' video game series, a Basset Hound version of Toby is briefly controlled by the player.\n\nIn the NHK puppetry television series ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2014 TV series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2014\u20132015), Toby is kept by Sherman in a [[shed]] in [[Beeton School]] and assists Holmes in his investigation.

Though being a pupil of [[Beeton School#Houses and uniform|Baker House]], she does not live in the house, but in the shed with animals. In the BBC series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', in the first episode of the fourth season titled \"[[The Six Thatchers]]\", Sherlock Holmes requires the services of a bloodhound named Toby.\n\n==Wiggins==\n'''Wiggins''' is a street urchin in London and head of the [[Baker Street Irregulars]]. He has no first name in the stories. He appears in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' (1887) and ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'' (1890).\n\nWiggins was voiced on BBC radio by Paul Taylor in the 1959 serial ''The Sign of Four'',<ref>{{cite book|last=De Waal|first=Ronald Burt|title=The World Bibliography of Sherlock Holmes|year=1974|publisher=Bramhall House|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldbibliograph00dewa/page/384 384]|ISBN=0-517-217597|url=https://archive.org/details/worldbibliograph00dewa/page/384}}</ref> by David Valla in the 1962 BBC radio dramatisation of \"A Study in Scarlet\", and by [[Glyn Dearman]] in \"The Sign of the Four\" (1963).<ref>{{cite book|last=De Waal|first=Ronald Burt|title=The World Bibliography of Sherlock Holmes|year=1974|publisher=Bramhall House|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldbibliograph00dewa/page/390 390]|ISBN=0-517-217597|url=https://archive.org/details/worldbibliograph00dewa/page/390}}</ref> In the 1965 musical ''[[Baker Street (musical)|Baker Street]]'', Wiggins was portrayed by [[Teddy Green]].

He delivers a note to [[Mycroft Holmes]] (played by [[Christopher Lee]]) and receives instructions concerning various items. Wiggins was played by [[Jay Simpson (actor)|Jay Simpson]] in the 1983 television series ''[[The Baker Street Boys]]''. Courtney Roper-Knight portrayed Wiggins in the 1987 television film \"The Sign of Four\", part of the Granada Television series ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1984 TV series)|Sherlock Holmes]]''.<ref>{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7990c39b|title=The Sign of Four (1987)|website=BFI|publisher=British Film Institute|date=2020|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> In the 1988 film ''[[Without a Clue]]'', Wiggins was played by Matthew Savage. The 1989\u20131991 animated television series ''[[Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century]]'' features a version of the character also named Wiggins, voiced by Viv Leacock.\n\nWiggins appears in the video game ''[[The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Serrated Scalpel]]'' (1992) and was played by Corey Miller in the version of the game released in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Serrated Scalpel - Panasonic 3DO - Manual|url=https://www.gamesdatabase.org/Media/SYSTEM/Panasonic_3DO//Manual/formated/Lost_Files_of_Sherlock_Holmes-_The_Case_of_the_Serrated_Scalpel_-_1994_-_Electronic_Arts.pdf|website=Games Database|date=1994|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Wiggins returns in the sequel ''[[The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Rose Tattoo]]'' (1996), voiced by Paul Vincent Black.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: Case of the Rose Tattoo - Manual|url=https://www.mocagh.org/ea/rosetattoo-manual.pdf|website=Museum of Computer Adventure Game History|accessdate=11 April 2020|date=1996}}</ref> The character, credited as \"Bill Wiggins\", also appears in the series three finale of ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' portrayed by [[Tom Brooke]] as a drug user who actually demonstrates the beginning of Sherlock's deductive skills, and later appoints himself a \"pupil\" of Sherlock's. In the video game ''[[Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments]]'' (2014), Wiggins plays a significant role in the last case of the game.\n\n==Non-canonical==\nSome fictional characters associated with Sherlock Holmes are not part of the Conan Doyle canon and were created by other writers.\n\n===Auguste Lupa===\n[[Auguste Lupa]] is  the son of Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler. He appears in two [[pastiche]] novels by author [[John Lescroart]], ''Son of Holmes'' (1986) and ''Rasputin's Revenge'' (1987). Lupa, a secret agent during the First World War, is strongly implied to be the younger version of fictional detective [[Nero Wolfe]] in the mystery series by [[Rex Stout]].\n\n===Enola Holmes===\n[[Enola Holmes]] is the younger sister and youngest sibling of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes. She appears in the series ''[[The Enola Holmes Mysteries]]'' by [[Nancy Springer]] and it could be inferred that she appears in the story ''[[The Copper Beeches]]'' as Violet Hunter, however there is not enough evidence to support the idea. Enola is a very independent and rebellious girl who likes to wear trousers while riding her bike. She becomes a Perditorian, or finder of lost things, when her mother runs away with the gypsies and her brothers try to send her to boarding school. Using her natural cunning which seems to be inherited by every member of the Holmes family, she creates multiple disguises on her quest to be reunited with her mother and evade her brothers.\n\n===Eurus Holmes===\n{{see also|List of Sherlock characters#Eurus Holmes}}\n\nA third Holmes sibling appears as a reference by Mycroft in the BBC ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' series, in the third-season episode \"[[His Last Vow]]\". At the end of the [[The Six Thatchers|first episode of the fourth season]], Mycroft requests to be put through to \"Sherrinford\" (see below).\n\nIn the [[The Lying Detective|second episode of the fourth season]], it was confirmed that Mycroft and Sherlock in fact have a sister named Eurus. She had posed as Faith Smith, the daughter of serial killer Culverton Smith and gave Sherlock a piece of paper which led him to the belief that Culverton Smith was a serial killer. Eurus had also posed as a woman on the bus who John Watson met and later texted, wanting to further their relationship. She also posed as John Watson's therapist and then later revealed herself to be Eurus Holmes, and at the end of the episode shoots John Watson with a handgun.\n\nIn the last episode, \"[[The Final Problem (Sherlock)|The Final Problem]]\", it is revealed that Sherrinford is in fact a high-security complex on an island to house some of the most dangerous criminals in the world, including Eurus. With Eurus having simply shot John with a tranquiliser dart, Sherlock and John stage a scenario where Mycroft will admit Eurus' existence. Mycroft explains that Eurus was the youngest child, eight years younger than Mycroft and one year younger than Sherlock, possessing a transcendent intellect that gave her the potential to be the equivalent of Newton in her era, but she was twisted by her inability to comprehend human feeling, once slicing at her arm to see her own muscles and having to ask the meaning of 'pain'.\n\nAfter a traumatic experience where she was involved in (or perpetrated) the disappearance and death of Sherlock's best friend, and then burned down the family home, she was confined as a child in a mental institution by her uncle, who took charge of her care. The traumatized young Sherlock reinvented his friend in memory as his dog, to lessen the emotional pain, and successfully repressed any memory of her or his childhood friend well into his adult life.\n\nLater, Mycroft assumed responsibility for Eurus, and arranged for her death to be faked to their parents, and for Eurus to be incarcerated in a highly secure prison facility. Despite her incarceration, Mycroft occasionally consulted Eurus for her insight into potential national threats, apparently predicting the dates of three major attempted terrorist attacks on Britain after an hour on Twitter, in exchange for 'favours', including five minutes of unsupervised conversation with Jim Moriarty.\n\nHaving taken subtle control of her prison through her skills at manipulating others, Eurus traps Sherlock, John, and Mycroft in a game which culminates in her ordering Sherlock to shoot either John or Mycroft, only to resort to tranquilising all three of them when Sherlock threatens to shoot himself instead. \n\nAt the conclusion of the episode Eurus has trapped John in the deep well where Eurus left her first victim to drown. Under pressure Sherlock deduces that a childish song she gave as the only 'clue' to what she had done to his disappeared friend was actually a coded message that invited Sherlock to Eurus' room, allowing Sherlock to save his friend by making a genuinely emotional appeal to Eurus, giving her the love of an older brother and a form of relationship he had denied her as a child, which convinces her to stand down. She is returned to incarceration, with Mycroft describing her as reduced to a catatonic state, although she responds in duet when Sherlock plays the violin near her cell.\n\n===Mary Russell===\n{{main|Mary Russell  (character)}}\nMary Russell is a fictional character in a book series by [[Laurie R. King]], focusing on the adventures of Russell and her mentor and, later, husband, an aging Sherlock Holmes.\n\n===Morland Holmes===\n'''Morland Holmes''' is the influential businessman and father of Sherlock and Mycroft, interpreted by [[John Noble]] in the TV adaptation ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]''. According to Sherlock, Morland Holmes doesn't care about his sons, and only does what he does out of a sense of familial obligations. Sherlock says he is a serial absentee, and that he has been so since Sherlock was a boy. He sent Sherlock to boarding school when he was eight years old.\n\n===Raffles Holmes===\n'''Raffles Holmes''', the son of [[Sherlock Holmes]], is a fictional character in the 1906 collection of short stories ''Raffles Holmes and Company'' by [[John Kendrick Bangs]]. He is described as the son of [[Sherlock Holmes]] by Marjorie Raffles, the daughter of gentleman thief [[A.J. Raffles]].\n\n[[Wold Newton family]] theorist [[Win Scott Eckert]] devised an explanation in his ''Original Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Chron4.htm|title=The Original Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology Part IV|website=www.pjfarmer.com}}</ref> to reconcile the existence of Raffles Holmes with canonical information about Sherlock Holmes and A.J. Raffles, which fellow Wold Newton speculator Brad Mengel incorporated into his essay \"Watching the Detectives.\" According to the theory, Holmes married Marjorie in 1883, and she died giving birth to Raffles later that year. Since Raffles and Holmes are contemporaries, it has been suggested that Marjorie was actually Raffles' sister.\n\nEckert further proposed in his ''Crossover Chronology'' that (1) Raffles Holmes was the same character as the \"lovely, lost son\" of Sherlock Holmes referred to in Laurie R. King's Mary Russell novels,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Chron6.htm|title=The Original Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology Part VI|website=www.pjfarmer.com}}</ref> and (2) Raffles Holmes was the father of Creighton Holmes, who is featured in the collection of short stories ''The Adventures of Creighton Holmes'' by Ned Hubbell.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Chron7.htm|title=The Original Wold Newton Universe Crossover Chronology Part VII|website=www.pjfarmer.com}}</ref>\n\nMengel's online essay was revised for publication in the [[Win Scott Eckert|Eckert]]-edited ''Myths for the Modern Age: Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's Wold Newton Universe'' ([[MonkeyBrain Books]], 2005), a collection of Wold Newton essays by Farmer and several other \"post-Farmerian\" contributors, authorised by Farmer as an extension of his Wold Newton mythos. He does not appear or is ever mentioned in any of the original stories of Sherlock Holmes and is not a creation of Doyle.\n\n===Sherrinford Holmes===\n'''Sherrinford Holmes''' is a proposed elder brother of [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Mycroft Holmes]]. His name is taken from early notes as one of those considered by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] for his detective hero before settling on \"Sherlock Holmes\".<ref name= \"names\">{{cite news |last=Honan |first=William H. |author-link=William H.

If Mycroft were the eldest, he could not play the role he does in four stories of the Sherlock Holmes [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|canon]], so Sherrinford frees them both.  This position is strengthened by the fact that Mycroft's general position as a senior civil servant was a common choice among the younger sons of the gentry.\n\nThe character (as \"Sherringford\") appears along with his brothers in the [[Virgin New Adventures]] [[Doctor Who]] novel ''[[All-Consuming Fire]]'' by [[Andy Lane]], where he is revealed to be the member of a cult worshiping an alien telepathic slug that is mutating him and his followers into an insect-like form; the novel culminates with Holmes being forced to shoot his brother to save Watson.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burt|first=Katyl|title=Sherlock Season 4: Who Are Sherrinford, Eurus, and Redbeard?|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/sherlock/261198/sherlock-season-4-who-are-sherrinford-eurus-and-redbeard|website=[[Den of Geek]]|date=January 15, 2017|accessdate=December 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe also appears, accused of a murder that Sherlock must find him innocent of, in the [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]] [[roleplaying game]] adventure ''The Yorkshire Horrors''.<ref>''[[Cthulhu by Gaslight]]'', Chaosium, 1986  http://www.yog-sothoth.com/cocdbdetail.php?ID=21{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Sherrinford also appears in the Italian comic series ''Storie da Altrove'' (a spin-off of ''[[Martin Myst\u00e8re]]'') as the eldest brother, born nine years before him, of Sherlock himself.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=Carlo Recagno |artist=Cesare Colombi |letterer=Monica Husler |story=La cosa che attende nella nebbia |title=Storie da Altrove |issue=2 |date=November 1999 |publisher=[[Sergio Bonelli Editore]] |location=[[Milan]] |page=46}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic |writer=Carlo Recagno |artist=Giuseppe Palumbo |letterer=Marina Sanfelice |story=L'ombra che sfid\u00f2 Sherlock Holmes |title=Storie da Altrove |issue=3 |date=November 2000 |publisher=[[Sergio Bonelli Editore]] |location=[[Milan]] |page=164}}</ref>\n\n===Sigerson Holmes===\nThe film ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]'' has as its protagonist Sigerson Holmes who Sherlock (a minor character) identifies as a brother of himself and Mycroft.\nThe name \"Sigerson\" is an alias mentioned in passing in a Conan Doyle story as an alias Sherlock used while posing as an explorer.\n\n===Amelia Watson===\nShe is the second wife of Dr. John Watson whose adventures are chronicled in a series of short stories and novels by [[Michael Mallory]]. Amelia Watson is based upon the enigmatic reference to Watson's having left Holmes in 1902 for a wife, which appears in the canonical story ''[[The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier]]'', though the woman in the story is never named or identified, nor mentioned again in the canon.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of detectives, constables, and agents in Sherlock Holmes]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Sherlock Holmes books}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sherlock Holmes minor characters}}\n[[Category:Sherlock Holmes characters| ]]\n[[Category:Sherlock Holmes lists|characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of minor fictional characters]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Sherlock_Holmes_characters"}

His father was Mirza Habibullah al-Shirazi, and his mother was Radhiya Golshan-Shirazi (daughter of Muhib Ali Golshan-Shirazi). Mirza Mahdi is the fourth of eight children. His eldest brother, Muhammd-Sadiq, died young. The remaining two of his brothers were also clerics; his older brother, Abdullah al-Shirazi (grandfather of [[Ali al-Sistani|Ali al-Sistani's]] wife; also known as al-Tawasuli), and younger brother, Jafar al-Shirazi. His elder sister, Um Moosa, was married to his cousin, senior cleric, Abd al-Hadi al-Shirazi.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMirza Mahdi began his religious education at a very early age, carrying out his introductory studies in Karbala, under his brother, Abdullah al-Tawasuli, Sayyid Husayn Khayr al-Din and Sayyid Muhammad-Hassan Agha Mir al-Qazwini.<ref name=\":5\" /> After his father, Mirza Habibullah passed away in 1902, he moved to [[Najaf]], to study under the two greats, [[Akhund Khorasani|Akhund Khurasani]] and [[Mohammed Kazem Yazdi|Muhammad-Kadhim Yazdi]].

They remained in Kadhimiya for approximately a year and a half, living a life of dire poverty, until they returned to Karbala, where Mirza Taqi, was preparing to lead the [[Iraqi revolt of 1920|independence movement]] against the British. He remained in Karbala, and played an active supporting role with his uncle in the Iraqi revolt, until his uncle was poisoned in 1920.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alshirazi.net/karbala/olama/09.htm|title=al-Thikra al-Tasi'a Wal Arbaoon Liraheel al-Marja al-Muqadas Ayatollah al-Udhma al-Sayyid Mirza Mahdi al-Husayni al-Shirazi Qudisa Siruh|last=|first=|date=|website=Official Website of Ayatollah Shirazi|trans-title=The 49th anniversary of the demise of the divine jurist Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mirza Mahdi al-Husayni al-Shirazi|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Lukitz|first=Liora|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hk-RAgAAQBAJ|title=Iraq: The Search for National Identity|date=2005-07-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-1-135-77820-0|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\nAfter the death of his uncle, he moved back to Najaf, to resume his religious education, and studied under his first cousin once removed, Mirza Ali Agha al-Shirazi, as well as [[Muhammad Hossein Naini|al-Muhaqiq al-Naini]] and [[Agha Zia ol Din Araghi|al-Muhaqiq al-Iraqi]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />[[File:Mirzamehdi.jpg|thumb|200px|Mirza Mahdi (centre left) with his teacher Hossein Qomi (centre right)|alt=|left]]\n\n=== Return to Karbala ===\nIn 1935, senior cleric Hossein Tabatabaei Qomi was exiled from Iran, by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Muhammed Reza Shah]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shakibi|first=Zhand|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4k6_DwAAQBAJ|title=Pahlavi Iran and the Politics of Occidentalism: The Shah and the Rastakhiz Party|date=2019-12-12|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=|isbn=978-1-78673-630-7|location=|pages=123|language=en}}</ref> So Qomi emigrated to Karbala, and sent a request for Mirza Mahdi to return to Karbala, so that he may join him in his quest to revive its seminary, to which Mirza Mahdi accepted and returned to his birthplace.

Within six months, Iraq was turned into a blood bath of pro-communist protests, attacking the homes of religious clerics and nationalists. It was so bad, it is reported that a Muslim would feel estranged in a city like Najaf.\n\nOne time, a protest was formed in Karbala, with some of the leaders of the city's communist movement. They had a list of fifty two names (this included Mirza Mahdi's son [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi|Muhammad]]), of the people they planned to attack their homes and kill, for the reason that they 'stood against communism and the \"red tide\"'.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=al-Muhtadi|first=Abd al-Atheem|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9PjWAAAAMAAJ|title=Qusas Wa Khawatir - Min Akhlaqiyat 'Ulama' al-Din|publisher=Mu'asasat al-Balagh|year=2009|isbn=|location=Beirut, Lebanon|pages=552\u201353|trans-title=Stories and Memories - From the Manners of the Scholars}}</ref>\n\nThis is when the senior jurists of the time decided to take a stand to counter this wave of terror.

His eldest brother, Muhammd-Sadiq, died young. The remaining two of his brothers were also clerics; his older brother, Abdullah al-Shirazi (grandfather of [[Ali al-Sistani|Ali al-Sistani's]] wife; also known as al-Tawasuli), and younger brother, Jafar al-Shirazi.

It was so bad, it is reported that a Muslim would feel estranged in a city like Najaf.\n\nOne time, a protest was formed in Karbala, with some of the leaders of the city's communist movement. They had a list of fifty two names (this included Mirza Mahdi's son [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi|Muhammad]]), of the people they planned to attack their homes and kill, for the reason that they 'stood against communism and the \"red tide\"'.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=al-Muhtadi|first=Abd al-Atheem|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9PjWAAAAMAAJ|title=Qusas Wa Khawatir - Min Akhlaqiyat 'Ulama' al-Din|publisher=Mu'asasat al-Balagh|year=2009|isbn=|location=Beirut, Lebanon|pages=552\u201353|trans-title=Stories and Memories - From the Manners of the Scholars}}</ref>\n\nThis is when the senior jurists of the time decided to take a stand to counter this wave of terror.
