By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kyiv to [[Pereyaslavets]] on the [[Danube]] in 969. In contrast with his mother's conversion to [[History of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)|Christianity]], Sviatoslav, like his [[druzhina]], remained a staunch [[paganism|pagan]]. Due to his abrupt death in an ambush in 972, Sviatoslav's conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a [[fratricide|fratricidal]] feud among his sons, which resulted in two of his three sons being killed.\n\n===Reign of Volodymyr and Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianization of Kyivan Rus'}}\n[[File:Izias\u0142a\u016d, Rahnieda, Volodymyr. \u0406\u0437\u044f\u0441\u043b\u0430\u045e, \u0420\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440.jpg|thumb|[[Rogneda of Polotsk]], [[Volodymyr I of Kiev]] and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]]]\n[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of Saint Prince Vladimir'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]]]]\n\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of the Grand Duke was first introduced, but the importance of the Kyiv principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between [[Volodymyr I of Kyiv|Volodymyr the Great]] and [[Yaropolk I of Kyiv|Yaropolk I]]. The region of Kyiv dominated the state of Kyivan Rus' for the next two centuries. The [[Grand Prince]] (''\"velykyj kniaz'\"'') of Kyiv controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute. The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Volodymyr the Great (980\u20131015) and Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019\u20131054). Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kyivan Rus' that had begun under Oleg.\n\nVolodymyr had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to [[Scandinavia]] in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]] and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative [[Earl]] [[H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson]], ruler of Norway, Volodymyr assembled a [[Viking]] army and reconquered Novgorod and Kyiv from Yaropolk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/631547/Vladimir-I |title=Volodymyr I (grand prince of Kyiv) - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> As Prince of Kyiv, Volodymyr's most notable achievement was the [[Christianization of Kyivan Rus']], a process that began in 988. The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that when Volodymyr had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional [[Slavic mythology|idol-worship]] ([[paganism]]) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the [[Latin Rite]], the [[Jew]]s, and the [[Muslims]] before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his [[chosen people]] to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Volodymyr that the faith of the [[Byzantine Rite]] was the best choice of all, upon which Volodymyr made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Princess Anna]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]].<ref>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980\u20131584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</ref>\n\n[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Eggink's painting represents [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent.]]\n\nVolodymyr's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kyiv's most vital commercial route, the [[Dnipro River]]. Adherence to the [[Eastern Church]] had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a [[liturgy]] written in [[Cyrillic]] and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the [[Slavic peoples]]. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the [[Eastern Slavs]] and introduced them to rudimentary [[Greek philosophy]], science, and [[historiography]] without the necessity of learning [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Simon|title=Greek in Kievan Rus'|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|year=1992|volume=46|pages=69\u201381|doi=10.2307/1291640|jstor=1291640}}</ref> In contrast, educated people in medieval [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] learned [[Latin (language)|Latin]].

Following the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054, the Rus' church maintained communion with both Rome and Constantinople for some time, but along with most of the Eastern churches it eventually split to follow the Eastern Orthodox.

Yaroslav's granddaughter, [[Eupraxia of Kyiv|Eupraxia]] the daughter of his son [[Vsevolod I, Prince of Kyiv]], was married to [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, ''[[Rus'ka Pravda]]''; built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv]] and [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]; patronized local clergy and [[monasticism]]; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great [[Kyiv Pechersk Lavra]] ([[monastery]]), which functioned in Kyivan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.\n\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurik's descendants]] shared power over Kievan Rus'.

The position of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.\n\nAn unconventional power succession system was established ([[rota system]]) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[Familicide]] was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] as the Grand Prince of Kiev,{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}<!--Why was the established rota system 'skipped'?--> in turn creating major squabbles between [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Olegovichi]] from [[Chernihiv]], Monomakhs from [[Pereyaslav]], [[Izyaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslavichi]] from [[Principality of Turov|Turov]]/[[Volhynia]], and [[Polotsk Principality|Polotsk Princes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!--This and following paragraph need to be amalgamated as they're both dealing with same subject matter.-->\n\n[[File:Kievan Nativity.jpg|thumb|''The Nativity'', a Kievan (possibly Galician) illumination from the [[Gertrude Psalter]]]]\n\nThe most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise.

The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly [[Byzantine]]) through [[eastern Europe]] to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. These trading routes became less important as the Byzantine Empire declined in power and Western Europe created new trading trading routes to Asia and the Near East. As people relied less on passing through Kievan Rus' territories for trade, the Kievan Rus' economy suffered.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Russia : a historical introduction from Kievan Rus' to the present|last=Thompson, John M.

In 1169, as the Kievan Rus' state was full of internal conflict, Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir sacked the city of Kiev.

In 1204, the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] sacked Constantinople, making the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] trade route marginal.<ref name=\"occawlonline.pearsoned.com\"/> At the same time, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] (of the [[Northern Crusades]]) were conquering the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region and threatening the [[Lands of Novgorod]]. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local [[Orthodox Christianity]] of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.\n\n====Novgorod Republic====\n{{Main|Republic of Novgorod}}\n\nIn the north, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] prospered because it controlled trade routes from the [[River Volga]] to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local [[oligarchy]] ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} Now an independent [[city state|city republic]], and referred to as \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" it would spread its \"mercantile interest\" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own [[Archbishop of Novgorod|archbishop]], named [[Ilya (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Ilya]], a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.\n\n====Northeast====\n{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Europe-1139.jpg|thumb|1139 map of the Grand Duchy of Kiev, where northeastern territories identified as the Transforrest Colonies (Zalesie) by [[Joachim Lelewel]]]]\n\nIn the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of [[Rostov]], the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by [[Suzdal]] and then by the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which become the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal']]. The combined [[principality]] of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, [[Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy]] of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]], the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.\n\n====Southwest====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nTo the southwest, the principality of [[Halych]] had developed trade relations with its [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Lithuania]]n neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, [[Roman the Great|Prince Roman Mstislavych]] united the two previously separate principalities of Halych and [[Volhynia|Volyn]]. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of [[Knyaz]] of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, [[Prince Daniel]] (r. 1238\u20131264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \"Rex Rusiae\" (\"King of Rus\") from the Roman [[papacy]], apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Constantinople granted the King of [[Poland]] a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the territory of former Kievan Rus was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \"Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.\n\nHowever, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the [[Mstislavich]] branch of the [[Dynasty of Rurik|Rurikids]] in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took [[Volhynia]], including Kiev, conquered by [[Gediminas]] in 1321 [[Battle on the Irpen' River|ending the rule of Rurikids in the city]]. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over [[Ruthenia]].\n\n===Final disintegration===\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Lilac borders: [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]], one of the successor states of Kievan Rus']]\n\nThe state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] (the so-called [[Tatar Yoke]]). In the late 15th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite Grand Dukes]] began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of [[translatio imperii]].\n\nOn the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], fell to the [[Gediminids]], the powerful, largely Ruthenized [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions.

This [[princedom]] emerged from a coalition of traditional [[patriarchic]] family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land. This union developed the first major cities in the Rus' and was the first notable form of self-government. As these communes became larger, the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded. This shift in ideology became known as the [[verv']].\n\nIn the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of [[Western Europe]]an feudalism. Nevertheless, urban [[merchant]]s, [[artisan]]s and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the ''[[veche]]'' (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of [[slave]]s. More important was a class of tribute-paying [[peasant]]s, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal [[serfdom]] characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.\n\nThe change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or [[smerd]]y. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.\n\n==Historical assessment==\n[[File:Igorsvyat.jpg|thumb|''The field of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]]'s battle with the [[Polovtsy]]'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]\n\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe,<ref>http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054310/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html archive])</ref> was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.<ref name=\"Sherman\">\n{{cite book | last = Sherman| first = Charles Phineas| authorlink = |title = Roman Law in the Modern World| origyear = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&dq=%22Roman+Law+in+the+Modern+World%22&pg=PP7&printsec=2&lpg=PP7| accessdate = | edition = | year = 1917 | publisher = The Boston Book Company | location = Boston | page = 191 | chapter = Russia | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=OCLC00824429&id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=advanced+culture+OR+cultural+Kiev+novgorod&vq=%22Russia+became+more+advanced++in+civilization+than+any+western+European+State+of+the+period%22 | quote =\"The adoption of Christianity by Vladimir... was followed by commerce with the [[Byzantine Empire]].

According to several chronicles after that date the predominant cult of [[Slavic paganism]] was persecuted.\n\nThe exact date of creation of the Kiev Metropolis is uncertain, as well as who was the first leader of the church. Predominantly it is considered that the first head was [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael I of Kiev]], however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the [[Church of the Tithes]]. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by [[Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople]] in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter [[Bila Tserkva|Yuriy-upon-Ros]]. The Kiev Metropolitan sent his own delegation to the [[Council of Bari]] in 1098.\n\nAfter the sacking of Kiev in 1169, part of the Kiev metropolis started to move{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir-upon-Klyazma]], concluding the move sometime after 1240 when Kiev was taken by [[Batu Khan]]. Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, [[Lev I of Galicia]] petitioned [[Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople]] for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe [[Church of the Tithes]] was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]] was chosen as the new cathedral.\n\nBy the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Che\u0142m (1235), Tver (1271).

By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in Europe, eventually moving his capital from Kiev to [[Pereyaslavets]] on the [[Danube]] in 969. In contrast with his mother's conversion to [[History of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)|Christianity]], Sviatoslav, like his [[druzhina]], remained a staunch [[paganism|pagan]]. Due to his abrupt death in an ambush in 972, Sviatoslav's conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a [[fratricide|fratricidal]] feud among his sons, which resulted in two of his three sons being killed.\n\n===Reign of Vladimir and Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}\n[[File:Izias\u0142a\u016d, Rahnieda, Volodymyr. \u0406\u0437\u044f\u0441\u043b\u0430\u045e, \u0420\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440.jpg|thumb|[[Rogneda of Polotsk]], [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]]]\n[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of Saint Prince Vladimir'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]]]]\n\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of the Grand Duke was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] and [[Yaropolk I of Kiev|Yaropolk I]]. The region of Kiev dominated the state of Kievan Rus' for the next two centuries. The [[Grand Prince]] (''\"velikiy kniaz'\"'') of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute. The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Vladimir the Great (980\u20131015) and Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019\u20131054). Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg.\n\nVladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to [[Scandinavia]] in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]] and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative [[Earl]] [[H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson]], ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a [[Viking]] army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/631547/Vladimir-I |title=Vladimir I (grand prince of Kiev) - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], a process that began in 988. The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional [[Slavic mythology|idol-worship]] ([[paganism]]) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the [[Latin Rite]], the [[Jew]]s, and the [[Muslims]] before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his [[chosen people]] to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the [[Byzantine Rite]] was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Princess Anna]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]].<ref>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980\u20131584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</ref>\n\n[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Eggink's painting represents [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent.]]\n\nVladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the [[Dnieper River]]. Adherence to the [[Eastern Church]] had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a [[liturgy]] written in [[Cyrillic]] and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the [[Slavic peoples]]. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the [[Eastern Slavs]] and introduced them to rudimentary [[Greek philosophy]], science, and [[historiography]] without the necessity of learning [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Simon|title=Greek in Kievan Rus'|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|year=1992|volume=46|pages=69\u201381|doi=10.2307/1291640|jstor=1291640}}</ref> In contrast, educated people in medieval [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] learned [[Latin (language)|Latin]].

Like Vladimir, Yaroslav was eager to improve relations with the rest of Europe, especially the Byzantine Empire. Yaroslav's granddaughter, [[Eupraxia of Kiev|Eupraxia]] the daughter of his son [[Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev]], was married to [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''; built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] and [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]; patronized local clergy and [[monasticism]]; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] ([[monastery]]), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.\n\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurik's descendants]] shared power over Kievan Rus'.

The position of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.\n\nAn unconventional power succession system was established ([[rota system]]) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[Familicide]] was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] as the Grand Prince of Kiev,{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}<!--Why was the established rota system 'skipped'?--> in turn creating major squabbles between [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Olegovichi]] from [[Chernihiv]], Monomakhs from [[Pereyaslav]], [[Izyaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslavichi]] from [[Principality of Turov|Turov]]/[[Volhynia]], and [[Polotsk Principality|Polotsk Princes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!--This and following paragraph need to be amalgamated as they're both dealing with same subject matter.-->\n\n[[File:Kievan Nativity.jpg|thumb|''The Nativity'', a Kievan (possibly Galician) illumination from the [[Gertrude Psalter]]]]\n\nThe most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise.

The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly [[Byzantine]]) through [[eastern Europe]] to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. These trading routes became less important as the Byzantine Empire declined in power and Western Europe created new trading trading routes to Asia and the Near East.

In 1169, as the Kievan Rus' state was full of internal conflict, Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir sacked the city of Kiev.

In 1204, the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] sacked Constantinople, making the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] trade route marginal.<ref name=\"occawlonline.pearsoned.com\"/> At the same time, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] (of the [[Northern Crusades]]) were conquering the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region and threatening the [[Lands of Novgorod]]. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local [[Orthodox Christianity]] of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.\n\n====Novgorod Republic====\n{{Main|Republic of Novgorod}}\n\nIn the north, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] prospered because it controlled trade routes from the [[River Volga]] to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local [[oligarchy]] ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} Now an independent [[city state|city republic]], and referred to as \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" it would spread its \"mercantile interest\" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own [[Archbishop of Novgorod|archbishop]], named [[Ilya (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Ilya]], a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.\n\n====Northeast====\n{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Europe-1139.jpg|thumb|1139 map of the Grand Duchy of Kiev, where northeastern territories identified as the Transforrest Colonies (Zalesie) by [[Joachim Lelewel]]]]\n\nIn the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of [[Rostov]], the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by [[Suzdal]] and then by the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which become the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal']]. The combined [[principality]] of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, [[Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy]] of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]], the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.\n\n====Southwest====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nTo the southwest, the principality of [[Halych]] had developed trade relations with its [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Lithuania]]n neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, [[Roman the Great|Prince Roman Mstislavych]] united the two previously separate principalities of Halych and [[Volhynia|Volyn]]. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of [[Knyaz]] of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, [[Prince Daniel]] (r. 1238\u20131264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \"Rex Rusiae\" (\"King of Rus\") from the Roman [[papacy]], apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Constantinople granted the King of [[Poland]] a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the territory of former Kievan Rus was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \"Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.\n\nHowever, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the [[Mstislavich]] branch of the [[Dynasty of Rurik|Rurikids]] in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took [[Volhynia]], including Kiev, conquered by [[Gediminas]] in 1321 [[Battle on the Irpen' River|ending the rule of Rurikids in the city]]. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over [[Ruthenia]].\n\n===Final disintegration===\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Lilac borders: [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]], one of the successor states of Kievan Rus']]\n\nThe state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] (the so-called [[Tatar Yoke]]). In the late 15th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite Grand Dukes]] began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of [[translatio imperii]].\n\nOn the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], fell to the [[Gediminids]], the powerful, largely Ruthenized [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions.

This [[princedom]] emerged from a coalition of traditional [[patriarchic]] family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land. This union developed the first major cities in the Rus' and was the first notable form of self-government. As these communes became larger, the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded. This shift in ideology became known as the [[verv']].\n\nIn the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of [[Western Europe]]an feudalism. Nevertheless, urban [[merchant]]s, [[artisan]]s and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the ''[[veche]]'' (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of [[slave]]s. More important was a class of tribute-paying [[peasant]]s, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal [[serfdom]] characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.\n\nThe change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or [[smerd]]y. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.\n\n==Historical assessment==\n[[File:Igorsvyat.jpg|thumb|''The field of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]]'s battle with the [[Polovtsy]]'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]\n\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe,<ref>http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054310/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html archive])</ref> was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.<ref name=\"Sherman\">\n{{cite book | last = Sherman| first = Charles Phineas| authorlink = |title = Roman Law in the Modern World| origyear = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&dq=%22Roman+Law+in+the+Modern+World%22&pg=PP7&printsec=2&lpg=PP7| accessdate = | edition = | year = 1917 | publisher = The Boston Book Company | location = Boston | page = 191 | chapter = Russia | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=OCLC00824429&id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=advanced+culture+OR+cultural+Kiev+novgorod&vq=%22Russia+became+more+advanced++in+civilization+than+any+western+European+State+of+the+period%22 | quote =\"The adoption of Christianity by Vladimir... was followed by commerce with the [[Byzantine Empire]].

According to several chronicles after that date the predominant cult of [[Slavic paganism]] was persecuted.\n\nThe exact date of creation of the Kiev Metropolis is uncertain, as well as who was the first leader of the church. Predominantly it is considered that the first head was [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael I of Kiev]], however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the [[Church of the Tithes]]. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by [[Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople]] in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter [[Bila Tserkva|Yuriy-upon-Ros]]. The Kiev Metropolitan sent his own delegation to the [[Council of Bari]] in 1098.\n\nAfter the sacking of Kiev in 1169, part of the Kiev metropolis started to move{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir-upon-Klyazma]], concluding the move sometime after 1240 when Kiev was taken by [[Batu Khan]]. Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, [[Lev I of Galicia]] petitioned [[Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople]] for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe [[Church of the Tithes]] was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]] was chosen as the new cathedral.\n\nBy the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Che\u0142m (1235), Tver (1271).

McAndrew et al. illustrates the idea with the example of a person hearing some noises while walking in a dark alley. That person would go in high alert, fearing that some dangerous individual was there. If that wasn\u2019t the case the loss would be small. If, on the other hand, a dangerous individual was actually in the alley and the person had not been alerted by this creepy feeling, the loss could have been significant.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|11}} \n\nCreepiness would therefore serve the purpose of alerting us in situations in which the danger isn\u2019t outright obvious but rather ambiguous.

Maror on the lowest plate.]]\n'''''Maror''''' ({{lang-he|\u05de\u05b8\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8}} ''m\u0101r\u00f4r'') refers to the bitter [[herb]]s eaten at the [[Passover Seder]] in keeping with the [[mitzvah|biblical commandment]]  \"with bitter herbs they shall eat it.\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 12:8).\n\n==Biblical source==\nIn some listings of the [[613 commandments]], such as the ''[[Minchat Chinuch]]'', the biblical obligation to consume ''maror'' is included within the commandment to consume the meat of the sacrificial [[Paschal offering]].<ref name=\"MC\">''Minchat Chinuch'' 6:14 ''u'v'mitzvah''</ref> Ever since the Paschal offering ceased to exist with the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE, the obligation to consume ''maror'' on the first night of Passover has been rabbinical in nature. The only two biblical reference to the ''maror'' is the verse quoted above (Exodus 12:8) in which it is mentioned in reference to the offering, and in Numbers 9:11 where \"They are to eat the lamb, together with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs\".<ref name=\"MC\"/> This is in contradistinction to the obligation to consume ''[[matzo]]'' on the first night of Passover, which remains a biblical commandment even in the absence of the Paschal Lamb, because there are other biblical verses that mention ''matzo'' as a standalone obligation (Exodus 12:18, Deuteronomy 16:8)\n\nThe word derives from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{lang|he-Latn|mar}} ({{lang|he|\u05de\u05b5\u05e8}} or {{lang|he|\u05de\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4}} \u2013 'bitter'), and thus may be related to the English word [[myrrh]] (through [[Aramaic]] {{lang|arc|\u0721\u072a\u071d\u072a\u0710}} {{lang|arc-Latn|mriro}}, cognate with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0631\u0651}} {{lang|ar-Latn|murr}}).\n\n==Symbolism==\nAccording to the [[Haggadah]], the traditional text which is recited at the Seder and which defines the Seder's form and customs, the maror symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The following verse from the [[Torah]] underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered (''ve-yimareru'' \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5) their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 1:14).\n\n==Use at the Seder==\n{{Seder plate}}\nMaror is one of the foods placed on the [[Passover Seder Plate]] and there is a rabbinical requirement to eat ''maror'' at the Seder. ''Chazeret'' ({{lang-he|\u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea}}) is used for the requirement called ''korech'', in which the maror is eaten together with ''matzo''. There are various customs about the kinds of ''maror'' placed at each location.\n\nDuring the Seder, each participant recites a specific [[blessing]] over the ''maror'' and eats it. It is first dipped into the [[charoset]]&mdash;a brown, pebbly mixture which symbolizes the mortar with which the [[Israelite]]s bound bricks for the Egyptians.  The excess charoset is then shaken off and the maror is eaten.  The ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish Law) prescribes the minimum amount of ''maror'' that should be eaten to fulfill the [[mitzvah]] (a ''kazayis'' or ''[[kezayit]]'', literally meaning the volume of an [[olive]]) and the amount of time in which it should be consumed. To fulfill the obligation, the flavor of the ''maror'' must be unadulterated by cooking or preservatives, such as being soaked in vinegar.<ref>''[[Mishna]]'' ''[[Pesachim]]'' 2:6</ref>\n\n==Types of maror==\nThe [[Mishnah]]<ref>''Pesahim'' 2:6</ref> specifies five types of bitter herbs eaten on the night of Passover: ''\u1e25azzeret'' ([[lettuce]]), ''\u02bfulesh\u012bn'' ([[endive]]/[[chicory]]), ''temakha'', ''\u1e25ar\u1e25avina'' ([[Melilotus|sweet clover]] or [[Eryngium|Eryngium creticum]]), and ''maror'' (likely [[Sonchus oleraceus]], a type of [[dandelion]]). The most common vegetables used as bitter herbs are [[horseradish]] and [[romaine lettuce]].\n\n===Hazzeret===\nHazzaret is undoubtedly domestic lettuce<ref>Thus explained in Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]]'s Commentary on Mishnah ''Uktzin'' 1:2 [3]; ''Sefer Arukh'', s.v. \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea; Mishnah Commentary of [[Rabbi Nathan, President of the Academy]], s.v. Mishnah ''Kila'im'' 1:2; Zohar Amar, ''Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teachings'', Kefar Darom 2015, p. 77 {{OCLC|783455868}}[Hebrew].</ref>, and the word is cognate to other near-eastern terms for lettuce. While in the past, domestic lettuce was bitter, modern varieties are only slightly bitter or not at all, such as [[iceberg lettuce]] and [[romaine lettuce]]. [[Heirloom plant|Heirloom varieties]] of lettuce are still available to gardeners that are bitter. Romaine lettuce is the most commonly used variety, perhaps because it still preserves a slight bitter taste, though all domestic varieties constitute Hazzereth.\n\nRomaine lettuce is not initially bitter, but becomes so later on, which is symbolic of the experience of the Jews in Egypt.<ref>[[Talmud]], Pesachim 39a</ref> The \"later\" bitterness of lettuce refers to fact that lettuce plants become bitter after they \"bolt\" (flower), a process which occurs naturally when days lengthen or temperatures rise.<ref>[https://www.thespruce.com/what-does-lettuce-bolt-do-1402981 Why Lettuce Bolts and How to Stop It]</ref>\n\nWild or [[Lactuca serriola|prickly lettuce (''Lactuca serriola'')]], is listed in Tosefta Pisha as suitable for maror under the name \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05d2\u05dc or \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea \u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05df. However, its absence from the approved list in the Mishnah and Talmud indicate that it is not halakhically suitable.\n\n===`Ulshin===\nThe second species listed in the Mishnah is `ulshin, which is a plural to refer to both wild and cultivated types<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.39a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en TB Pesahim 39 a]</ref> of plants in the genus [[Endive|Chicorium]].<ref>Yehuda Felix, ''Mareos Hamishna''.

Of these, the most commonly grown chervil in Israel is [[Chaetosciadium trichospermum]]. Cf. William Smith (ed.), ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', Third edition, New York 1858, s.v. \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (\"gingidium\"), \"a kind of chervil.\" [[Ibn Baytar]], citing [[Galen]], explains ''Gingidium'' as rather meaning a species of [[wild carrot]] (e.g. ''Daucus gingidium'', or something similar). This view is accepted by [[Pliny the Elder]] who, in his ''Natural History'' (Book XX, ch. XVI), wrote: \"In [[Greater Syria|Syria]] very great pains are taken over kitchen-gardens; hence the Greek proverb: 'Syrians have plenty of vegetables.' They sow a vegetable called by some ''gingidion'' that is very like ''staphylinus'' (=parsnip; carrot), only it is slighter and more bitter, though its properties are the same. It is eaten, cooked or raw, with great advantage to the stomach, for it dries up all its humours, however deep these may lie.\"</ref>\n\nRabbi [[Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller]], in his ''Tosafot Yom-Tov'', identified the Mishna's \"temakha\" with Yiddish \"chreyn\" ([[horseradish]]). This identification has long been recognized as problematic, as horseradish does not grow natively in Israel and was not available to Jews in the Mishnaic period. Many Jews use [[horseradish]] condiment (a mixture of cooked horseradish, beetroot and sugar), though the [[Shulchan Aruch]] requires that maror be used as is, that is raw, and not cooked or mixed with salt, vinegar, sugar, lemon, or beets.<ref>Orach Chaim 473:5</ref>\n\n===Harhavina===\nThe identity of harhavina is somewhat disputed.<ref>El'ad Kapah, ''The Identification of the Mishna Plants According to Rabbi Nathan's Commentary of the Mishna'', Ramat-Gan 2007, p. 48 (Hebrew); Zohar Amar, ''Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teaching''s, Kfar Darom 2015, pp. 88\u201389 {{OCLC|783455868}}.

Maror on the lowest plate.]]\n'''''Maror''''' ({{lang-he|\u05de\u05b8\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8}} ''m\u0101r\u00f4r'') refers to the bitter [[herb]]s eaten at the [[Passover Seder]] in keeping with the [[mitzvah|biblical commandment]]  \"with bitter herbs they shall eat it.\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 12:8).\n\n==Biblical source==\nIn some listings of the [[613 commandments]], such as the ''[[Minchat Chinuch]]'', the biblical obligation to consume ''maror'' is included within the commandment to consume the meat of the sacrificial [[Paschal offering]].<ref name=\"MC\">''Minchat Chinuch'' 6:14 ''u'v'mitzvah''</ref> Ever since the Paschal offering ceased to exist with the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE, the obligation to consume ''maror'' on the first night of Passover has been rabbinical in nature. The only two biblical reference to the ''maror'' is the verse quoted above (Exodus 12:8) in which it is mentioned in reference to the offering, and in Numbers 9:11 where \"They are to eat the lamb, together with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs\".<ref name=\"MC\"/> This is in contradistinction to the obligation to consume ''[[matzo]]'' on the first night of Passover, which remains a biblical commandment even in the absence of the Paschal Lamb, because there are other biblical verses that mention ''matzo'' as a standalone obligation (Exodus 12:18, Deuteronomy 16:8)\n\nThe word derives from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''mar'' (\u05de\u05b5\u05e8 or \u05de\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 \u2013 \"bitter\"), and thus may be related to the English word [[myrrh]] (through \u00a0[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] \u0721\u072a\u071d\u072a\u0710 ''mriro'', in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] \u0645\u0631\u0651 ''murr'').\n\n==Symbolism==\nAccording to the [[Haggadah]], the traditional text which is recited at the Seder and which defines the Seder's form and customs, the maror symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The following verse from the [[Torah]] underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered (''ve-yimareru'' \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5) their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 1:14).\n\n==Use at the Seder==\n{{Seder plate}}\nMaror is one of the foods placed on the [[Passover Seder Plate]] and there is a rabbinical requirement to eat ''maror'' at the Seder. ''Chazeret'' ({{lang-he|\u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea}}) is used for the requirement called ''korech'', in which the maror is eaten together with ''matzo''. There are various customs about the kinds of ''maror'' placed at each location.\n\nDuring the Seder, each participant recites a specific [[blessing]] over the ''maror'' and eats it. It is first dipped into the [[charoset]]&mdash;a brown, pebbly mixture which symbolizes the mortar with which the [[Israelite]]s bound bricks for the Egyptians.  The excess charoset is then shaken off and the maror is eaten.  The ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish Law) prescribes the minimum amount of ''maror'' that should be eaten to fulfill the [[mitzvah]] (a ''kazayis'' or ''[[kezayit]]'', literally meaning the volume of an [[olive]]) and the amount of time in which it should be consumed. To fulfill the obligation, the flavor of the ''maror'' must be unadulterated by cooking or preservatives, such as being soaked in vinegar.<ref>''[[Mishna]]'' ''[[Pesachim]]'' 2:6</ref>\n\n==Types of maror==\nThe [[Mishnah]]<ref>''Pesahim'' 2:6</ref> specifies five types of bitter herbs eaten on the night of Passover: ''\u1e25azzeret'' ([[lettuce]]), ''\u02bfulesh\u012bn'' ([[endive]]/[[chicory]]), ''temakha'', ''\u1e25ar\u1e25avina'' ([[Melilotus|sweet clover]] or [[Eryngium|Eryngium creticum]]), and ''maror'' (likely [[Sonchus oleraceus]], a type of [[dandelion]]). The most common vegetables used as bitter herbs are [[horseradish]] and [[romaine lettuce]].\n\n===Hazzeret===\nHazzaret is undoubtedly domestic lettuce<ref>Thus explained in Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]]'s Commentary on Mishnah ''Uktzin'' 1:2 [3]; ''Sefer Arukh'', s.v. \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea; Mishnah Commentary of [[Rabbi Nathan, President of the Academy]], s.v. Mishnah ''Kila'im'' 1:2; Zohar Amar, ''Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teachings'', Kefar Darom 2015, p. 77 {{OCLC|783455868}}[Hebrew].</ref>, and the word is cognate to other near-eastern terms for lettuce. While in the past, domestic lettuce was bitter, modern varieties are only slightly bitter or not at all, such as [[iceberg lettuce]] and [[romaine lettuce]]. [[Heirloom plant|Heirloom varieties]] of lettuce are still available to gardeners that are bitter. Romaine lettuce is the most commonly used variety, perhaps because it still preserves a slight bitter taste, though all domestic varieties constitute Hazzereth.\n\nRomaine lettuce is not initially bitter, but becomes so later on, which is symbolic of the experience of the Jews in Egypt.<ref>[[Talmud]], Pesachim 39a</ref> The \"later\" bitterness of lettuce refers to fact that lettuce plants become bitter after they \"bolt\" (flower), a process which occurs naturally when days lengthen or temperatures rise.<ref>[https://www.thespruce.com/what-does-lettuce-bolt-do-1402981 Why Lettuce Bolts and How to Stop It]</ref>\n\nWild or [[Lactuca serriola|prickly lettuce (''Lactuca serriola'')]], is listed in Tosefta Pisha as suitable for maror under the name \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05d2\u05dc or \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea \u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05df. However, its absence from the approved list in the Mishnah and Talmud indicate that it is not halakhically suitable.\n\n===`Ulshin===\nThe second species listed in the Mishnah is `ulshin, which is a plural to refer to both wild and cultivated types<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.39a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en TB Pesahim 39 a]</ref> of plants in the genus [[Endive|Chicorium]].<ref>Yehuda Felix, ''Mareos Hamishna''.

Of these, the most commonly grown chervil in Israel is [[Chaetosciadium trichospermum]]. Cf. William Smith (ed.), ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', Third edition, New York 1858, s.v. \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (\"gingidium\"), \"a kind of chervil.\" [[Ibn Baytar]], citing [[Galen]], explains ''Gingidium'' as rather meaning a species of [[wild carrot]] (e.g. ''Daucus gingidium'', or something similar).

Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary. The first \"bishop of the Croats\" is named ''Marko Giudice'', and he and his successors were attached to the royal court as preachers and king's \"special bishops\" until 1102.<ref>''[[Illyricum sacrum]]'', IV (Venice, 1775)</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=23}}\n\nIn the second half of the 11th century, Knin became a more permanent royal residence of king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] around 1080.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia. Thus, these territories ''de facto'' continued to remain outside the monarchy, and the [[Nelipi\u0107 noble family]] made Knin their permanent seat and ruled their territories as \"Princes of Knin\".\n\nAfter successfully warring against their enemies, the Dalmatian cities and nobility under [[George II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Juraj II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]] (who was imprisoned in the castle's dungeons), as well as the royal forces commanded by the [[Ban of Slavonia|Slavonian ban]] ''Mikac Prodani\u0107'',<ref>Miha Madijev, cap.

The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]].

A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n[[File:Spomenik hrvatske pobjede Oluja 95 16 obljetnica vojnoredarstvene operacije Oluja 04082011 5047-2.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of the Croatian Victory \"Storm '95\"]]\n{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}\nFrom October 1990,<ref name=\"The war\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|title=Kronologija Domovinskog rata u Lici i Sjevernoj Dalmaciji|accessdate=26 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125151650/http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|archivedate=25 November 2014}}</ref> eight months before Croatia [[Croatian War of Independence|declared independence]] (June 25, 1991) from [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], Knin became the main stronghold for the [[Serbs]] in the [[Kninska Krajina|Knin region]], eventually becoming the capital city of the internationally unrecognised [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Knin-Domovinski Rat\">[http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20051126063710/http://www.knin.hr/stranice/o_kninu/domovinski_rat.asp Knin-Domovinski Rat]</ref> The leaders of ''Krajina'' were Knin locals: [[Milan Marti\u0107]] and [[Milan Babi\u0107]], both convicted for [[ethnic cleansing]] of Croats and other non-Serbs from Krajina by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]].<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612_summary_en.pdf|title=Summary of Judgement for Milan Marti\u0107|accessdate=18 May 2011|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]}}</ref> Widespread acts of murder and violence, detention and intimidation became pervasive throughout the RSK territory from 1992 to 1995.<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\" /> During that time 93,9% of Croats were expelled from the town and municipality of Knin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://narod.hr/kultura/19-ozujka-1993-knin-znate-li-da-su-srbi-protjerali-iz-grada-i-okolice-cak-94-hrvata|title=18. o\u017eujka 1993.

Although the city is only some 50&nbsp;km (31&nbsp;mi) from the Adriatic Sea, an arm of the Mediterranean, the proximity of the Dinaric Alps to the north alters its climate. Knin is particularly known for its hot summers: temperatures reaching 40&nbsp;\u00b0C (104&nbsp;\u00b0F) are not uncommon in July and August. The January average temperature is about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C and in August is about 24&nbsp;\u00b0C\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Knin (1971\u20132000, extremes 1949\u20132017)\n|width = auto\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 20.5\n|Feb record high C = 22.3\n|Mar record high C = 27.6\n|Apr record high C = 29.2\n|May record high C = 34.2\n|Jun record high C = 39.3\n|Jul record high C = 40.9\n|Aug record high C = 42.3\n|Sep record high C = 37.4\n|Oct record high C = 31.6\n|Nov record high C = 27.6\n|Dec record high C = 21.6\n|year record high C = 42.3\n| Jan high C = 8.9\n| Feb high C = 10.4\n| Mar high C = 14.1\n| Apr high C = 17.4\n| May high C = 23.0\n| Jun high C = 26.6\n| Jul high C = 30.1\n| Aug high C = 30.3\n| Sep high C = 25.4\n| Oct high C = 19.9\n| Nov high C = 13.7\n| Dec high C = 9.9\n|year high C = 19.1\n|Jan mean C = 4.0\n|Feb mean C = 5.1\n|Mar mean C = 8.2\n|Apr mean C = 11.5\n|May mean C = 16.6\n|Jun mean C = 20.1\n|Jul mean C = 23.0\n|Aug mean C = 22.5\n|Sep mean C = 18.0\n|Oct mean C = 13.3\n|Nov mean C = 8.2\n|Dec mean C = 5.0\n|year mean C = 13.0\n| Jan low C = -0.2\n| Feb low C = 0.7\n| Mar low C = 3.3\n| Apr low C = 6.5\n| May low C = 10.6\n| Jun low C = 13.8\n| Jul low C = 16.2\n| Aug low C = 16.0\n| Sep low C = 12.2\n| Oct low C = 8.3\n| Nov low C = 3.8\n| Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C = 7.7\n|Jan record low C = -18.3\n|Feb record low C = -18.4\n|Mar record low C = -14.0\n|Apr record low C = -4.1\n|May record low C = -0.4\n|Jun record low C = 4.3\n|Jul record low C = 8.1\n|Aug record low C = 6.8\n|Sep record low C = 1.0\n|Oct record low C = -3.3\n|Nov record low C = -8.5\n|Dec record low C = -15.4\n|year record low C = -18.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 75.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 69.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 74.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 92.0\n|May precipitation mm = 90.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 81.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 43.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 61.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 108.1\n|Oct precipitation mm = 114.3\n|Nov precipitation mm = 112.3\n|Dec precipitation mm = 101.7\n|year precipitation mm = 1025.8\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan precipitation days = 10.7\n| Feb precipitation days = 9.2\n| Mar precipitation days = 9.6\n| Apr precipitation days = 11.8\n| May precipitation days = 11.4\n| Jun precipitation days = 10.8\n| Jul precipitation days = 6.4\n| Aug precipitation days = 7.1\n| Sep precipitation days = 8.8\n| Oct precipitation days = 10.5\n| Nov precipitation days = 11.0\n| Dec precipitation days = 11.0\n|year precipitation days = 118.4\n|unit snow days = 1.0 cm\n|Jan snow days = 1.3\n|Feb snow days = 1.2\n|Mar snow days = 0.2\n|Apr snow days = 0.0\n|May snow days = 0.0\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.0\n|Oct snow days = 0.0\n|Nov snow days = 0.3\n|Dec snow days = 0.5\n|year snow days = 3.5\n|Jan humidity = 69.0\n|Feb humidity = 63.5\n|Mar humidity = 62.2\n|Apr humidity = 63.1\n|May humidity = 63.6\n|Jun humidity = 62.1\n|Jul humidity = 56.1\n|Aug humidity = 58.3\n|Sep humidity = 65.8\n|Oct humidity = 69.2\n|Nov humidity = 70.1\n|Dec humidity = 70.3\n|year humidity = 64.4\n|Jan sun = 120.9\n|Feb sun = 146.9\n|Mar sun = 182.9\n|Apr sun = 189.0\n|May sun = 244.9\n|Jun sun = 270.0\n|Jul sun = 325.5\n|Aug sun = 297.6\n|Sep sun = 234.0\n|Oct sun = 182.9\n|Nov sun = 123.0\n|Dec sun = 108.5\n|year sun =\n| source 1 = [[Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service]]<ref name= DHMZ >{{cite web\n| url = http://klima.hr/k1/k1_2/knin.pdf\n| title = Knin Climate Normals\n| accessdate = 3 December 2015\n| publisher = Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service}}</ref><ref name=monthlyvalues>{{cite web\n| url = http://klima.hr/klima.php?id=k1&param=srednjak&Grad=knin\n| title = Mjese\u010dne vrijednosti za Knin u razdoblju 1949\u22122014\n| language = Croatian\n| accessdate = 3 December 2015\n| publisher = Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service}}</ref>\n|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Knin i Dinara.jpg|thumb|right|View of Knin and the [[Dinara]] mountain]]\n[[File:Kninska crkva u izgradnji.JPG|thumb|Our Lady of the Great Croatian Baptismal Vow church]]\n[[File:Arhitektura Bizanta u Kninu.JPG|thumb|Serbian Orthodox church in Knin]]\n\nIn the 2011 census, Knin (city) has 10,493 citizens, while the Knin municipality has 15,388.<ref name=\"census2011\"/> In the 2001 census, the population of Knin was 11,128 in the city and 15,190 in the municipality, and the majority of its citizens were Croats with 76.45% and Serbs with 20.8%.<ref name=\"census2001\">[http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/Census2001/Popis/H01_02_02/H01_02_02_zup15.html 2001 Croatian census]</ref> \n\nKnin has seen steep [[population decline]], not least due to high emigration rates, especially since Croatia joined the EU in 2013 and its [[Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union|citizens consequently face few to no work and immigration restrictions]].

There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the [[overhead line|catenary]] being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s). [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] had started from [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] inland towards the coast and had only reached Knin, so today the Knin station sidings are equipped with overhead catenary, but lines leaving the town are not.\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki-kolodvor-postaja-Knin-05082016-02-roberta-f.jpg|thumb|right|Knin railway station's platforms, notice the lack of catenary wires, and the presence of the poles only]]\n\n==Towns and villages in the municipality==\n\n*[[Golubi\u0107, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Golubi\u0107]]\n*Knin\nBiskupija\n*[[Kninsko Polje]]\n*[[Kova\u010di\u0107, Croatia|Kova\u010di\u0107]]\n*[[Ljuba\u010d, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Ljuba\u010d]]\n*[[O\u0107estovo]]\nOrlic\n*[[Plavno, Croatia|Plavno]]\n*[[Pola\u010da, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Pola\u010da]]\n*[[Potkonje]]\n*[[Radljevac]]\n*[[Strmica, Croatia|Strmica]]\n*[[Vrpolje, Knin|Vrpolje]]\n*[[\u017dagrovi\u0107]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Croatia}}\n* [[Church of Saint Anthony, Knin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|ref={{harvid|ICJ|3 February 2015}}|title=Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia.

The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]]. The armistice was generally respected by all sides,<ref>[[Ive Ma\u017euran]]: Povijest Hrvatske od 15. stolje\u0107a do 18. stolje\u0107a, p. 44-45</ref> during which Knin's defensive positions were strengthened in 1504. A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

After the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] in 1805, the French Empire gained the city and incorporated it into the [[Illyrian Provinces]] in 1809. By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the [[Habsburg]] domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n[[File:Spomenik hrvatske pobjede Oluja 95 16 obljetnica vojnoredarstvene operacije Oluja 04082011 5047-2.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of the Croatian Victory \"Storm '95\"]]\n{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}\nFrom October 1990,<ref name=\"The war\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|title=Kronologija Domovinskog rata u Lici i Sjevernoj Dalmaciji|accessdate=26 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125151650/http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|archivedate=25 November 2014}}</ref> eight months before Croatia [[Croatian War of Independence|declared independence]] (June 25, 1991) from [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], Knin became the main stronghold for the [[Serbs]] in the [[Kninska Krajina|Knin region]], eventually becoming the capital city of the internationally unrecognised [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Knin-Domovinski Rat\">[http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20051126063710/http://www.knin.hr/stranice/o_kninu/domovinski_rat.asp Knin-Domovinski Rat]</ref> The leaders of ''Krajina'' were Knin locals: [[Milan Marti\u0107]] and [[Milan Babi\u0107]], both convicted for [[ethnic cleansing]] of Croats and other non-Serbs from Krajina by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]].<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612_summary_en.pdf|title=Summary of Judgement for Milan Marti\u0107|accessdate=18 May 2011|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]}}</ref> Widespread acts of murder and violence, detention and intimidation became pervasive throughout the RSK territory from 1992 to 1995.<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\" /> During that time 93,9% of Croats were expelled from the town and municipality of Knin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://narod.hr/kultura/19-ozujka-1993-knin-znate-li-da-su-srbi-protjerali-iz-grada-i-okolice-cak-94-hrvata|title=18. o\u017eujka 1993.

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the [[overhead line|catenary]] being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s). [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] had started from [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] inland towards the coast and had only reached Knin, so today the Knin station sidings are equipped with overhead catenary, but lines leaving the town are not.\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki-kolodvor-postaja-Knin-05082016-02-roberta-f.jpg|thumb|right|Knin railway station's platforms, notice the lack of catenary wires, and the presence of the poles only]]\n\n==Towns and villages in the municipality==\n\n*[[Golubi\u0107, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Golubi\u0107]]\n*Knin\nBiskupija\n*[[Kninsko Polje]]\n*[[Kova\u010di\u0107, Croatia|Kova\u010di\u0107]]\n*[[Ljuba\u010d, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Ljuba\u010d]]\n*[[O\u0107estovo]]\nOrlic\n*[[Plavno, Croatia|Plavno]]\n*[[Pola\u010da, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Pola\u010da]]\n*[[Potkonje]]\n*[[Radljevac]]\n*[[Strmica, Croatia|Strmica]]\n*[[Vrpolje, Knin|Vrpolje]]\n*[[\u017dagrovi\u0107]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Croatia}}\n* [[Church of Saint Anthony, Knin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|ref={{harvid|ICJ|3 February 2015}}|title=Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.
