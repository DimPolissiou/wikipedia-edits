{"title_page": "Quiet Revolution", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\nThe '''Quiet Revolution''' ({{lang-fr|R\u00e9volution tranquille}}) was a period of intense socio-political and socio-cultural change in the [[Canadian province]] of [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]], characterized by the effective [[secularization]] of government, the creation of a state-run [[welfare state]] (''\u00e9tat-providence''), and realignment of politics into [[Quebec federalism|federalist]] and [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] (or [[Separatism|separatist]]) factions and the eventual election of a pro-sovereignty provincial government in the [[1976 Quebec general election|1976 election]]. The Quiet Revolution typically refers to the efforts made by the Liberal government of [[Jean Lesage]] (elected in 1960), and sometimes [[Robert Bourassa]] (elected in 1970 after the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'s [[Daniel Johnson Sr.|Daniel Johnson]] in 1966), though given the profound effect of the changes, most provincial governments since the early 1960s have maintained an orientation based on core concepts developed and implemented in that era.\n\nA primary change was an effort by the provincial government to take more direct control over the fields of health care and education, which had previously been in the hands of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It created ministries of [[Ministry of Health and Social Services (Quebec)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Education]], expanded the public service, and made massive investments in the public education system and provincial infrastructure. The government further allowed [[trade union|unionization]] of the [[civil service]].

The Quiet Revolution typically refers to the efforts made by the Liberal government of [[Jean Lesage]] (elected in 1960), and sometimes [[Robert Bourassa]] (elected in 1970 after the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'s [[Daniel Johnson Sr.|Daniel Johnson]] in 1966), though given the profound effect of the changes, most provincial governments since the early 1960s have maintained an orientation based on core concepts developed and implemented in that era.\n\nA primary change was an effort by the provincial government to take more direct control over the fields of health care and education, which had previously been in the hands of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It created ministries of [[Ministry of Health and Social Services (Quebec)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Education]], expanded the public service, and made massive investments in the public education system and provincial infrastructure. The government further allowed [[trade union|unionization]] of the [[civil service]]. It took measures to increase Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois control over [[economy of Quebec|the province's economy]] and [[Nationalization|nationalized]] electricity production and distribution and worked to establish the [[Canada Pension Plan|Canada/Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan]]. [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] was also created in an attempt to nationalize Qu\u00e9bec's electric companies. French-Canadians in Qu\u00e9bec also adopted the new name 'Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois', trying to create a separate identity from France and establish themselves as a reformed province.\n\nThe Quiet Revolution was a period of unbridled economic and social development in [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[Canada]] and paralleled similar developments in the [[Western world|West]] in general. It was a byproduct of Canada's 20-year post-war expansion and Qu\u00e9bec's position as the leading province for more than a century before and after [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]]. It witnessed particular changes to the built environment and social structures of [[Montreal]], Qu\u00e9bec's leading city. The Quiet Revolution also extended beyond Qu\u00e9bec's borders by virtue of its influence on contemporary Canadian politics. During the same era of renewed Quebecois nationalism,<ref>{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |url= https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8 |url-access= registration |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= [https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8/page/372 372] }}</ref> French Canadians made great inroads into both the structure and direction of the federal government and national policy. Moreover, certain facets of the welfare state, as they developed in Qu\u00e9bec in the 1960s, became nationalized by virtue of Qu\u00e9bec's acceptance and promotion. This would include [[rural electrification]] and healthcare initiatives undertaken by [[Tommy Douglas]] in [[Saskatchewan]] twenty years earlier.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:PlaceDArmes by Msteckiw.jpg|thumb|The hill leading to [[Place d'Armes]] in Montreal, an important historic site of French Canada]]\n\nThe Quiet Revolution began with the enacted [[Parti lib\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec|Liberal]] provincial government of [[Jean Lesage]], who was elected in the June [[1960 Quebec general election|1960 provincial election]], shortly after the death of Premier [[Maurice Duplessis]], whose tenure was known by some as the [[Grande Noirceur]] (Great Darkness), but viewed by conservatives as epitomizing a religiously and culturally pure Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, the government of Qu\u00e9bec was controlled by the conservative Duplessis, leader of the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] party. Not all the Catholic Church supported Duplessis - some Catholic unions and members of the clergy criticized him, including Montreal Archbishop [[Joseph Charbonneau]] - but the bulk of the small-town and rural clergy supported him.<ref name=\"Behiels 1985\">{{cite book |last=Behiels |first=Michael |title=Prelude to Quebec's Quiet Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/preludetoquebecs0000behi |url-access=registration |date=1985 |publisher=McGill}}</ref> Some quoted the Union Nationale slogan ''Le ciel est bleu, l'enfer est rouge'' (The sky (Heaven) is blue, Hell is red) as a reference to the colours of the Union Nationale (blue) and the Liberals (red), the latter accused often of being pro-communist.{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} [[Radio-Canada]], the newspaper ''[[Le Devoir]]'' and political journal ''[[Cit\u00e9 Libre]]'' were [[intellectual]] forums for critics of the Duplessis government.<ref name=\"Behiels 1985\" />\n\nPrior to the Quiet Revolution, the province's natural resources were developed mainly by foreign investors.{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} As an example, the process of mining iron ore was developed by the US-based [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]].

The 1949 [[Asbestos Strike]] found Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois miners united against a nationalist foreign corporation.

In 1963, in conjunction with the [[Canada Pension Plan]] the government of Canada authorized the province to create its own ''R\u00e9gie des Rentes du Qu\u00e9bec'' (RRQ, Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan); universal contributions came into effect in 1966.

The bill also restricted the eligibility for elementary and high school students to attend school in English, allowing this only for children of parents who had studied in English in Qu\u00e9bec.

Though the improvements made to Qu\u00e9bec society during this era make it seem like an extremely innovative period, it has been posited that these changes follow a logical revolutionary movement occurring throughout North America in the 1960s. Noted Qu\u00e9bec historian {{interlanguage link|Jacques Rouillard|fr|vertical-align=sup}} took this [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] stance in arguing that the Quiet Revolution may have accelerated the natural evolution of Quebec\u2019s francophone society rather than having turned it on its head.<ref name=\"Jacques Rouillard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La r\u00e9volution tranquille, rupture ou tournant? |author=Jacques Rouillard |date=Winter 1998 |work=32:4 |publisher=Journal of Canadian Studies/Revue d\u2019\u00e9tudes canadiennes |accessdate=September 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514054757/http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral arguments support this view. From an economic perspective, Quebec\u2019s manufacturing sector had seen important growth since the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Buoyed by significant manufacturing demand during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the Qu\u00e9bec economy was already expanding before the events of the Quiet Revolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La r\u00e9volution tranquille, rupture ou tournant?

He notes the popularity enjoyed by federal Liberal Prime Minister [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] as well as the Premiership of [[Ad\u00e9lard Godbout]] as examples of Qu\u00e9bec Liberalism prior to the events of the Quiet Revolution. The Godbout administration was extremely innovative. Its notable achievements include nationalizing the electricity distribution network of the city of Montreal, granting universal suffrage, instituting mandatory schooling until the age of 14 and establishing various social programs in Qu\u00e9bec.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La r\u00e9volution tranquille, rupture ou tournant?

The atomic number of these nuclei was estimated to be between 105 and 130, with one nucleus likely constrained between 113 and 129, and their lifetimes were estimated to be at least 3,000 years. Although this observation has yet to be confirmed in independent studies, it strongly suggests the existence of the island of stability, and is consistent with theoretical calculations of half-lives of these nuclides.<ref name=oly1>{{cite journal |last1=Bagulya |first1=A.
