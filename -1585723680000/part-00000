An item is not a gift if that item is already owned by the one to whom it is given. Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is meant to be free. In many countries, the act of mutually exchanging [[money]], [[property|goods]], etc. may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion. Economists have elaborated the [[economics]] of gift-giving into the notion of a [[gift economy]]. By extension the term ''gift'' can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other [[happiness|happier]] or less sad, especially as a favor, including [[forgiveness]] and [[kindness]]. Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions such as [[birthday]]s and [[holiday]]s.\n\n== Presentation ==\nIn many cultures gifts are traditionally packaged in some way. For example, in Western cultures, gifts are often wrapped in [[wrapping paper]] and accompanied by a [[gift note]] which may note the occasion, the recipient's name and the giver's name. In Chinese culture, red wrapping connotes luck. Although inexpensive gifts are common among colleagues, associates and acquaintances, expensive or amorous gifts are considered more appropriate among close friends, romantic interests or relatives.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brigham|first1=John Carl|title=Social Psychology|date=1986|page=322}}</ref>\n\n== Gift-giving occasions  ==\nGift-giving occasions may be:\n* An expression of [[coronation]] event recognition personal coronation gift presented by the newly crowned monarch to the official coronation guest by the court protocol for level\n* An expression of [[coronation]] acknowledgement for national event Official coronation gift, Royal or Imperial commissioned by the coronation commission presented to the newly crowned monarch, as personal memento.    \n* An expression of [[love]] or [[friendship]]\n* An expression of [[gratitude]] for a gift received.\n* An expression of [[piety]], in the form of [[alms|charity]].\n* An expression of [[solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]], in the form of [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]].\n* To share wealth.\n* To offset misfortune.\n* Offering travel [[souvenir]]s.\n* Custom, on occasions (often [[celebration (party)|celebrations]]) such as\n** A [[birthday]] (the person who has his or her birthday gives [[cake]], etc. and/or receives gifts).\n** A [[potlatch]], in societies where status is associated with gift-giving rather than acquisition.\n** [[Christmas]] (throughout the history of Christmas gift giving, people have given one another gifts, often pretending they are left by [[Santa Claus]], the [[Christ Child]] or [[Saint Nicholas]]).\n** [[Feast of Saint Nicholas]] (people give each other gifts, often supposedly receiving them from Saint Nicholas).\n** Easter baskets with chocolate eggs, jelly beans, and chocolate rabbits are gifts given on [[Easter]].\n** [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christians]] in Greece, will give gifts to family and friends on the Feast of [[Saint Basil]].\n** [[Muslims]] give gifts to family and friends, known as [[Eidi (gift)|Eidi]], on [[Eid al-Fitr]] (the end of [[Ramadan]]) and on [[Eid al-Adha]].\n** American [[Jews]] give [[Hanukkah]] gifts to family and friends.\n** [[Hindus]] give [[Diwali]] and [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]] gifts to family and friends.\n** [[Buddhists]] give [[Vesak]] gifts to family and friends.\n** Gifts are given to among [[African American]] families and friends on [[Kwanzaa]].\n** A [[wedding]] (the couple receives gifts and gives [[food]] and/or [[drink]]s at the [[wedding reception]]).\n** A [[wedding anniversary]] (each spouse receives gifts).\n** A [[funeral]] (visitors bring flowers, the relatives of the deceased give food and/or drinks after the ceremonial part).\n** A [[Childbirth|birth]] (the baby receives gifts, or the mother receives a gift from the father known as a [[push present]]).\n** Passing an [[Test (assessment)|examination]] (the [[student]] receives gifts).\n** [[Father's Day]] (the [[father]] receives gifts).\n** [[Mother's Day]] (the [[mother]] receives gifts).\n** [[Siblings Day]] (the [[sibling]] receives gifts)\n** Exchange of gifts between a guest and a host, often a traditional practice.\n** [[Lagniappe]]\n** [[Retirement]] Gifts\n** [[:wikt:congratulations|Congratulations]] Gifts\n** [[Engagement]] Gifts\n** [[Housewarming party]] Gifts\n** [[International Women's Day|women's day]] Gifts\n\n== Promotional gifts ==\nPromotional gifts vary from the normal gifts. The recipients of the gifts may be either employee of a company or the clients. Promotional gifts are mainly used for advertising purposes. They are used to promote the brand name and increase its awareness among the people. In promotional gifting procedures, the quality and presentation of the gifts hold more value than the gifts itself since it will act as a gateway to acquire new clients or associates.\n\n== As reinforcement and manipulation ==\nGiving a gift to someone is not necessarily just an altruistic act. It may be given in the hope that the receiver [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocates]] in a particular way. It may take the form of [[positive reinforcement]] as a [[Reward system|reward]] for [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], possibly for an underhand [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and [[abusive]] purpose.<ref name=braiker>{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ?

An item is not a gift if that item is already owned by the one to whom it is given. Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is meant to be free. In many countries, the act of mutually exchanging [[money]], [[property|goods]], etc. may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion. Economists have elaborated the [[economics]] of gift-giving into the notion of a [[gift economy]]. By extension the term ''gift'' can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other [[happiness|happier]] or less sad, especially as a favor, including [[forgiveness]] and [[kindness]]. Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions such as [[birthday]]s and [[holiday]]s.\n\n== Presentation ==\nIn many cultures gifts are traditionally packaged in some way. For example, in Western cultures, gifts are often wrapped in [[wrapping paper]] and accompanied by a [[gift note]] which may note the occasion, the recipient's name and the giver's name. In Chinese culture, red wrapping connotes luck. Although inexpensive gifts are common among colleagues, associates and acquaintances, expensive or amorous gifts are considered more appropriate among close friends, romantic interests or relatives.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brigham|first1=John Carl|title=Social Psychology|date=1986|page=322}}</ref>\n\n== Gift-giving occasions  ==\nGift-giving occasions may be:\n* An expression of [[coronation]] event recognition personal coronation gift presented by the newly crowned monarch to the official coronation guest by the court protocol for level\n* An expression of [[coronation]] acknowledgement for national event Official coronation gift, Royal or Imperial commissioned by the coronation commission presented to the newly crowned monarch, as personal memento.    \n* An expression of [[love]] or [[friendship]]\n* An expression of [[gratitude]] for a gift received.\n* An expression of [[piety]], in the form of [[alms|charity]].\n* An expression of [[solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]], in the form of [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]].\n* To share wealth.\n* To offset misfortune.\n* Offering travel [[souvenir]]s.\n* Custom, on occasions (often [[celebration (party)|celebrations]]) such as\n** A [[birthday]] (the person who has his or her birthday gives [[cake]], etc. and/or receives gifts).\n** A [[potlatch]], in societies where status is associated with gift-giving rather than acquisition.\n** [[Christmas]] (throughout the history of Christmas gift giving, people have given one another gifts, often pretending they are left by [[Santa Claus]], the [[Christ Child]] or [[Saint Nicholas]]).\n** [[Feast of Saint Nicholas]] (people give each other gifts, often supposedly receiving them from Saint Nicholas).\n** Easter baskets with chocolate eggs, jelly beans, and chocolate rabbits are gifts given on [[Easter]].\n** [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christians]] in Greece, will give gifts to family and friends on the Feast of [[Saint Basil]].\n** [[Muslims]] give gifts to family and friends, known as [[Eidi (gift)|Eidi]], on [[Eid al-Fitr]] (the end of [[Ramadan]]) and on [[Eid al-Adha]].\n** American [[Jews]] give [[Hanukkah]] gifts to family and friends.\n** [[Hindus]] give [[Diwali]] and [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]] gifts to family and friends.\n** [[Buddhists]] give [[Vesak]] gifts to family and friends.\n** Gifts are given to among [[African American]] families and friends on [[Kwanzaa]].\n** A [[wedding]] (the couple receives gifts and gives [[food]] and/or [[drink]]s at the [[wedding reception]]).\n** A [[wedding anniversary]] (each spouse receives gifts).\n** A [[funeral]] (visitors bring flowers, the relatives of the deceased give food and/or drinks after the ceremonial part).\n** A [[Childbirth|birth]] (the baby receives gifts, or the mother receives a gift from the father known as a [[push present]]).\n** Passing an [[Test (assessment)|examination]] (the [[student]] receives gifts).\n** [[Father's Day]] (the [[father]] receives gifts).\n** [[Mother's Day]] (the [[mother]] receives gifts).\n** [[Siblings Day]] (the [[sibling]] receives gifts)\n** Exchange of gifts between a guest and a host, often a traditional practice.\n** [[Lagniappe]]\n** [[Retirement]] Gifts\n** [[:wikt:congratulations|Congratulations]] Gifts\n** [[Engagement]] Gifts\n** [[Housewarming party]] Gifts\n** [[International Women's Day|women's day]] Gifts\n\n== Promotional gifts ==\nPromotional gifts vary from the normal gifts. The recipients of the gifts may be either employee of a company or the clients. Promotional gifts are mainly used for advertising purposes. They are used to promote the brand name and increase its awareness among the people. In promotional gifting procedures, the quality and presentation of the gifts hold more value than the gifts itself since it will act as a gateway to acquire new clients or associates.\n\n== As reinforcement and manipulation ==\nGiving a gift to someone is not necessarily just an altruistic act. It may be given in the hope that the receiver [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocates]] in a particular way. It may take the form of [[positive reinforcement]] as a [[Reward system|reward]] for [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], possibly for an underhand [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and [[abusive]] purpose.<ref name=braiker>{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ?

There was peace between the families.\n\n===The shooting of Khaled Taleb: 30 July 2003===\n\nThe feud was reignited more than 2 years after the [[kneecapping]] of Bilal Razzak.\n\nTaleb, who had been Adnan Darwiche's right-hand man in his former drug business, was shot by 2 masked men as he spoke to a friend in the Halal's Butcher shop in [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]]. He was shot in both legs. Taleb believed that the gunmen were Gehad and Ziad Razzak, although nobody was ever charged in relation to the shooting.\n\nAccording to Taleb, Adnan Darwiche said that if the Razzaks were responsible then ''\" they're gonna cop it, they're dead...this is it I'm either gonna die or spend the rest of my life in gaol, it's on\"'' and ''\"this was it the Razzak's and they were all dead\"''.\n\n===The Yanderra Street shooting: 27 August 2003===\n\nAdnan Darwiche concluded that the Razzaks were responsible. According to Taleb, on 25 August 2003 Adnan and Abdul Darwiche, Touma and Aouad visited him and told him they had discovered that Gehad and Ziad Razzak were living at Yanderra Street, Condell Park. Adnan Darwiche said ''\"this is what's gonna happen. Fidel can drive down the road and shoot at their house, then they come out to see what the fuck happened, I and Abdul will be standing on the corner with SKS's and blast em\"''.\n\nOn the evening of 27 August, 2003 Adnan Darwiche and another man (suspected to be Abdul Darwiche, although he was later acquitted) took up positions near the Yanderra Street house. They were both armed with [[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifle]]s. A third man (suspected to be Aouad, although he was never charged) drove to the house and fired 11 shots at a car parked outside the house.\n\nFarouk Razzak came out of the house to investigate. He saw \"like some shadow go towards the right, under the dark, the trees...suddenly I see two different persons. Since I saw them I yell to them, I swear to them 'Hey boy, what you fucking' \u2013 and then the fire comes out of the gun, they did not let me finish my words...and I turn back and I walk just normal.

I put the handle and the bullets, I think it must miss my eyes maybe one millimeter and, my head, my everywhere. They stop me. I think second on the door, I can't move. The handle comes off in my hand, and I feel burn\".\n\nThe gunmen fired 55 rounds, but Farouk Razzak was not hit. Nor were the other occupants of the house, his wife Nahla, son Mohamad and daughter Jomana. The gunmen were so inaccurate that shots hit houses as far east as no. 96 (five houses down the street). Farouk yelled to Nahla \"Listen, that pigs, Abdul and Eddie, they shot me\".<ref name=\"2006 NSWSC 848\">{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|848|2006|litigants=R v Abdul Darwiche |date=8 March 2006 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to Taleb, Darwiche said after the shooting ''\"Ziggy came out on the porch and then Frank came out. Ziggy had a gun and was looking around. I and Abdul blasted em, fuckin missed.\"'' and ''\"Fuck them. Fuck all of them.\"''\n\n===The murder of Ali Abdul Razzak: 29 August 2003===\n\nAccording to Jamal Razzak, he was assaulted by Adnan and Abdul Darwiche and another man in Greenacre at 11:30 am. He alleged that Abdul Darwiche pointed an assault style rifle at him through the passenger window of a vehicle. No charges were ever laid in relation to this alleged incident.\n\nAt 1:23 pm Ali Abdul Razzak was shot and killed while seated in his car which was parked near the Lakemba Mosque. Witnesses observed a small black hatchback vehicle that stopped in front of Razzak's vehicle. The driver and passenger of the black hatchback were wearing balaclavas.

Osman was assigned the role of driver. Adnan and Touma were to use the [[SKS]] rifles, Aouad was to use a [[Mac 10]].

Adnan Darwiche threatened Razzak, saying ''\"OK I can do this anytime...I want you to give me Bilal or he must leave the country.\"''\n\nRazzak obliged on 7 March 2001, fleeing to Lebanon.

He abandoned his drug business and became deeply [[religious]], attending the [[Hajj]] in 2002 and 2003. There was peace between the families.\n\n===The shooting of Khaled Taleb: 30 July 2003===\n\nThe feud was reignited more than 2 years after the [[kneecapping]] of Bilal Razzak.\n\nTaleb, who had been Adnan Darwiche's right-hand man in his former drug business, was shot by 2 masked men as he spoke to a friend in the Halal's Butcher shop in [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]]. He was shot in both legs. Taleb believed that the gunmen were Gehad and Ziad Razzak, although nobody was ever charged in relation to the shooting.\n\nAccording to Taleb, Adnan Darwiche said that if the Razzaks were responsible then ''\"they're gunna cop it, they're dead...this is it I'm either gunna die or spend the rest of my life in gaol, it's on\"'' and ''\"this was it the Razzak's and they were all dead\"''.\n\n===The Yanderra Street shooting: 27 August 2003===\n\nAdnan Darwiche concluded that the Razzaks were responsible. According to Taleb, on 25 August 2003 Adnan and Abdul Darwiche, Touma and Aouad visited him and told him they had discovered that Gehad and Ziad Razzak were living at Yanderra Street, Condell Park. Adnan Darwiche said ''\"this is what's gunna happen. Fidel can drive down the road and shoot at their house, then they come out to see what the fuck happened, me and Abdul will be standing on the corner with SKS's and blast em\"''.\n\nOn the evening of 27 August 2003 Adnan Darwiche and another man (suspected to be Abdul Darwiche, although he was later acquitted) took up positions near the Yanderra Street house. They were both armed with [[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifle]]s. A third man (suspected to be Aouad, although he was never charged) drove to the house and fired 11 shots at a car parked outside the house.\n\nFarouk Razzak came out of the house to investigate. He saw \"like some shadow go towards the right, under the dark, the trees...suddenly I see two different persons. Since I saw them I yell to them, I swear to them 'Hey boy, what you fucking' \u2013 and then the fire come out of the gun, they not let me finish my words...and I turn back and I walk just normal.

The handle come off in my hand, and I feel burn\".\n\nThe gunmen fired 55 rounds, but Farouk Razzak was not hit. Nor were the other occupants of the house, his wife Nahla, son Mohamad and daughter Jomana. The gunmen were so inaccurate that shots hit houses as far east as no. 96 (five houses down the street). Farouk yelled to Nahla \"Listen, that pigs, Abdul and Eddie, they shot me\".<ref name=\"2006 NSWSC 848\">{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|848|2006|litigants=R v Abdul Darwiche |date=8 March 2006 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to Taleb, Darwiche said after the shooting ''\"Ziggy came out on the porch and then Frank came out. Ziggy had a gun and was looking around. Me and Abdul blasted em, fuckin missed.\"'' and ''\"Fuck them. Fuck all of them.\"''\n\n===The murder of Ali Abdul Razzak: 29 August 2003===\n\nAccording to Jamal Razzak he was assaulted by Adnan and Abdul Darwiche and another man in Greenacre at 11:30am. He alleged that Abdul Darwiche pointed an assault style rifle at him through the passenger window of a vehicle. No charges were ever laid in relation to this alleged incident.\n\nAt 1:23pm Ali Abdul Razzak was shot and killed while seated in his car which was parked near the Lakemba Mosque. Witnesses observed a small black hatchback vehicle which stopped in front of Razzak's vehicle. The driver and passenger of the black hatchback were wearing balaclavas. The passenger got out of the car, holding a black pistol. He fired shots at Razzak and got back into the passenger seat of the vehicle, which drove off. 14 fired cartridge cases were found at the scene.\n\nAccording to Taleb, he was visited at his sister's house at about 2:00pm by Adnan Darwiche, Gary Awad and Touma. Darwiche said ''\"I waited, when he got in the car I unloaded a magazine on him, I saw one bullet hit him just above the eyebrow. I saw him take his last breath.\"'' and gave Taleb a.40 calibre Glock pistol to get rid of.\n\nDarwiche was later acquitted of Razzak's murder and nobody else has ever been charged.\n\nOn 30 August 2003 55 shots were fired at Aouad's family home in Liverpool and 65 shots fired at Taleb's house in Liverpool. According to Taleb, Aouad said to him a few days later ''\"I know it was that cunt Hussein'' [Fahda]'', Gehad, Ziggy and Mohammed for sure there's no doubt about it. They're going to cop it, they're gunna cop it, they're fuckin' dead, my parents nearly got hit.\"''\n\n===Stolen weapons: September/October 2003===\n\nMeanwhile, 31 Glock pistols were stolen from Obliging Security in Chester Hill.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/04/1062548951407.html?from=storyrhs|title=Robbers steal 34 guns from Obliging Security|date=2003-09-04|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2009-04-19}}</ref> (One of those weapons would later be found at the scene of a shootout involving El-Zeyat and Aouad.)\n\nZiad and Gehad Razzak went into hiding and stayed with a friend, Ali Hamka, who lived at 5 Lawford Street, Greenacre.

According to Taleb, he accompanied Darwiche on a drive past the house. A man later given the pseudonym \"Mr W\" testified that Osman drove him past the house, saying ''\"Just drive past, I don't want the Razzaks to recognize the car or me.

He said ''\"I will see you at Erdt's at two o'clock in the morning.

Present were Adnan Darwiche, Taleb, El-Zeyat, Aouad, Osman Darwiche and Awad. There was a discussion about whether or not to use the rocket launcher in the assault. Osman told Adnan ''\"you can't just use that because like you are meant to put them things on your ears to block your ears. You cannot use it if you were to use it like that. It will blow your eardrums out.\"'' It was decided not to use the rocket launcher. Adnan outlined each man's role: Taleb was to have been the driver, but it was considered that due to his injuries, he would become a liability if there was trouble. Osman was assigned the role of driver. Adnan and Touma were to use the [[SKS]] rifles, Aouad was to use a [[Mac 10]]. El-Zeyat insisted that he wanted to be one of the shooters too, and he was drafted into the plans and assigned a Glock.
