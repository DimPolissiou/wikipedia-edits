He guided Ireland to the knockout stage of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. He later managed [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].

He spent two years in the basement league, before the club won promotion. Two years later, the team again went up to the (old) Division 2. A strong central defender, he was a virtual ever-present for his hometown club, but departed in December 1983 for fellow Division 2 club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].\n\nThe [[Maine Road]] club won promotion in McCarthy's first full season and he finally had the chance to play at the highest level. His first season in the top flight was steady enough as the club reached midtable, but relegation struck the following year.

During the 1995\u201396 season, McCarthy became the prime candidate for the vacant [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] manager's job, after the resignation of [[Jack Charlton]]. After a protracted period of speculation, McCarthy was officially appointed on 5 February 1996, two days after his resignation at the club. Despite sitting a comfortable 14 points clear from the relegation zone at the time of his departure, Millwall would go on to suffer the drop (by virtue of goals scored) after McCarthy's departure.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHis loan signings of the underachieving [[Russia]]n internationals [[Sergei Yuran]] and [[Vassili Kulkov]] from [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], who each received a \u00a3150,000 signing-on fee and were being paid five times the wage of the rest of the first team, would later be cited {{by whom|date=November 2018}} as one of the main reasons Millwall were eventually relegated under [[Jimmy Nicholl]], although it cannot be proven.<ref name=\"Bethel\">Bethel, Chris; ''Millwall Football Club 1940\u20132001'' Tempus Publishing Ltd, 2001, p.122; {{ISBN|0-7524-2187-5}}</ref>\n\n===Republic of Ireland===\nIn February 1996, McCarthy became the new manager of the Republic of Ireland football team following the resignation of [[Jack Charlton]].\nMcCarthy's first game in charge of the Republic of Ireland team was a friendly international against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] on 27 March 1996 which finished in a 0\u20132 defeat.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Rob|date=19 March 2019|title=Where are they now?

Indeed, the narrowness of the elimination meant Ireland were the ninth best performers at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], and the fifth best among European teams in the competition. In spite of this, the Keane issue remained, with the proportion of blame undecided. Many in Ireland sided with Keane \u2013 particularly following a televised interview in which details of poor preparation were revealed \u2013 and demanded McCarthy's resignation both during and after the tournament. An independent inquiry into the organisation's handling of the squad's preparation later commissioned by the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] created a damning report, leading to general secretary Brendan Menton tendering his resignation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/1112/fai.html |title=Menton quits following damning FAI report| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209003252/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/1112/fai.html |archivedate=9 December 2008 |work=[[RT\u00c9]].ie|date= 12 November 2002 |accessdate= 19 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of McCarthy in the media became increasingly intense after a poor start to Ireland's [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 10|qualifying]] campaign for [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]].

From this awkward position, McCarthy managed to collect together a team from the club's youth ranks, and some lower league signings, and free transfers. Despite the lack of expectations, the team managed to make the promotion play-offs in McCarthy's first season, but it was third time unlucky for McCarthy in them as the team lost out to local rivals [[West Bromwich Albion]] over two legs, losing 3\u20132 at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] and 1\u20130 at [[The Hawthorns]].\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 in English football|2007\u201308 season]] he took the club to within a single placing of a successive play-off finish, ending seventh, losing the coveted sixth place to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] by a goal difference of only one (although another goal would have been required to overcome Watford's superior goals scored record).

football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|manager]], pundit and former player who was most recently the manager of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. Born in [[Barnsley, South Yorkshire|Barnsley]], England with an Irish father, he played for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on 57 occasions scoring two goals.\n\nMcCarthy began his playing career at [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in 1977, and he later had spells at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], and finally [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], retiring in 1992.\n\nHe went on to manage Millwall, and then the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. He guided Ireland to the knockout stage of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. He later managed [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He has also been a television pundit and [[Sports commentator|commentator]], including for the [[BBC]] and for [[Virgin Media Television (Ireland)|Virgin Media Television]]. He began a second tenure as manager of the Republic of Ireland football team in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2018/1124/1013087-stephen-kenny-to-replace-mccarthy-after-2020-finals/|title=Stephen Kenny to replace McCarthy after 2020 finals|date=2018-11-24|work=RTE.ie|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/soccer/fai-on-verge-of-agreement-for-both-mick-mccarthy-and-stephen-kenny-to-manage-ireland-887588.html|title=FAI on verge of agreement for BOTH Mick McCarthy and Stephen Kenny to manage Ireland|date=2018-11-24|access-date=2018-11-24}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n===Club===\nBorn in [[Barnsley, South Yorkshire|Barnsley, Yorkshire]],<ref name=Hugman/> McCarthy made his league debut for then-Fourth Division [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 20 August 1977 in a 4\u20130 win over [[Rochdale F.C.|Rochdale]]. He spent two years in the basement league, before the club won promotion. Two years later, the team again went up to the (old) Division 2. A strong central defender, he was a virtual ever-present for his hometown club, but departed in December 1983 for fellow Division 2 club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].\n\nThe [[Maine Road]] club won promotion in McCarthy's first full season and he finally had the chance to play at the highest level. His first season in the top flight was steady enough as the club reached midtable, but relegation struck the following year. McCarthy himself would not face the drop though as he moved to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in May 1987.<ref>{{cite news |date=15 August 1987 |page=13 |newspaper=[[the Guardian]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29537305/the_guardian/ |title=Accent Still on Merseyside |first=David |last=Lacey |via=[[Newspapers.com]] }}{{free access}}</ref>\n\nHe picked up his first silverware at the Scottish club as they won the league and cup double in his first season.

Making his international debut in a goalless friendly against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] on 23 May 1984, McCarthy soon became a first-choice player and featured in all three of Ireland's games at [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro '88]].

During the 1995\u201396 season, McCarthy became the prime candidate for the vacant [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] manager's job, after the resignation of [[Jack Charlton]]. After a protracted period of speculation, McCarthy was officially appointed on 5 February 1996, two days after his resignation at the club. Despite sitting a comfortable 14 points clear from the relegation zone at the time of his departure, Millwall would go on to suffer the drop (by virtue of goals scored) after McCarthy's departure.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHis loan signings of the underachieving [[Russia]]n internationals [[Sergei Yuran]] and [[Vassili Kulkov]] from [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], who each received a \u00a3150,000 signing-on fee and were being paid five times the wage of the rest of the first team, would later be cited {{by whom|date=November 2018}} as one of the main reasons Millwall were eventually relegated under [[Jimmy Nicholl]], although it cannot be proven.<ref name=\"Bethel\">Bethel, Chris; ''Millwall Football Club 1940\u20132001'' Tempus Publishing Ltd, 2001, p.122; {{ISBN|0-7524-2187-5}}</ref>\n\n===Republic of Ireland===\nIn February 1996, McCarthy became the new manager of the Republic of Ireland football team following the resignation of [[Jack Charlton]].\nMcCarthy's first game in charge of the Republic of Ireland team was a friendly international against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] on 27 March 1996 which finished in a 0\u20132 defeat.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Rob|date=19 March 2019|title=Where are they now?

Indeed, the narrowness of the elimination meant Ireland were the ninth best performers at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], and the fifth best among European teams in the competition. In spite of this, the Keane issue remained, with the proportion of blame undecided. Many in Ireland sided with Keane \u2013 particularly following a televised interview in which details of poor preparation were revealed \u2013 and demanded McCarthy's resignation both during and after the tournament. An independent inquiry into the organisation's handling of the squad's preparation later commissioned by the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] created a damning report, leading to general secretary Brendan Menton tendering his resignation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/1112/fai.html |title=Menton quits following damning FAI report| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209003252/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/1112/fai.html |archivedate=9 December 2008 |work=[[RT\u00c9]].ie|date= 12 November 2002 |accessdate= 19 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of McCarthy in the media became increasingly intense after a poor start to Ireland's [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 10|qualifying]] campaign for [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]]. In particular, his persistence with several players and tactics that some perceived to be inadequate did him damage, as did a 4\u20132 away defeat to [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and a 2\u20131 home defeat to [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. Under mounting pressure, McCarthy resigned from the post on 5 November 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/republic_of_ireland/2406549.stm |title=McCarthy quits Republic|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date= 6 November 2002 |accessdate= 19 August 2009}}</ref> During his 68 games in charge, the Republic of Ireland won 29, drew 20 and lost 19.<ref name=\"ROI\">{{cite web|url = http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-soccer-managers/mick-mccarthy.htm|title=Mick McCarthy \u2013 Irish Soccer Manager|publisher=Soccer Ireland|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Sunderland===\nOn 12 March 2003, he was appointed manager of struggling [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] as an immediate replacement for [[Howard Wilkinson]], who was sacked after six successive [[Premier League|Premiership]] defeats left the club facing near-certain relegation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/2838747.stm \"McCarthy unveiled as Sunderland boss\"] ''[[BBC News Online|news.BBC.co.uk]]'' (Sport), 12 March 2003 (Retrieved: 19 August 2009)</ref> McCarthy could not stop [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]'s slide, and the Black Cats were relegated at the end of the season, but he largely escaped blame and was retained as manager.

The Midlands club faced an uncertain future after having to sell the majority of their first-team players, though despite this situation, McCarthy promised [[Premier League]] football at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] within three seasons. From this awkward position, McCarthy managed to collect together a team from the club's youth ranks, and some lower league signings, and free transfers. Despite the lack of expectations, the team managed to make the promotion play-offs in McCarthy's first season, but it was third time unlucky for McCarthy in them as the team lost out to local rivals [[West Bromwich Albion]] over two legs, losing 3\u20132 at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] and 1\u20130 at [[The Hawthorns]].\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 in English football|2007\u201308 season]] he took the club to within a single placing of a successive play-off finish, ending seventh, losing the coveted sixth place to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] by a goal difference of only one (although another goal would have been required to overcome Watford's superior goals scored record). The campaign had also seen him linked with the international positions of [[Korea Republic National Football Team|South Korea]] and his previous post as Republic of Ireland manager.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7128801.stm \"McCarthy rules out Korea position\"] ''[[BBC News Online|news.BBC.co.uk]]'' (Sport), 5 December 2007 (Retrieved: 19 August 2009)</ref>\n\nThe [[2008-09 in English football|2008\u201309 season]] started well for McCarthy as he won the August [[Football League Championship Manager of the Month|Championship Manager of the Month Award]], after seeing his side reach the top of the table,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/7598391.stm \"Wolves boss scoops monthly award\"] ''[[BBC News Online|news.BBC.co.uk]]'' (Sport), 4 September 2008 (Retrieved: 19 August 2009)</ref> eventually going on to match Wolves' record start to a season (equaling the 1949\u201350 season).

The following week McCarthy clinched his second Championship as a manager after a 1\u20131 draw at his hometown club [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. He won the Championship Manager of the Season Award at the conclusion of the campaign, his side having led the table for 42 of 46 games.\n\nThe following season, McCarthy kept Wolves in the Premier League, his first success at this level in three attempts. The club assured safety with two games to spare, eventually finishing 15th, their best league finish since 1979\u201380, and their first ever survival in the modern Premier League.

California's interpretation of inverse condemnation is unique. The tenet is applied in other states, usually to government entities that damage private property when engaged in a public service. California's courts have ruled the principle can be applied to utilities. So the utilities are held liable for damage, even if they comply with all of California's strict energy-related rules.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=David |title=The California Rule That Doomed PG&E: Inverse Condemnation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-15/the-california-rule-that-doomed-pg-e-inverse-condemnation |website=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg LP |location=New York NY |date=January 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis policy resulted in $30B of liability for PG&E from the 2017 & 2018 fires and drove it to bankruptcy proceedings.{{ r | LAT_1 | p=1 | q=PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection in January in anticipation of massive legal fees resulting from wildfires linked to its electrical equipment in recent years. State law requires utilities to pay for such fires, regardless of whether a company&apos;s negligence may have caused the blaze. }}\n{{ r | LAT_2 | p=1 | q=Under state guidelines, a utility or its customers are responsible for paying property damages from wildfires linked to the company&apos;s equipment. With aging infrastructure electrifying remote areas of increasingly hot and dry terrain, the cost and risk have grown significantly in recent years. Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy, anticipating some $30 billion in liability for fires in 2017 and 2018, earlier this year. }}\nIn July 2019, a new $21 billion wildfire trust fund was created to pay for damages from future wildfires, started with a 50-50 balance of utility and customer monies and also reduced the liability threshold for utilities to where customers must prove negilgence before companies are held liable.{{ r | LAT_2 | p=1 | q=California&apos;s investor-owned utility companies have agreed to open up their wallets to pay into the state&apos;s wildfire fund in exchange for less financial responsibility when blazes are linked to their equipment. ... The fund, propped up by $21 billion split equally between utility customers and shareholders, is meant to act as a second insurance policy for publicly traded electricity companies and to offset concerns from Wall Street about massive monetary liabilities that have threatened to upend the energy market in California. ... The law takes $10.5 billion from electricity customers through the continuation of a charge on monthly bills that was set to expire next year. In return, wildfire costs that would typically lead to higher bills for customers will instead be paid out by the fund, potentially avoiding price hikes. ... For their $10.5 billion, the utilities are allowed to tap into the fund to pay wildfire damages that exceed insurance coverage. The law also shifts the burden of proof in regulatory proceedings \u2014 another benefit for the utilities \u2014 and requires outside groups to intervene to prove that the company failed to properly manage its system to prevent the fire. }}\n\nCritics of inverse condemnation point out that it can lead to utility bankruptcies which can threaten the integrity of the California power grid as well as hurt financing the states' efforts for renewable energy and against climate change, one of the causes of the intensified fire threat.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bradford |first1=Peter |title=Making PG&E pay more than its fair share of fire damage could backfire on the state |url=https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article212316269.html |work=Sacramento Bee |publisher=McClatchy Company |date=May 31, 2018 |location=Sacramento CA}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to court cases in recent years and the evolution of [[case law]] which have made new standards of legal liability, the [[Government of California|California State]] [[California State Legislature|legislature]] and the [[Governor of California|Governor]]<!-- it take both legislature and governor to enact a law; so action on both sides of the government of california here --> also enacted new [[statutory law]]s to modify the legal regime under which electrical utilities operate in California.

California's interpretation of inverse condemnation is unique. The tenet is applied in other states, usually to government entities that damage private property when engaged in a public service. California's courts have ruled the principle can be applied to utilities. So the utilities are held liable for damage, even if they comply with all of California's strict energy-related rules.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=David |title=The California Rule That Doomed PG&E: Inverse Condemnation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-15/the-california-rule-that-doomed-pg-e-inverse-condemnation |website=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg LP |location=New York NY |date=January 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis policy resulted in $30B of liability for PG&E from the 2017 & 2018 fires and drove it to bankruptcy proceedings.{{ r | LAT_1 | p=1 | q=PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection in January in anticipation of massive legal fees resulting from wildfires linked to its electrical equipment in recent years. State law requires utilities to pay for such fires, regardless of whether a company&apos;s negligence may have caused the blaze. }}\n{{ r | LAT_2 | p=1 | q=Under state guidelines, a utility or its customers are responsible for paying property damages from wildfires linked to the company&apos;s equipment. With aging infrastructure electrifying remote areas of increasingly hot and dry terrain, the cost and risk have grown significantly in recent years. Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy, anticipating some $30 billion in liability for fires in 2017 and 2018, earlier this year. }}\nIn July 2019, a new $21 billion wildfire trust fund was created to pay for damages from future wildfires, started with a 50-50 balance of utility and customer monies and also reduced the liability threshold for utilities to where customers must prove negilgence before companies are held liable.{{ r | LAT_2 | p=1 | q=California&apos;s investor-owned utility companies have agreed to open up their wallets to pay into the state&apos;s wildfire fund in exchange for less financial responsibility when blazes are linked to their equipment. ... The fund, propped up by $21 billion split equally between utility customers and shareholders, is meant to act as a second insurance policy for publicly traded electricity companies and to offset concerns from Wall Street about massive monetary liabilities that have threatened to upend the energy market in California. ... The law takes $10.5 billion from electricity customers through the continuation of a charge on monthly bills that was set to expire next year. In return, wildfire costs that would typically lead to higher bills for customers will instead be paid out by the fund, potentially avoiding price hikes. ... For their $10.5 billion, the utilities are allowed to tap into the fund to pay wildfire damages that exceed insurance coverage. The law also shifts the burden of proof in regulatory proceedings \u2014 another benefit for the utilities \u2014 and requires outside groups to intervene to prove that the company failed to properly manage its system to prevent the fire. }}\n\nCritics of inverse condemnation point out that it can lead to utility bankruptcies which can threaten the integrity of the California power grid as well as hurt financing the states' efforts for renewable energy and against climate change, one of the causes of the intensified fire threat.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bradford |first1=Peter |title=Making PG&E pay more than its fair share of fire damage could backfire on the state |url=https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article212316269.html |work=Sacramento Bee |publisher=McClatchy Company |date=May 31, 2018 |location=Sacramento CA}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to court cases in recent years and the evolution of [[case law]] which have made new standards of legal liability, the [[Government of California|California State]] [[California State Legislature|legislature]] and the [[Governor of California|Governor]]<!-- it take both legislature and governor to enact a law; so action on both sides of the government of california here --> also enacted new [[statutory law]]s to modify the legal regime under which electrical utilities operate in California.

In some areas, they can be picked legally on both public and private lands in accordance with the [[freedom to roam]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Picking flowers, berries, mushrooms, etc.|url=http://www.swedishepa.se/Enjoying-nature/The-Right-of-Public-Access/This-is-allowed/Picking-flowers-berries-mushrooms-etc/|website=The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=Naturv\u00e5rdsverket|accessdate=13 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313201841/http://www.swedishepa.se/Enjoying-nature/The-Right-of-Public-Access/This-is-allowed/Picking-flowers-berries-mushrooms-etc/|archive-date=2016-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe berries are quite tart, so they are often cooked and sweetened before eating in the form of [[lingonberry jam]], compote, juice, smoothie or syrup. The raw fruits are also frequently simply mashed with sugar, which preserves most of their nutrients and taste. This mix can be stored at room temperature in closed but not necessarily sealed containers, but in this condition, they are best preserved frozen. Fruit served this way or as compote often accompanies game and liver dishes.\n\nIn Sweden and Norway, reindeer and elk steaks are traditionally served with gravy and lingonberry sauce. Preserved fruit is commonly eaten with meatballs, as well as potato pancakes. A traditional Swedish dessert is ''lingonp\u00e4ron'' (literally lingonberry pears), consisting of fresh pears which are peeled, boiled and preserved in ''lingondricka'' (lingonberry juice) and is commonly eaten during Christmas. This was very common in old times, because it was an easy and tasty way to preserve pears. In Sweden and Russia, when sugar was still a luxury item, the berries were usually preserved simply by putting them whole into bottles of water. This was known as ''vattlingon'' (watered lingonberries); the procedure preserved them until next season. This was also a home remedy against [[scurvy]].\n\nThis traditional Russian soft drink, known as \"[[lingonberry water]]\", is mentioned by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''. In Russian [[traditional medicine|folk medicine]], lingonberry water was used as a mild laxative. A traditional Finnish dish is [[saut\u00e9ed reindeer]] (''poronk\u00e4ristys'') with mashed potatoes and lingonberries on the side, either raw, thawed or as a jam. In Finland, whipped [[semolina pudding]] flavored with lingonberry (''puolukkapuuro'') is also popular. In Poland, the berries are often mixed with [[pear]]s to create a sauce served with poultry or game. The berries can also be used to replace redcurrants when creating [[Cumberland sauce]].\n[[Image:Vaccinium vitis-idaea L..jpg|thumb|upright|19th century illustration]]\n\nThe berries are also popular as a wild picked fruit in Eastern Canada, for example in Newfoundland and Labrador and Cape Breton, where they are locally known as partridgeberries or redberries, and on the mainland of Nova Scotia, where they are known as foxberries. In this region they are incorporated into jams, syrups, and baked goods, such as pies, scones, and muffins.\n\nIn Sweden lingonberries are often sold as jam and juice, and as a key ingredient in dishes. They are used to make Lillehammer berry liqueur; and, in East European countries, lingonberry [[vodka]] is sold, and vodka with lingonberry juice or \"[[Mors (drink)|mors]]\" is a popular cocktail.\n\nThe berries are an important food for bears and foxes, and many fruit-eating birds. Caterpillars of the case-bearer moths ''[[Coleophora glitzella]]'', ''[[Coleophora idaeella]]'' and ''[[Coleophora vitisella]]'' are obligate feeders on ''V. vitis-idaea'' leaves.\n\n===In Native American cuisine===\n[[Alaska natives]] mix the berries with rose hip pulp and sugar to make jam, cook the berries as a sauce, and store the berries for future use.<ref>Heller, Christine A., 1953, Edible and Poisonous Plants of Alaska, University of Alaska, page 109</ref> The [[Dakelh]] use the berries to make jam.<ref>Carrier Linguistic Committee, 1973, Plants of Carrier Country, Fort St. James, BC.

The raw fruits are also frequently simply mashed with sugar, which preserves most of their nutrients and taste. This mix can be stored at room temperature in closed but not necessarily sealed containers, but in this condition, they are best preserved frozen. Fruit served this way or as compote often accompanies game and liver dishes.\n\nIn Sweden and Norway, reindeer and elk steaks are traditionally served with gravy and lingonberry sauce. Preserved fruit is commonly eaten with meatballs, as well as potato pancakes. A traditional Swedish dessert is ''lingonp\u00e4ron'' (literally lingonberry pears), consisting of fresh pears which are peeled, boiled and preserved in ''lingondricka'' (lingonberry juice) and is commonly eaten during Christmas. This was very common in old times, because it was an easy and tasty way to preserve pears. In Sweden and Russia, when sugar was still a luxury item, the berries were usually preserved simply by putting them whole into bottles of water.  This was known as ''vattlingon'' (watered lingonberries); the procedure preserved them until next season. This was also a home remedy against [[scurvy]].\n\nThis traditional Russian soft drink, known as \"[[lingonberry water]]\", is mentioned by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''. In Russian [[traditional medicine|folk medicine]], lingonberry water was used as a mild laxative. A traditional Finnish dish is [[saut\u00e9ed reindeer]] (''poronk\u00e4ristys'') with mashed potatoes and lingonberries on the side, either raw, thawed or as a jam. In Finland, whipped [[semolina pudding]] flavored with lingonberry (''puolukkapuuro'') is also popular. In Poland, the berries are often mixed with [[pear]]s to create a sauce served with poultry or game. The berries can also be used to replace redcurrants when creating [[Cumberland sauce]].\n[[Image:Vaccinium vitis-idaea L..jpg|thumb|upright|19th century illustration]]\n\nThe berries are also popular as a wild picked fruit in Eastern Canada, for example in Newfoundland and Labrador and Cape Breton, where they are locally known as partridgeberries or redberries, and on the mainland of Nova Scotia, where they are known as foxberries.  In this region they are incorporated into jams, syrups, and baked goods, such as pies, scones, and muffins.\n\nIn Sweden lingonberries are often sold as jam and juice, and as a key ingredient in dishes. They are used to make Lillehammer berry liqueur; and, in East European countries, lingonberry [[vodka]] is sold, and vodka with lingonberry juice or \"[[Mors (drink)|mors]]\" is a popular cocktail.\n\nThe berries are an important food for bears and foxes, and many fruit-eating birds. Caterpillars of the case-bearer moths ''[[Coleophora glitzella]]'', ''[[Coleophora idaeella]]'' and ''[[Coleophora vitisella]]'' are obligate feeders on ''V. vitis-idaea'' leaves.\n\n===In Native American cuisine===\n[[Alaska natives]] mix the berries with rose hip pulp and sugar to make jam, cook the berries as a sauce, and store the berries for future use.<ref>Heller, Christine A., 1953, Edible and Poisonous Plants of Alaska, University of Alaska, page 109</ref> The [[Dakelh]] use the berries to make jam.<ref>Carrier Linguistic Committee, 1973, Plants of Carrier Country, Fort St. James, BC.
