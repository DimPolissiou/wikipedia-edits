Although Phil thinks that it is ridiculous to hang on to traditions from the \"old world\", they marry for re-population purposes. Over the next several months, more survivors join them.

As time passes, Erica ([[Cleopatra Coleman]]) gives birth to a girl named Dawn, and the group decides to leave the United States for Mexico after they see a nuclear facility meltdown close to the office. \n\nIn season 4, we see the story of a survivor named Pamela Brinton ([[Kristen Wiig]]), a rich woman who lives in a bunker and discovers the group via drone. The group ends up on a boat and first meet Pamela after she kills Pat. Pamela kidnaps Tandy while the other survivors end up stranded on an island. Here they meet Glenn ([[Chris Elliott]]), who has been on the island before the virus broke out. Pamela's guilt over abandoning the group becomes too much and they sail back to the island. The survivors move to [[Zihuatanejo]], Mexico and while there, Carol gives birth to twin daughters and becomes pregnant again a few weeks later; Erica becomes pregnant again with Todd's ([[Mel Rodriguez]]) first child; and Mike temporarily rejoins the group, having recovered from what was actually a weakened immune system, before leaving to search for a way to start his own family. During a hunt for the missing Jasper, Tandy and Todd end up meeting Karl ([[Fred Armisen]]) at a jail, who poses as a jailer but is in fact a cannibal. He terrifies them until they decide they must kill him before he kills one or all of them; however, he ends up finding a [[Rubik's Cube]] that, once solved, explodes.

As he searches for others and paints signs in every state saying he is alive in his hometown of [[Tucson, Arizona]], he finds no one. After years of being alone, he decides to run his truck into a rock to commit suicide. He happens to look off to the side right before he hits and sees smoke; he ends up discovering another survivor, Carol Pilbasian ([[Kristen Schaal]]).<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/columns/why-the-last-man-on-earth-is-a-comedy-dinosaur-spoilers-1201457287|title=Why 'The Last Man on Earth' Is a Comedy Dinosaur (SPOILERS)|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 22, 2015|accessdate=March 24, 2015|author=Lowry, Brian}}</ref> Despite being annoyed by each other, Carol believes it is their job as the last two survivors to repopulate the world but insists Phil marry her so their children will not be born out of wedlock. Although Phil thinks that it is ridiculous to hang on to traditions from the \"old world\", they marry for re-population purposes. Over the next several months, more survivors join them. When Phil's irritating attitude leads to his banishment from Tucson, Carol leaves with him.\n\nIn season 2, Phil and Carol continue their road trip in the middle of 2023.<ref name=\"s02e03\">{{cite episode|title=Dead Man Walking|episodelink=List of The Last Man on Earth episodes#ep16|series=The Last Man on Earth|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|date=October 11, 2015|season=2|number=3|minutes=00:27}}</ref> They discover the group has relocated to [[Malibu, California]] and travel there to reunite with them and rebuild trust. Meanwhile, Phil's astronaut brother Mike Miller ([[Jason Sudeikis]]) crashes down to Earth and finds his way to Malibu, where he joins the survivors briefly before getting sick and is ostracized by most of the group for seemingly having been infected with the virus.\n\nIn season 3, following a potential threat by a paranoid and violent survivor Pat Brown ([[Mark Boone Junior]]), the other survivors move to a self-sustaining office building in [[San Jose, California]], where Melissa ([[January Jones]]) struggles with mental instability and Carol discovers a young boy living in the woods whom they name Jasper. As time passes, Erica ([[Cleopatra Coleman]]) gives birth to a girl named Dawn, and the group decides to leave the United States for Mexico after they see a nuclear facility meltdown close to the office. \n\nIn season 4, we see the story of a survivor named Pamela Brinton ([[Kristen Wiig]]), a rich woman who lives in a bunker and discovers the group via drone. The group ends up on a boat and first meet Pamela after she kills Pat. Pamela kidnaps Tandy while the other survivors end up stranded on an island. Here they meet Glenn ([[Chris Elliott]]), who has been on the island before the virus broke out. Pamela's guilt over abandoning the group becomes too much and they sail back to the island. The survivors move to [[Zihuatanejo]], Mexico and while there, Carol gives birth to twin daughters and becomes pregnant again a few weeks later; Erica becomes pregnant again with Todd's ([[Mel Rodriguez]]) first child; and Mike temporarily rejoins the group, having recovered from what was actually a weakened immune system, before leaving to search for a way to start his own family. During a hunt for the missing Jasper, Tandy and Todd end up meeting Karl ([[Fred Armisen]]) at a jail, who poses as a jailer but is in fact a cannibal. He terrifies them until they decide they must kill him before he kills one or all of them; however, he ends up finding a [[Rubik's Cube]] that, once solved, explodes. The main group then moves to [[Tapachula]], only to be found and surrounded by dozens of underground survivors as season 4 concludes.\n\nAlthough the series was canceled with season 4, the plan for the subsequent season was to have both groups of survivors live together and gain one another's trust before the main characters ended up infecting and killing all of the others as [[Asymptomatic carrier|carriers]] of the virus.<ref name=\"fifth\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/who-were-the-people-at-the-end-of-the-last-man-on-earth.html |last=Fox |first=Jesse David |publisher=[[Vulture.com]] |date=July 30, 2018 |title=What Would\u2019ve Happened If ''The Last Man on Earth'' Got Another Season |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n[[File:Will Forte April 2015.jpg|upright|thumb|Series creator [[Will Forte]] plays the lead role of Phil Tandy Miller.]]\n* [[Will Forte]] as Philip Tandy<ref>{{cite episode|title=Moved to Tampa|episodelink=#ep11|series=The Last Man on Earth|serieslink=<!-- The Last Man on Earth (TV series) -->|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|date=April 19, 2015|season=1|number=11|minutes=17:39}}</ref> Miller (first addressed by the other characters as \"Phil\", then \"Tandy\"), an average, socially challenged man and seemingly the only human survivor after a virus wiped out nearly the entire population about a year earlier.

In his pre-virus life, he worked temp jobs and lived in a studio apartment for which his parents paid the rent.

Later, ownership of the station was exchanged for Russian property in Finland, including the [[Aleksanterin Teatteri|Alexander Theatre]] in Helsinki.\n\nThe station is famously known for the arrival of [[Vladimir Lenin]] by train from [[Switzerland]] on 3 April 1917 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]). The event is commemorated by the Soviet statue of Lenin dominating the square in front of the station. \nThis event is also referred to in the title of  [[Edmund Wilson]]'s book ''[[To the Finland Station]]'' (1940), a well-known study of revolutionary thought.\n\nAfter the turmoil of the [[July Days]], when workers and soldiers in the capital clashed with government troops, Lenin had to flee to Finland for safety, to avoid arrest. Lenin secretly returned from Finland disguised as a railway worker and protected by [[Eino Rahja]] and [[Alexander Shotman]] on 9 August 1917.

The railway would connect Leningrad with a station near the western shore of [[Lake Ladoga]], at which supplies from the non-occupied parts of the Soviet Union would arrive from across the lake, by boat or over the lake ice, via the so-called [[Road of Life]].\n\n===Reconstruction===\nIn the 1950s, the old station building was demolished and replaced with a new one, inaugurated in 1960.

K. T. forty-eight\") is an Indonesian [[Japanese idol|idol group]] whose name is derived from its based city of [[Jakarta]] and the [[Japanese idol]] group [[AKB48]]. Formed in 2011, it is the first AKB48 sister group outside Japan and adopts the concept of \"idols you can meet\",{{sfn|Oricon 2011}} before switching to \"idols that will come to meet you\" since 8 April 2018. Fans can attend daily performances at the group's theater, which was built as a close replica to the AKB48 Theater in [[Akihabara]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nWhile JKT48 does not restrict membership by nationality, applicants must be residents of Indonesia. As of 30 March 2020, the group has 38 individual team members, with one of them performs in two teams.<ref name=\"MembersProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://jkt48.com/member/list?lang=id|title=Profil Anggota|accessdate=30 March 2020|publisher=JKT48 Operation Team|work=jkt48.com|language=id}}</ref> It also has 35 Class A Academy members \u2013 formerly known as trainees.<ref name=\"AcademyProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://jkt48.com/jkt48-academy/member-academy|title=JKT48 Academy Members|accessdate=30 March 2020|publisher= JKT48 Operation Team|work=jkt48.com|language=id}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 February 2013, JKT48 released its first studio album ''[[Heavy Rotation (JKT48 album)|Heavy Rotation]]'' via Hits Records, a division of MNC subsidiary [[:id:Star Media Nusantara|PT Star Media Nusantara]]. It performs songs by AKB48 and other sister groups that are translated into Indonesian.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} JKT48 released its first original single in January 2020<ref>{{Cite news|last=Abas|first=Daiffurakhman|url=https://www.medcom.id/hiburan/musik/VNnQB2vK-jkt48-rilis-lagu-orisinil-perdana-rapsodi|title=JKT48 Rilis Lagu Orisinil Perdana, Rapsodi|date=23 January 2020|work=medcom.id|access-date=24 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>, following the result of [[JKT48 Original Single's Members Election|JKT48 Original Single's Member Election]].\n\n== Conception ==\nMuch like [[AKB48]], the female [[Japanese idol]] group formed in 2005 in [[Akihabara]], Tokyo, JKT48 is based on the concept of idols with whom fans can \"'meet', or at least develop a similar feeling of intimacy\". JKT48 takes its name from the group's base city of [[Jakarta]], Indonesia.{{sfn|Galbraith|2012|p=202}} The country was seen as a potential market for the idol business because of its relatively young population\u2014{{as of|2012}} about half are under the age of 30\u2014and the popularity of Japanese ''[[manga]]'' series, such as ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]'' and ''[[One Piece]]''. In order to bring the concept of AKB48 to Indonesia, producer [[Yasushi Akimoto]] and Dentsu Media Group Indonesia partnered with the country's largest media conglomerate, [[Media Nusantara Citra|Global Mediacom]], and [[Rakuten]].{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012|p=1}}\n\nIn an interview on CNN's ''[[TalkAsia]]'' program, Akimoto responded to the question of why he selected Indonesia as the first target of AKB48's overseas expansion: <blockquote>\"People in Indonesia were interested in AKB48. That is why we decided to try it in Jakarta. Kids watched AKB on the internet and they want to do the same, but they don't know whether they have talent. Also it's difficult [for them] to go to Japan to audition.\"{{sfn|TalkAsia 2012}}</blockquote> Then Rakuten\u2013MNC chief marketing officer Reino Barack and Arya Sinulingga recounted of his visit to Japan: <blockquote>\"When I watched AKB48's theater performance in Akihabara, I sensed the potential for a new business in Indonesia.\"{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012|p=1}}</blockquote>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 2011\u20132012: Formation ===\n{{External media\n| align  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMexRrjqvw4 First live performance of JKT48].

Finalists were judged based on their dance performance of \"[[Heavy Rotation (song)|Heavy Rotation]]\", from AKB48's single of the same name, and their performance of a song of their choice.{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012|p=2}} JKT48's 28 first generation members, ages 12\u201321, were selected on 2 November 2011.{{sfn|The Japan Times 2011}}\n\nOn 17 December 2011, JKT48 made its first public appearance on the live music program ''100% Ampuh'' on [[Global TV (Indonesia)|Global TV]], performing \"Heavy Rotation\", with lyrics translated into Indonesian.{{sfn|Natalie 2011, JKT48: First Performance of Japan's \"Heavy Rotation\" & First Handshake Event}}\n\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|caption_align=center|image1=JKT48 Theater.JPG|width1=220|footer=JKT48 Theater at [[fX Sudirman]] in 2012 (up) and 2020 (down)|image2=JKT48_Theater_February_2020.jpg|width2=220}}\nAs part of the concept of \"idols you can meet every day\", AKB48 performs daily at its theater in Akihabara.{{sfn|JKT48 Operation Team, Apa Itu AKB48}} The JKT48 management team aimed to accomplish this same principle and began scouting locations in Jakarta for the group's own theater in early 2012. An unoccupied site in the [[fX Sudirman]] shopping mall was selected as the theater's eventual location, and planning for its renovation began in April.{{sfn|Mr. Sunday 2012}} In the meantime, the first theater performances were held 17\u201320 May 2012 at a temporary stage in the Nyi Ageng Serang Building in Kuningan, Jakarta.{{sfn|Ogino|Ohira|2012|p=12}} The official theater opened on 8 September 2012 for daily performances with a [[set list]] of 16 songs that have been translated into Indonesian. The theater first had a seating capacity of 180 and standing room for 30, and its design is a close replica of the AKB48 Theater.{{sfn|Maruli 2012}} Currently it holds around 350 people, both seated and standing.\n\nJKT48 has also performed in Japan alongside other AKB48 sister groups. In its first performance in Japan, the group was a surprise guest at 2011 AKB48 ''K\u014dhaku Taik\u014d Uta Gassen'' and performed the Indonesian version of \"[[Aitakatta]]\".{{sfn|Natalie 2011, Y\u016bko \u014cshima Leads White Team to Victory in First AKB48 K\u014dhaku Taik\u014d Uta Gassen}} It also performed alongside AKB48 and other sister groups at the [[62nd NHK K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen|62nd NHK ''K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen'']] with a total 210 members onstage.{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012}}{{sfn|Yomiuri Shimbun 2011}} It also participated in the 2012 AKB48 concerts at [[Saitama Super Arena]] and [[Tokyo Dome]].{{sfn|Natalie 2012, Atsuko Maeda's Graduation and General Election Announced at AKB48's Final Day at Saitama Super Arena}}{{sfn|Natalie 2012, Atsuko Maeda Cries \"My Entire Youth\" at AKB48's Final Day at Tokyo Dome}}\n\nOn 13 August 2012, management began accepting applications for second generation members. Of the 4,500 applicants, approximately 200 were selected for interviews the following month. The pool was then narrowed down from 67 to 31 in a selection round held by [[RCTI]].{{sfn|Tribun 2012}} All 31 finalists were eventually chosen as second generation members at a final audition on 3 November in Japan.{{sfn|Halo Jepang! 2012, Seluruh Finalis JKT48 Generasi 2 Lulus Seleksi}} Additionally, AKB48 members [[Aki Takaj\u014d]] and [[Haruka Nakagawa]], whose transfers to JKT48 were announced at the Tokyo Dome concert, officially began their activities with the group on 1 November and made their theater debut on 26 December.{{sfn|Oricon 2012}} Nakagawa became interested in Jakarta during a visit with other members of AKB48 earlier in February 2012.{{sfn|Mainichi Shimbun 2012}}\n\n===2013\u2013present: Ups and downs===\n[[File:JKT48.jpg|thumb|120px|The group's logo]]\nJKT48 was scheduled to release its debut album in January 2013, but production was hampered because of [[2013 Jakarta flood|flooding in Jakarta]].{{sfn|JKT48 Operation Team 2013, Pengunduran Rilis CD Perdana JKT48}} To celebrate the release, the group's management team had distributed 100,000 free CD singles. Each single featured an Indonesian version of one of four songs: \"[[Heavy Rotation (song)|Heavy Rotation]]\"; \"[[River (AKB48 song)|Kimi no Koto ga Suki Dakara]]\"; \"Baby! Baby!
