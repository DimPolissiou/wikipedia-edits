The work premiered in 1949 on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and was an immediate hit, running for 1,925 performances. The plot is based on [[James A. Michener]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize-winning]] 1947 book ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'' and combines elements of several of those stories. [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] believed they could write a musical based on Michener's work that would be financially successful and, at the same time, send a strong progressive message on racism.\n\nThe plot centers on an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island during World War II, who falls in love with a middle-aged expatriate French plantation owner but struggles to accept his mixed-race children. A secondary romance, between a [[U.S. Marine]] lieutenant and a young [[Tonkin]]ese woman, explores his fears of the social consequences should he marry his Asian sweetheart. The issue of racial prejudice is candidly explored throughout the musical, most controversially in the lieutenant's song, \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\".  Supporting characters, including a comic [[petty officer#United States|petty officer]] and the Tonkinese girl's mother, help to tie the stories together.  Because he lacked military knowledge, Hammerstein had difficulty writing that part of the script; the director of the original production, Logan, assisted him and received credit as co-writer of the book.\n\nThe original Broadway production enjoyed immense critical and box-office success, became [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|the second-longest running Broadway musical]] to that point (behind Rodgers and Hammerstein's earlier ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943)), and has remained popular ever since. After they signed [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] as the leads, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind.  The piece won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1950.  Especially in the Southern U.S., its racial theme provoked controversy, for which its authors were unapologetic. Several of its songs, including \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\", \"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\", \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\", \"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\", \"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\", \"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\", and \"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\", have become popular standards.\n\nThe production won ten [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical, Best Score, and Best Libretto, and it is the only musical production to win Tony Awards in all four acting categories. Its original cast album was the bestselling record of the 1940s, and other recordings of the show have also been popular. The show has enjoyed many successful revivals and tours, spawning a [[South Pacific (1958 film)|1958 film]] and television adaptations. The 2008 Broadway revival, a critical success, ran for 996 performances and won seven Tonys, including Best Musical Revival.\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Tales of the South Pacific}}\nAlthough book editor and university instructor [[James Michener]] could have avoided military service in World War II as a birthright [[Quaker]], he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 1942.  He was not sent to [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|the South Pacific theater]] until April 1944, when he was assigned to write a history of the Navy in the Pacific and was allowed to travel widely.  He survived a plane crash in [[New Caledonia]]; the near-death experience motivated him to write fiction, and he began listening to the stories told by soldiers. One journey took him to the [[Treasury Islands]], where he discovered an unpleasant village, called Bali-ha'i, populated by \"scrawny residents and only one pig\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 35\u201339</ref> Struck by the name, Michener wrote it down and soon began to record, on a battered typewriter, his version of the tales.<ref name = \"L39\" /> On a plantation on the island of [[Espiritu Santo]], he met a woman named Bloody Mary; she was small, almost toothless, her face stained with red [[betel nut|betel juice]].  Punctuated with profanity learned from [[G.I. (military)|GIs]], she complained endlessly to Michener about the French colonial government, which refused to allow her and other [[Tonkin]]ese to return to their native Vietnam, lest the plantations be depopulated.  She told him also of her plans to oppose colonialism in [[French Indochina]].{{#tag:ref|Michener later reflected, \"I would often think of her&nbsp;... when American troops were fighting their fruitless battles in Vietnam, and I wondered if our leaders realized that the enemy they were fighting consisted of millions of determined people like Bloody Mary.\" See May, p. 20|group= n}} These stories, collected into ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'', won Michener the [[1948 Pulitzer Prize]] for fiction.<ref name = \"L39\">Lovensheimer, p. 39</ref>\n\n''Tales of the South Pacific'' comprises nineteen stories. Each stands independently but revolves around the preparation for an American military operation to dislodge the Japanese from a nearby island.  This operation, dubbed ''Alligator'', occurs in the penultimate story, \"The Landing at Kuralei\".  Many of the characters die in that battle, and the last story is titled \"The Cemetery at Huga Point\". The stories are thematically linked in pairs: the first and final stories are reflective, the second and eighteenth involve battle, the third and seventeenth involve preparation for battle, and so on. The tenth story, at the center, is not paired with any other.  This story, \"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", was one of only four of his many works that Michener later admitted to holding in high regard.  It was the one that attracted [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s attention for its potential to be converted into a stage work.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 39, 191</ref>\n\n\"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", set in part on the island of Bali-ha'i, focuses on the romance between a young Tonkinese woman, Liat, and one of the Americans, Marine Lieutenant Joe Cable, a [[Princeton University|Princeton]] graduate and scion of a wealthy [[Philadelphia Main Line|Main Line]] family.  Pressed to marry Liat by her mother, Bloody Mary, Cable reluctantly declines, realizing that the Asian girl would never be accepted by his family or Philadelphia society.  He leaves for battle (where he will die) as Bloody Mary proceeds with her backup plan, to affiance Liat to a wealthy French planter on the islands. Cable struggles, during the story, with his own racism: he is able to overcome it sufficiently to love Liat, but not enough to take her home.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nAnother source of the musical is the eighth story, \"Our Heroine\", which is thematically paired with the 12th, \"A Boar's Tooth\", as both involve American encounters with local cultures.  \"Our Heroine\" tells of the romance between Navy nurse Nellie Forbush, from rural Arkansas, and a wealthy, sophisticated planter,  Frenchman Emile De Becque.{{#tag:ref|The \"De\" was changed to lower case for the musical.  See Maslon, p. 115.|group= n}}  After falling in love with Emile, Nellie (who is introduced briefly in story No. 4, \"An Officer and a Gentleman\") learns that Emile has eight daughters, out of wedlock, with several local women. Michener tells us that \"any person&nbsp;... who was not white or yellow was a nigger\" to Nellie, and while she is willing to accept two of the children (of French-Asian descent) who remain in Emile's household, she is taken aback by the other two girls who live there, evidence that the planter had cohabited with a darker Polynesian woman. To her great relief, she learns that this woman is dead, but Nellie endangers her relationship with Emile when she is initially unable to accept Emile's \"nigger children.\"<ref>Michener 1967, pp. 126\u2013127</ref> Nellie overcomes her feelings and returns to spend her life with her plantation owner.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 43\u201344, 191</ref>\n\nAdditional elements of ''South Pacific'' had their genesis in others of Michener's 19 tales. One introduces the character of Bloody Mary; another tells of a British spy hidden on the Japanese-controlled island who relays information about Japanese movements to [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] by radio.  Michener based the spy, dubbed \"the Remittance Man\", on Captain [[Martin Clemens]], a Scot, who unlike his fictional counterpart, survived the war.  The stories also tell of the seemingly endless waiting that precedes battle, and the efforts of the Americans to repel boredom, which would inspire the song \"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 49\u201350; and May, pp. 24\u201325</ref> Several of the stories involve the [[Seabee]], Luther Billis, who in the musical would be used both for comic relief and to tie together episodes involving otherwise unconnected characters.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 52\u201353</ref> A 2001 article in ''Islands Magazine'' states that Michener renamed [[Ambae Island|Aoba Island]] Bali-ha'i.

Logan recalled that he then pointed it out to Hammerstein, who read Michener's book and spoke to Rodgers; the two agreed to do the project so long as they had majority control, to which Hayward grudgingly agreed.<ref>Fordin, pp. 259\u2013260; and Logan, pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Michener, in his 1992 memoirs, wrote that the stories were first pitched as a movie concept to [[MGM]] by [[Kenneth MacKenna]], head of the studio's literary department.  MacKenna's half brother was [[Jo Mielziner]], who had designed the sets for ''Carousel'' and ''Allegro''.  Michener states that Mielziner learned of the work from MacKenna and brought it to the attention of Hammerstein and Rodgers, pledging to create the sets if they took on the project.<ref>Lovensheimer, p. 47</ref>\n\nHayward attempted to buy the rights from Michener outright, offering $500; Michener declined.  Although playwright [[Lynn Riggs]] had received 1.5% of the box office grosses for the right to adapt ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs]]'' into ''Oklahoma!'', Michener never regretted accepting one percent of the gross receipts from ''South Pacific''.  As Rodgers and Hammerstein began their work on the adaptation, Michener worked mostly with the lyricist, but Rodgers was concerned about the implications of the setting, fearing that he would have to include ukuleles and guitars, which he disliked.  Michener assured him that the only instrument he had ever heard the natives play was an emptied barrel of gasoline, drummed upon with clubs.<ref>May, p. 80</ref>\n\n=== Composition ===\n[[File:R and H.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two men in business suits sit in theatre seats amiably discussing what they are watching|Rodgers (left) and Hammerstein]]\nSoon after their purchase of the rights, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided not to include a ballet, as in their earlier works, feeling that the realism of the setting would not support one.  Concerned that an adaptation too focused on \"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", the story of the encounter between Cable and Liat, would be too similar to ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', Hammerstein spent months studying the other stories and focused his attention on \"Our Heroine\", the tale of the romance between Nellie and Emile.  The team decided to include both romances in the musical play.  It was conventional at the time that if one love story in a musical was serious, the other would be more comedic, but in this case both were serious and focused on racial prejudice.  They decided to increase the role played by Luther Billis in the stories, merging experiences and elements of several other characters into him.  Billis's wheeling and dealing would provide comic relief.<ref>Fordin, pp. 261\u2013262</ref> They also shortened the title to ''South Pacific'' \u2013 Rodgers related that the producers tired of people making risqu\u00e9 puns on the word \"tales\".<ref>Maslon, p. 117</ref>\n\nIn early drafts of the musical, Hammerstein gave significant parts to two characters who eventually came to have only minor roles, Bill Harbison and Dinah Culbert.  Harbison is one of the major characters in ''Tales of the South Pacific''; a model officer at the start, he gradually degenerates to the point where, with battle imminent, he requests his influential father-in-law to procure for him a transfer to a post in the United States. Hammerstein conceived of him as a rival to Emile for Nellie's affections, and gave him a song, \"The Bright Young Executive of Today\".  As redrafts focused the play on the two couples, Harbison became less essential, and he was relegated to a small role as the executive officer to the commander of the island, Captain Brackett.  Dinah, a nurse and friend of Nellie, is also a major character in Michener's work, and was seen as a possible love interest for Billis, though any actual romance was limited by Navy regulations forbidding fraternization between officers (all American nurses in World War II were commissioned officers) and enlisted men. \"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\" originated as a duet for Dinah and Nellie, with Dinah beginning the song and developing its theme.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 58\u201367</ref> According to Lovensheimer, Nellie's and Dinah's \"friendship became increasingly incidental to the plot as the writing continued. Hammerstein eventually realized that the decision to wash Emile out of her hair had to be Nellie's.  Only then did the scene have the dramatic potential for Nellie's emotional transition\" as she realizes her love for Emile. In the final version, Dinah retains one solo line in the song.<ref>Rodgers and Hammerstein, pp. 310\u2013313</ref>\n\nJoshua Logan, in his memoirs, stated that after months of effort in the first half of 1948, Hammerstein had written only the first scene, an outline, and some lyrics.  Hammerstein was having trouble due to lack of knowledge of the military, a matter with which Logan, a veteran of the armed forces, was able to help.  The dialogue was written in consultation between the two of them, and eventually Logan asked to be credited for his work.  Rodgers and Hammerstein decided that while Logan would receive co-writing credit on the book, he would receive no author's royalties. Logan stated that a contract putting these changes into force was sent over to his lawyer with instructions that unless it was signed within two hours, Logan need not show up for rehearsals as director.<ref>Logan, pp. 273\u2013281; and May, pp. 98\u2013103</ref> Logan signed, although his lawyer did not then tell him about the ultimatum.<ref name = \"H179\">Hyland, p. 179</ref> Through the decades that followed, Logan brought the matter up from time to time, demanding compensation, but when he included his version of the events in his 1976 memoirs, it was disputed by Rodgers (Hammerstein had died in 1960).<ref name = \"H179\"/> Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that Logan was compensated when [[South Pacific (1958 film)|''South Pacific'' was filmed in 1958]], as Logan received a substantial share of the profits as director.{{#tag:ref|Jim Lovensheimer, in his book on the genesis of ''South Pacific'', questions Logan's account: \"in his autobiography, at least, Logan is the star of every show he mentions\".<ref name=\"Lovensheimer 46\"/>|group= n}}<ref>Secrest, p. 290</ref> According to Michener biographer Stephen J. May, \"it is difficult to assess just how much of the final book Josh Logan was responsible for.  Some estimates say 30 to 40 percent.  But that percentage is not as critical perhaps as his knowledge of military lore and directing for the theatre, without which the creation of ''South Pacific'' would have collapsed during that summer of 1948.\"<ref>May, p. 100</ref>\n\nRodgers composed the music once he received the lyrics from Hammerstein.  A number of stories are told of the speed with which he wrote the music for ''South Pacific''&nbsp;'s numbers. \"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\" was said to have been composed in about twenty minutes; when Hammerstein, who had sent the lyrics by messenger, called to check whether Rodgers had received them, his partner informed him that he had both lyrics and music. Legend has it he composed \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\" in ten minutes over coffee in Logan's apartment; what he did create in that time frame was the three-note motif which begins both song and musical.  Hammerstein's lyrics for \"Bali Ha'i\" were inspired by the stage backdrop which designer [[Jo Mielziner]] had painted.  Feeling that the island of Bali Ha'i did not appear mysterious enough, Mielziner painted some mist near the summit of its volcano. When Hammerstein saw this he immediately thought of the lyric, \"my head sticking up from a low-flying cloud\" and the rest of the song followed easily from that.<ref>Nolan, pp. 184\u2013186</ref>\n\n=== Casting and out-of-town previews ===\n[[File:Ezio Pinza SP.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Publicity portrait of a man in his mid-fifties with curly hair (Pinza)|Ezio Pinza]]\nIn May 1948, Rodgers received a telephone call from [[Edwin Lester]] of the [[Los Angeles Civic Light Opera]].  Lester had signed former [[Metropolitan Opera]] star [[Ezio Pinza]] for $25,000 to star in a new show, ''Mr. Ambassador''.  The show had not been written, and it never would be.<ref>Maslon, p. 111</ref> Lester hoped that Rodgers would take over Pinza's contract.  Pinza had become bored as the Met's leading lyric [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and having played the great opera houses, sought other worlds to conquer.  Rodgers immediately saw Pinza as perfect for the role of Emile.<ref>Nolan, p. 178</ref> Lester carefully broached the subject to Pinza and his wife/business manager and provided them with a copy of ''Tales of the South Pacific''.  When Pinza read the book, he told Lester, \"Sell me right away!\"<ref name = \"M112\">Maslon, p. 112</ref> Pinza's contract for ''South Pacific'' included a clause limiting his singing to 15 minutes per performance.<ref name = \"M112\" /> With Pinza's signing, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided to make his the lead male role, subordinating the story of the pair of young lovers.  It was unusual on Broadway for the romantic lead to be an older male.<ref name = \"F262\">Fordin, p. 262</ref>\n\n[[File:Mary Martin 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait of a woman in her mid-thirties, with long curly hair and wearing an old-fashioned blouse with string tie|[[Mary Martin]]]]\nFor the role of Nellie, Rodgers sought [[Mary Martin]], who had nearly been cast to originate the role of Laurey in ''Oklahoma!''<ref name = \"F262\" /> Martin was playing the title role in the touring company of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''.  After Hammerstein and Rodgers saw her play in Los Angeles in mid-1948, they asked her to consider the part.  Martin was reluctant to sing opposite Pinza's powerful voice; Rodgers assured her he would see to it the two never sang at the same time,<ref>Davis, p. 123</ref> a promise he mostly kept.<ref name = \"H180\">Hyland, p. 180</ref> Rodgers and Martin lived near each other in Connecticut, and after her tour Rodgers invited Martin and her husband, Richard Halliday, to his home to hear the three songs for the musical that he had completed, none of them for Nellie.<ref>Davis, p. 125</ref> \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\" especially struck Martin, and although disappointed the song was not for her, she agreed to do the part.<ref name = \"H180\" /> Although Nellie and Emile were already fully developed characters in Michener's stories, during the creation of ''South Pacific'', Rodgers, Hammerstein and Logan began to adapt the roles specifically to the talents of Martin and Pinza and to tailor the music for their voices.<ref>[http://www.rnh.com/show/97/South-Pacific#shows-history \"''South Pacific'': History], Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, accessed August 29, 2012</ref>\n\nMartin influenced several of her songs.  While showering one day during rehearsals, she came up with the idea for a scene in which she would shampoo her hair onstage.  This gave rise to \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\".<ref>Hammerstein, p. 199</ref> Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in ''South Pacific''.<ref>Maslon, p. 93</ref> To introduce another of Martin's numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played \"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\" for her.  When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench.  Rodgers gazed down at her, \"That's exactly what I want.  Never do it differently.  We must feel you couldn't squeeze out another sound.\"<ref>Nolan, p. 185</ref>\n\nThe producers held extensive auditions to fill the other roles.<ref name = \"F267\">Fordin, p. 267</ref> [[Myron McCormick]] was cast as Billis; according to Logan, no one else was seriously considered. The two roles which gave the most trouble were those of Cable and Bloody Mary.<ref name = \"L283\" /> They tried to get Harold Keel for the role of Cable (he had played Curly in the West End production of ''Oklahoma!'') only to find that he had signed a contract with MGM under the name [[Howard Keel]].<ref name = \"N182\">Nolan, p. 182</ref> [[William Tabbert]] was eventually cast as Cable, though Logan instructed him to lose {{convert|20|lb}}.

There was no formal chorus; each of the nurses and [[Seabees in World War II|Seabees]] was given a name, and, in the case of the men, $50 to equip themselves with what clothing they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. [[Don Fellows]], the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots.<ref>Maslon, pp. 124\u2013125</ref> Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship.<ref name=\"Davis, p. 130\">Davis, p. 130</ref> Of the mood backstage, \"everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive.\"<ref name = \"N186\">Nolan, p. 186</ref>  He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in ''Allegro''), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless.  He soon had the Seabees pacing back and forth like caged animals during \"There Is Nothing Like a Dame\", a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show.<ref name = \"N186\" /> One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking.<ref name = \"M121\">Maslon, p. 121</ref> As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\" with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage.  This was eliminated after she vaulted into the orchestra pit, knocking out Rittman.<ref>Logan, p. 289</ref>\n\nThere were no major difficulties during the four weeks of rehearsal in New York; Martin later remembered that the \"gypsy run-through\" for friends and professional associates on a bare stage was met with some of the most enthusiastic applause she could remember.  One of the few people having trouble was Pinza, who had difficulty adjusting to the constant alterations in the show \u2013 he was used to the operatic world, where a role rarely changed once learned.  Pinza's mispronunciations of English exasperated Logan, and driving to [[New Haven, Connecticut]] for the first week of previews, Pinza discussed with his wife the possibility of a return to the Met, where he knew audiences would welcome him.  She told him to let ''South Pacific''&nbsp;'s attendees decide for themselves. When the tryouts began in New Haven on March 7, the play was an immediate hit; the ''[[New Haven Register]]'' wrote, \"''South Pacific'' should make history\".<ref>Maslon, pp. 126, 129</ref>\n\nNevertheless, a number of changes were made in New Haven and in the subsequent two weeks of previews in Boston. The show was running long; Logan persuaded his friend, playwright [[Emlyn Williams]], to go over the script and cut extraneous dialogue.<ref name = \"M129\">Maslon, p. 129</ref> There were wide expectations of a hit; producer [[Mike Todd]] came backstage and advised that the show not be taken to New York \"because it's too damned good for them\".<ref>Nolan, p. 191</ref> The show moved to Boston, where it was so successful that playwright [[George S.

They just want to push money under the doors.\"<ref name=Nolan190>Nolan, pp. 190\u2013195</ref>\n\n[[File:South Pacific rehearsal.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Four middle-aged men are gathered around to listen to a woman sing from a book|From left: Logan, Rodgers, Hammerstein, Martin and Michener]]\n''South Pacific'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on April 7, 1949, at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]].<ref>Hischak, p. 261</ref> The advance sale was $400,000, and an additional $700,000 in sales was made soon after the opening. The first night audience was packed with important Broadway, business, and arts leaders.  The audience repeatedly stopped the show with extended applause, which was sustained at length at the final curtain.  Rodgers and Hammerstein had preferred, in the past, not to sponsor an afterparty, but they rented the [[St. Regis Hotel]]'s roof and ordered 200 copies of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in the anticipation of a hit.  ''Times'' critic [[Brooks Atkinson]] gave the show a rave review.<ref>Fordin, p. 281</ref>\n\nThree days after the opening, Pinza signed a contract with MGM to star in films once his obligation to appear in the show expired. He left the show June 1, 1950, replaced by [[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]], though Pinza missed a number of shows due to illness before that.  Martin recalled that, unused to performing eight shows a week, the former opera star would sing full out early in the week, leaving himself little voice towards the end, and would have his understudy go on.<ref>Davis, p. 145</ref><ref name = \"M154\">Maslon, p. 154</ref> Nevertheless, during the year he was in the show, and although aged 58, he was acclaimed as a sex symbol; [[George Jean Nathan]] wrote that \"Pinza has taken the place of Hot Springs, Saratoga, and hormone injections for all the other old boys\".<ref name = \"M154\" />\n\nA national tour began in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, in April 1950; it ran for five years and starred [[Richard Eastham]] as Emile, [[Janet Blair]] as Nellie and [[Ray Walston]] as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film. For the 48,000 tickets available in Cleveland, 250,000 requests were submitted, causing the box office to close for three weeks to process them.<ref>Maslon, pp. 153\u2013154</ref> [[Jeanne Bal]] and [[Iva Withers]] were later Nellies on this tour.<ref>Green, p. 399</ref> A scaled-down version toured military bases in Korea in 1951; by the request of Hammerstein and Rodgers, officers and enlisted soldiers sat together to view it.<ref name = \"M154\" />\n\nMartin left the Broadway production in 1951 to appear in the original London [[West End theatre|West End]] production; [[Martha Wright (actress)|Martha Wright]] replaced her.

Ensign Nellie Forbush, a na\u00efve [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] nurse from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], has fallen in love with Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French plantation owner, though she has known him only briefly. Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right (\"A Cockeyed Optimist\"). Emile also loves Nellie, and each wonders if the other reciprocates those feelings (\"Twin Soliloquies\"). Emile expresses his love for Nellie, recalling how they met at the officers' club dance and instantly were attracted to each other (\"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\").  Nellie, promising to think about their relationship, returns to the hospital. Emile calls Ngana and Jerome to him, revealing to the audience that they are his children, unbeknownst to Nellie.\n\nMeanwhile, the restless American [[Seabees in World War II|Seabees]], led by crafty Luther Billis, lament the absence of available women&nbsp;\u2013 Navy nurses are commissioned officers and off-limits to enlisted men. There is one civilian woman on the island, nicknamed \"Bloody Mary\", a sassy middle-aged [[Tonkin]]ese vendor of grass skirts, who engages the sailors in sarcastic, flirtatious banter as she tries to sell them her wares (\"Bloody Mary\"). Billis yearns to visit the nearby island of Bali Ha'i \u2013 which is off-limits to all but officers \u2013 supposedly to witness a Boar's Tooth Ceremony (at which he can get an unusual native artifact); the other sailors josh him, saying that his real motivation is to see the young French women there. Billis and the sailors further lament their lack of feminine companionship (\"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\").\n\n[[File:Hall as Bloody Mary.jpg|thumb|left|x300px|alt=A smiling woman with a topknot and strings of shells around her neck|Juanita Hall as Bloody Mary in the original Broadway production]]\n[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Lieutenant#Marine rank|Lieutenant]] Cable arrives on the island from [[Guadalcanal]], having been sent to take part in a dangerous spy mission whose success could turn the tide of the war against Japan.  Bloody Mary tries to persuade Cable to visit \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\", mysteriously telling him that it is ''his'' special island. Billis, seeing an opportunity, urges Cable to go.  Cable meets with his commanding officers, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] George Brackett and [[Commander (United States)#Naval rank|Commander]] William Harbison, who plan to ask Emile to help with the mission because he used to live on the island where the mission will take place. They ask Nellie to help them find out more about Emile's background, for example, his politics and why he left France. They have heard, for instance, that Emile committed a murder, and this might make him less than desirable for such a mission.\n\nAfter thinking a bit more about Emile and deciding she has become attracted on the basis of little knowledge of him, Nellie tells the other nurses that she intends to end her relationship with him (\"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\"). But when he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, he speaks of universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings (\"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\").\n\n[[File:Pinza decides.jpg|thumb|right|alt=In a \"war room\", three military men watch a worried man in civilian dress|Emile (Pinza) decides whether to go with Cable (William Tabbert) and place his hoped-for life with Nellie at risk]]\nCable's mission is to land on a Japanese-held island and report on Japanese ship movements. The Navy officers ask Emile to be Cable's guide, but he refuses their request because of his hopes for a new life with Nellie. Commander Harbison, the executive officer, tells Cable to go on leave until the mission can take place, and Billis obtains a boat and takes Cable to Bali Ha'i. There, Billis participates in the native ceremony, while Bloody Mary introduces Cable to her beautiful daughter, Liat, with whom he must communicate haltingly in French.  Believing that Liat's only chance at a better life is to marry an American officer, Mary leaves Liat alone with Cable. The two are instantly attracted to each other and make love (\"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\").  Billis and the rest of the crew are ready to leave the island, yet must wait for Cable who, unbeknownst to them, is with Liat (\"Bali Ha'i\" (reprise)). Bloody Mary proudly tells Billis that Cable is going to be her son-in-law.\n\nMeanwhile, after Emile's party, Nellie and he reflect on how happy they are to be in love (Reprises of \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\", \"Twin Soliloquies\", \"Cockeyed Optimist\" and \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\").

Though she finds them charming, she is shocked when Emile reveals that they are his children by his first wife, a dark-skinned Polynesian woman, now deceased.

The GIs and nurses dance in a holiday revue titled \"Thanksgiving Follies\". In the past week, an epidemic of [[malaria]] has hit the island of Bali Ha'i. Having visited Bali Ha'i often to be with Liat, Cable is also ill, but escapes from the hospital to be with Liat.  As Liat and Cable spend more time together, Bloody Mary is delighted. She encourages them to continue their carefree life on the island (\"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\") and urges them to marry. Cable, aware of his family's prejudices, says he cannot marry a Tonkinese girl. Bloody Mary furiously drags her distraught daughter away, telling Cable that Liat must now marry a much older French plantation owner instead. Cable laments his loss. (\"Younger Than Springtime\" (reprise)).\n\nFor the final number of the Thanksgiving Follies, Nellie performs a comedy burlesque dressed as a sailor singing the praises of \"his\" sweetheart (\"Honey Bun\"). Billis plays Honey Bun, dressed in a blond wig, grass skirt and coconut-shell bra. After the show, Emile asks Nellie to reconsider. She insists that she cannot feel the same way about him since she knows about his children's Polynesian mother.  Frustrated and uncomprehending, Emile asks Cable why he and Nellie have such prejudices. Cable, filled with self-loathing, replies that \"it's not something you're born with\", yet it is an ingrained part of their upbringing (\"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\"). He also vows that if he gets out of the war alive, he won't go home to the United States; everything he wants is on these islands. Emile imagines what might have been (\"This Nearly Was Mine\"). Dejected and feeling that he has nothing to lose, he agrees to join Cable on his dangerous mission.\n\n[[File:Final scene South Pacific.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Emile and Nellie grasp hands as Emile's two children look on.|The final tableau from the original production]]\nThe mission begins with plenty of air support. Offstage, Billis stows away on the plane, falls out when the plane is hit by anti-aircraft fire, and ends up in the ocean waiting to be rescued; the massive rescue operation inadvertently becomes a diversion that allows Emile and Cable to land on the other side of the island undetected. The two send back reports on Japanese ships' movements in the \"Slot\", a strategic strait; American aircraft intercept and destroy the Japanese ships. When the Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zeros]] strafe the Americans' position, Emile narrowly escapes, but Cable is killed.\n\nNellie learns of Cable's death and that Emile is missing. She realizes that she was foolish to reject Emile because of the race of his children's mother. Bloody Mary and Liat come to Nellie asking where Cable is; Mary explains that Liat refuses to marry anyone but him. Nellie comforts Liat. Cable and Emile's espionage work has made it possible for a major offensive, Operation ''Alligator'', to begin. The previously idle fighting men, including Billis, go off to battle.\n\nNellie spends time with Jerome and Ngana and soon comes to love them. While the children are teaching her to sing \"Dites-Moi,\" suddenly Emile's voice joins them. Emile has returned to discover that Nellie has overcome her prejudices and has fallen in love with his children. Emile, Nellie and the children rejoice (\"Dites-Moi\" (reprise)).\n{{clear}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Principal roles and notable performers ==\n<!--this list is for stage performers only, please do not add movie cast-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"120\" | Character\n! width=\"180\" | Description\n! width=\"120\" | Original Broadway cast<ref>Rodgers & Hammerstein, p. 269 (roles and original cast only)</ref>\n! width=\"400\" | Notable subsequent performers in noteworthy productions<!-- REFERENCES FOR EACH OF THESE PERFORMERS ARE GIVEN IN THE \"Original Production\"and \"Revivals\" SECTIONS of this article -->\n|-\n| Nellie Forbush||A young U.S. Navy nurse ||[[Mary Martin]]|| [[Janet Blair]], [[Martha Wright (actress)|Martha Wright]], [[Julie Wilson]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Mindy Carson]], [[Florence Henderson]], [[Iva Withers]], [[Gemma Craven]], [[Lauren Kennedy]], [[Helena Blackman]], [[Kelli O'Hara]], [[Laura Osnes]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Carmen Cusack]], [[Samantha Womack]], [[Lisa McCune]]\n|-\n| Emile de Becque ||A middle-aged expatriate French planter ||[[Ezio Pinza]]|| [[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]], [[Richard Eastham]], [[Wilbur Evans]], [[George Britton (musician)|George Britton]], [[William Chapman (baritone)|William Chapman]], [[Giorgio Tozzi]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Justino D\u00edaz]], [[Philip Quast]], [[Dave Willetts]], [[Brian Stokes Mitchell]], [[Paulo Szot]], [[Teddy Tahu Rhodes]], [[Rod Gilfry]]\n|-\n| Lt.

They are seated on a divan or loveseat|right|[[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]] and [[Mary Martin]] as Emile and Nellie in the original production (1950)]]\nA number of songs were extensively modified or omitted in the weeks leading up to the initial Broadway opening.  They are listed in the order of their one-time placement within the show:\n* \"Bright Canary Yellow\", a short song for Nellie and Emile, was placed just before \"A Cockeyed Optimist\", of which the opening line, \"When the sky is a bright canary yellow\" was intended to play off of the earlier song.<ref>Block, pp. 139\u2013140</ref>\n* \"Now Is the Time\" (Emile) was placed in the beach scene (Act I, Scene 7) just after Emile tells Nellie why he killed the man in France.  It was to be reprised after \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\", but it was felt that for Emile to remain on stage while singing of immediate action was self-contradictory.  It was replaced in Act I by a reprise of \"Some Enchanted Evening\"; in Act II it was initially replaced by  \"Will You Marry Me?\" (later repurposed for ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'') on March 24, 1949, and then by \"This Nearly Was Mine\" on March 29, just over a week before the Broadway opening on April 7.<ref>Block, pp. 140\u2013145</ref>\n* \"Loneliness of Evening\" (Emile) was cut before the Broadway opening.  It was to occur in the first backstage scene (Act II, Scene 2) prior to \"Happy Talk\" and was sung to the same melody as \"Bright Canary Yellow\". Its melody can be heard in the 1958 film as Emile reads aloud the card with the flowers he has brought backstage for Nellie to the Thanksgiving show; the second stanza was repurposed and sung by the Prince in the 1965 TV production of ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''.<ref>Block, pp. 139, 142\u2013143</ref>\n* A reprise of \"Younger Than Springtime\" that follows Cable's rejection of Liat, was added after January 1949.<ref name = \"B142\" /> It followed two separate attempts at songs for Cable. One song, designated as \"My Friend\" was a duet for Cable and Liat, included such lyrics as \"My friend, my friend, is coming around the bend\" and was rejected by Logan as one of the worst he'd ever heard.  Rodgers and Hammerstein's second attempt to place a song there, \"Suddenly Lovely\", was considered by Logan too lightweight and was later repurposed for ''[[The King and I]]'' as \"[[Getting to Know You (song)|Getting to Know You]]\".<ref>Block, pp. 142, 145\u2013146</ref> The melody for \"Younger than Springtime\" was from a song, \"My Wife\", intended for ''Allegro'' but not used.<ref>Nolan, p. 190</ref>\n* \"Honey Bun\" was not included in the January 1949 libretto (a note marks that the lyrics will be supplied later).<ref name = \"B142\">Block, p. 142</ref>\n* \"My Girl Back Home\" (Cable) preceded \"You've Got to be Carefully Taught\" in the original score but was cut before the first Broadway production. It appears in the movie version as a duet for Nellie and Cable. It was reinstated for the 2002 London revival, for Cable.<ref name = \"B142146\" />\n* \"You've Got to be Carefully Taught\" originally had several singing lines for Emile following the conclusion of the lyrics for Cable.<ref name =\"B142146\">Block, pp. 142, 146</ref>\n\n==Subsequent productions==\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Florence Henderson 1967.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A woman in her thirties with short, parted hair in a black-and-white portrait shot.

It is novel in texture and treatment, rich in dramatic substance, and eloquent in song, a musical play to be cherished. Under Logan's superb direction, the action shifts with constant fluency.&nbsp;... [He] has kept the book cumulatively arresting and tremendously satisfying. The occasional dances appear to be magical improvisations. It is a long and prodigal entertainment, but it seems all too short. The Rodgers music is not his finest, but it fits the mood and pace of ''South Pacific'' so felicitously that one does not miss a series of hit tunes. In the same way the lyrics are part and parcel of a captivating musical unity.<ref name=Suskin>Suskin, Steven.

According to professor [[Philip Beidler]], \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's attempt to use the Broadway theater to make a courageous statement against racial bigotry in general and institutional racism in the postwar United States in particular\" forms part of ''South Pacific''&nbsp;'s legend.<ref>Beidler, p. 213</ref> Although ''Tales of the South Pacific'' treats the question of racism, it does not give it the central place that it takes in the musical. Andrea Most, writing on the \"politics of race\" in ''South Pacific'', suggests that in the late 1940s, American liberals, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, turned to the fight for racial equality as a practical means of advancing their progressive views without risking being deemed communists.<ref>Most, pp. 308\u2013309</ref> [[Trevor Nunn]], director of the 2001 West End production, notes the importance of the fact that Nellie, a southerner, ends the play about to be the mother in an interracial family: \"It's being performed in America in 1949. That's the resonance.\"<ref name = \"b8\" />\n\nFrom the early drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made the issue of racial prejudice central to the story. Hammerstein repeatedly rewrote the Act II backstage scene where Emile, Nellie and Cable confront the question of the Americans' racism.<ref name = \"racial\" /> As critic Robert Butler pointed out in his educational companion to the 2001 London production, \"if one young person has a prejudice, it might be a character flaw; if two young people share a prejudice, it tells us something about the society in which they grew up\".<ref name = \"b3\" /> In one draft, Emile advises that the Americans are no better than the Axis Powers, in their prejudice, and suggests they go home to sing songs about how all are created free and equal.  Lovensheimer states that a postwar American audience would have found such onstage sentiments to be offensive. In the staged version, Emile's expressions are limited to two lines arguing that prejudice is not inborn.<ref name = \"racial\">Lovensheimer, pp. 97\u201398</ref>\n\n[[File:Happy Talk.jpg|thumb|alt=A crouching man in military uniform watches a young woman and a middle-aged one make hand gestures to him|right|\"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\": Cable ([[William Tabbert]]) watches Liat ([[Betta St. John]]) and Bloody Mary ([[Juanita Hall|Hall]]).]]\nAt the heart of this scene is Cable's song \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism.  Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most controversial element of the show.<ref>Most, p. 307</ref> Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein.  When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, \"That's what the show is about!\"<ref>Michener 1992, pp. 294\u2013295</ref> Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less \"briskly\", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered.<ref name=\"M162\">Maslon, p. 162</ref> Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; [[Wolcott Gibbs]] wrote of \"something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing\" while [[John Mason Brown]] opined that he was \"somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 85\u201386</ref> After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\".  Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the [[Library of Congress]], the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote \"What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'&nbsp;... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough.\"<ref name=\"L104\">Lovensheimer, p. 104</ref> Nevertheless, another wrote, \"I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding\".<ref name = \"L104\" />\n\nWhen the tour of the show reached a racially segregated theatre in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], Rodgers and Hammerstein threatened to cancel the performances there unless seating was integrated, which it was.<ref name = \"M163\" /> In 1953, with the tour in Atlanta, there was controversy over \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\".  Two Georgia state legislators, Senator John D. Shepard and Representative David C. Jones, objected to the song, stating that though ''South Pacific'' was a fine piece of entertainment, that song \"contained an underlying philosophy inspired by Moscow\", and explained, \"Intermarriage produces half-breeds.  And half-breeds are not conducive to the higher type of society.&nbsp;... In the South, we have pure blood lines and we intend to keep it that way.\"  They stated that they planned to introduce legislation to outlaw such communist-inspired works. The Northern press had a field day; Hammerstein, when asked for comment, responded that he did not think the legislators were representing their constituents very well, and that he was surprised at the suggestion that anything kind and decent must necessarily originate in Moscow.<ref name =\"M163\">Maslon, p. 163</ref><ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/03/01/93397165.pdf Georgia legislators score ''South Pacific''; see Red philosophy in song against bias]\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 1, 1953, accessed March 12, 2013 (subscription required)</ref> In part because of the song, touring companies of ''South Pacific'' had difficulty getting bookings in the Deep South.<ref>Hischak, p. 324</ref>\n\n[[File:Pinza with kids.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Pinza, in a white suit, walks along holding a mixed-race boy, about 7 or 8 years old, while listening to a slightly older girl who walks next to him.|upright|Emile (Pinza) with his children.]]\nIn the final scene of Act I, Nellie rejects Emile because of his part-Polynesian children.  In so doing, Nellie fails to live up to the American ideal that \"all men are created equal\", which Emile had earlier affirmed.<ref name = \"b8\">Butler, p. 8</ref> This scene was also toned down by Hammerstein; in early drafts, Nellie, initially unable to force out a word to describe Emile's first wife, after he supplies the word \"Polynesian\", responds with \"colored\".  This pronouncement, which makes Nellie less sympathetic as a character, was restored for the 2008 Lincoln Center production.  As [[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented, \"it's upsetting because Nellie isn't some cracker stereotype&nbsp;\u2013 she's lovable&nbsp;... But how can we love a racist?\"<ref name = \"love\">Lovensheimer, pp. 90\u201392</ref> Most argues that even Emile is tainted by racism, as his lifestyle is dependent on the maintenance of a system whereby he benefits from underpaid native labor&nbsp;\u2013 Bloody Mary is able to attract workers to make grass skirts for sale to GIs because, as she puts it, \"French planters stingy bastards!\"<ref>Most, pp. 330\u2013331</ref>\n\n=== Sex and gender roles ===\nNellie Forbush, in her journey from Little Rock, Arkansas, to serving as a Navy nurse and on to the domesticity of the final scene of ''South Pacific'', parallels the experience of many American women of the period. They entered the workforce during the war, only to find afterwards a societal expectation that they give up their jobs to men, with their best route to financial security being marriage and becoming a housewife. One means of securing audience acceptance of Nellie's choices was the sanitization of her sexual past from her counterpart in the Michener work&nbsp;\u2013 that character had a [[4-F (US Military)|4-F]] boyfriend back in Arkansas and a liaison with Bill Harbison while on the island.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 108\u2013109</ref><ref>Michener 1967, p. 106</ref>\n\n[[File:Billis and Nellie laundry.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A military scene.

Other enlisted men, many bare-chested, watch.|Nellie (Martin) praises the laundry skills of Billis (McCormick) as his friends look on.]]\nThe male characters in ''South Pacific'' are intended to appear conventionally masculine.  In the aftermath of World War II, the masculinity of the American soldier was beyond public question.  Cable's virility with Liat is made evident to the audience.  Although Billis operates a laundry \u2013 Nellie particularly praises his pleats \u2013 and appears in a grass skirt in the \"Thanksgiving Follies\", these acts are consistent with his desire for money and are clearly intended to be comic.  His interest in the young women on Bali H'ai establishes his masculinity.  Lovensheimer writes that Billis is more defined by class than by sexuality, evidenced by the Seabee's assumption, on learning that Cable went to college in New Jersey, that it was [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] (the state's flagship public university), rather than [[Ivy League]] Princeton, and by his delight on learning that the rescue operation for him had cost $600,000 when his uncle had told him he would never be worth a dime.<ref>Rodgers and Hammerstein, pp. 290, 353</ref><ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 109\u2013111, 142\u2013143</ref>\n\nMeryle Secrest, in her biography of Rodgers, theorizes that ''South Pacific'' marks a transition for the pair \"between heroes and heroines who are more or less evenly matched in age and stories about powerful older men and the younger women who are attracted to them\".<ref>Secrest, p. 294</ref> Lovensheimer points out that this pattern only holds for two of their five subsequent musicals, ''The King and I'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', and in the former, the love between Anna and the King is not expressed in words.  He believes a different transition took place: that their plots, beginning with  ''South Pacific'', involve a woman needing to enter and accept her love interest's world to be successful and accepted herself.  He notes that both ''Oklahoma!'' and ''Carousel'' involve a man entering his wife's world, Curly in ''Oklahoma!'' about to become a farmer with expectations of success, whereas Billy Bigelow in ''Carousel'' fails to find work after leaving his place as a barker.  Lovensheimer deems ''Allegro'' to be a transition, where the attempts of the lead female character to alter her husband Joe's world to suit her ambition lead to the breakup of their marriage.  He argues that the nurse Emily, who goes with Joe in his return to the small town where he was happy, is a forerunner of Nellie, uprooting her life in Chicago for Joe.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\nSecrest notes that much is overlooked in the rush to have love conquer all in ''South Pacific'', \"questions of the long-term survival of a marriage between a sophisticate who read Proust at bedtime and a girl who liked Dinah Shore and did not read anything were raised by Nellie Forbush only to be brushed aside.  As for the interracial complexities of raising two Polynesian children, all such issues were subsumed in the general euphoria of true love.\"<ref>Secrest, p. 293</ref>  Lovensheimer too wonders how Nellie will fare as the second Madame de Becque, \"little Nellie Forbush from Arkansas ends up in a tropical paradise, far from her previous world, with a husband, a servant, and two children who speak a language she does not understand\".<ref>Lovensheimer, p. 115</ref>\n\n=== Cultural effect ===\n[[File:Wash man from hair.jpg|thumb|alt=Martin, wearing a swimsuit, stands in an improvised shower stall as water pours down on her.|right|[[Mary Martin]] washed her hair onstage eight times a week.]]\nA mammoth hit, ''South Pacific'' sparked huge media and public attention.  ''South Pacific'' was one of the first shows for which a variety of souvenirs were available: fans could buy ''South Pacific'' neckties, or for women, lipstick and scarves.  Fake ticket stubs could be purchased for use as status symbols.<ref name=\"M153\" /> There were ''South Pacific'' music boxes, dolls, fashion accessories, and even hairbrushes for use after washing men from hair.<ref>Hammerstein, p. 200</ref> Martin's on-stage shower prompted an immediate fashion craze for short hair that could be managed through once-a-day washing at home, rather than in a beauty salon, and for the products which would allow for such care.<ref>Beidler, pp. 116\u2013117</ref> The songs of ''South Pacific'' could be heard on the radio, and they were popular among dance bands and in piano lounges.<ref name=\"M153\" /> Mordden comments that ''South Pacific'' contained nothing but hit songs; Rodgers and Hammerstein's other successful works always included at least one song which did not become popular.<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 120</ref>\n\nThe cast album, recorded ten days after the show's opening, was an immediate hit.  Released by [[Columbia Records]], it spent 69 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard and a total of 400 weeks on the charts, becoming the best-selling record of the 1940s.<ref name=\"M153\" /> It was one of the early [[LP record]]s, with a turntable speed of 33{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm, and helped to popularize that technology&nbsp;\u2013 previously, show albums and operas had been issued on sets of 78&nbsp;rpm records, with high prices and much less music on a single disc.  In the years to come, the LP would become the medium of choice for the \"longhair\" music niche of show, opera and classical performances.<ref>Beidler, p. 117</ref>\n\nAn indirect effect of the success of the show was the career of James Michener.  His one percent of the show as author of the source material, plus the income from a share which the duo allowed him to buy on credit, made him financially independent and allowed him to quit his job as an editor at Macmillan and to become a full-time writer.<ref>Michener 1992, p. 294</ref><ref>May, pp. 112\u2013125</ref> Over the next five decades, his lengthy, detailed novels centering on different places would dominate the bestseller lists.<ref>May, pp. ix\u2013x</ref>\n\n== Music and recordings ==\n\n=== Musical treatment ===\nThe role of Nellie Forbush was the first time with Hammerstein that Rodgers made the leading female role a [[belt (music)|belter]], rather than a [[lyric soprano]] like Laurey in ''Oklahoma!'' and Julie in ''Carousel''.{{#tag:ref|The female lead in ''Allegro'', Jenny, is principally a dancing role; the performer playing her does not sing by herself.|group= n}} According to Mordden, \"Nellie was something new in R&H, carrying a goodly share of the score on a 'Broadway' voice\".<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 108</ref>\n\nNellie does not sing together with Emile, because Rodgers promised Martin that she would not have to compete vocally with Pinza,{{#tag:ref|They do sing together at the start of the final scene of Act I, but their characters are supposed to have been drinking.|group= n}} but the composer sought to unite them in the underlying music.  A [[tetrachord]], heard before we see either lead, is played during the instrumental introduction to \"''Dites-Moi''&nbsp;\", the show's first song.  Considered as pitch classes, that is, as pitches without characterization by octave or register, the motif is C-B-A-G. It will be heard repeatedly in Nellie's music, or in the music (such as \"Twin Soliloquies\") that she shares with Emile, and even in the bridge of \"Some Enchanted Evening\".  Lovensheimer argues that this symbolizes what Nellie is trying to say with her Act II line \"We're the same sort of people fundamentally&nbsp;\u2013 you and me\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 124\u2013132</ref>\n\nOriginally, \"Twin Soliloquies\" came to an end shortly after the vocal part finishes.  Logan found this unsatisfying and worked with Trude Rittmann to find a better ending to the song.  This piece of music, dubbed \"Unspoken Thoughts\", continues the music as Nellie and Emile sip brandy together, and is called by Lovensheimer \"the one truly operatic moment of the score\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> \"This Nearly Was Mine\" is a big bass solo for Emile in waltz time, deemed by Rodgers biographer William G. Hyland as \"one of his finest efforts\".<ref name =\"WGH183\">Hyland, p. 183</ref> Only five notes are used in the first four bars, a phrase which is then repeated with a slight variation in the following four bars.  The song ends an octave higher than where it began, making it perfect for Pinza's voice.<ref name = \"WGH183\" />\n\nTwo songs, \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\" and \"Honey Bun\" are intended to imitate American popular songs of the 1940s.  In the former, the triple recitation of the song title at intervals suggests a [[big band]] arrangement of the wartime era, while in the bridge, the final eight bars (repeating the lyrics from the bridge's first eight bars) gives a suggestion of [[swing music|swing]].  The sections beginning \"If the man don't understand you\" and \"If you laugh at different comics\" have a [[blues]] style.  Lovensheimer deems the song \"Nellie's spontaneous and improvisatory expression of her feelings through the vocabulary of popular song\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 133\u2013135</ref> Mordden suggests that \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\" with its \"take no prisoners bounce\", might well be the center of the score, with the typical American girl defending her love by spouting clich\u00e9s, many of which, such as \"corny as Kansas in August\" Hammerstein made up, and \"sure enough, over the years they have become clich\u00e9s\".<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 121</ref>\n\n=== Recordings ===\n[[File:South pacific bway 1949.jpg|thumb|Cover of original cast album]]\n[[Columbia Records]] recorded the overture and most of the songs from the original production in 1949, using members of the cast including [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]]. Drawing from the original [[Acetate disc|lacquer disc]] masters, Columbia released the album in both the new LP format and on 78-rpm discs.  Soon after Sony acquired Columbia in 1988, a CD was released from the previously unused magnetic tape recording from the same 1949 sessions in New York City. The CD includes the bonus tracks \"Loneliness of Evening\" (recorded in 1949 by Mary Martin), \"My Girl Back Home\" (Martin), \"Bali Ha'i\" (Pinza) and Symphonic Scenario for Concert Orchestra (original orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett).

[[Thurl Ravenscroft]], later television's [[Tony the Tiger]], sang the [[basso profundo]] notes in \"There Is Nothing Like a Dame\". The film opened with Cable's flight to the island in a [[PBY]], followed by the Seabees' beach scene, and added Billis' rescue and scenes from the mission to spy on the Japanese.  The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Sound]]. It was also nominated for the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Scoring of a Musical Picture]] (Alfred Newman and Ken Darby), and the 65&nbsp;mm [[Todd-AO]] cinematography by [[Leon Shamroy]] was also nominated.<!-- The film has its own article, so we don't need to include more production details about it here. --> The film was widely criticized for its use of color to indicate mood, with actors changing color as they began to sing.

The work premiered in 1949 on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and was an immediate hit, running for 1,925 performances. The plot is based on [[James A. Michener]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize-winning]] 1947 book ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'' and combines elements of several of those stories. [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] believed they could write a musical based on Michener's work that would be financially successful and, at the same time, send a strong progressive message on racism.\n\nThe plot centers on an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island during World War II, who falls in love with a middle-aged expatriate French plantation owner but struggles to accept his mixed-race children. A secondary romance, between a [[U.S. Marine]] lieutenant and a young [[Tonkin]]ese woman, explores his fears of the social consequences should he marry his Asian sweetheart. The issue of racial prejudice is candidly explored throughout the musical, most controversially in the lieutenant's song, \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\".  Supporting characters, including a comic [[petty officer#United States|petty officer]] and the Tonkinese girl's mother, help to tie the stories together.  Because he lacked military knowledge, Hammerstein had difficulty writing that part of the script; the director of the original production, Logan, assisted him and received credit as co-writer of the book.\n\nThe original Broadway production enjoyed immense critical and box-office success, became [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|the second-longest running Broadway musical]] to that point (behind Rodgers and Hammerstein's earlier ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943)), and has remained popular ever since. After they signed [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] as the leads, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind.  The piece won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1950.  Especially in the Southern U.S., its racial theme provoked controversy, for which its authors were unapologetic. Several of its songs, including \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\", \"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\", \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\", \"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\", \"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\", \"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\", and \"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\", have become popular standards.\n\nThe production won ten [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical, Best Score, and Best Libretto, and it is the only musical production to win Tony Awards in all four acting categories. Its original cast album was the bestselling record of the 1940s, and other recordings of the show have also been popular. The show has enjoyed many successful revivals and tours, spawning a [[South Pacific (1958 film)|1958 film]] and television adaptations. The 2008 Broadway revival, a critical success, ran for 996 performances and won seven Tonys, including Best Musical Revival.\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Tales of the South Pacific}}\nAlthough book editor and university instructor [[James Michener]] could have avoided military service in World War II as a birthright [[Quaker]], he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 1942.  He was not sent to [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|the South Pacific theater]] until April 1944, when he was assigned to write a history of the Navy in the Pacific and was allowed to travel widely.  He survived a plane crash in [[New Caledonia]]; the near-death experience motivated him to write fiction, and he began listening to the stories told by soldiers. One journey took him to the [[Treasury Islands]], where he discovered an unpleasant village, called Bali-ha'i, populated by \"scrawny residents and only one pig\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 35\u201339</ref> Struck by the name, Michener wrote it down and soon began to record, on a battered typewriter, his version of the tales.<ref name = \"L39\" /> On a plantation on the island of [[Espiritu Santo]], he met a woman named Bloody Mary; she was small, almost toothless, her face stained with red [[betel nut|betel juice]].  Punctuated with profanity learned from [[G.I. (military)|GIs]], she complained endlessly to Michener about the French colonial government, which refused to allow her and other [[Tonkin]]ese to return to their native Vietnam, lest the plantations be depopulated.  She told him also of her plans to oppose colonialism in [[French Indochina]].{{#tag:ref|Michener later reflected, \"I would often think of her&nbsp;... when American troops were fighting their fruitless battles in Vietnam, and I wondered if our leaders realized that the enemy they were fighting consisted of millions of determined people like Bloody Mary.\" See May, p. 20|group= n}} These stories, collected into ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]'', won Michener the [[1948 Pulitzer Prize]] for fiction.<ref name = \"L39\">Lovensheimer, p. 39</ref>\n\n''Tales of the South Pacific'' comprises nineteen stories. Each stands independently but revolves around the preparation for an American military operation to dislodge the Japanese from a nearby island.  This operation, dubbed ''Alligator'', occurs in the penultimate story, \"The Landing at Kuralei\".  Many of the characters die in that battle, and the last story is titled \"The Cemetery at Huga Point\". The stories are thematically linked in pairs: the first and final stories are reflective, the second and eighteenth involve battle, the third and seventeenth involve preparation for battle, and so on. The tenth story, at the center, is not paired with any other.  This story, \"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", was one of only four of his many works that Michener later admitted to holding in high regard.  It was the one that attracted [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s attention for its potential to be converted into a stage work.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 39, 191</ref>\n\n\"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", set in part on the island of Bali-ha'i, focuses on the romance between a young Tonkinese woman, Liat, and one of the Americans, Marine Lieutenant Joe Cable, a [[Princeton University|Princeton]] graduate and scion of a wealthy [[Philadelphia Main Line|Main Line]] family.  Pressed to marry Liat by her mother, Bloody Mary, Cable reluctantly declines, realizing that the Asian girl would never be accepted by his family or Philadelphia society.  He leaves for battle (where he will die) as Bloody Mary proceeds with her backup plan, to affiance Liat to a wealthy French planter on the islands. Cable struggles, during the story, with his own racism: he is able to overcome it sufficiently to love Liat, but not enough to take her home.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nAnother source of the musical is the eighth story, \"Our Heroine\", which is thematically paired with the 12th, \"A Boar's Tooth\", as both involve American encounters with local cultures.  \"Our Heroine\" tells of the romance between Navy nurse Nellie Forbush, from rural Arkansas, and a wealthy, sophisticated planter,  Frenchman Emile De Becque.{{#tag:ref|The \"De\" was changed to lower case for the musical.  See Maslon, p. 115.|group= n}}  After falling in love with Emile, Nellie (who is introduced briefly in story No. 4, \"An Officer and a Gentleman\") learns that Emile has eight daughters, out of wedlock, with several local women. Michener tells us that \"any person&nbsp;... who was not white or yellow was a nigger\" to Nellie, and while she is willing to accept two of the children (of French-Asian descent) who remain in Emile's household, she is taken aback by the other two girls who live there, evidence that the planter had cohabited with a darker Polynesian woman. To her great relief, she learns that this woman is dead, but Nellie endangers her relationship with Emile when she is initially unable to accept Emile's \"nigger children.\"<ref>Michener 1967, pp. 126\u2013127</ref> Nellie overcomes her feelings and returns to spend her life with her plantation owner.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 43\u201344, 191</ref>\n\nAdditional elements of ''South Pacific'' had their genesis in others of Michener's 19 tales. One introduces the character of Bloody Mary; another tells of a British spy hidden on the Japanese-controlled island who relays information about Japanese movements to [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] by radio.  Michener based the spy, dubbed \"the Remittance Man\", on Captain [[Martin Clemens]], a Scot, who unlike his fictional counterpart, survived the war.  The stories also tell of the seemingly endless waiting that precedes battle, and the efforts of the Americans to repel boredom, which would inspire the song \"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 49\u201350; and May, pp. 24\u201325</ref> Several of the stories involve the [[Seabee]], Luther Billis, who in the musical would be used both for comic relief and to tie together episodes involving otherwise unconnected characters.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 52\u201353</ref> A 2001 article in ''Islands Magazine'' states that Michener renamed [[Ambae Island|Aoba Island]] Bali-ha'i. The author interviewed the proprietor of a resort on [[Espiritu Santo]], who claimed that Emile was modeled on his father and that the \"real Bloody Mary\" lived on Espiritu Santo for many years after the war and lived to the age of 102.<ref>Gibbs, Tony.

Logan recalled that he then pointed it out to Hammerstein, who read Michener's book and spoke to Rodgers; the two agreed to do the project so long as they had majority control, to which Hayward grudgingly agreed.<ref>Fordin, pp. 259\u2013260; and Logan, pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Michener, in his 1992 memoirs, wrote that the stories were first pitched as a movie concept to [[MGM]] by [[Kenneth MacKenna]], head of the studio's literary department.  MacKenna's half brother was [[Jo Mielziner]], who had designed the sets for ''Carousel'' and ''Allegro''.  Michener states that Mielziner learned of the work from MacKenna and brought it to the attention of Hammerstein and Rodgers, pledging to create the sets if they took on the project.<ref>Lovensheimer, p. 47</ref>\n\nHayward attempted to buy the rights from Michener outright, offering $500; Michener declined.  Although playwright [[Lynn Riggs]] had received 1.5% of the box office grosses for the right to adapt ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs]]'' into ''Oklahoma!'', Michener never regretted accepting one percent of the gross receipts from ''South Pacific''.  As Rodgers and Hammerstein began their work on the adaptation, Michener worked mostly with the lyricist, but Rodgers was concerned about the implications of the setting, fearing that he would have to include ukuleles and guitars, which he disliked.  Michener assured him that the only instrument he had ever heard the natives play was an emptied barrel of gasoline, drummed upon with clubs.<ref>May, p. 80</ref>\n\n=== Composition ===\n[[File:R and H.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two men in business suits sit in theatre seats amiably discussing what they are watching|Rodgers (left) and Hammerstein]]\nSoon after their purchase of the rights, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided not to include a ballet, as in their earlier works, feeling that the realism of the setting would not support one.  Concerned that an adaptation too focused on \"Fo' Dolla'&nbsp;\", the story of the encounter between Cable and Liat, would be too similar to ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', Hammerstein spent months studying the other stories and focused his attention on \"Our Heroine\", the tale of the romance between Nellie and Emile.  The team decided to include both romances in the musical play.  It was conventional at the time that if one love story in a musical was serious, the other would be more comedic, but in this case both were serious and focused on racial prejudice.  They decided to increase the role played by Luther Billis in the stories, merging experiences and elements of several other characters into him.  Billis's wheeling and dealing would provide comic relief.<ref>Fordin, pp. 261\u2013262</ref> They also shortened the title to ''South Pacific'' \u2013 Rodgers related that the producers tired of people making risqu\u00e9 puns on the word \"tales\".<ref>Maslon, p. 117</ref>\n\nIn early drafts of the musical, Hammerstein gave significant parts to two characters who eventually came to have only minor roles, Bill Harbison and Dinah Culbert.  Harbison is one of the major characters in ''Tales of the South Pacific''; a model officer at the start, he gradually degenerates to the point where, with battle imminent, he requests his influential father-in-law to procure for him a transfer to a post in the United States. Hammerstein conceived of him as a rival to Emile for Nellie's affections, and gave him a song, \"The Bright Young Executive of Today\".  As redrafts focused the play on the two couples, Harbison became less essential, and he was relegated to a small role as the executive officer to the commander of the island, Captain Brackett.  Dinah, a nurse and friend of Nellie, is also a major character in Michener's work, and was seen as a possible love interest for Billis, though any actual romance was limited by Navy regulations forbidding fraternization between officers (all American nurses in World War II were commissioned officers) and enlisted men. \"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\" originated as a duet for Dinah and Nellie, with Dinah beginning the song and developing its theme.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 58\u201367</ref> According to Lovensheimer, Nellie's and Dinah's \"friendship became increasingly incidental to the plot as the writing continued. Hammerstein eventually realized that the decision to wash Emile out of her hair had to be Nellie's.  Only then did the scene have the dramatic potential for Nellie's emotional transition\" as she realizes her love for Emile. In the final version, Dinah retains one solo line in the song.<ref>Rodgers and Hammerstein, pp. 310\u2013313</ref>\n\nJoshua Logan, in his memoirs, stated that after months of effort in the first half of 1948, Hammerstein had written only the first scene, an outline, and some lyrics.  Hammerstein was having trouble due to lack of knowledge of the military, a matter with which Logan, a veteran of the armed forces, was able to help.  The dialogue was written in consultation between the two of them, and eventually Logan asked to be credited for his work.  Rodgers and Hammerstein decided that while Logan would receive co-writing credit on the book, he would receive no author's royalties. Logan stated that a contract putting these changes into force was sent over to his lawyer with instructions that unless it was signed within two hours, Logan need not show up for rehearsals as director.<ref>Logan, pp. 273\u2013281; and May, pp. 98\u2013103</ref> Logan signed, although his lawyer did not then tell him about the ultimatum.<ref name = \"H179\">Hyland, p. 179</ref> Through the decades that followed, Logan brought the matter up from time to time, demanding compensation, but when he included his version of the events in his 1976 memoirs, it was disputed by Rodgers (Hammerstein had died in 1960).<ref name = \"H179\"/> Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that Logan was compensated when [[South Pacific (1958 film)|''South Pacific'' was filmed in 1958]], as Logan received a substantial share of the profits as director.{{#tag:ref|Jim Lovensheimer, in his book on the genesis of ''South Pacific'', questions Logan's account: \"in his autobiography, at least, Logan is the star of every show he mentions\".<ref name=\"Lovensheimer 46\"/>|group= n}}<ref>Secrest, p. 290</ref> According to Michener biographer Stephen J. May, \"it is difficult to assess just how much of the final book Josh Logan was responsible for.  Some estimates say 30 to 40 percent.  But that percentage is not as critical perhaps as his knowledge of military lore and directing for the theatre, without which the creation of ''South Pacific'' would have collapsed during that summer of 1948.\"<ref>May, p. 100</ref>\n\nRodgers composed the music once he received the lyrics from Hammerstein.  A number of stories are told of the speed with which he wrote the music for ''South Pacific''&nbsp;'s numbers. \"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\" was said to have been composed in about twenty minutes; when Hammerstein, who had sent the lyrics by messenger, called to check whether Rodgers had received them, his partner informed him that he had both lyrics and music. Legend has it he composed \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\" in ten minutes over coffee in Logan's apartment; what he did create in that time frame was the three-note motif which begins both song and musical.  Hammerstein's lyrics for \"Bali Ha'i\" were inspired by the stage backdrop which designer [[Jo Mielziner]] had painted.  Feeling that the island of Bali Ha'i did not appear mysterious enough, Mielziner painted some mist near the summit of its volcano. When Hammerstein saw this he immediately thought of the lyric, \"my head sticking up from a low-flying cloud\" and the rest of the song followed easily from that.<ref>Nolan, pp. 184\u2013186</ref>\n\n=== Casting and out-of-town previews ===\n[[File:Ezio Pinza SP.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Publicity portrait of a man in his mid-fifties with curly hair (Pinza)|Ezio Pinza]]\nIn May 1948, Rodgers received a telephone call from [[Edwin Lester]] of the [[Los Angeles Civic Light Opera]].  Lester had signed former [[Metropolitan Opera]] star [[Ezio Pinza]] for $25,000 to star in a new show, ''Mr. Ambassador''.  The show had not been written, and it never would be.<ref>Maslon, p. 111</ref> Lester hoped that Rodgers would take over Pinza's contract.  Pinza had become bored as the Met's leading lyric [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and having played the great opera houses, sought other worlds to conquer.  Rodgers immediately saw Pinza as perfect for the role of Emile.<ref>Nolan, p. 178</ref> Lester carefully broached the subject to Pinza and his wife/business manager and provided them with a copy of ''Tales of the South Pacific''.  When Pinza read the book, he told Lester, \"Sell me right away!\"<ref name = \"M112\">Maslon, p. 112</ref> Pinza's contract for ''South Pacific'' included a clause limiting his singing to 15 minutes per performance.<ref name = \"M112\" /> With Pinza's signing, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided to make his the lead male role, subordinating the story of the pair of young lovers.  It was unusual on Broadway for the romantic lead to be an older male.<ref name = \"F262\">Fordin, p. 262</ref>\n\n[[File:Mary Martin 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait of a woman in her mid-thirties, with long curly hair and wearing an old-fashioned blouse with string tie|[[Mary Martin]]]]\nFor the role of Nellie, Rodgers sought [[Mary Martin]], who had nearly been cast to originate the role of Laurey in ''Oklahoma!''<ref name = \"F262\" /> Martin was playing the title role in the touring company of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''.  After Hammerstein and Rodgers saw her play in Los Angeles in mid-1948, they asked her to consider the part.  Martin was reluctant to sing opposite Pinza's powerful voice; Rodgers assured her he would see to it the two never sang at the same time,<ref>Davis, p. 123</ref> a promise he mostly kept.<ref name = \"H180\">Hyland, p. 180</ref> Rodgers and Martin lived near each other in Connecticut, and after her tour Rodgers invited Martin and her husband, Richard Halliday, to his home to hear the three songs for the musical that he had completed, none of them for Nellie.<ref>Davis, p. 125</ref> \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\" especially struck Martin, and although disappointed the song was not for her, she agreed to do the part.<ref name = \"H180\" /> Although Nellie and Emile were already fully developed characters in Michener's stories, during the creation of ''South Pacific'', Rodgers, Hammerstein and Logan began to adapt the roles specifically to the talents of Martin and Pinza and to tailor the music for their voices.<ref>[http://www.rnh.com/show/97/South-Pacific#shows-history \"''South Pacific'': History], Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, accessed August 29, 2012</ref>\n\nMartin influenced several of her songs.  While showering one day during rehearsals, she came up with the idea for a scene in which she would shampoo her hair onstage.  This gave rise to \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\".<ref>Hammerstein, p. 199</ref> Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in ''South Pacific''.<ref>Maslon, p. 93</ref> To introduce another of Martin's numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played \"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\" for her.  When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench.  Rodgers gazed down at her, \"That's exactly what I want.  Never do it differently.  We must feel you couldn't squeeze out another sound.\"<ref>Nolan, p. 185</ref>\n\nThe producers held extensive auditions to fill the other roles.<ref name = \"F267\">Fordin, p. 267</ref> [[Myron McCormick]] was cast as Billis; according to Logan, no one else was seriously considered. The two roles which gave the most trouble were those of Cable and Bloody Mary.<ref name = \"L283\" /> They tried to get Harold Keel for the role of Cable (he had played Curly in the West End production of ''Oklahoma!'') only to find that he had signed a contract with MGM under the name [[Howard Keel]].<ref name = \"N182\">Nolan, p. 182</ref> [[William Tabbert]] was eventually cast as Cable, though Logan instructed him to lose {{convert|20|lb}}.  African-American singer [[Juanita Hall]] was cast as Bloody Mary; Logan recalled that at her audition, she took a squatting pose which proclaimed, \"I am Bloody Mary and don't you dare cast anyone else!\"<ref name = \"L283\">Logan, p. 283</ref> [[Betta St. John]], who under the name Betty Striegler had replaced [[Bambi Linn]] as Louise in ''Carousel'', took the role of Liat.<ref name = \"N182\" /> Logan directed (he and Hayward co-produced with Rodgers and Hammerstein), Mielziner did the stage design, [[Trude Rittmann]] and [[Robert Russell Bennett]] prepared the orchestration, and [[Elizabeth Montgomery Wilmot|Elizabeth Montgomery]] of [[Motley Theatre Design Group]] designed the costumes.<ref name = \"F267\" /> [[Salvatore Dell'Isola]] served as music director.<ref>Maslon, p. 124</ref>\n\n===Original production===\n[[File:South Pacific Playbill.jpg| thumb|upright| alt = Cover of the Playbill for the original production at the Majestic Theatre.

There was no formal chorus; each of the nurses and [[Seabees in World War II|Seabees]] was given a name, and, in the case of the men, $50 to equip themselves with what clothing they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. [[Don Fellows]], the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots.<ref>Maslon, pp. 124\u2013125</ref> Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship.<ref name=\"Davis, p. 130\">Davis, p. 130</ref> Of the mood backstage, \"everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive.\"<ref name = \"N186\">Nolan, p. 186</ref>  He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in ''Allegro''), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless.  He soon had the Seabees pacing back and forth like caged animals during \"There Is Nothing Like a Dame\", a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show.<ref name = \"N186\" /> One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking.<ref name = \"M121\">Maslon, p. 121</ref> As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\" with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage.  This was eliminated after she vaulted into the orchestra pit, knocking out Rittman.<ref>Logan, p. 289</ref>\n\nThere were no major difficulties during the four weeks of rehearsal in New York; Martin later remembered that the \"gypsy run-through\" for friends and professional associates on a bare stage was met with some of the most enthusiastic applause she could remember.  One of the few people having trouble was Pinza, who had difficulty adjusting to the constant alterations in the show \u2013 he was used to the operatic world, where a role rarely changed once learned.  Pinza's mispronunciations of English exasperated Logan, and driving to [[New Haven, Connecticut]] for the first week of previews, Pinza discussed with his wife the possibility of a return to the Met, where he knew audiences would welcome him.  She told him to let ''South Pacific''&nbsp;'s attendees decide for themselves. When the tryouts began in New Haven on March 7, the play was an immediate hit; the ''[[New Haven Register]]'' wrote, \"''South Pacific'' should make history\".<ref>Maslon, pp. 126, 129</ref>\n\nNevertheless, a number of changes were made in New Haven and in the subsequent two weeks of previews in Boston. The show was running long; Logan persuaded his friend, playwright [[Emlyn Williams]], to go over the script and cut extraneous dialogue.<ref name = \"M129\">Maslon, p. 129</ref> There were wide expectations of a hit; producer [[Mike Todd]] came backstage and advised that the show not be taken to New York \"because it's too damned good for them\".<ref>Nolan, p. 191</ref> The show moved to Boston, where it was so successful that playwright [[George S. Kaufman]] joked that people lining up there at the [[Shubert Theatre (Boston)|Shubert Theatre]] \"don't actually want anything&nbsp;... They just want to push money under the doors.\"<ref name=Nolan190>Nolan, pp. 190\u2013195</ref>\n\n[[File:South Pacific rehearsal.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Four middle-aged men are gathered around to listen to a woman sing from a book|From left: Logan, Rodgers, Hammerstein, Martin and Michener]]\n''South Pacific'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on April 7, 1949, at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]].<ref>Hischak, p. 261</ref> The advance sale was $400,000, and an additional $700,000 in sales was made soon after the opening. The first night audience was packed with important Broadway, business, and arts leaders.  The audience repeatedly stopped the show with extended applause, which was sustained at length at the final curtain.  Rodgers and Hammerstein had preferred, in the past, not to sponsor an afterparty, but they rented the [[St. Regis Hotel]]'s roof and ordered 200 copies of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in the anticipation of a hit.  ''Times'' critic [[Brooks Atkinson]] gave the show a rave review.<ref>Fordin, p. 281</ref>\n\nThree days after the opening, Pinza signed a contract with MGM to star in films once his obligation to appear in the show expired. He left the show June 1, 1950, replaced by [[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]], though Pinza missed a number of shows due to illness before that.  Martin recalled that, unused to performing eight shows a week, the former opera star would sing full out early in the week, leaving himself little voice towards the end, and would have his understudy go on.<ref>Davis, p. 145</ref><ref name = \"M154\">Maslon, p. 154</ref> Nevertheless, during the year he was in the show, and although aged 58, he was acclaimed as a sex symbol; [[George Jean Nathan]] wrote that \"Pinza has taken the place of Hot Springs, Saratoga, and hormone injections for all the other old boys\".<ref name = \"M154\" />\n\nA national tour began in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, in April 1950; it ran for five years and starred [[Richard Eastham]] as Emile, [[Janet Blair]] as Nellie and [[Ray Walston]] as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film.

This is consistent with Michener's novel, which takes place in the [[New Hebrides]] ([[Vanuatu]]).  As part of [[Melanesia]], its native inhabitants are black-skinned, and Michener repeatedly refers to the island natives as \"black\".|group= n}} Ngana and Jerome, happily sing as they play together (\"Dites-Moi\"). Ensign Nellie Forbush, a na\u00efve [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] nurse from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], has fallen in love with Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French plantation owner, though she has known him only briefly. Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right (\"A Cockeyed Optimist\"). Emile also loves Nellie, and each wonders if the other reciprocates those feelings (\"Twin Soliloquies\"). Emile expresses his love for Nellie, recalling how they met at the officers' club dance and instantly were attracted to each other (\"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\").  Nellie, promising to think about their relationship, returns to the hospital. Emile calls Ngana and Jerome to him, revealing to the audience that they are his children, unbeknownst to Nellie.\n\nMeanwhile, the restless American [[Seabees in World War II|Seabees]], led by crafty Luther Billis, lament the absence of available women&nbsp;\u2013 Navy nurses are commissioned officers and off-limits to enlisted men. There is one civilian woman on the island, nicknamed \"Bloody Mary\", a sassy middle-aged [[Tonkin]]ese vendor of grass skirts, who engages the sailors in sarcastic, flirtatious banter as she tries to sell them her wares (\"Bloody Mary\"). Billis yearns to visit the nearby island of Bali Ha'i \u2013 which is off-limits to all but officers \u2013 supposedly to witness a Boar's Tooth Ceremony (at which he can get an unusual native artifact); the other sailors josh him, saying that his real motivation is to see the young French women there. Billis and the sailors further lament their lack of feminine companionship (\"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame]]\").\n\n[[File:Hall as Bloody Mary.jpg|thumb|left|x300px|alt=A smiling woman with a topknot and strings of shells around her neck|Juanita Hall as Bloody Mary in the original Broadway production]]\n[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Lieutenant#Marine rank|Lieutenant]] Cable arrives on the island from [[Guadalcanal]], having been sent to take part in a dangerous spy mission whose success could turn the tide of the war against Japan.  Bloody Mary tries to persuade Cable to visit \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\", mysteriously telling him that it is ''his'' special island. Billis, seeing an opportunity, urges Cable to go.  Cable meets with his commanding officers, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] George Brackett and [[Commander (United States)#Naval rank|Commander]] William Harbison, who plan to ask Emile to help with the mission because he used to live on the island where the mission will take place. They ask Nellie to help them find out more about Emile's background, for example, his politics and why he left France. They have heard, for instance, that Emile committed a murder, and this might make him less than desirable for such a mission.\n\nAfter thinking a bit more about Emile and deciding she has become attracted on the basis of little knowledge of him, Nellie tells the other nurses that she intends to end her relationship with him (\"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\"). But when he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, he speaks of universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings (\"[[I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy]]\").\n\n[[File:Pinza decides.jpg|thumb|right|alt=In a \"war room\", three military men watch a worried man in civilian dress|Emile (Pinza) decides whether to go with Cable (William Tabbert) and place his hoped-for life with Nellie at risk]]\nCable's mission is to land on a Japanese-held island and report on Japanese ship movements. The Navy officers ask Emile to be Cable's guide, but he refuses their request because of his hopes for a new life with Nellie. Commander Harbison, the executive officer, tells Cable to go on leave until the mission can take place, and Billis obtains a boat and takes Cable to Bali Ha'i. There, Billis participates in the native ceremony, while Bloody Mary introduces Cable to her beautiful daughter, Liat, with whom he must communicate haltingly in French.  Believing that Liat's only chance at a better life is to marry an American officer, Mary leaves Liat alone with Cable. The two are instantly attracted to each other and make love (\"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\").  Billis and the rest of the crew are ready to leave the island, yet must wait for Cable who, unbeknownst to them, is with Liat (\"Bali Ha'i\" (reprise)). Bloody Mary proudly tells Billis that Cable is going to be her son-in-law.\n\nMeanwhile, after Emile's party, Nellie and he reflect on how happy they are to be in love (Reprises of \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\", \"Twin Soliloquies\", \"Cockeyed Optimist\" and \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\").  Emile introduces Nellie to Jerome and Ngana.  Though she finds them charming, she is shocked when Emile reveals that they are his children by his first wife, a dark-skinned Polynesian woman, now deceased.  Nellie is unable to overcome her deep-seated racial prejudices and tearfully leaves Emile, after which he reflects sadly on what might have been (\"Some Enchanted Evening\" (reprise)).\n\n===Act II {{anchor|Synopsis-Act II}}===\n[[File:Thanksgiving Follies.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Three women and three men on stage in a chorus number|The \"Thanksgiving Follies\", from the original production.]]\nIt is [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. The GIs and nurses dance in a holiday revue titled \"Thanksgiving Follies\". In the past week, an epidemic of [[malaria]] has hit the island of Bali Ha'i. Having visited Bali Ha'i often to be with Liat, Cable is also ill, but escapes from the hospital to be with Liat.  As Liat and Cable spend more time together, Bloody Mary is delighted. She encourages them to continue their carefree life on the island (\"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\") and urges them to marry. Cable, aware of his family's prejudices, says he cannot marry a Tonkinese girl. Bloody Mary furiously drags her distraught daughter away, telling Cable that Liat must now marry a much older French plantation owner instead. Cable laments his loss. (\"Younger Than Springtime\" (reprise)).\n\nFor the final number of the Thanksgiving Follies, Nellie performs a comedy burlesque dressed as a sailor singing the praises of \"his\" sweetheart (\"Honey Bun\"). Billis plays Honey Bun, dressed in a blond wig, grass skirt and coconut-shell bra. After the show, Emile asks Nellie to reconsider. She insists that she cannot feel the same way about him since she knows about his children's Polynesian mother.  Frustrated and uncomprehending, Emile asks Cable why he and Nellie have such prejudices. Cable, filled with self-loathing, replies that \"it's not something you're born with\", yet it is an ingrained part of their upbringing (\"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\"). He also vows that if he gets out of the war alive, he won't go home to the United States; everything he wants is on these islands. Emile imagines what might have been (\"This Nearly Was Mine\"). Dejected and feeling that he has nothing to lose, he agrees to join Cable on his dangerous mission.\n\n[[File:Final scene South Pacific.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Emile and Nellie grasp hands as Emile's two children look on.|The final tableau from the original production]]\nThe mission begins with plenty of air support. Offstage, Billis stows away on the plane, falls out when the plane is hit by anti-aircraft fire, and ends up in the ocean waiting to be rescued; the massive rescue operation inadvertently becomes a diversion that allows Emile and Cable to land on the other side of the island undetected. The two send back reports on Japanese ships' movements in the \"Slot\", a strategic strait; American aircraft intercept and destroy the Japanese ships. When the Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zeros]] strafe the Americans' position, Emile narrowly escapes, but Cable is killed.\n\nNellie learns of Cable's death and that Emile is missing. She realizes that she was foolish to reject Emile because of the race of his children's mother. Bloody Mary and Liat come to Nellie asking where Cable is; Mary explains that Liat refuses to marry anyone but him. Nellie comforts Liat. Cable and Emile's espionage work has made it possible for a major offensive, Operation ''Alligator'', to begin. The previously idle fighting men, including Billis, go off to battle.\n\nNellie spends time with Jerome and Ngana and soon comes to love them. While the children are teaching her to sing \"Dites-Moi,\" suddenly Emile's voice joins them. Emile has returned to discover that Nellie has overcome her prejudices and has fallen in love with his children. Emile, Nellie and the children rejoice (\"Dites-Moi\" (reprise)).\n{{clear}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Principal roles and notable performers ==\n<!--this list is for stage performers only, please do not add movie cast-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"120\" | Character\n! width=\"180\" | Description\n! width=\"120\" | Original Broadway cast<ref>Rodgers & Hammerstein, p. 269 (roles and original cast only)</ref>\n! width=\"400\" | Notable subsequent performers in noteworthy productions<!-- REFERENCES FOR EACH OF THESE PERFORMERS ARE GIVEN IN THE \"Original Production\"and \"Revivals\" SECTIONS of this article -->\n|-\n| Nellie Forbush||A young U.S. Navy nurse ||[[Mary Martin]]|| [[Janet Blair]], [[Martha Wright (actress)|Martha Wright]], [[Julie Wilson]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Mindy Carson]], [[Florence Henderson]], [[Iva Withers]], [[Gemma Craven]], [[Lauren Kennedy]], [[Helena Blackman]], [[Kelli O'Hara]], [[Laura Osnes]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Carmen Cusack]], [[Samantha Womack]], [[Lisa McCune]]\n|-\n| Emile de Becque ||A middle-aged expatriate French planter ||[[Ezio Pinza]]|| [[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]], [[Richard Eastham]], [[Wilbur Evans]], [[George Britton (musician)|George Britton]], [[William Chapman (baritone)|William Chapman]], [[Giorgio Tozzi]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Justino D\u00edaz]], [[Philip Quast]], [[Dave Willetts]], [[Brian Stokes Mitchell]], [[Paulo Szot]], [[Teddy Tahu Rhodes]], [[Rod Gilfry]]\n|-\n| Lt.

They are seated on a divan or loveseat|right|[[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]] and [[Mary Martin]] as Emile and Nellie in the original production (1950)]]\nA number of songs were extensively modified or omitted in the weeks leading up to the initial Broadway opening.  They are listed in the order of their one-time placement within the show:\n* \"Bright Canary Yellow\", a short song for Nellie and Emile, was placed just before \"A Cockeyed Optimist\", of which the opening line, \"When the sky is a bright canary yellow\" was intended to play off of the earlier song.<ref>Block, pp. 139\u2013140</ref>\n* \"Now Is the Time\" (Emile) was placed in the beach scene (Act I, Scene 7) just after Emile tells Nellie why he killed the man in France.  It was to be reprised after \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\", but it was felt that for Emile to remain on stage while singing of immediate action was self-contradictory.  It was replaced in Act I by a reprise of \"Some Enchanted Evening\"; in Act II it was initially replaced by  \"Will You Marry Me?\" (later repurposed for ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'') on March 24, 1949, and then by \"This Nearly Was Mine\" on March 29, just over a week before the Broadway opening on April 7.<ref>Block, pp. 140\u2013145</ref>\n* \"Loneliness of Evening\" (Emile) was cut before the Broadway opening.  It was to occur in the first backstage scene (Act II, Scene 2) prior to \"Happy Talk\" and was sung to the same melody as \"Bright Canary Yellow\". Its melody can be heard in the 1958 film as Emile reads aloud the card with the flowers he has brought backstage for Nellie to the Thanksgiving show; the second stanza was repurposed and sung by the Prince in the 1965 TV production of ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''.<ref>Block, pp. 139, 142\u2013143</ref>\n* A reprise of \"Younger Than Springtime\" that follows Cable's rejection of Liat, was added after January 1949.<ref name = \"B142\" /> It followed two separate attempts at songs for Cable. One song, designated as \"My Friend\" was a duet for Cable and Liat, included such lyrics as \"My friend, my friend, is coming around the bend\" and was rejected by Logan as one of the worst he'd ever heard.  Rodgers and Hammerstein's second attempt to place a song there, \"Suddenly Lovely\", was considered by Logan too lightweight and was later repurposed for ''[[The King and I]]'' as \"[[Getting to Know You (song)|Getting to Know You]]\".<ref>Block, pp. 142, 145\u2013146</ref> The melody for \"Younger than Springtime\" was from a song, \"My Wife\", intended for ''Allegro'' but not used.<ref>Nolan, p. 190</ref>\n* \"Honey Bun\" was not included in the January 1949 libretto (a note marks that the lyrics will be supplied later).<ref name = \"B142\">Block, p. 142</ref>\n* \"My Girl Back Home\" (Cable) preceded \"You've Got to be Carefully Taught\" in the original score but was cut before the first Broadway production. It appears in the movie version as a duet for Nellie and Cable. It was reinstated for the 2002 London revival, for Cable.<ref name = \"B142146\" />\n* \"You've Got to be Carefully Taught\" originally had several singing lines for Emile following the conclusion of the lyrics for Cable.<ref name =\"B142146\">Block, pp. 142, 146</ref>\n\n==Subsequent productions==\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Florence Henderson 1967.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A woman in her thirties with short, parted hair in a black-and-white portrait shot.

According to professor [[Philip Beidler]], \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's attempt to use the Broadway theater to make a courageous statement against racial bigotry in general and institutional racism in the postwar United States in particular\" forms part of ''South Pacific''&nbsp;'s legend.<ref>Beidler, p. 213</ref> Although ''Tales of the South Pacific'' treats the question of racism, it does not give it the central place that it takes in the musical. Andrea Most, writing on the \"politics of race\" in ''South Pacific'', suggests that in the late 1940s, American liberals, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, turned to the fight for racial equality as a practical means of advancing their progressive views without risking being deemed communists.<ref>Most, pp. 308\u2013309</ref> [[Trevor Nunn]], director of the 2001 West End production, notes the importance of the fact that Nellie, a southerner, ends the play about to be the mother in an interracial family: \"It's being performed in America in 1949. That's the resonance.\"<ref name = \"b8\" />\n\nFrom the early drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made the issue of racial prejudice central to the story. Hammerstein repeatedly rewrote the Act II backstage scene where Emile, Nellie and Cable confront the question of the Americans' racism.<ref name = \"racial\" /> As critic Robert Butler pointed out in his educational companion to the 2001 London production, \"if one young person has a prejudice, it might be a character flaw; if two young people share a prejudice, it tells us something about the society in which they grew up\".<ref name = \"b3\" /> In one draft, Emile advises that the Americans are no better than the Axis Powers, in their prejudice, and suggests they go home to sing songs about how all are created free and equal.  Lovensheimer states that a postwar American audience would have found such onstage sentiments to be offensive. In the staged version, Emile's expressions are limited to two lines arguing that prejudice is not inborn.<ref name = \"racial\">Lovensheimer, pp. 97\u201398</ref>\n\n[[File:Happy Talk.jpg|thumb|alt=A crouching man in military uniform watches a young woman and a middle-aged one make hand gestures to him|right|\"[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]\": Cable ([[William Tabbert]]) watches Liat ([[Betta St. John]]) and Bloody Mary ([[Juanita Hall|Hall]]).]]\nAt the heart of this scene is Cable's song \"[[You've Got to Be Carefully Taught]]\", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism.  Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most controversial element of the show.<ref>Most, p. 307</ref> Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein.  When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, \"That's what the show is about!\"<ref>Michener 1992, pp. 294\u2013295</ref> Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less \"briskly\", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered.<ref name=\"M162\">Maslon, p. 162</ref> Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; [[Wolcott Gibbs]] wrote of \"something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing\" while [[John Mason Brown]] opined that he was \"somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 85\u201386</ref> After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\".  Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the [[Library of Congress]], the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote \"What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'&nbsp;... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough.\"<ref name=\"L104\">Lovensheimer, p. 104</ref> Nevertheless, another wrote, \"I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding\".<ref name = \"L104\" />\n\nWhen the tour of the show reached a racially segregated theatre in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], Rodgers and Hammerstein threatened to cancel the performances there unless seating was integrated, which it was.<ref name = \"M163\" /> In 1953, with the tour in Atlanta, there was controversy over \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\".  Two Georgia state legislators, Senator John D. Shepard and Representative David C. Jones, objected to the song, stating that though ''South Pacific'' was a fine piece of entertainment, that song \"contained an underlying philosophy inspired by Moscow\", and explained, \"Intermarriage produces half-breeds.  And half-breeds are not conducive to the higher type of society.&nbsp;... In the South, we have pure blood lines and we intend to keep it that way.\"  They stated that they planned to introduce legislation to outlaw such communist-inspired works. The Northern press had a field day; Hammerstein, when asked for comment, responded that he did not think the legislators were representing their constituents very well, and that he was surprised at the suggestion that anything kind and decent must necessarily originate in Moscow.<ref name =\"M163\">Maslon, p. 163</ref><ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/03/01/93397165.pdf Georgia legislators score ''South Pacific''; see Red philosophy in song against bias]\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 1, 1953, accessed March 12, 2013 (subscription required)</ref> In part because of the song, touring companies of ''South Pacific'' had difficulty getting bookings in the Deep South.<ref>Hischak, p. 324</ref>\n\n[[File:Pinza with kids.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Pinza, in a white suit, walks along holding a mixed-race boy, about 7 or 8 years old, while listening to a slightly older girl who walks next to him.|upright|Emile (Pinza) with his children.]]\nIn the final scene of Act I, Nellie rejects Emile because of his part-Polynesian children.  In so doing, Nellie fails to live up to the American ideal that \"all men are created equal\", which Emile had earlier affirmed.<ref name = \"b8\">Butler, p. 8</ref> This scene was also toned down by Hammerstein; in early drafts, Nellie, initially unable to force out a word to describe Emile's first wife, after he supplies the word \"Polynesian\", responds with \"colored\".  This pronouncement, which makes Nellie less sympathetic as a character, was restored for the 2008 Lincoln Center production.  As [[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented, \"it's upsetting because Nellie isn't some cracker stereotype&nbsp;\u2013 she's lovable&nbsp;...

They entered the workforce during the war, only to find afterwards a societal expectation that they give up their jobs to men, with their best route to financial security being marriage and becoming a housewife. One means of securing audience acceptance of Nellie's choices was the sanitization of her sexual past from her counterpart in the Michener work&nbsp;\u2013 that character had a [[4-F (US Military)|4-F]] boyfriend back in Arkansas and a liaison with Bill Harbison while on the island.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 108\u2013109</ref><ref>Michener 1967, p. 106</ref>\n\n[[File:Billis and Nellie laundry.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A military scene.

Other enlisted men, many bare-chested, watch.|Nellie (Martin) praises the laundry skills of Billis (McCormick) as his friends look on.]]\nThe male characters in ''South Pacific'' are intended to appear conventionally masculine.  In the aftermath of World War II, the masculinity of the American soldier was beyond public question.  Cable's virility with Liat is made evident to the audience.  Although Billis operates a laundry \u2013 Nellie particularly praises his pleats \u2013 and appears in a grass skirt in the \"Thanksgiving Follies\", these acts are consistent with his desire for money and are clearly intended to be comic.  His interest in the young women on Bali H'ai establishes his masculinity.  Lovensheimer writes that Billis is more defined by class than by sexuality, evidenced by the Seabee's assumption, on learning that Cable went to college in New Jersey, that it was [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] (the state's flagship public university), rather than [[Ivy League]] Princeton, and by his delight on learning that the rescue operation for him had cost $600,000 when his uncle had told him he would never be worth a dime.<ref>Rodgers and Hammerstein, pp. 290, 353</ref><ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 109\u2013111, 142\u2013143</ref>\n\nMeryle Secrest, in her biography of Rodgers, theorizes that ''South Pacific'' marks a transition for the pair \"between heroes and heroines who are more or less evenly matched in age and stories about powerful older men and the younger women who are attracted to them\".<ref>Secrest, p. 294</ref> Lovensheimer points out that this pattern only holds for two of their five subsequent musicals, ''The King and I'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', and in the former, the love between Anna and the King is not expressed in words.  He believes a different transition took place: that their plots, beginning with  ''South Pacific'', involve a woman needing to enter and accept her love interest's world to be successful and accepted herself.  He notes that both ''Oklahoma!'' and ''Carousel'' involve a man entering his wife's world, Curly in ''Oklahoma!'' about to become a farmer with expectations of success, whereas Billy Bigelow in ''Carousel'' fails to find work after leaving his place as a barker.  Lovensheimer deems ''Allegro'' to be a transition, where the attempts of the lead female character to alter her husband Joe's world to suit her ambition lead to the breakup of their marriage.  He argues that the nurse Emily, who goes with Joe in his return to the small town where he was happy, is a forerunner of Nellie, uprooting her life in Chicago for Joe.<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\nSecrest notes that much is overlooked in the rush to have love conquer all in ''South Pacific'', \"questions of the long-term survival of a marriage between a sophisticate who read Proust at bedtime and a girl who liked Dinah Shore and did not read anything were raised by Nellie Forbush only to be brushed aside.  As for the interracial complexities of raising two Polynesian children, all such issues were subsumed in the general euphoria of true love.\"<ref>Secrest, p. 293</ref>  Lovensheimer too wonders how Nellie will fare as the second Madame de Becque, \"little Nellie Forbush from Arkansas ends up in a tropical paradise, far from her previous world, with a husband, a servant, and two children who speak a language she does not understand\".<ref>Lovensheimer, p. 115</ref>\n\n=== Cultural effect ===\n[[File:Wash man from hair.jpg|thumb|alt=Martin, wearing a swimsuit, stands in an improvised shower stall as water pours down on her.|right|[[Mary Martin]] washed her hair onstage eight times a week.]]\nA mammoth hit, ''South Pacific'' sparked huge media and public attention.  ''South Pacific'' was one of the first shows for which a variety of souvenirs were available: fans could buy ''South Pacific'' neckties, or for women, lipstick and scarves.  Fake ticket stubs could be purchased for use as status symbols.<ref name=\"M153\" /> There were ''South Pacific'' music boxes, dolls, fashion accessories, and even hairbrushes for use after washing men from hair.<ref>Hammerstein, p. 200</ref> Martin's on-stage shower prompted an immediate fashion craze for short hair that could be managed through once-a-day washing at home, rather than in a beauty salon, and for the products which would allow for such care.<ref>Beidler, pp. 116\u2013117</ref> The songs of ''South Pacific'' could be heard on the radio, and they were popular among dance bands and in piano lounges.<ref name=\"M153\" /> Mordden comments that ''South Pacific'' contained nothing but hit songs; Rodgers and Hammerstein's other successful works always included at least one song which did not become popular.<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 120</ref>\n\nThe cast album, recorded ten days after the show's opening, was an immediate hit.  Released by [[Columbia Records]], it spent 69 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard and a total of 400 weeks on the charts, becoming the best-selling record of the 1940s.<ref name=\"M153\" /> It was one of the early [[LP record]]s, with a turntable speed of 33{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm, and helped to popularize that technology&nbsp;\u2013 previously, show albums and operas had been issued on sets of 78&nbsp;rpm records, with high prices and much less music on a single disc.  In the years to come, the LP would become the medium of choice for the \"longhair\" music niche of show, opera and classical performances.<ref>Beidler, p. 117</ref>\n\nAn indirect effect of the success of the show was the career of James Michener.  His one percent of the show as author of the source material, plus the income from a share which the duo allowed him to buy on credit, made him financially independent and allowed him to quit his job as an editor at Macmillan and to become a full-time writer.<ref>Michener 1992, p. 294</ref><ref>May, pp. 112\u2013125</ref> Over the next five decades, his lengthy, detailed novels centering on different places would dominate the bestseller lists.<ref>May, pp. ix\u2013x</ref>\n\n== Music and recordings ==\n\n=== Musical treatment ===\nThe role of Nellie Forbush was the first time with Hammerstein that Rodgers made the leading female role a [[belt (music)|belter]], rather than a [[lyric soprano]] like Laurey in ''Oklahoma!'' and Julie in ''Carousel''.{{#tag:ref|The female lead in ''Allegro'', Jenny, is principally a dancing role; the performer playing her does not sing by herself.|group= n}} According to Mordden, \"Nellie was something new in R&H, carrying a goodly share of the score on a 'Broadway' voice\".<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 108</ref>\n\nNellie does not sing together with Emile, because Rodgers promised Martin that she would not have to compete vocally with Pinza,{{#tag:ref|They do sing together at the start of the final scene of Act I, but their characters are supposed to have been drinking.|group= n}} but the composer sought to unite them in the underlying music.  A [[tetrachord]], heard before we see either lead, is played during the instrumental introduction to \"''Dites-Moi''&nbsp;\", the show's first song.  Considered as pitch classes, that is, as pitches without characterization by octave or register, the motif is C-B-A-G. It will be heard repeatedly in Nellie's music, or in the music (such as \"Twin Soliloquies\") that she shares with Emile, and even in the bridge of \"Some Enchanted Evening\".  Lovensheimer argues that this symbolizes what Nellie is trying to say with her Act II line \"We're the same sort of people fundamentally&nbsp;\u2013 you and me\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 124\u2013132</ref>\n\nOriginally, \"Twin Soliloquies\" came to an end shortly after the vocal part finishes.  Logan found this unsatisfying and worked with Trude Rittmann to find a better ending to the song.  This piece of music, dubbed \"Unspoken Thoughts\", continues the music as Nellie and Emile sip brandy together, and is called by Lovensheimer \"the one truly operatic moment of the score\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> \"This Nearly Was Mine\" is a big bass solo for Emile in waltz time, deemed by Rodgers biographer William G. Hyland as \"one of his finest efforts\".<ref name =\"WGH183\">Hyland, p. 183</ref> Only five notes are used in the first four bars, a phrase which is then repeated with a slight variation in the following four bars.  The song ends an octave higher than where it began, making it perfect for Pinza's voice.<ref name = \"WGH183\" />\n\nTwo songs, \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\" and \"Honey Bun\" are intended to imitate American popular songs of the 1940s.  In the former, the triple recitation of the song title at intervals suggests a [[big band]] arrangement of the wartime era, while in the bridge, the final eight bars (repeating the lyrics from the bridge's first eight bars) gives a suggestion of [[swing music|swing]].  The sections beginning \"If the man don't understand you\" and \"If you laugh at different comics\" have a [[blues]] style.  Lovensheimer deems the song \"Nellie's spontaneous and improvisatory expression of her feelings through the vocabulary of popular song\".<ref>Lovensheimer, pp. 133\u2013135</ref> Mordden suggests that \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\" with its \"take no prisoners bounce\", might well be the center of the score, with the typical American girl defending her love by spouting clich\u00e9s, many of which, such as \"corny as Kansas in August\" Hammerstein made up, and \"sure enough, over the years they have become clich\u00e9s\".<ref>Mordden 1992, p. 121</ref>\n\n=== Recordings ===\n[[File:South pacific bway 1949.jpg|thumb|Cover of original cast album]]\n[[Columbia Records]] recorded the overture and most of the songs from the original production in 1949, using members of the cast including [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]]. Drawing from the original [[Acetate disc|lacquer disc]] masters, Columbia released the album in both the new LP format and on 78-rpm discs.  Soon after Sony acquired Columbia in 1988, a CD was released from the previously unused magnetic tape recording from the same 1949 sessions in New York City. The CD includes the bonus tracks \"Loneliness of Evening\" (recorded in 1949 by Mary Martin), \"My Girl Back Home\" (Martin), \"Bali Ha'i\" (Pinza) and Symphonic Scenario for Concert Orchestra (original orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett).

[[Thurl Ravenscroft]], later television's [[Tony the Tiger]], sang the [[basso profundo]] notes in \"There Is Nothing Like a Dame\". The film opened with Cable's flight to the island in a [[PBY]], followed by the Seabees' beach scene, and added Billis' rescue and scenes from the mission to spy on the Japanese.  The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Sound]]. It was also nominated for the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Scoring of a Musical Picture]] (Alfred Newman and Ken Darby), and the 65&nbsp;mm [[Todd-AO]] cinematography by [[Leon Shamroy]] was also nominated.<!-- The film has its own article, so we don't need to include more production details about it here. --> The film was widely criticized for its use of color to indicate mood, with actors changing color as they began to sing.

The diatoms in each deposit contain different amounts of silica, depending on the age of the deposit. The species of diatom may also differ among deposits. The species of diatom is dependent upon the age and paleo-environment of the deposit. In turn, the shape of a diatom is determined by its species.\n\nMany deposits throughout British Columbia, Canada, such as Red Lake Earth, are from the [[Miocene]] epoch and contain a species of diatom known as ''Melosira granulata''. These diatoms are approximately 12 to 13 million years old and have a small globular shape. \nA deposit containing diatoms from this age can provide many more benefits than that of an older deposit. For example, diatoms from the [[Eocene]] age (approximately 40 to 50 million years old) are not as effective in their ability to absorb fluids because older diatoms recrystallize, their small pores becoming filled with silica.<ref>{{cite web |title=Diatoms |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GeolSci/micropal/diatom.html |publisher=UCL London's Global University |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\nDiatomite forms by the accumulation of the [[amorphous]] silica ([[opal]], SiO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7nH<sub>2</sub>O) remains of dead diatoms (microscopic single-celled [[algae]]) in [[Lake|lacustrine]] or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[sediment]]s.

Additional marine deposits have been worked in [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[Algeria]] and the [[MoClay]] of Denmark. Freshwater lake deposits occur in Nevada, [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[California]]. Lake deposits also occur in [[interglacial]] lakes in the eastern United States, in Canada and in Europe in Germany, France, Denmark and the Czech Republic. The worldwide association of diatomite deposits and [[volcanic]] deposits suggests that the availability of silica from [[volcanic ash]] may be necessary for thick diatomite deposits.<ref name=AIME/>\n\nDiatomaceous earth is sometimes found on [[desert]] surfaces. Research has shown that the erosion of diatomaceous earth in such areas (such as the [[Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression]] in the [[Sahara]]) is one of the most important sources of climate-affecting dust in the atmosphere.\n\nThe siliceous [[frustule]]s of [[diatom]]s accumulate in fresh and brackish wetlands and lakes. Some peats and mucks contain a sufficient abundance of frustules that they can be mined. Most of Florida's diatomaceous earths have been found in the muck of wetlands or lakes. The American Diatomite Corporation, from 1935 to 1946, refined a maximum of 145 tons per year from their processing plant near [[Clermont, Florida]]. Muck from several locations in [[Lake County, Florida]] was dried and burned ([[calcined]]) to produce the diatomaceous earth.<ref>{{cite book |first=John H. |last=Davis, Jr. |title=The Peat Deposits of Florida Their Occurrence, Development and Uses, Geological Bulletin No. 30. |publisher=Florida Geological Survey |year=1946}}</ref> It was formerly extracted from [[Lake Myvatn]] in Iceland.\n\nThe commercial deposits of diatomite are restricted to [[Tertiary]] or [[Quaternary]] periods.

This allows much safer transport and handling than nitroglycerin in its raw form. He patented this mixture as [[dynamite]] in 1867; the mixture is also called guhr dynamite.\n\n=== Filtration ===\nThe [[Celle]] engineer Wilhelm Berkefeld recognized the ability of the diatomaceous earth to filter, and he developed tubular filters (known as filter candles) fired from diatomaceous earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technomaps.veoliawatertechnologies.com/berkefeld-aquantis/en/|title=BERKEFELD\u00ae &#38; AQUANTIS Water Treatment - Veolia Water Technologies|website=technomaps.veoliawatertechnologies.com}}</ref> During the [[cholera]] [[epidemic]] in [[Hamburg]] in 1892, these [[Berkefeld filter]]s were used successfully.  \nOne form of diatomaceous earth is used as a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]] medium, especially for swimming pools.  It has a high porosity because it is composed of microscopically small, hollow particles.  Diatomaceous earth (sometimes referred to by trademarked brand names such as Celite) is used in chemistry as a filtration aid, to filter very fine particles that would otherwise pass through or clog [[filter paper]].  It is also used to filter water, particularly in the [[drinking water]] treatment process and in [[aquarium|fish tanks]], and other liquids, such as [[beer]] and [[wine]].  It can also filter [[syrup]]s, [[sugar]], and honey without removing or altering their color, taste, or nutritional properties.<ref name=\"RootRoot2005\">{{cite book|author1=Amos Ives Root|author2=Ernest Rob Root|title=The ABC And Xyz of Bee Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0PoSYNEsh0C&pg=PA387|date=March 1, 2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4179-2427-1|page=387}}</ref>\n\n=== Abrasive ===\nThe oldest use of diatomite is as a very mild abrasive and, for this purpose, it has been used both in [[toothpaste]] and in metal [[Polishing|polishes]], as well as in some facial scrubs.\n\n=== Pest control ===\nDiatomite is of value as an [[insecticide]], because of its abrasive and physico-[[sorptivity|sorptive]] properties.<ref>{{cite conference|url= http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~fieldspg/fields/fields-de-test-2002.pdf |title= Standardized testing for diatomaceous earth |last1= Fields |first1= Paul |last2= Allen |first2= Sylvia |first3= Zlatko |last3= Korunic |first4= Alan |last4= McLaughlin |first5= Tanya |last5= Stathers |date= July 2002 |publisher= Entomological Society of Manitoba |booktitle= Proceedings of the Eighth International Working Conference of Stored-Product Protection |pages= |location= York, U.K. |id= }}</ref> The fine powder [[adsorption|adsorbs]] [[lipid]]s from the waxy outer layer of the [[exoskeleton]]s of many species of insects; this layer acts as a barrier that resists the loss of water vapour from the insect's body. Damaging the layer increases the evaporation of water from their bodies, so that they dehydrate, often fatally.\n\n[[Arthropod]]s die as a result of the water pressure deficiency, based on [[Fick's law of diffusion]]. This also works against [[gastropod]]s and is commonly employed in gardening to defeat [[slug]]s. However, since slugs inhabit humid environments, efficacy is very low. Diatomaceous earth is sometimes mixed with an attractant or other additives to increase its effectiveness.\n\nThe shape of the diatoms contained in a deposit has not been proven to affect their functionality when it comes to the adsorption of lipids; however, certain applications, such as that for slugs and snails, do work best when a particular shaped diatom is used, suggesting that lipid absorption is not the whole story. For example, in the case of slugs and snails large, spiny diatoms work best to lacerate the epithelium of the mollusk. Diatom shells will work to some degree on the vast majority of animals that undergo [[ecdysis]] in shedding [[cuticle]], such as [[arthropod]]s or [[nematodes]]. It also may have other effects on [[lophotrochozoan]]s, such as [[mollusk]]s or [[annelid]]s.\n\nMedical-grade diatomite has been studied for its efficacy as a [[deworming]] agent in cattle; in both studies cited the groups being treated with diatomaceous earth did not fare any better than control groups.<ref name=\"Lartigue 2004 660\u2013674\">{{cite journal |last=Lartigue |first=E. del C. |last2=Rossanigo |first2=C.

The diatoms in each deposit contain different amounts of silica, depending on the age of the deposit. The species of diatom may also differ among deposits. The species of diatom is dependent upon the age and paleo-environment of the deposit. In turn, the shape of a diatom is determined by its species.\n\nMany deposits throughout British Columbia, Canada, such as Red Lake Earth, are from the [[Miocene]] epoch and contain a species of diatom known as ''Melosira granulata''. These diatoms are approximately 12 to 13 million years old and have a small globular shape. \nA deposit containing diatoms from this age can provide many more benefits than that of an older deposit. For example, diatoms from the [[Eocene]] age (approximately 40 to 50 million years old) are not as effective in their ability to absorb fluids because older diatoms recrystallize, their small pores becoming filled with silica.<ref>{{cite web |title=Diatoms |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GeolSci/micropal/diatom.html |publisher=UCL London's Global University |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\nDiatomite forms by the accumulation of the [[amorphous]] silica ([[opal]], SiO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7nH<sub>2</sub>O) remains of dead diatoms (microscopic single-celled [[algae]]) in [[Lake|lacustrine]] or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[sediment]]s.

Lake deposits also occur in [[interglacial]] lakes in the eastern United States, in Canada and in Europe in Germany, France, Denmark and the Czech Republic. The worldwide association of diatomite deposits and [[volcanic]] deposits suggests that the availability of silica from [[volcanic ash]] may be necessary for thick diatomite deposits.<ref name=AIME/>\n\nDiatomaceous earth is sometimes found on [[desert]] surfaces. Research has shown that the erosion of diatomaceous earth in such areas (such as the [[Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression]] in the [[Sahara]]) is one of the most important sources of climate-affecting dust in the atmosphere.\n\nThe siliceous [[frustule]]s of [[diatom]]s accumulate in fresh and brackish wetlands and lakes. Some peats and mucks contain a sufficient abundance of frustules that they can be mined. Most of Florida's diatomaceous earths have been found in the muck of wetlands or lakes. The American Diatomite Corporation, from 1935 to 1946, refined a maximum of 145 tons per year from their processing plant near [[Clermont, Florida]]. Muck from several locations in [[Lake County, Florida]] was dried and burned ([[calcined]]) to produce the diatomaceous earth.<ref>{{cite book |first=John H. |last=Davis, Jr. |title=The Peat Deposits of Florida Their Occurrence, Development and Uses, Geological Bulletin No. 30. |publisher=Florida Geological Survey |year=1946}}</ref> It was formerly extracted from [[Lake Myvatn]] in Iceland.\n\nThe commercial deposits of diatomite are restricted to [[Tertiary]] or [[Quaternary]] periods.

This allows much safer transport and handling than nitroglycerin in its raw form. He patented this mixture as [[dynamite]] in 1867; the mixture is also called guhr dynamite.\n\n=== Filtration ===\nThe [[Celle]] engineer Wilhelm Berkefeld recognized the ability of the diatomaceous earth to filter, and he developed tubular filters (known as filter candles) fired from diatomaceous earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technomaps.veoliawatertechnologies.com/berkefeld-aquantis/en/|title=BERKEFELD\u00ae &#38; AQUANTIS Water Treatment - Veolia Water Technologies|website=technomaps.veoliawatertechnologies.com}}</ref> During the [[cholera]] [[epidemic]] in [[Hamburg]] in 1892, these [[Berkefeld filter]]s were used successfully.  \nOne form of diatomaceous earth is used as a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]] medium, especially for swimming pools.

This also works against [[gastropod]]s and is commonly employed in gardening to defeat [[slug]]s. However, since slugs inhabit humid environments, efficacy is very low. Diatomaceous earth is sometimes mixed with an attractant or other additives to increase its effectiveness.\n\nThe shape of the diatoms contained in a deposit has not been proven to affect their functionality when it comes to the adsorption of lipids; however, certain applications, such as that for slugs and snails, do work best when a particular shaped diatom is used, suggesting that lipid absorption is not the whole story. For example, in the case of slugs and snails large, spiny diatoms work best to lacerate the epithelium of the mollusk. Diatom shells will work to some degree on the vast majority of animals that undergo [[ecdysis]] in shedding [[cuticle]], such as [[arthropod]]s or [[nematodes]].

The houses of some [[Roman Catholic]] unionists, suspected informers, and members or supporters of the new [[Irish Free State]] government were also targeted. Although the practice by the IRA of destroying country houses began in the [[Irish War of Independence]], most of the buildings were destroyed during the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922\u201323).<ref>Peter Martin, \"Unionism: The Irish Nobility and the Revolution 1919\u201323\", ''The Irish Revolution'' (Joost Augustein (ed), Palgrave 2002), p. 157.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Today, most of the targeted buildings are in ruins or have been demolished.

The [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] narrative maintained that the land of Irishmen had been illegally stolen from them by the landowning aristocracy, who had mostly arrived in Ireland as [[Protestant]] settlers of [[The Crown]] during the late 16th and 17th centuries. The Irish Big House was at the administrative centre of the estates of the landowners, as well as being the [[List of family seats of Irish nobility|family seat]] from which the Anglo-Irish exerted their political control over the island.<ref>Dooley, p. 11.</ref>\n\nThis perception was popularly held by nationalists, despite a considerable increase in Irish landownership in the previous decades due to the [[Irish Land Acts]]. Whereas in 1870, 97% of land was owned by landlords and 50% by just 750 families, by 1916, 70% of Irish farmers owned their own land.<ref>Jonathan Haughton, 'Historical Background' in John W.

By 1915 the [[Irish Land Commission]] had transferred over 60% of Irish farmland to tenant farmers, leaving most of the former [[landed gentry]] with a house and a home farm known as a \"demesne\". The former landlords could afford to employ gardeners and household staff as they had received, as a group, the equivalent of over \u20ac60 billion (in 2019 euro).<ref>https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1915/feb/11/land-purchase-ireland#S5CV0069P0-02660 Commons statement, 11 February 1915</ref> Burning country houses from 1919 was therefore largely symbolic, and removed the former landlords' capital from the Irish economy when they emigrated, as well as ending the employment of thousands of their staff, with an inevitable knock-on effect on local economies. \n\n===Irish War of Independence===\nIn the destruction of the country houses of the aristocracy and [[landed gentry]], the IRA hoped to overcome a culture of deference towards the landowning class.<ref>Dooley, p. 56.</ref> As early as 1918, IRA organiser [[Ernie O'Malley]] had his Volunteers train in [[demesne]] grounds to \"rid them of their inherent respect for the owners\".<ref>Ernie O'Malley, ''The Singing Flame'' (Anvil 2002), p. 94<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, country houses were often targeted in reprisal for the destruction of houses by the [[British Army]], who took to burning or defacing the homes of nationalists engaged in actions against the British administration in Ireland. Usually the local Big House and landowner had no influence over British military policy in the area, and the reprisal attack by the IRA would be carried out on the assumption that all Anglo-Irish were [[loyalists]]. \"In April 1921, north Cork IRA leader, [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]], enraged by the destruction of several houses in reprisal for an IRA ambush declared, 'six big houses and castles of their friends, the Imperialists will go up for this.'\"<ref>[http://www.theirishstory.com/2011/06/21/the-big-house-and-the-irish-revolution/ \"The Big House and the Irish Revolution\"], The Irish Story (2011).

Donnelly stated in a study of the burning of over 50 country mansions in County Cork in 1919\u201321 that although there may have been agrarian or sectarian animosities at work, most of the houses targeted by the IRA were burnt either to deny them as potential billets to the British forces or as reprisals for house burnings committed by the British forces.<ref name=\"donnelly\"/> Similarly a study of the border region of counties Louth, Cavan and Monaghan found no such burnings until June and July 1921, coinciding with a sizeable British Army offensive in the area and that the main motive was to deny them garrisons. \"In this region at least it was the guerrilla tactics of the IRA and not agrarian motives that were main motive for targeting the Big Houses\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2015/11/06/the-burning-of-the-big-houses-revisited-1920-23/#_ednref11|title=Explaining the Civil War Burnings|publisher=TheIrishStory.com|date=6 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Big Houses\" did not become the subject of a concerted campaign until the Irish Civil War.<ref>Martin, p. 157.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref> In this period there was also a significant level of violence against southern Irish Protestants.

However, others were targeted because the IRA listed them as \"Imperialists\" or in some cases '[[Freemasons]]'.<ref name=\"dorney\"/> Most country houses were isolated and in rural areas, and targeting them forced the [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] to allocate their stretched resources to protecting landowners, while also creating an atmosphere of panic among the Anglo-Irish, as well as unionists in general.

In Dublin for instance, out of 28 homes burned by the IRA between 10 December 1922 and the end of April, nine could be counted as Big Houses or mansions associated with the Anglo-Irish gentry.<ref name=\"dorney\"/> As well as members of the gentry, the houses of newspaper owners and editors, members of the National Army and former British Army officers, and [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]] were also targeted.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSome Free State [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]], such as Liam Burke and [[Se\u00e1n McGarry]], were targeted; in the case of the latter causing the death of his seven-year-old son, Emmet.

The size of the buildings targeted ranged from small to palatial. Most were destroyed by being set on fire, their interiors having been doused in petrol, although in some instances houses were blown up using high explosives. The attempt to burn down Burton Hall, [[Stillorgan]], the home of [[Henry Guinness]], in March 1923 failed when a mine planted there failed to explode.<ref name=\"dorney\"/>\n\nIn most cases, no one was injured during the destruction of the house. It is recorded that in several cases, members of the IRA helped the targeted family to remove their possessions from the house before it was destroyed. When the home of [[Dermot Bourke, 7th Earl of Mayo]], was attacked on 29 January 1923, he described the IRA guerrillas as being \"excessively polite\" and apologetic. Nonetheless, there ''were'' incidents of violence and deaths in such attacks. The ''Church of Ireland Gazette'' recorded numerous instances of Unionists and Loyalists being shot, burned out or otherwise forced from their homes during the early 1920s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nSenator [[John Philip Bagwell]] was kidnapped during the attack on his home. Country houses were often looted during and following their destruction, and in most cases a family's possessions were entirely destroyed. Homes of pro-Treaty Catholic nationalists, such as [[Oliver St John Gogarty]] and [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] were targeted. The former was rebuilt, but the latter was not. The library of [[Moore Hall, County Mayo]], containing ancient manuscripts relating to Irish and world history, was entirely destroyed in February 1923.<ref>George Moore, Letter to the ''Morning Post'', 13 February 1923.</ref>\n\nNot all such houses were regarded by the IRA as targets, depending upon their ownership.

The widespread use of petrol and other incendiaries ensured that most of the buildings were completely gutted by fire and rendered uninhabitable. The state of the buildings, as well as fear of a repeat attack, meant that few of the country houses were rebuilt. Most were demolished, while others remain as ruins. Most of the owners sought compensation from the [[Irish Free State]] government. Ebenezer Pike claimed \u00a362,000 for the destruction of Kilcronagh House, arguing his losses were \"enormous, for valuable furniture, paintings, and art treasures were all consumed in the flames.\"<ref>''Cork Constitution'' (27 May 1921)</ref>\n\nBoth of Sir [[Warren baronets|Augustus Digby Warren]]'s properties in County Cork were destroyed. William Downes Webber sought compensation from the Irish Free State totalling \u00a3149,000 for the rebuilding and \u00a318,000 for the contents of [[Mitchelstown Castle]]; \u00a327,500 for the building and the full \u00a318,000 for the contents were eventually awarded by Justice Kenny in 1926.

In ''[[The Last September]]'' (1929), [[Elizabeth Bowen]] mythologised \"The Big Houses\" as an ideal of civilisation and order, yet one which had its origins in injustice and could not be expected to survive in the modern world.<ref name=\"genet\"/>\n\nThe destructions were also haphazard and case-by-case. Some mansions like [[Dunsany Castle and Demesne|Dunsany Castle]], owned by [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany]], were spared because of his fame and because the house contained holy relics of the martyred [[Oliver Plunkett|Saint Oliver Plunket]], that were revered and visited by local people. Other families such as the [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] family or the [[Guinness family]] were unaffected because of their local popularity, even though they were not supporters of Irish independence.\n\n==Resurgence during The Troubles==\nDuring [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, the practice of targeting the \"Big House\" was revived by the [[Irish Republican Army]], although there were relatively few of these in the six counties. Most notoriously, [[Tynan Abbey]] was attacked on the night of 21 January 1981. The 86-year-old [[Norman Stronge|Sir Norman Stronge, Bt.]], and his only son, [[Sir James Stronge, 9th Baronet|James]], 48 (both former [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s), were murdered by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] attackers.

The [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] narrative maintained that the land of Irishmen had been illegally stolen from them by the landowning aristocracy, who had mostly arrived in Ireland as [[Protestant]] settlers of [[The Crown]] during the late 16th and 17th centuries. The Irish Big House was at the administrative centre of the estates of the landowners, as well as being the [[List of family seats of Irish nobility|family seat]] from which the Anglo-Irish exerted their political control over the island.<ref>Dooley, p. 11.</ref>\n\nThis perception was popularly held by nationalists, despite a considerable increase in Irish landownership in the previous decades due to the [[Irish Land Acts]].

By 1915 the [[Irish Land Commission]] had transferred over 60% of Irish farmland to tenant farmers, leaving most of the former [[landed gentry]] with a house and a home farm known as a \"demesne\".

Usually the local Big House and landowner had no influence over British military policy in the area, and the reprisal attack by the IRA would be carried out on the assumption that all Anglo-Irish were [[loyalists]]. \"In April 1921, north Cork IRA leader, [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]], enraged by the destruction of several houses in reprisal for an IRA ambush declared, 'six big houses and castles of their friends, the Imperialists will go up for this.'\"<ref>[http://www.theirishstory.com/2011/06/21/the-big-house-and-the-irish-revolution/ \"The Big House and the Irish Revolution\"], The Irish Story (2011).

However, others were targeted because the IRA listed them as \"Imperialists\" or in some cases '[[Freemasons]]'.<ref name=\"dorney\"/> Most country houses were isolated and in rural areas, and targeting them forced the [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] to allocate their stretched resources to protecting landowners, while also creating an atmosphere of panic among the Anglo-Irish, as well as unionists in general. As such, the country house was regarded by the IRA as a \"soft target\".<ref>Dooley, p. 72.</ref>\n\nAttacks were planned and organised, and generally focused on [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peers]] who had sat in the [[House of Lords]], members of the [[Senate of the Irish Free State]] and former [[Irish Unionist Party]] politicians.<ref>Alan O'Day, ''Reactions to Irish Nationalism, 1865\u20131914'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 1 July 1987), p. 384.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> The assault on the \"Big Houses\" was part of a wider campaign against Free State supporters as a reprisal for the executions policy of the Government. In Dublin for instance, out of 28 homes burned by the IRA between 10 December 1922 and the end of April, nine could be counted as Big Houses or mansions associated with the Anglo-Irish gentry.<ref name=\"dorney\"/> As well as members of the gentry, the houses of newspaper owners and editors, members of the National Army and former British Army officers, and [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]] were also targeted.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSome Free State [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]], such as Liam Burke and [[Se\u00e1n McGarry]], were targeted; in the case of the latter causing the death of his seven-year-old son, Emmet. The former's home was demolished but the latter rebuilt his property. The [[Ballyboden]] home of the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State]], [[W. T. Cosgrave]], was burned down in January 1923.<ref>Gemma Clark, ''Everyday Violence in the Irish Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 21 April 2014), p. 70.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref> The [[Foxrock|Foxrock, County Dublin]] home of the Anglo-Irish politician [[Horace Plunkett|Sir Horace Plunkett]], a distant relation to [[Count Plunkett]], was burnt down in 1923, despite his reputation as a social reformer.<ref>Diarmaid Ferriter, ''The Transformation of Ireland 1900\u20132000'' (Profile Books, 2004), p. 210.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\n[[File:Coolbawn House (2) (geograph 3036203).jpg|thumb|Coolbawn House, near [[Rathnure]] in County Wexford, was burned in February 1923 and not repaired or rebuilt]]\nSome houses, such as Ballycarty House, were purportedly also attacked to prevent their being used as garrisons by Free State forces. The size of the buildings targeted ranged from small to palatial. Most were destroyed by being set on fire, their interiors having been doused in petrol, although in some instances houses were blown up using high explosives. The attempt to burn down Burton Hall, [[Stillorgan]], the home of [[Henry Guinness]], in March 1923 failed when a mine planted there failed to explode.<ref name=\"dorney\"/>\n\nIn most cases, no one was injured during the destruction of the house. It is recorded that in several cases, members of the IRA helped the targeted family to remove their possessions from the house before it was destroyed. When the home of [[Dermot Bourke, 7th Earl of Mayo]], was attacked on 29 January 1923, he described the IRA guerrillas as being \"excessively polite\" and apologetic. Nonetheless, there ''were'' incidents of violence and deaths in such attacks. The ''Church of Ireland Gazette'' recorded numerous instances of Unionists and Loyalists being shot, burned out or otherwise forced from their homes during the early 1920s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nSenator [[John Philip Bagwell]] was kidnapped during the attack on his home. Country houses were often looted during and following their destruction, and in most cases a family's possessions were entirely destroyed. Homes of pro-Treaty Catholic nationalists, such as [[Oliver St John Gogarty]] and [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] were targeted. The former was rebuilt, but the latter was not. The library of [[Moore Hall, County Mayo]], containing ancient manuscripts relating to Irish and world history, was entirely destroyed in February 1923.<ref>George Moore, Letter to the ''Morning Post'', 13 February 1923.</ref>\n\nNot all such houses were regarded by the IRA as targets, depending upon their ownership. [[Mount Trenchard House]] in County Kerry was the home of [[Mary Spring Rice]], a nationalist activist, and the building was used by the IRA as a [[safe house]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Moore Hall 22nd Aug 2010 003.JPG|thumb|The ruins of [[Moore Hall, County Mayo]], which was abandoned after being burnt down by the IRA in 1923.]]\nMost of the properties targeted by the IRA were abandoned following the attacks. The widespread use of petrol and other incendiaries ensured that most of the buildings were completely gutted by fire and rendered uninhabitable. The state of the buildings, as well as fear of a repeat attack, meant that few of the country houses were rebuilt. Most were demolished, while others remain as ruins. Most of the owners sought compensation from the [[Irish Free State]] government. Ebenezer Pike claimed \u00a362,000 for the destruction of Kilcronagh House, arguing his losses were \"enormous, for valuable furniture, paintings, and art treasures were all consumed in the flames.\"<ref>''Cork Constitution'' (27 May 1921)</ref>\n\nBoth of Sir [[Warren baronets|Augustus Digby Warren]]'s properties in County Cork were destroyed. William Downes Webber sought compensation from the Irish Free State totalling \u00a3149,000 for the rebuilding and \u00a318,000 for the contents of [[Mitchelstown Castle]]; \u00a327,500 for the building and the full \u00a318,000 for the contents were eventually awarded by Justice Kenny in 1926. Webber deemed the award for rebuilding too small and relocated to Dublin.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe period of the destruction of the Big Houses came to play an important part in Irish culture.<ref name=\"genet\">Jacqueline Genet, ''The Big House in Ireland: Reality and Representation'' (Rowman & Littlefield, 1 January 1991)<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref><ref>Vera Kreilkamp, ''The Anglo-Irish Novel and the Big House'' (Syracuse University Press, 1998)<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref><ref>Robert Kee, ''The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism'' (Penguin, 2000).<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\n[[William Butler Yeats]] decried the targeting of Big Houses in the poem ''Meditations in Time of Civil War'' (1924). In ''[[The Last September]]'' (1929), [[Elizabeth Bowen]] mythologised \"The Big Houses\" as an ideal of civilisation and order, yet one which had its origins in injustice and could not be expected to survive in the modern world.<ref name=\"genet\"/>\n\nThe destructions were also haphazard and case-by-case. Some mansions like [[Dunsany Castle and Demesne|Dunsany Castle]], owned by [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany]], were spared because of his fame and because the house contained holy relics of the martyred [[Oliver Plunkett|Saint Oliver Plunket]], that were revered and visited by local people. Other families such as the [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] family or the [[Guinness family]] were unaffected because of their local popularity, even though they were not supporters of Irish independence.\n\n==Resurgence during The Troubles==\nDuring [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, the practice of targeting the \"Big House\" was revived by the [[Irish Republican Army]], although there were relatively few of these in the six counties. Most notoriously, [[Tynan Abbey]] was attacked on the night of 21 January 1981. The 86-year-old [[Norman Stronge|Sir Norman Stronge, Bt.]], and his only son, [[Sir James Stronge, 9th Baronet|James]], 48 (both former [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s), were murdered by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] attackers. The house was then burnt to the ground. The bodies of the father and son were later recovered from their blazing home.<ref>[[Tim Pat Coogan]][http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/docs/coogan/coogan93.htm \"The Green Book: I\" from ''The IRA'' (1993)], cain.ulst.ac.uk.

In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted.

A hearse arrived at the [[cemetery]] to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|Host\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge was waiting for Orton to make his entrance, Orton who was disguised as a cameraman appeared and performed an ''RKO'' on Edge. Orton attacked Edge with a second ''RKO'' and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Centres' gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. They eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge would perform a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. Edge then performed a Conchairto with another chair on Orton. Orton could not answer the referees 10 count, thus Edge won the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion, Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a Fatal Five-Way Elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi and Tamina. Tamina was the first competitor eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Naomi was next eliminated by Sasha Banks after submitting to the Bank Statement. Next, Bayley accidentally pushed Banks into the way of Lacey Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Finally, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then pinned Evans to win the match and retain the championship.\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt, which Wyatt billed as a fight between Cena and Cena's own self. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Cena and Wyatt suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. In the end, McIntyre countered a fourth F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> {{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of ''[[The A.V.

The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|Host\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge was waiting for Orton to make his entrance, Orton who was disguised as a cameraman appeared and performed an ''RKO'' on Edge. Orton attacked Edge with a second ''RKO'' and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Centres' gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. They eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge would perform a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. Edge then performed a Conchairto with another chair on Orton. Orton could not answer the referees 10 count, thus Edge won the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion, Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a Fatal Five-Way Elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi and Tamina. Tamina was the first competitor eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Naomi was next eliminated by Sasha Banks after submitting to the Bank Statement. Next, Bayley accidentally pushed Banks into the way of Lacey Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Finally, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then pinned Evans to win the match and retain the championship.\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt, which Wyatt billed as a fight between Cena and Cena's own self. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Cena and Wyatt suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. In the end, McIntyre countered a fourth F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> {{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of ''[[The A.V.

It showed a progression from straightforward rock towards [[folk music|folk]] and acoustic music.\n\nWhile hard rock influences were still present, such as on \"[[Immigrant Song]]\", acoustic-based songs such as \"[[The Maid Freed from the Gallows#Led Zeppelin version|Gallows Pole]]\" and \"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\" showed Led Zeppelin were capable of playing different styles successfully. The band wrote most of the material themselves, but as with prior records, included two songs that were re-interpretations of earlier works: \"Gallows Pole\", based on a traditional English folk song, by way of American singer [[Fred Gerlach]]; and \"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\", a reworking of a blues song by [[Bukka White]].\n\nThe acoustic material developed from a songwriting session between band members [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]] at [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage in Wales, which influenced the musical direction. The songs were recorded in three locations. Much of the work was done at [[Headley Grange]], a country house, using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]. Additional sessions were held in more traditional recording studios, such as [[Sarm West Studios|Island Studios]] and [[Olympic Studios]] in London. As with the prior album, the band eschewed the use of guest musicians, with all music performed by band members Page (guitars), Plant (vocals), [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass, keyboards), and [[John Bonham]] (drums). The range of instruments played by the band was greatly enhanced on this album, with Jones especially emerging as a talented multi-instrumentalist, playing a wide range of keyboard and stringed instruments, including various [[synthesizer]]s, [[mandolin]] and [[double bass]], in addition to his usual bass guitar. As with prior albums, Page served as producer on the album, with mixing done by [[Andy Johns]] and [[Terry Manning]].\n\nThe album was one of the most anticipated of 1970, and its shipping date was held up by the intricate inner sleeve design based around a [[volvelle]], with numerous images visible through holes in the outer cover. It was an immediate commercial success upon release and topped the UK and US charts. Although critics were typically confused over the change in musical style and gave the album a mixed response, ''Led Zeppelin III'' has since been acknowledged as representing an important milestone in the band's history and a turning point in their music.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Bron-y-aur - geograph.org.uk - 21107 (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|right|Three songs on ''Led Zeppelin III'' were written by [[Jimmy Page|Page]] and [[Robert Plant|Plant]] while holidaying in [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Phil Sutcliffe|title=Back to Nature|journal=Q Magazine Special Led Zeppelin edition|date=2003|page= 34}}</ref>]]\n\nBy 1970, Led Zeppelin had achieved commercial success in both the UK and the US with their first two albums. They were determined to have a proper break, having recorded most of ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' in various locations while on tour, financing the sessions with the album sales and tour receipts.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Following an exhausting [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour Spring 1970|concert tour of North America]] that spring, lead singer [[Robert Plant]] recommended to guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]] that they should retreat to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], an 18th-century cottage in [[Snowdonia]], Wales, on a hilltop overlooking the [[River Dyfi|Dyfi Valley]], {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} north of the market town [[Machynlleth]]. Plant had spent holidays there with his family.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|McParland|2018|p=29}}\n\nThis remote setting had no running water or electric power, which encouraged a slight change of musical direction for the band towards an emphasis on acoustic arrangements.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|Welch|1994|pp=52, 55}} Page later explained that the tranquillity of Bron-Yr-Aur stood in sharp contrast to the continual touring of 1969, affecting the overall tone of the songwriting and dominance of acoustic guitars.<ref name=Schulps>{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Schulps|url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp|title=Interview with Jimmy Page|publisher=[[Trouser Press]]|publication-date=October 1977}}</ref> His playing was influenced by folk guitarists [[Davey Graham]] and [[Bert Jansch]], who regularly used alternative guitar tunings. Plant also recalled the band were \"obsessed with change\" and enjoyed listening to [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]].<ref name=williamson>{{cite journal|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|authorlink=Nigel Williamson|title=Good Times...Bad Times|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|publication-date=May 2005|page=56}}</ref> The band specifically wanted a change in direction, to show they could play any style of music they wanted.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=96}}\n\n==Recording==\nThe first recording sessions for ''Led Zeppelin III'' took place at [[Olympic Studios]] in November 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}} A press statement from manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] said the group were recording a non-album track to be released as a single, but this was ultimately abandoned. Further sessions took place towards the end of the year, in between touring, before the decision was made to stop working and take a break at Bron-Yr-Aur.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=74}} After preparing material for the album there, Page and Plant were joined by drummer [[John Bonham]] and bassist/keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] at [[Headley Grange]], a mansion in [[East Hampshire]], to rehearse the songs. The rural atmosphere gave a relaxed feel to the sessions, and the band found it to be a more enjoyable environment in which to develop songs than a studio in the city.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}\n\nThe album was recorded between May and June 1970 at Headley Grange (using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]) and at Olympic, with further recording at Island Records' [[Basing Street Studios]] in [[Notting Hill]] the following month. Mixing took place at Ardent Studios, [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], in August 1970, partway through the group's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour Summer 1970|sixth American concert tour]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=76}} The album was produced by Page and engineered by [[Andy Johns]] and [[Terry Manning]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Led Zeppelin III|publisher=Atlantic Records|id=K50002|year=1970}}</ref> Page had first met Manning when the latter's band, [[Lawson and Four More]], had supported Page's old band [[the Yardbirds]] in 1966. Manning had been to several Led Zeppelin shows, and this led to Page asking him to engineer the new album.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=77}}\n\n==Songs==\n''Led Zeppelin III'' marked a change in focus for the band, from late 1960s hard rock to a [[psychedelic folk]] and [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sound.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} These styles had been present to a lesser degree on the band's first two releases, such as \"[[Babe I'm Gonna Leave You]]\" and \"[[Ramble On]]\", from the first and second albums, respectively. However, on this album, the group used more acoustic arrangements, and they would remain prominent to various degrees in the group's later releases.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=73,75}} With ''Led Zeppelin III'', the group's songwriting dynamic also changed, from Page's domination of the first two albums towards a more democratic situation in which all four group members contributed their own compositions and ideas.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Plant wrote all of the lyrics, with the exception of \"Tangerine\".<ref name=MM70/>\n\n===Side one===\n\"[[Immigrant Song]]\" was written about the [[Viking invasions of England]] and inspired by a [[Led Zeppelin Tour of Iceland, Bath and Germany, Summer 1970|short tour of Iceland]] in June 1970. It was released as a single in the US and became a top 20 hit. It was the opening song for the band's appearance at the [[Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music]] and at subsequent gigs for the next two years.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} It was popularised in the 2003 movie ''[[School of Rock]]'', after [[Jack Black]] made a short video with fans asking for permission for its use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/led-zeppelin-allow-song-to-be-used-in-school-of-rock-movie/|title=LED ZEPPELIN Allow Song To Be Used In 'School Of Rock' Movie|website=Blabbermouth|date=8 September 2003|accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref> Page clarified that the song's opening is a combination of a voice and echo feedback.<ref name=MM70>{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/led-zeppelin-page-on-zeppelin-iii|title=Led Zeppelin: Page on Zeppelin III|first=Chris|last=Welch|work=Melody Maker|date=24 October 1970|via=[[Rock's Backpages]]|url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n\"Friends\" is an acoustic track that uses [[C6 tuning|C6 chord open tuning]] (C-A-C-G-C-E).<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/magazine/50-greatest-led-zeppelin-songs|title=The 50 Greatest Led Zeppelin Songs|first=Jimmy|last=Brown|journal=Guitar World|date=9 January 2015|accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref> It includes a [[string section]] arranged by Jones, which Page had wanted to achieve an Indian style of sound.<ref name=MM70/> The song was re-recorded as an experimental arrangement with the Bombay Orchestra in March 1972, along with \"Four Sticks\" from the following untitled album, commonly known as ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' (1971).{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=49\u201350}} That arrangement appeared on the 2015 reissue of the retrospective album ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/passage-to-india-the-true-story-of-zeppelin-s-secret-bombay-sessions|title=Led Zeppelin in India: the true story behind the secret Bombay sessions|work=Louder|date=23 July 2015|accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref> The song segues into \"Celebration Day\" via a [[Moog synthesiser]] drone.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=49\u201350}}\n\n\"[[Since I've Been Loving You]]\" was one of the first songs to be written for the album, in late 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} It is a blues song in the key of [[C minor]], featuring Jones on [[Hammond organ]] and bass pedals, simultaneously.<ref name=MM70/> The song became a live performance staple for the band throughout the rest of their career, replacing \"[[I Can't Quit You Baby]]\" from the [[Led Zeppelin (album)|first album]] as the band's slow blues showcase, with Page's guitar solo featured on both the recorded version and in the band's live show.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=47,50}}\n\n\"Out on the Tiles\" was written by Bonham, who came up with the idea for the riffs that run through the track.

The track features [[pedal steel guitar]] as well as acoustic. It was added to the group's live acoustic set in 1971 and performed regularly into the following year. It was then revived as a four-part harmony arrangement in 1975.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=50}}\n\n\"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\" had the original title of \"The Boy Next Door\". It was written in Bron-Yr-Aur about the problems two people faced in a relationship and the clashes with their families.

Page asked him if he would help design a sleeve for the album and, on 24 January 1970, Zacron met the band at their gig at his university and agreed to do the cover. That spring, he met the band members individually and took a series of photos of each of them, which would be put into a collage.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=77\u201378}}\n\nThe cover and interior gatefold art consisted of a surreal collection of seemingly random images on a white background, many of them connected thematically with flight or aviation. Behind the front cover was a rotatable laminated card disc, or [[volvelle]], covered with more images, including photos of the band members, which showed through holes in the cover; moving an image into place behind one hole would usually bring one or two others into place behind other holes.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=78}} The back cover was a composite shot of the best photographs from the photography sessions.

It showed a progression from straightforward rock towards [[folk music|folk]] and acoustic music.\n\nWhile hard rock influences were still present, such as on \"[[Immigrant Song]]\", acoustic-based songs such as \"[[The Maid Freed from the Gallows#Led Zeppelin version|Gallows Pole]]\" and \"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\" showed Led Zeppelin were capable of playing different styles successfully. The band wrote most of the material themselves, but as with prior records, included two songs that were re-interpretations of earlier works: \"Gallows Pole\", based on a traditional English folk song, by way of American singer [[Fred Gerlach]]; and \"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\", a reworking of a blues song by [[Bukka White]].\n\nThe acoustic material developed from a songwriting session between band members [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]] at [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage in Wales, which influenced the musical direction. The songs were recorded in three locations. Much of the work was done at [[Headley Grange]], a country house, using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]. Additional sessions were held in more traditional recording studios, such as [[Sarm West Studios|Island Studios]] and [[Olympic Studios]] in London. As with the prior album, the band eschewed the use of guest musicians, with all music performed by band members Page (guitars), Plant (vocals), [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass, keyboards), and [[John Bonham]] (drums). The range of instruments played by the band was greatly enhanced on this album, with Jones especially emerging as a talented multi-instrumentalist, playing a wide range of keyboard and stringed instruments, including various [[synthesizer]]s, [[mandolin]] and [[double bass]], in addition to his usual bass guitar. As with prior albums, Page served as producer on the album, with mixing done by [[Andy Johns]] and [[Terry Manning]].\n\nThe album was one of the most anticipated of 1970, and its shipping date was held up by the intricate inner sleeve design based around a [[volvelle]], with numerous images visible through holes in the outer cover. It was an immediate commercial success upon release and topped the UK and US charts. Although critics were typically confused over the change in musical style and gave the album a mixed response, ''Led Zeppelin III'' has since been acknowledged as representing an important milestone in the band's history and a turning point in their music.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Bron-y-aur - geograph.org.uk - 21107 (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|right|Three songs on ''Led Zeppelin III'' were written by [[Jimmy Page|Page]] and [[Robert Plant|Plant]] while holidaying in [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] cottage.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Phil Sutcliffe|title=Back to Nature|journal=Q Magazine Special Led Zeppelin edition|date=2003|page= 34}}</ref>]]\n\nBy 1970, Led Zeppelin had achieved commercial success in both the UK and the US with their first two albums. They were determined to have a proper break, having recorded most of ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' in various locations while on tour, financing the sessions with the album sales and tour receipts.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Following an exhausting [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour Spring 1970|concert tour of North America]] that spring, lead singer [[Robert Plant]] recommended to guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]] that they should retreat to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], an 18th-century cottage in [[Snowdonia]], Wales, on a hilltop overlooking the [[River Dyfi|Dyfi Valley]], {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} north of the market town [[Machynlleth]]. Plant had spent holidays there with his family.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|McParland|2018|p=29}}\n\nThis remote setting had no running water or electric power, which encouraged a slight change of musical direction for the band towards an emphasis on acoustic arrangements.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|Welch|1994|pp=52, 55}} Page later explained that the tranquillity of Bron-Yr-Aur stood in sharp contrast to the continual touring of 1969, affecting the overall tone of the songwriting and dominance of acoustic guitars.<ref name=Schulps>{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Schulps|url=http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp|title=Interview with Jimmy Page|publisher=[[Trouser Press]]|publication-date=October 1977}}</ref> His playing was influenced by folk guitarists [[Davey Graham]] and [[Bert Jansch]], who regularly used alternative guitar tunings.

Further sessions took place towards the end of the year, in between touring, before the decision was made to stop working and take a break at Bron-Yr-Aur.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=88}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=74}} After preparing material for the album there, Page and Plant were joined by drummer [[John Bonham]] and bassist/keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] at [[Headley Grange]], a mansion in [[East Hampshire]], to rehearse the songs. The rural atmosphere gave a relaxed feel to the sessions, and the band found it to be a more enjoyable environment in which to develop songs than a studio in the city.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}\n\nThe album was recorded between May and June 1970 at Headley Grange (using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]) and at Olympic, with further recording at Island Records' [[Basing Street Studios]] in [[Notting Hill]] the following month. Mixing took place at Ardent Studios, [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], in August 1970, partway through the group's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour Summer 1970|sixth American concert tour]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=76}} The album was produced by Page and engineered by [[Andy Johns]] and [[Terry Manning]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Led Zeppelin III|publisher=Atlantic Records|id=K50002|year=1970}}</ref> Page had first met Manning when the latter's band, [[Lawson and Four More]], had supported Page's old band [[the Yardbirds]] in 1966. Manning had been to several Led Zeppelin shows, and this led to Page asking him to engineer the new album.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=77}}\n\n==Songs==\n''Led Zeppelin III'' marked a change in focus for the band, from late 1960s hard rock to a [[psychedelic folk]] and [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sound.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} These styles had been present to a lesser degree on the band's first two releases, such as \"[[Babe I'm Gonna Leave You]]\" and \"[[Ramble On]]\", from the first and second albums, respectively. However, on this album, the group used more acoustic arrangements, and they would remain prominent to various degrees in the group's later releases.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=73,75}} With ''Led Zeppelin III'', the group's songwriting dynamic also changed, from Page's domination of the first two albums towards a more democratic situation in which all four group members contributed their own compositions and ideas.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Plant wrote all of the lyrics, with the exception of \"Tangerine\".<ref name=MM70/>\n\n===Side one===\n\"[[Immigrant Song]]\" was written about the [[Viking invasions of England]] and inspired by a [[Led Zeppelin Tour of Iceland, Bath and Germany, Summer 1970|short tour of Iceland]] in June 1970. It was released as a single in the US and became a top 20 hit. It was the opening song for the band's appearance at the [[Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music]] and at subsequent gigs for the next two years.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} It was popularised in the 2003 movie ''[[School of Rock]]'', after [[Jack Black]] made a short video with fans asking for permission for its use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/led-zeppelin-allow-song-to-be-used-in-school-of-rock-movie/|title=LED ZEPPELIN Allow Song To Be Used In 'School Of Rock' Movie|website=Blabbermouth|date=8 September 2003|accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref> Page clarified that the song's opening is a combination of a voice and echo feedback.<ref name=MM70>{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/led-zeppelin-page-on-zeppelin-iii|title=Led Zeppelin: Page on Zeppelin III|first=Chris|last=Welch|work=Melody Maker|date=24 October 1970|via=[[Rock's Backpages]]|url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n\"Friends\" is an acoustic track that uses [[C6 tuning|C6 chord open tuning]] (C-A-C-G-C-E).<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/magazine/50-greatest-led-zeppelin-songs|title=The 50 Greatest Led Zeppelin Songs|first=Jimmy|last=Brown|journal=Guitar World|date=9 January 2015|accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref> It includes a [[string section]] arranged by Jones, which Page had wanted to achieve an Indian style of sound.<ref name=MM70/> The song was re-recorded as an experimental arrangement with the Bombay Orchestra in March 1972, along with \"Four Sticks\" from the following untitled album, commonly known as ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' (1971).{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=49\u201350}} That arrangement appeared on the 2015 reissue of the retrospective album ''[[Coda (album)|Coda]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/passage-to-india-the-true-story-of-zeppelin-s-secret-bombay-sessions|title=Led Zeppelin in India: the true story behind the secret Bombay sessions|work=Louder|date=23 July 2015|accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref> The song segues into \"Celebration Day\" via a [[Moog synthesiser]] drone.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=49\u201350}}\n\n\"[[Since I've Been Loving You]]\" was one of the first songs to be written for the album, in late 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} It is a blues song in the key of [[C minor]], featuring Jones on [[Hammond organ]] and bass pedals, simultaneously.<ref name=MM70/> The song became a live performance staple for the band throughout the rest of their career, replacing \"[[I Can't Quit You Baby]]\" from the [[Led Zeppelin (album)|first album]] as the band's slow blues showcase, with Page's guitar solo featured on both the recorded version and in the band's live show.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=47,50}}\n\n\"Out on the Tiles\" was written by Bonham, who came up with the idea for the riffs that run through the track.

Page asked him if he would help design a sleeve for the album and, on 24 January 1970, Zacron met the band at their gig at his university and agreed to do the cover. That spring, he met the band members individually and took a series of photos of each of them, which would be put into a collage.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|pp=77\u201378}}\n\nThe cover and interior gatefold art consisted of a surreal collection of seemingly random images on a white background, many of them connected thematically with flight or aviation.

Older specimens are weathered looking, twisted with a deeply grooved trunk is about {{convert|200|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long, giving the appearance of a number of narrower stems. At the top of the trunk a number of branches separate, each very rough due to the remains of the leaf bases and is densely covered with many [[Gland (botany)|glandular]] hairs. The leaves are arranged in a tight spiral near the ends of the branches and are {{convert|4-11|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.7-1|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide. They are linear in shape, almost circular in cross section and are covered with many glandular hairs.<ref name=Chinnock>{{cite book|last1=Chinnock|first1=R.J.
