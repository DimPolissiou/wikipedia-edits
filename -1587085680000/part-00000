The business grew steadily, relying on \"bargain sales\" and advertising to grow the business and increase its influence throughout the South.\n\nBeginning in 1921 with the Leggett Bros. stores of [[South Boston, Virginia]], the Belk company grew by investing in various partnerships with local merchandisers in nearby markets.<ref name=Womick/> Belk's growth out of the Southeast was pushed by Earl Jones Sr and the Belk-Jones brand that opened the first Belk west of the Mississippi in 1947.

By the 1990s, the system had become increasingly untenable: stores were held by over 350 separate legal entities, Belk family members disagreed about whether to maintain or sweep away the structure, and some local partners threatened stability by selling their stakes.

The Belks quickly sold their stake as well, although Belk would later purchase the stores back as part of its later acquisition of the entire Proffitt's chain. When Proffitt's made an offer for the Leggett family's stake, which included 42 stores comprising about 20 percent of Belk's revenue, John and Tom Belk were forced to respond by forming a new company in 1996 that bought the Leggetts out.

The Trump Administration reported in October 2017 that the average subsidy would rise to $555 per month in 2018, up 45% from 2017.

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated that up to 13 million fewer persons would be covered by health insurance by 2027 relative to prior law and insurance premiums on the exchanges would increase by about 10 percentage points. This is because removing the mandate encourages younger and typically healthier persons to opt out of health insurance on the ACA exchanges, increasing premiums for the remainder. The non-group insurance market (which includes the ACA exchanges) would continue to be stable (i.e., no \"death spiral\").

This is on top of the $17.2 trillion debt held by the public and the $9.2 trillion already expected to be added to the debt excluding these proposals. About half was the Tax Act, and the other half was spending increases. This analysis assumed the individual tax cuts expire as scheduled after 2025; if extended, up to another $1 trillion could be added through 2029. The [[Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018]] and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 added $2.2 trillion to the projected debt, mainly by increasing defense and non-defense discretionary spending caps through 2017-2021. There are no such caps after 2021. A December 2019 spending deal added another $500 billion of debt through additional tax cuts, repealing 3 taxes meant to fund the [[Affordable Care Act]], including the so-called \"Cadillac tax\" on unusually generous health plans.<ref name=\"CRFB_$4.7T\"/>\n\n===CBO baseline projections===\n{{See|Economic policy of the Barack Obama administration}}\n\nThe CBO publishes a 10-year economic and budgetary forecast (\"baseline\") annually as part of their \"Budget and Economic Outlook\" report.

This includes reduced spending of $752 billion for overseas contingency operations (defense spending in Afghanistan and other foreign countries), which is partially offset by other increases in defense spending of $448B, for a net defense cut of $304B. Other discretionary spending (cabinet departments) would be reduced by $1,548B.\n* Revenues would be reduced by $1,000B, mainly by repealing the ACA, which had applied higher tax rates to the top 5% of income earners.

About 20 million persons filed for unemployment insurance in the four weeks ending April 11. It caused the number of unemployed persons to increase significantly, which is expected to reduce tax revenues while increasing [[automatic stabilizer]] spending for [[unemployment insurance]] and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|nutritional support]]. As a result of the adverse economic impact, both state and federal budget deficits will dramatically increase, even before considering any new legislation.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/economy/unemployment-claim-numbers-coronavirus.html NYT-Sudden Black Hole for the Economy with Millions More Unemployed-April 9, 2020]</ref>\n\nTo help address lost income for millions of workers and assist businesses, Congress and President Trump enacted the [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] (CARES) on March 27, 2020. It included loans and grants for businesses, along with direct payments to individuals and additional funding for unemployment insurance. While the Act carried a estimated $2.3 trillion price tag, some or all of the loans may ultimately be paid back including interest, while the spending measures should dampen the negative budgetary impact of the economic disruption. While the law will almost certainly increase budget deficits relative to the January 2020 10-year CBO baseline (completed prior to the Coronavirus), in the absence of the legislation, a complete economic collapse could have occurred.<ref>[https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/4/8/short-run-effects-of-the-cares-act Penn Wharton Budget Model-Short Run Economic Effects of the CARES Act-April 8, 2020]</ref>  \n\nCBO provided a preliminary score for the CARES Act on April 16, 2020, estimating that it would increase federal deficits by about $1.8 trillion over the 2020-2030 period.

In particular, the act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide up to $454 billion to fund emergency lending facilities established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

As of January 7, 2020, the United States had imposed tariffs on 16.8 percent of goods imported into the country, measured as a share of the value of all U.S. imports in 2017.\nSome of those tariffs apply to imports from nearly all U.S. trading partners, including tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, and steel and aluminum products. A few countries are exempted from certain tariffs. For example, Canadian and Mexican imports were granted exemptions from the tariffs on steel and aluminum products. Other tariffs affected only imports from China, covering about half of U.S. imports from China and targeting intermediate goods (items used for the production of other goods and services), capital goods (such as computers and other equipment), and some consumer goods (such as apparel and footwear). In response to the tariffs, U.S. trading partners have retaliated by imposing their own trade barriers. As of January 7, 2020, retaliatory tariffs had been imposed on 9.3 percent of all goods exported by the United States\u2014 primarily industrial supplies and materials as well as agricultural products.\u201d<ref name=\"CBO_BEO2020\"/> As of January 7, 2020, tariffs were in-effect for $395 billion of U.S. imports and $143 billion of U.S exports (in retaliation); nearly all of this balance relates to China.<ref name=\"CBO_BEO2020\"/>\n\nFurther, China devalued its currency (Yuan) by about 12% from the beginning of 2018 to the end of 2019, making its exports more competitive, to help offset the impact on its economy from the tariffs. By August 2019, the exchange rate was the lowest in 11 years. The U.S. responded by declaring China a \"currency manipulator\" on August 5, 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/748155575/chinas-currency-falls-to-lowest-exchange-rate-in-11-years|title=China's Currency Falls To Lowest Exchange Rate In 11 Years|website=npr.org|date=August 5, 2019}}</ref> although this designation was later rescinded in January 2020 as part of the Phase 1 trade deal.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-currency/us-designates-china-as-currency-manipulator-for-first-time-in-decades-idUSKCN1UV2BK U.S. designates China as currency manipulator-August 5, 2019]</ref>\n\nThe following table summarizes trends in imports, exports, and trade balance (a negative indicating a trade deficit) in goods only with China.

Reuters summarized the deal as follows:\n*China will increase purchases of products & services by $200B over two years vs. 2017 levels of $130B in goods and $56 billion in services. This would approximately double U.S. exports to China. \n*U.S. import tariffs would be cut from 15% to 7.5% on $120B of Chinese goods (the 9/1 tranche) effective 2/14.  The 25% rate on $250 billion of Chinese goods would remain, so about $370B of Chinese imports would still have tariffs. The U.S. agreed to suspend an additional $160 billion in tariffs (12/15 tranche). \n*China\u2019s planned retaliatory tariffs (12/15 tranche) were also suspended. China reduced tariffs on $75 billion worth of goods (9/1 tranche) on 2/5.\n*China also pledged to strengthen intellectual property protection (patent/trademark/copyright); reduce pressure on foreign companies to transfer technology in exchange for market access; not competitively devalue its currency; and improve access to its financial market for U.S. financial institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-details-factbox/whats-in-the-us-china-phase-1-trade-deal-idUSKBN1ZE2IF|title=What's in the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal|website=reuters.com|date=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe deal was seen as a \u201ccease-fire\u201d in the trade war, although tariffs remained at elevated levels.

CBO summarized the economic impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs as follows:\n*\u201cIn CBO\u2019s estimation, the trade barriers put in place by the United States and its trading partners between January 2018 and January 2020 would reduce real GDP over the projection period [2020-2030].\n*The effects of those barriers on trade flows, prices, and output are projected to peak during the first half of 2020 and then begin to subside. \n*Tariffs are expected to reduce the level of real GDP by roughly 0.5 percent and raise consumer prices by 0.5 percent in 2020. \n*As a result, tariffs are also projected to reduce average real household income by $1,277 (in 2019 dollars) in 2020. \n*CBO expects the effect of trade barriers on output and prices to diminish over time as businesses continue to adjust their supply chains in response to the changes in the international trading environment. By 2030, in CBO\u2019s projections, the tariffs lower the level of real GDP by 0.1 percent.\u201d<ref name=\"CBO_BEO2020\"/>\n\nThe ''New York Times'' reported in June 2019 that If Trump's tariffs are fully implemented as proposed, they would raise prices sufficiently to offset most or all of his tax cuts for lower- and middle-class households, potentially slowing the economy. Analysis by the [[Tax Foundation]] found that the benefits of the Trump tax cut would be completely eliminated for all taxpayers through the 90th percentile in earnings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/business/tariffs-trump-mexico-china.html|title=Trump's Tariffs Could Nullify Tax Cut, Clouding Economic Picture|first=Jim|last=Tankersley|date=June 3, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of NY estimated that tariffs implemented as of May 2019 cost the average family about $415 per year, while implementing the remaining threatened tariffs would bring the total to $830 per year.<ref name=\"FRBNY_T1\">{{cite web|url=https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/05/new-china-tariffs-increase-costs-to-us-households.html?mod=article_inline|title=New China Tariffs Increase Costs to U.S. Households \u2013 Liberty Street Economics|website=libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. farm industry was adversely impacted by China canceling or delaying imports of soybeans and other products in retaliation for U.S. tariffs.

This is because a trade deficit also represents an excess of national investment over savings, and increasing the budget deficit (as the tax bill does per CBO and JCT estimates) means reducing national savings, thus increasing the trade deficit. One inconsistent argument made by the Administration for the tax cuts is that they would bring in a sizable amount of foreign capital (increasing the capital surplus and its mathematical offset, the trade deficit), which would be invested by corporations and drive increases in GDP. However, this inflow of capital would drive up the price of the dollar, hurting exports and thus raising the trade deficit and thus reducing GDP.<ref name=\"NYT_Trade1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/us/politics/tax-cuts-trade-deficit-trump.html|title=Trump's Tax Cuts Are Likely to Increase Trade Deficit|first=Binyamin|last=Appelbaum|date=November 17, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=December 24, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nEconomists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis explained that a trade deficit is not necessarily bad for an economy. In one sense, a trade deficit is a subtraction from GDP, so in theory a larger trade deficit offsets economic growth and reduces the number of jobs. On the positive side, a trade deficit can mean: 1) Foreigners are net investors in your country's economy and production capacity; and 2) The economy is doing sufficiently well such that your citizens are importing more from abroad than they are exporting because local demand cannot meet supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2017/02/demystifying-the-trade-balance/|title=Demystifying the trade balance : Why a trade balance deficit isn't necessarily a sign of a poor economy|website=FREDblog.StLouisFed.org|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}</ref> On the negative side, if the inflow of foreign capital is used instead to bid up housing and financial asset prices (as was the case during the [[United States housing bubble]] that contributed to the [[Great Recession]]) then a trade deficit can be detrimental.

Immigrants start companies at twice the rate of native Americans, and half the companies in the Fortune 500 were started by immigrants or their children; such innovation helps drive productivity.

If immigration stayed at that level rather than the typical 1 million per year, research from Moody's Analytics indicates GDP would be $1 trillion lower than it would otherwise be in a decade.

The Trump Administration reported in October 2017 that the average subsidy would rise to $555 per month in 2018, up 45% from 2017.

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated that up to 13 million fewer persons would be covered by health insurance by 2027 relative to prior law and insurance premiums on the exchanges would increase by about 10 percentage points. This is because removing the mandate encourages younger and typically healthier persons to opt out of health insurance on the ACA exchanges, increasing premiums for the remainder. The non-group insurance market (which includes the ACA exchanges) would continue to be stable (i.e., no \"death spiral\").

This is on top of the $17.2 trillion debt held by the public and the $9.2 trillion already expected to be added to the debt excluding these proposals. About half was the Tax Act, and the other half was spending increases. This analysis assumed the individual tax cuts expire as scheduled after 2025; if extended, up to another $1 trillion could be added through 2029. The [[Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018]] and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 added $2.2 trillion to the projected debt, mainly by increasing defense and non-defense discretionary spending caps through 2017-2021. There are no such caps after 2021. A December 2019 spending deal added another $500 billion of debt through additional tax cuts, repealing 3 taxes meant to fund the [[Affordable Care Act]], including the so-called \"Cadillac tax\" on unusually generous health plans.<ref name=\"CRFB_$4.7T\"/>\n\n===CBO baseline projections===\n{{See|Economic policy of the Barack Obama administration}}\n\nThe CBO publishes a 10-year economic and budgetary forecast (\"baseline\") annually as part of their \"Budget and Economic Outlook\" report.

This includes reduced spending of $752 billion for overseas contingency operations (defense spending in Afghanistan and other foreign countries), which is partially offset by other increases in defense spending of $448B, for a net defense cut of $304B. Other discretionary spending (cabinet departments) would be reduced by $1,548B.\n* Revenues would be reduced by $1,000B, mainly by repealing the ACA, which had applied higher tax rates to the top 5% of income earners.

About 20 million persons filed for unemployment insurance in the four weeks ending April 11. It caused the number of unemployed persons to increase significantly, which is expected to reduce tax revenues while increasing [[automatic stabilizer]] spending for [[unemployment insurance]] and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|nutritional support]]. As a result of the adverse economic impact, both state and federal budget deficits will dramatically increase, even before considering any new legislation.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/economy/unemployment-claim-numbers-coronavirus.html NYT-Sudden Black Hole for the Economy with Millions More Unemployed-April 9, 2020]</ref>\n\nTo help address lost income for millions of workers and assist businesses, Congress and President Trump enacted the [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] (CARES) on March 27, 2020. It included loans and grants for businesses, along with direct payments to individuals and additional funding for unemployment insurance. While the Act carried a estimated $2.3 trillion price tag, some or all of the loans may ultimately be paid back including interest, while the spending measures should dampen the negative budgetary impact of the economic disruption. While the law will almost certainly increase budget deficits relative to the January 2020 10-year CBO baseline (completed prior to the Coronavirus), in the absence of the legislation, a complete economic collapse could have occurred.<ref>[https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/4/8/short-run-effects-of-the-cares-act Penn Wharton Budget Model-Short Run Economic Effects of the CARES Act-April 8, 2020]</ref>  \n\nCBO provided a preliminary score for the CARES Act on April 16, 2020, estimating that it would increase federal deficits by about $1.8 trillion over the 2020-2030 period. The estimate includes: \n*A $988 billion increase in mandatory outlays; \n*A $446 billion decrease in revenues; and \n*A $326 billion increase in discretionary outlays, stemming from emergency supplemental appropriations.\n\nCBO reported that not all parts of the bill will increase deficits: \u201cAlthough the act provides financial assistance totaling more than $2 trillion, the projected cost is less than that because some of that assistance is in the form of loan guarantees, which are not estimated to have a net effect on the budget. In particular, the act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide up to $454 billion to fund emergency lending facilities established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Because the income and costs stemming from that lending are expected to roughly offset each other, CBO estimates no deficit effect from that provision.\u201d<ref name=\"CBO_Score1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56334|title=H.R. 748, CARES Act, Public Law 116-136 |date=April 16, 2020 |work=cbo.gov |access-date=April 16, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget]] estimated that the budget deficit for fiscal year 2020 would increase to a record $3.8 trillion, or 18.7% GDP.<ref name = \"CRFB_CARES1\">[https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/13/us/13reuters-health-coronavirus-usa-budget.html?

As of January 7, 2020, the United States had imposed tariffs on 16.8 percent of goods imported into the country, measured as a share of the value of all U.S. imports in 2017.\nSome of those tariffs apply to imports from nearly all U.S. trading partners, including tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, and steel and aluminum products. A few countries are exempted from certain tariffs. For example, Canadian and Mexican imports were granted exemptions from the tariffs on steel and aluminum products. Other tariffs affected only imports from China, covering about half of U.S. imports from China and targeting intermediate goods (items used for the production of other goods and services), capital goods (such as computers and other equipment), and some consumer goods (such as apparel and footwear). In response to the tariffs, U.S. trading partners have retaliated by imposing their own trade barriers. As of January 7, 2020, retaliatory tariffs had been imposed on 9.3 percent of all goods exported by the United States\u2014 primarily industrial supplies and materials as well as agricultural products.\u201d<ref name=\"CBO_BEO2020\"/> As of January 7, 2020, tariffs were in-effect for $395 billion of U.S. imports and $143 billion of U.S exports (in retaliation); nearly all of this balance relates to China.<ref name=\"CBO_BEO2020\"/>\n\nFurther, China devalued its currency (Yuan) by about 12% from the beginning of 2018 to the end of 2019, making its exports more competitive, to help offset the impact on its economy from the tariffs. By August 2019, the exchange rate was the lowest in 11 years. The U.S. responded by declaring China a \"currency manipulator\" on August 5, 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/748155575/chinas-currency-falls-to-lowest-exchange-rate-in-11-years|title=China's Currency Falls To Lowest Exchange Rate In 11 Years|website=npr.org|date=August 5, 2019}}</ref> although this designation was later rescinded in January 2020 as part of the Phase 1 trade deal.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-currency/us-designates-china-as-currency-manipulator-for-first-time-in-decades-idUSKCN1UV2BK U.S. designates China as currency manipulator-August 5, 2019]</ref>\n\nThe following table summarizes trends in imports, exports, and trade balance (a negative indicating a trade deficit) in goods only with China.

Reuters summarized the deal as follows:\n*China will increase purchases of products & services by $200B over two years vs. 2017 levels of $130B in goods and $56 billion in services. This would approximately double U.S. exports to China. \n*U.S. import tariffs would be cut from 15% to 7.5% on $120B of Chinese goods (the 9/1 tranche) effective 2/14.  The 25% rate on $250 billion of Chinese goods would remain, so about $370B of Chinese imports would still have tariffs. The U.S. agreed to suspend an additional $160 billion in tariffs (12/15 tranche). \n*China\u2019s planned retaliatory tariffs (12/15 tranche) were also suspended. China reduced tariffs on $75 billion worth of goods (9/1 tranche) on 2/5.\n*China also pledged to strengthen intellectual property protection (patent/trademark/copyright); reduce pressure on foreign companies to transfer technology in exchange for market access; not competitively devalue its currency; and improve access to its financial market for U.S. financial institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-details-factbox/whats-in-the-us-china-phase-1-trade-deal-idUSKBN1ZE2IF|title=What's in the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal|website=reuters.com|date=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe deal was seen as a \u201ccease-fire\u201d in the trade war, although tariffs remained at elevated levels.

CBO summarized the economic impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs as follows:\n*\u201cIn CBO\u2019s estimation, the trade barriers put in place by the United States and its trading partners between January 2018 and January 2020 would reduce real GDP over the projection period [2020-2030].\n*The effects of those barriers on trade flows, prices, and output are projected to peak during the first half of 2020 and then begin to subside. \n*Tariffs are expected to reduce the level of real GDP by roughly 0.5 percent and raise consumer prices by 0.5 percent in 2020. \n*As a result, tariffs are also projected to reduce average real household income by $1,277 (in 2019 dollars) in 2020. \n*CBO expects the effect of trade barriers on output and prices to diminish over time as businesses continue to adjust their supply chains in response to the changes in the international trading environment. By 2030, in CBO\u2019s projections, the tariffs lower the level of real GDP by 0.1 percent.\u201d<ref name=\"CBO_BEO2020\"/>\n\nThe ''New York Times'' reported in June 2019 that If Trump's tariffs are fully implemented as proposed, they would raise prices sufficiently to offset most or all of his tax cuts for lower- and middle-class households, potentially slowing the economy. Analysis by the [[Tax Foundation]] found that the benefits of the Trump tax cut would be completely eliminated for all taxpayers through the 90th percentile in earnings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/business/tariffs-trump-mexico-china.html|title=Trump's Tariffs Could Nullify Tax Cut, Clouding Economic Picture|first=Jim|last=Tankersley|date=June 3, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of NY estimated that tariffs implemented as of May 2019 cost the average family about $415 per year, while implementing the remaining threatened tariffs would bring the total to $830 per year.<ref name=\"FRBNY_T1\">{{cite web|url=https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/05/new-china-tariffs-increase-costs-to-us-households.html?mod=article_inline|title=New China Tariffs Increase Costs to U.S. Households \u2013 Liberty Street Economics|website=libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. farm industry was adversely impacted by China canceling or delaying imports of soybeans and other products in retaliation for U.S. tariffs.

This is because a trade deficit also represents an excess of national investment over savings, and increasing the budget deficit (as the tax bill does per CBO and JCT estimates) means reducing national savings, thus increasing the trade deficit. One inconsistent argument made by the Administration for the tax cuts is that they would bring in a sizable amount of foreign capital (increasing the capital surplus and its mathematical offset, the trade deficit), which would be invested by corporations and drive increases in GDP. However, this inflow of capital would drive up the price of the dollar, hurting exports and thus raising the trade deficit and thus reducing GDP.<ref name=\"NYT_Trade1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/us/politics/tax-cuts-trade-deficit-trump.html|title=Trump's Tax Cuts Are Likely to Increase Trade Deficit|first=Binyamin|last=Appelbaum|date=November 17, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=December 24, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nEconomists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis explained that a trade deficit is not necessarily bad for an economy. In one sense, a trade deficit is a subtraction from GDP, so in theory a larger trade deficit offsets economic growth and reduces the number of jobs. On the positive side, a trade deficit can mean: 1) Foreigners are net investors in your country's economy and production capacity; and 2) The economy is doing sufficiently well such that your citizens are importing more from abroad than they are exporting because local demand cannot meet supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2017/02/demystifying-the-trade-balance/|title=Demystifying the trade balance : Why a trade balance deficit isn't necessarily a sign of a poor economy|website=FREDblog.StLouisFed.org|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}</ref> On the negative side, if the inflow of foreign capital is used instead to bid up housing and financial asset prices (as was the case during the [[United States housing bubble]] that contributed to the [[Great Recession]]) then a trade deficit can be detrimental.

If immigration stayed at that level rather than the typical 1 million per year, research from Moody's Analytics indicates GDP would be $1 trillion lower than it would otherwise be in a decade.
