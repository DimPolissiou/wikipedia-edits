This article focuses on calculation of definite integrals. The term '''numerical quadrature''' (often abbreviated to [[Quadrature (mathematics)|''quadrature'']]) is more or less a synonym for ''numerical integration'', especially as applied to one-dimensional integrals. Some authors refer to numerical integration over more than one dimension as '''cubature''';<ref>{{MathWorld | urlname=Cubature | title=Cubature }}</ref> others take ''quadrature'' to include higher-dimensional integration.\n\nThe basic problem in numerical integration is to compute an approximate solution to a definite integral\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx</math>\n\nto a given degree of accuracy. If {{math|''f(x)''}} is a smooth function integrated over a small number of dimensions, and the domain of integration is bounded, there are many methods for approximating the integral to the desired precision.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|Quadrature (mathematics)}}\nThe term \"numerical integration\" first appears in 1915 in the publication ''A Course in Interpolation and Numeric Integration for the Mathematical Laboratory'' by [[David Gibb (mathematician)|David Gibb]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/q.html|title=Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (Q)|author=|date=|website=jeff560.tripod.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n'''Quadrature''' is a historical mathematical term that means calculating area. Quadrature problems have served as one of the main sources of [[mathematical analysis]]. [[Greek mathematics|Mathematicians of Ancient Greece]], according to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrine, understood calculation of [[area]] as the process of constructing geometrically a [[square (geometry)|square]] having the same area (''squaring''). That is why the process was named '''quadrature'''. For example, a [[quadrature of the circle]], [[Lune of Hippocrates]], [[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]. This construction must be performed only by means of [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]].\n\nThe ancient Babylonians used the [[trapezoidal rule]] to integrate the motion of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] along the [[ecliptic]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Mathieu Ossendrijver|title=Ancient Babylonian astronomers calculated Jupiter's position from the area under a time-velocity graph|journal=Science|date=Jan 29, 2016|doi=10.1126/science.aad8085|volume=351|issue=6272|pages=482\u2013484|pmid=26823423|bibcode=2016Sci...351..482O}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Geometric mean.svg|thumb|left|220px|Antique method to find the [[Geometric mean]]]]\nFor a quadrature of a rectangle with the sides ''a'' and ''b'' it is necessary to construct a square with the side <math>x =\\sqrt {ab}</math> (the [[Geometric mean]] of ''a'' and ''b''). For this purpose it is possible to use the following fact: if we draw the circle with the sum of ''a'' and ''b'' as the diameter, then the height BH (from a point of their connection to crossing with a circle) equals their geometric mean. The similar geometrical construction solves a problem of a quadrature for a parallelogram and a triangle.\n\n[[File:Parabola and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|200px|<center>The area of a segment of a parabola</center>]]\nProblems of quadrature for curvilinear figures are much more difficult. The [[quadrature of the circle]] with compass and straightedge had been proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example the [[Lune of Hippocrates]]) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of a sphere surface and a [[The Quadrature of the Parabola|parabola segment]] done by [[Archimedes]] became the highest achievement of the antique analysis.\n* The area of the surface of a sphere is equal to quadruple the area of a [[great circle]] of this sphere.\n* The area of a segment of the [[parabola]] cut from it by a straight line is 4/3 the area of the triangle inscribed in this segment.\nFor the proof of the results Archimedes used the [[Method of exhaustion]] of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]].\n\nIn medieval Europe the quadrature meant calculation of area by any method. More often the [[Method of indivisibles]] was used; it was less rigorous, but more simple and powerful. With its help [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Gilles de Roberval]] found the area of a [[cycloid]] arch, [[Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent]] investigated the area under a [[hyperbola]] (''Opus Geometricum'', 1647), and [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], de Saint-Vincent's pupil and commentator, noted the relation of this area to [[logarithm]]s.\n\n[[John Wallis]] algebrised this method: he wrote in his ''Arithmetica Infinitorum'' (1656) series that we now call the [[definite integral]], and he calculated their values. [[Isaac Barrow]] and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] made further progress: quadratures for some [[algebraic curves]] and [[spiral]]s. [[Christiaan Huygens]] successfully performed a quadrature of some [[Solid of revolution|Solids of revolution]].\n\nThe quadrature of the hyperbola by Saint-Vincent and de Sarasa provided a new [[function(mathematics)|function]], the [[natural logarithm]], of critical importance.\n\nWith the invention of [[integral calculus]] came a universal method for area calculation. In response, the term '''quadrature''' has become traditional, and instead the modern phrase \"''computation of a univariate definite integral''\" is more common.\n\n==Reasons for numerical integration==\n\nThere are several reasons for carrying out numerical integration.\n{{ordered list\n|1= The integrand ''f''(''x'') may be known only at certain points, such as obtained by [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]]. Some [[embedded systems]] and other computer applications may need numerical integration for this reason.\n\n|2=  A formula for the integrand may be known, but it may be difficult or impossible to find an [[antiderivative]] that is an [[elementary function]]. An example of such an integrand is ''f''(''x'') = exp(\u2212''x''<sup>''2''</sup>), the antiderivative of which (the [[error function]], times a constant) cannot be written in [[elementary form]].\n\n|3= It may be possible to find an antiderivative symbolically, but it may be easier to compute a numerical approximation than to compute the antiderivative. That may be the case if the antiderivative is given as an infinite series or product, or if its evaluation requires a [[special function]] that is not available.\n}}\n\n==Methods for one-dimensional integrals==\n\nNumerical integration methods can generally be described as combining evaluations of the integrand to get an approximation to the integral. The integrand is evaluated at a finite set of points called '''integration points''' and a weighted sum of these values is used to approximate the integral. The integration points and weights depend on the specific method used and the accuracy required from the approximation.\n\nAn important part of the analysis of any numerical integration method is to study the behavior of the approximation error as a function of the number of integrand evaluations.\nA method that yields a small error for a small number of evaluations is usually considered superior.\nReducing the number of evaluations of the integrand reduces the number of arithmetic operations involved,\nand therefore reduces the total [[round-off error]].\nAlso,\neach evaluation takes time, and the integrand may be arbitrarily complicated.\n\nA 'brute force' kind of numerical integration can be done, if the integrand is reasonably well-behaved (i.e. [[piecewise]] [[continuous function|continuous]] and of [[bounded variation]]), by evaluating the integrand with very small increments.\n\n===Quadrature rules based on interpolating functions===\nA large class of quadrature rules can be derived by constructing  [[interpolation|interpolating]] functions that are easy to integrate. Typically these interpolating functions are [[polynomial]]s.  In practice, since polynomials of very high degree tend to oscillate wildly, only polynomials of low degree are used, typically linear and quadratic.\n\n[[Image:Integration rectangle.svg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of the rectangle rule.]]\nThe simplest method of this type is to let the interpolating function be a constant function (a polynomial of degree zero) that passes through the point <math display=\"inline\"> \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2}, f \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2} \\right)\\right) </math>. This is called the ''midpoint rule'' or ''[[rectangle method|rectangle rule]]''\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx \\approx (b-a) f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right).</math>\n\n[[Image:Integration trapezoid.svg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of the trapezoidal rule.]]\nThe interpolating function may be a straight line (an [[affine function]], i.e. a polynomial of degree 1)\npassing through the points <math> \\left( a, f(a)\\right) </math> and <math> \\left( b, f(b)\\right) </math>.\nThis is called the ''[[trapezoidal rule]]''\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx \\approx (b-a) \\left(\\frac{f(a) + f(b)}{2}\\right).</math>\n\n[[Image:Integration simpson.svg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of Simpson's rule.]]\nFor either one of these rules, we can make a more accurate approximation by breaking  up the interval <math> [a,b] </math> into some number <math> n </math> of subintervals, computing an approximation for each subinterval, then adding up all the results. This is called a ''composite rule'', ''extended rule'', or ''iterated rule''. For example, the composite trapezoidal rule can be stated as\n\n:<math>\n\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx \\approx \n\\frac{b-a}{n} \\left( {f(a) \\over 2} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\left( f \\left( a+k \\frac{b-a}{n} \\right) \\right) + {f(b) \\over 2} \\right),\n</math>\n\nwhere the subintervals have the form <math> [a+k h,a+ (k+1)h] \\subset [a,b], </math> with <math display=\"inline\">h = \\frac{b-a}{n}</math> and <math>k = 0,\\ldots,n-1. </math> Here we used subintervals of the same length <math> h </math> but one could also use intervals of varying length <math> \\left( h_k \\right)_k </math>.\n\nInterpolation with polynomials evaluated at equally spaced points in <math> [a,b] </math> yields the [[Newton\u2013Cotes formulas]], of which the rectangle rule and the trapezoidal rule are examples. [[Simpson's rule]], which is based on a polynomial of order 2, is also a Newton\u2013Cotes formula.\n\nQuadrature rules with equally spaced points have the very convenient property of ''nesting''.  The corresponding rule with each interval subdivided includes all the current points, so those integrand values can be re-used.\n\nIf we allow the intervals between interpolation points to vary, we find another group of quadrature formulas, such as the [[Gaussian quadrature]] formulas. A Gaussian  quadrature rule is typically more accurate than a Newton\u2013Cotes rule, which requires the same number of function evaluations, if the integrand is [[Smooth function|smooth]] (i.e., if it is sufficiently differentiable). Other quadrature methods with varying intervals include [[Clenshaw\u2013Curtis quadrature]] (also called Fej\u00e9r quadrature) methods, which do nest.\n\nGaussian quadrature rules do not nest, but the related [[Gauss\u2013Kronrod quadrature formula]]s do.\n\n=== Generalized midpoint rule formula ===\n\nA generalized midpoint rule formula is given by\n:<math>\n\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{\\frac{{{{\\left({-1}\\right)}^n}+1}}{{{{\\left({2M}\\right)}^{n+1}}\\left({n+1}\\right)!}}{{\\left.{{f^{\\left(n\\right)}}\\left(x\\right)}\\right|}_{x=\\frac{{m-1/2}}{M}}}}}\n</math>\nor\n:<math>\n\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=\\lim_{M\\to\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\sum_{n=0}^N{\\frac{{{{\\left({-1}\\right)}^n}+1}}{{{{\\left({2M}\\right)}^{n+1}}\\left({n+1}\\right)!}}{{\\left.{{f^{\\left(n\\right)}}\\left(x\\right)}\\right|}_{x=\\frac{{m-1/2}}{M}}}}},\n</math>\nwhere <math> f^{(n)}(x) </math> denotes <math> n</math>-th derivative. For example, substituting <math> M=1 </math> and\n:<math>\nf(x) = \\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta^2 x^2}\n</math>\nin the generalized midpoint rule formula, we obtain an equation of the inverse tangent\n:<math>\n\\tan^{-1}(\\theta)=i\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{2n-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\left(1+2i/\\theta\\right)^{2n-1}}-\\frac{1}{\\left(1-2i/\\theta\\right)^{2n-1}}\\right)=2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{\\frac{1}{2n-1}\\frac{{{a}_{n}}\\left(\\theta\\right)}{a_{n}^{2}\\left(\\theta\\right)+b_{n}^{2}\\left(\\theta\\right)}},\n</math>\nwhere <math> i=\\sqrt{-1} </math> is [[imaginary unit]] and\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  a_1(\\theta) &= \\frac{2}{\\theta},\\\\ \n  b_1(\\theta) &= 1,\\\\ \n  a_n(\\theta) &= \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{\\theta^2}\\right)\\,a_{n-1}(\\theta) + \\frac{4}{\\theta}\\,b_{n-1}(\\theta),\\\\\n  b_n(\\theta) &= \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{\\theta^2}\\right)\\,b_{n-1}(\\theta) - \\frac{4}{\\theta}\\,a_{n-1}(\\theta).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince at each odd <math> n </math> the numerator of the integrand becomes <math> (-1)^n + 1 = 0 </math>, the generalized midpoint rule formula can be reorganized as\n:<math>\n\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=2\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{\\frac{{1}}{{{{\\left({2M}\\right)}^{2n+1}}\\left({2n+1}\\right)!}}{{\\left.{{f^{(2n)}}(x)}\\right|}_{x=\\frac{{m-1/2}}{M}}}}}\\,\\,.\n</math>\n\nThe following example of Mathematica code generates the plot showing difference between inverse tangent and its approximation truncated at <math> M = 5 </math> and <math> N = 10 </math>:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=Mathematica>\nf[theta_, x_] := theta/(1 + theta^2*x^2);\n\naTan[theta_, M_, nMax_] := \n    2*Sum[(Function[x, Evaluate[D[f[theta, x], {x, 2*n}]]][(m - 1/2)/\n        M])/((2*n + 1)!*(2*M)^(2*n + 1)), {m, 1, M}, {n, 0, nMax}];\n\nPlot[{ArcTan[theta] - aTan[theta, 5, 10]}, {theta, -Pi, Pi}, \n PlotRange -> All]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nFor a function <math> g(t) </math> defined over interval <math> (a,b) </math>, its integral is\n:<math>\n\\int_a^b {g(t) dt} = \\int_0^{b-a} {g(\\tau+a) d\\tau}= (b-a)\\int_0^1 {g((b-a)x+a) dx}.\n</math>\nTherefore, we can apply the generalized midpoint integration formula above by assuming that <math> f(x) = (b-a)\\,g((b-a)x+a) </math>.\n\n=== Adaptive algorithms ===\n{{main|Adaptive quadrature}}\n\nIf ''f''(''x'') does not have many derivatives at all points, or if the derivatives become large, then Gaussian quadrature is often insufficient. In this case, an algorithm similar to the following will perform better:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\ndef calculate_definite_integral_of_f(f, initial_step_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    This algorithm calculates the definite integral of a function\n    from 0 to 1, adaptively, by choosing smaller steps near\n    problematic points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = 0.0\n    h = initial_step_size\n    accumulator = 0.0\n    while x < 1.0:\n        if x + h > 1.0:\n            h = 1.0 - x  # At end of unit interval, adjust last step to end at 1.\n        if error_too_big_in_quadrature_of_f_over_range(f, [x, x + h]):\n            h = make_h_smaller(h)\n        else:\n            accumulator += quadrature_of_f_over_range(f, [x, x + h])\n            x += h\n            if error_too_small_in_quadrature_of_over_range(f, [x, x + h]):\n                h = make_h_larger(h)  # Avoid wasting time on tiny steps.\n    return accumulator\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nSome details of the algorithm require careful thought. For many cases, estimating the error from quadrature over an interval for a function ''f''(''x'') isn't obvious. One popular solution is to use two different rules of quadrature, and use their difference as an estimate of the error from quadrature. The other problem is deciding what \"too large\" or \"very small\" signify. A ''local'' criterion for \"too large\" is that the quadrature error should not be larger than ''t''&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;''h'' where ''t'', a real number, is the tolerance we wish to set for global error. Then again, if ''h'' is already tiny, it may not be worthwhile to make it even smaller even if the quadrature error is apparently large. A ''global'' criterion is that the sum of errors on all the intervals should be less than&nbsp;''t''.  This type of error analysis is usually called \"a posteriori\" since we compute the error after having computed the approximation.\n\nHeuristics for adaptive quadrature are discussed by Forsythe et al. (Section 5.4).\n\n=== Extrapolation methods ===\n\nThe accuracy of a quadrature rule of the [[Newton-Cotes]] type is generally a function of the number of evaluation points.\nThe result is usually more accurate as the number of evaluation points increases,\nor, equivalently, as the width of the step size between the points decreases.\nIt is natural to ask what the result would be if the step size were allowed to approach zero.\nThis can be answered by extrapolating the result from two or more nonzero step sizes, using [[series acceleration]] methods such as [[Richardson extrapolation]].\nThe extrapolation function may be a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function]].\nExtrapolation methods are described in more detail by Stoer and Bulirsch (Section 3.4) and are implemented in many of the routines in the [[QUADPACK]] library.\n\n=== Conservative (a priori) error estimation ===\nLet <math>f</math> have a bounded first derivative over <math>[a,b],</math> i.e. <math>f \\in C^1([a,b]).</math> The [[mean value theorem]] for <math> f,</math> where <math>x \\in [a,b),</math> gives\n:<math>\n (x - a) f'(\\xi_x) = f(x) - f(a),\n</math>\n\nfor some <math> \\xi_x \\in (a,x] </math> depending on <math> x </math>.\n\nIf we integrate in <math> x </math> from <math> a </math> to <math> b </math> on both sides and take the absolute values, we obtain\n:<math>\n    \\left| \\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx - (b - a) f(a) \\right|\n  = \\left| \\int_a^b (x - a) f'(\\xi_x)\\, dx \\right| .\n</math>\n\nWe can further approximate the integral on the right-hand side by bringing the absolute value into the integrand, and replacing the term in <math> f' </math> by an upper bound\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\n  \\left| \\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx - (b - a) f(a) \\right| \n  \\leq {(b - a)^2 \\over 2} \\sup_{a \\leq x \\leq b} \\left| f'(x) \\right| ,\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|1}}\n}}\nwhere the [[supremum]] was used to approximate.\n\nHence, if we approximate the integral <math display=\"inline\"> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx </math> by the [[Numerical integration#Methods for one-dimensional integrals|quadrature rule]] <math> (b - a) f(a) </math> our error is no greater than the right hand side of {{EquationNote|1}}. We can convert this into an error analysis for the [[Riemann sum#Definition|Riemann sum]] (*), giving an upper bound of\n\n: <math>{n^{-1} \\over 2} \\sup_{0 \\leq x \\leq 1} \\left| f'(x) \\right|</math>\n\nfor the error term of that particular approximation. (Note that this is precisely the error we calculated for the example <math>f(x) = x</math>.) Using more derivatives, and by tweaking the quadrature, we can do a similar error analysis using a [[Taylor series]] (using a partial sum with remainder term) for ''f''. This error analysis gives a strict upper bound on the error, if the derivatives of ''f'' are available.\n\nThis integration method can be combined with [[interval arithmetic]] to produce [[computer proof]]s and ''verified'' calculations.\n\n=== Integrals over infinite intervals ===\n\nSeveral methods exist for approximate integration over unbounded intervals. The standard technique involves specially derived quadrature rules, such as [[Gauss-Hermite quadrature]] for integrals on the whole real line and [[Gauss-Laguerre quadrature]] for integrals on the positive reals.<ref>{{cite book |last=Leader |first=Jeffery J. | authorlink=Jeffery J. Leader| title=Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computation |year=2004 |publisher=Addison Wesley |location= |isbn= 978-0-201-73499-7}}</ref> Monte Carlo methods can also be used, or a change of variables to a finite interval; e.g., for the whole line one could use\n\n:<math>\n  \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{+1} f\\left( \\frac{t}{1-t^2} \\right) \\frac{1+t^2}{(1-t^2)^2} \\, dt,\n</math>\n\nand for semi-infinite intervals one could use\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_a^{\\infty}f(x) \\, dx &= \\int_0^1 f\\left(a + \\frac{t}{1-t}\\right) \\frac{dt}{(1-t)^2}, \\\\\n\\int_{-\\infty}^a f(x) \\, dx &= \\int_0^1 f\\left(a - \\frac{1-t}{t}\\right) \\frac{dt}{t^2},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nas possible transformations.\n\n== Multidimensional integrals ==\n\nThe quadrature rules discussed so far are all designed to compute one-dimensional integrals. To compute integrals in multiple dimensions, one approach is to phrase the multiple integral as repeated one-dimensional integrals by applying [[Fubini's theorem]] (the tensor product rule). This approach requires the function evaluations to [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]] as the number of dimensions increases. Three methods are known to overcome this so-called ''[[curse of dimensionality]]''.\n\nA great many additional techniques for forming multidimensional cubature integration rules for a variety of weighting functions are given in the monograph by Stroud.<ref name=\"StroudBook\">{{cite book |last1=Stroud |first1=A.

They may yield greater accuracy for the same number of function evaluations than repeated integrations using one-dimensional methods. {{CN|date=November 2018}}\n\nA large class of useful Monte Carlo methods are the so-called [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] algorithms,\nwhich include the [[Metropolis-Hastings algorithm]] and [[Gibbs sampling]].\n\n=== Sparse grids ===\n[[Sparse grid]]s were originally developed by Smolyak for the quadrature of high-dimensional functions. The method is always based on a one-dimensional quadrature rule, but performs a more sophisticated combination of univariate results. However, whereas the tensor product rule guarantees that the weights of all of the cubature points will be positive if the weights of the quadrature points were positive, Smolyak's rule does not guarantee that the  weights will all be positive.\n\n=== Bayesian Quadrature ===\nBayesian Quadrature is a statistical approach to the numerical problem of computing integrals and falls under the field of probabilistic numerics. It can provide a full handling of the uncertainty over the solution of the integral expressed as a [[Gaussian Process]] posterior variance. It is also known to provide very fast convergence rates which can be up to exponential in the number of quadrature points n.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|title = Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature: Probabilistic Integration with Theoretical Guarantees |eprint = 1506.02681 |date = 2015-06-08|first = Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier|last = Briol|first2 = Chris J.|last2 = Oates|first3 = Mark|last3 = Girolami|first4 = Michael A.|last4 = Osborne|class = stat.ML }}</ref>\n\n== Connection with differential equations ==\n\nThe problem of evaluating the integral\n:<math>F(x) = \\int_a^x f(u)\\, du</math>\ncan be reduced to an [[initial value problem]] for an [[ordinary differential equation]] by applying the first part of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. By differentiating both sides of the above with respect to the argument ''x'', it is seen that the function ''F'' satisfies\n:<math> \\frac{d F(x)}{d x} = f(x), \\quad F(a) = 0. </math>\nMethods developed for ordinary differential equations, such as [[Runge\u2013Kutta methods]], can be applied to the restated problem and thus be used to evaluate the integral. For instance, the standard fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta method applied to the differential equation yields Simpson's rule from above.\n\nThe differential equation ''F''&thinsp;'&thinsp;(''x'') = &fnof;(''x'') has a special form: the right-hand side contains only the independent variable (here ''x'') and not the dependent variable (here ''F''). This simplifies the theory and algorithms considerably.

This article focuses on calculation of definite integrals. The term '''numerical quadrature''' (often abbreviated to [[Quadrature (mathematics)|''quadrature'']]) is more or less a synonym for ''numerical integration'', especially as applied to one-dimensional integrals. Some authors refer to numerical integration over more than one dimension as '''cubature''';<ref>{{MathWorld | urlname=Cubature | title=Cubature }}</ref> others take ''quadrature'' to include higher-dimensional integration.\n\nThe basic problem in numerical integration is to compute an approximate solution to a definite integral\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx</math>\n\nto a given degree of accuracy.

Quadrature problems have served as one of the main sources of [[mathematical analysis]]. [[Greek mathematics|Mathematicians of Ancient Greece]], according to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrine, understood calculation of [[area]] as the process of constructing geometrically a [[square (geometry)|square]] having the same area (''squaring''). That is why the process was named '''quadrature'''. For example, a [[quadrature of the circle]], [[Lune of Hippocrates]], [[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]. This construction must be performed only by means of [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]].\n\nThe ancient Babylonians used the [[trapezoidal rule]] to integrate the motion of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] along the [[ecliptic]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Mathieu Ossendrijver|title=Ancient Babylonian astronomers calculated Jupiter's position from the area under a time-velocity graph|journal=Science|date=Jan 29, 2016|doi=10.1126/science.aad8085|volume=351|issue=6272|pages=482\u2013484|pmid=26823423|bibcode=2016Sci...351..482O}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Geometric mean.svg|thumb|left|220px|Antique method to find the [[Geometric mean]]]]\nFor a quadrature of a rectangle with the sides ''a'' and ''b'' it is necessary to construct a square with the side <math>x =\\sqrt {ab}</math> (the [[Geometric mean]] of ''a'' and ''b''). For this purpose it is possible to use the following fact: if we draw the circle with the sum of ''a'' and ''b'' as the diameter, then the height BH (from a point of their connection to crossing with a circle) equals their geometric mean. The similar geometrical construction solves a problem of a quadrature for a parallelogram and a triangle.\n\n[[File:Parabola and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|200px|<center>The area of a segment of a parabola</center>]]\nProblems of quadrature for curvilinear figures are much more difficult. The [[quadrature of the circle]] with compass and straightedge had been proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example the [[Lune of Hippocrates]]) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of a sphere surface and a [[The Quadrature of the Parabola|parabola segment]] done by [[Archimedes]] became the highest achievement of the antique analysis.\n* The area of the surface of a sphere is equal to quadruple the area of a [[great circle]] of this sphere.\n* The area of a segment of the [[parabola]] cut from it by a straight line is 4/3 the area of the triangle inscribed in this segment.\nFor the proof of the results Archimedes used the [[Method of exhaustion]] of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]].\n\nIn medieval Europe the quadrature meant calculation of area by any method. More often the [[Method of indivisibles]] was used; it was less rigorous, but more simple and powerful. With its help [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Gilles de Roberval]] found the area of a [[cycloid]] arch, [[Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent]] investigated the area under a [[hyperbola]] (''Opus Geometricum'', 1647), and [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], de Saint-Vincent's pupil and commentator, noted the relation of this area to [[logarithm]]s.\n\n[[John Wallis]] algebrised this method: he wrote in his ''Arithmetica Infinitorum'' (1656) series that we now call the [[definite integral]], and he calculated their values. [[Isaac Barrow]] and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] made further progress: quadratures for some [[algebraic curves]] and [[spiral]]s. [[Christiaan Huygens]] successfully performed a quadrature of some [[Solid of revolution|Solids of revolution]].\n\nThe quadrature of the hyperbola by Saint-Vincent and de Sarasa provided a new [[function(mathematics)|function]], the [[natural logarithm]], of critical importance.\n\nWith the invention of [[integral calculus]] came a universal method for area calculation. In response, the term '''quadrature''' has become traditional, and instead the modern phrase \"''computation of a univariate definite integral''\" is more common.\n\n==Reasons for numerical integration==\n\nThere are several reasons for carrying out numerical integration.\n{{ordered list\n|1= The integrand ''f''(''x'') may be known only at certain points, such as obtained by [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]]. Some [[embedded systems]] and other computer applications may need numerical integration for this reason.\n\n|2=  A formula for the integrand may be known, but it may be difficult or impossible to find an [[antiderivative]] that is an [[elementary function]]. An example of such an integrand is ''f''(''x'') = exp(\u2212''x''<sup>''2''</sup>), the antiderivative of which (the [[error function]], times a constant) cannot be written in [[elementary form]].\n\n|3= It may be possible to find an antiderivative symbolically, but it may be easier to compute a numerical approximation than to compute the antiderivative. That may be the case if the antiderivative is given as an infinite series or product, or if its evaluation requires a [[special function]] that is not available.\n}}\n\n==Methods for one-dimensional integrals==\n\nNumerical integration methods can generally be described as combining evaluations of the integrand to get an approximation to the integral. The integrand is evaluated at a finite set of points called '''integration points''' and a weighted sum of these values is used to approximate the integral. The integration points and weights depend on the specific method used and the accuracy required from the approximation.\n\nAn important part of the analysis of any numerical integration method is to study the behavior of the approximation error as a function of the number of integrand evaluations.\nA method that yields a small error for a small number of evaluations is usually considered superior.\nReducing the number of evaluations of the integrand reduces the number of arithmetic operations involved,\nand therefore reduces the total [[round-off error]].\nAlso,\neach evaluation takes time, and the integrand may be arbitrarily complicated.\n\nA 'brute force' kind of numerical integration can be done, if the integrand is reasonably well-behaved (i.e. [[piecewise]] [[continuous function|continuous]] and of [[bounded variation]]), by evaluating the integrand with very small increments.\n\n===Quadrature rules based on interpolating functions===\nA large class of quadrature rules can be derived by constructing  [[interpolation|interpolating]] functions that are easy to integrate. Typically these interpolating functions are [[polynomial]]s.  In practice, since polynomials of very high degree tend to oscillate wildly, only polynomials of low degree are used, typically linear and quadratic.\n\n[[Image:Integration rectangle.svg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of the rectangle rule.]]\nThe simplest method of this type is to let the interpolating function be a constant function (a polynomial of degree zero) that passes through the point <math display=\"inline\"> \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2}, f \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2} \\right)\\right) </math>. This is called the ''midpoint rule'' or ''[[rectangle method|rectangle rule]]''\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx \\approx (b-a) f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right).</math>\n\n[[Image:Integration trapezoid.svg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of the trapezoidal rule.]]\nThe interpolating function may be a straight line (an [[affine function]], i.e. a polynomial of degree 1)\npassing through the points <math> \\left( a, f(a)\\right) </math> and <math> \\left( b, f(b)\\right) </math>.\nThis is called the ''[[trapezoidal rule]]''\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx \\approx (b-a) \\left(\\frac{f(a) + f(b)}{2}\\right).</math>\n\n[[Image:Integration simpson.svg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of Simpson's rule.]]\nFor either one of these rules, we can make a more accurate approximation by breaking  up the interval <math> [a,b] </math> into some number <math> n </math> of subintervals, computing an approximation for each subinterval, then adding up all the results. This is called a ''composite rule'', ''extended rule'', or ''iterated rule''. For example, the composite trapezoidal rule can be stated as\n\n:<math>\n\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx \\approx \n\\frac{b-a}{n} \\left( {f(a) \\over 2} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\left( f \\left( a+k \\frac{b-a}{n} \\right) \\right) + {f(b) \\over 2} \\right),\n</math>\n\nwhere the subintervals have the form <math> [a+k h,a+ (k+1)h] \\subset [a,b], </math> with <math display=\"inline\">h = \\frac{b-a}{n}</math> and <math>k = 0,\\ldots,n-1. </math> Here we used subintervals of the same length <math> h </math> but one could also use intervals of varying length <math> \\left( h_k \\right)_k </math>.\n\nInterpolation with polynomials evaluated at equally spaced points in <math> [a,b] </math> yields the [[Newton\u2013Cotes formulas]], of which the rectangle rule and the trapezoidal rule are examples. [[Simpson's rule]], which is based on a polynomial of order 2, is also a Newton\u2013Cotes formula.\n\nQuadrature rules with equally spaced points have the very convenient property of ''nesting''.  The corresponding rule with each interval subdivided includes all the current points, so those integrand values can be re-used.\n\nIf we allow the intervals between interpolation points to vary, we find another group of quadrature formulas, such as the [[Gaussian quadrature]] formulas. A Gaussian  quadrature rule is typically more accurate than a Newton\u2013Cotes rule, which requires the same number of function evaluations, if the integrand is [[Smooth function|smooth]] (i.e., if it is sufficiently differentiable). Other quadrature methods with varying intervals include [[Clenshaw\u2013Curtis quadrature]] (also called Fej\u00e9r quadrature) methods, which do nest.\n\nGaussian quadrature rules do not nest, but the related [[Gauss\u2013Kronrod quadrature formula]]s do.\n\n=== Generalized midpoint rule formula ===\n\nA generalized midpoint rule formula is given by\n:<math>\n\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{\\frac{{{{\\left({-1}\\right)}^n}+1}}{{{{\\left({2M}\\right)}^{n+1}}\\left({n+1}\\right)!}}{{\\left.{{f^{\\left(n\\right)}}\\left(x\\right)}\\right|}_{x=\\frac{{m-1/2}}{M}}}}}\n</math>\nor\n:<math>\n\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=\\lim_{M\\to\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\sum_{n=0}^N{\\frac{{{{\\left({-1}\\right)}^n}+1}}{{{{\\left({2M}\\right)}^{n+1}}\\left({n+1}\\right)!}}{{\\left.{{f^{\\left(n\\right)}}\\left(x\\right)}\\right|}_{x=\\frac{{m-1/2}}{M}}}}},\n</math>\nwhere <math> f^{(n)}(x) </math> denotes <math> n</math>-th derivative. For example, substituting <math> M=1 </math> and\n:<math>\nf(x) = \\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta^2 x^2}\n</math>\nin the generalized midpoint rule formula, we obtain an equation of the inverse tangent\n:<math>\n\\tan^{-1}(\\theta)=i\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{2n-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\left(1+2i/\\theta\\right)^{2n-1}}-\\frac{1}{\\left(1-2i/\\theta\\right)^{2n-1}}\\right)=2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{\\frac{1}{2n-1}\\frac{{{a}_{n}}\\left(\\theta\\right)}{a_{n}^{2}\\left(\\theta\\right)+b_{n}^{2}\\left(\\theta\\right)}},\n</math>\nwhere <math> i=\\sqrt{-1} </math> is [[imaginary unit]] and\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  a_1(\\theta) &= \\frac{2}{\\theta},\\\\ \n  b_1(\\theta) &= 1,\\\\ \n  a_n(\\theta) &= \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{\\theta^2}\\right)\\,a_{n-1}(\\theta) + \\frac{4}{\\theta}\\,b_{n-1}(\\theta),\\\\\n  b_n(\\theta) &= \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{\\theta^2}\\right)\\,b_{n-1}(\\theta) - \\frac{4}{\\theta}\\,a_{n-1}(\\theta).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince at each odd <math> n </math> the numerator of the integrand becomes <math> (-1)^n + 1 = 0 </math>, the generalized midpoint rule formula can be reorganized as\n:<math>\n\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=2\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{\\frac{{1}}{{{{\\left({2M}\\right)}^{2n+1}}\\left({2n+1}\\right)!}}{{\\left.{{f^{(2n)}}(x)}\\right|}_{x=\\frac{{m-1/2}}{M}}}}}\\,\\,.\n</math>\n\nThe following example of Mathematica code generates the plot showing difference between inverse tangent and its approximation truncated at <math> M = 5 </math> and <math> N = 10 </math>:\n<source lang=Mathematica>\nf[theta_, x_] := theta/(1 + theta^2*x^2);\n\naTan[theta_, M_, nMax_] := \n    2*Sum[(Function[x, Evaluate[D[f[theta, x], {x, 2*n}]]][(m - 1/2)/\n        M])/((2*n + 1)!*(2*M)^(2*n + 1)), {m, 1, M}, {n, 0, nMax}];\n\nPlot[{ArcTan[theta] - aTan[theta, 5, 10]}, {theta, -Pi, Pi}, \n PlotRange -> All]\n</source>\n\nFor a function <math> g(t) </math> defined over interval <math> (a,b) </math>, its integral is\n:<math>\n\\int_a^b {g(t) dt} = \\int_0^{b-a} {g(\\tau+a) d\\tau}= (b-a)\\int_0^1 {g((b-a)x+a) dx}.\n</math>\nTherefore, we can apply the generalized midpoint integration formula above by assuming that <math> f(x) = (b-a)\\,g((b-a)x+a) </math>.\n\n=== Adaptive algorithms ===\n{{main|Adaptive quadrature}}\n\nIf ''f''(''x'') does not have many derivatives at all points, or if the derivatives become large, then Gaussian quadrature is often insufficient. In this case, an algorithm similar to the following will perform better:\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef calculate_definite_integral_of_f(f, initial_step_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    This algorithm calculates the definite integral of a function\n    from 0 to 1, adaptively, by choosing smaller steps near\n    problematic points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = 0.0\n    h = initial_step_size\n    accumulator = 0.0\n    while x < 1.0:\n        if x + h > 1.0:\n            h = 1.0 - x  # At end of unit interval, adjust last step to end at 1.\n        if error_too_big_in_quadrature_of_f_over_range(f, [x, x + h]):\n            h = make_h_smaller(h)\n        else:\n            accumulator += quadrature_of_f_over_range(f, [x, x + h])\n            x += h\n            if error_too_small_in_quadrature_of_over_range(f, [x, x + h]):\n                h = make_h_larger(h)  # Avoid wasting time on tiny steps.\n    return accumulator\n</source>\n\nSome details of the algorithm require careful thought. For many cases, estimating the error from quadrature over an interval for a function ''f''(''x'') isn't obvious. One popular solution is to use two different rules of quadrature, and use their difference as an estimate of the error from quadrature. The other problem is deciding what \"too large\" or \"very small\" signify. A ''local'' criterion for \"too large\" is that the quadrature error should not be larger than ''t''&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;''h'' where ''t'', a real number, is the tolerance we wish to set for global error. Then again, if ''h'' is already tiny, it may not be worthwhile to make it even smaller even if the quadrature error is apparently large. A ''global'' criterion is that the sum of errors on all the intervals should be less than&nbsp;''t''.  This type of error analysis is usually called \"a posteriori\" since we compute the error after having computed the approximation.\n\nHeuristics for adaptive quadrature are discussed by Forsythe et al. (Section 5.4).\n\n=== Extrapolation methods ===\n\nThe accuracy of a quadrature rule of the [[Newton-Cotes]] type is generally a function of the number of evaluation points.\nThe result is usually more accurate as the number of evaluation points increases,\nor, equivalently, as the width of the step size between the points decreases.\nIt is natural to ask what the result would be if the step size were allowed to approach zero.\nThis can be answered by extrapolating the result from two or more nonzero step sizes, using [[series acceleration]] methods such as [[Richardson extrapolation]].\nThe extrapolation function may be a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function]].\nExtrapolation methods are described in more detail by Stoer and Bulirsch (Section 3.4) and are implemented in many of the routines in the [[QUADPACK]] library.\n\n=== Conservative (a priori) error estimation ===\nLet <math>f</math> have a bounded first derivative over <math>[a,b],</math> i.e. <math>f \\in C^1([a,b]).</math> The [[mean value theorem]] for <math> f,</math> where <math>x \\in [a,b),</math> gives\n:<math>\n (x - a) f'(\\xi_x) = f(x) - f(a),\n</math>\n\nfor some <math> \\xi_x \\in (a,x] </math> depending on <math> x </math>.\n\nIf we integrate in <math> x </math> from <math> a </math> to <math> b </math> on both sides and take the absolute values, we obtain\n:<math>\n    \\left| \\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx - (b - a) f(a) \\right|\n  = \\left| \\int_a^b (x - a) f'(\\xi_x)\\, dx \\right| .\n</math>\n\nWe can further approximate the integral on the right-hand side by bringing the absolute value into the integrand, and replacing the term in <math> f' </math> by an upper bound\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\n  \\left| \\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx - (b - a) f(a) \\right| \n  \\leq {(b - a)^2 \\over 2} \\sup_{a \\leq x \\leq b} \\left| f'(x) \\right| ,\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|1}}\n}}\nwhere the [[supremum]] was used to approximate.\n\nHence, if we approximate the integral <math display=\"inline\"> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx </math> by the [[Numerical integration#Methods for one-dimensional integrals|quadrature rule]] <math> (b - a) f(a) </math> our error is no greater than the right hand side of {{EquationNote|1}}. We can convert this into an error analysis for the [[Riemann sum#Definition|Riemann sum]] (*), giving an upper bound of\n\n: <math>{n^{-1} \\over 2} \\sup_{0 \\leq x \\leq 1} \\left| f'(x) \\right|</math>\n\nfor the error term of that particular approximation. (Note that this is precisely the error we calculated for the example <math>f(x) = x</math>.) Using more derivatives, and by tweaking the quadrature, we can do a similar error analysis using a [[Taylor series]] (using a partial sum with remainder term) for ''f''. This error analysis gives a strict upper bound on the error, if the derivatives of ''f'' are available.\n\nThis integration method can be combined with [[interval arithmetic]] to produce [[computer proof]]s and ''verified'' calculations.\n\n=== Integrals over infinite intervals ===\n\nSeveral methods exist for approximate integration over unbounded intervals. The standard technique involves specially derived quadrature rules, such as [[Gauss-Hermite quadrature]] for integrals on the whole real line and [[Gauss-Laguerre quadrature]] for integrals on the positive reals.<ref>{{cite book |last=Leader |first=Jeffery J. | authorlink=Jeffery J. Leader| title=Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computation |year=2004 |publisher=Addison Wesley |location= |isbn= 978-0-201-73499-7}}</ref> Monte Carlo methods can also be used, or a change of variables to a finite interval; e.g., for the whole line one could use\n\n:<math>\n  \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-1}^{+1} f\\left( \\frac{t}{1-t^2} \\right) \\frac{1+t^2}{(1-t^2)^2} \\, dt,\n</math>\n\nand for semi-infinite intervals one could use\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_a^{\\infty}f(x) \\, dx &= \\int_0^1 f\\left(a + \\frac{t}{1-t}\\right) \\frac{dt}{(1-t)^2}, \\\\\n\\int_{-\\infty}^a f(x) \\, dx &= \\int_0^1 f\\left(a - \\frac{1-t}{t}\\right) \\frac{dt}{t^2},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nas possible transformations.\n\n== Multidimensional integrals ==\n\nThe quadrature rules discussed so far are all designed to compute one-dimensional integrals. To compute integrals in multiple dimensions, one approach is to phrase the multiple integral as repeated one-dimensional integrals by applying [[Fubini's theorem]] (the tensor product rule). This approach requires the function evaluations to [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]] as the number of dimensions increases. Three methods are known to overcome this so-called ''[[curse of dimensionality]]''.\n\nA great many additional techniques for forming multidimensional cubature integration rules for a variety of weighting functions are given in the monograph by Stroud.<ref name=\"StroudBook\">{{cite book |last1=Stroud |first1=A. H. |title=Approximate Calculation of Multiple Integrals |url=https://archive.org/details/approximatecalcu0000stro_b8j7 |url-access=registration |date=1971 |publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc. |location=Cliffs, NJ}}</ref> \n\n=== Monte Carlo ===\n\n{{main|Monte Carlo integration}}\n\n[[Monte Carlo method]]s and [[quasi-Monte Carlo method]]s are easy to apply to multi-dimensional integrals. They may yield greater accuracy for the same number of function evaluations than repeated integrations using one-dimensional methods. {{CN|date=November 2018}}\n\nA large class of useful Monte Carlo methods are the so-called [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] algorithms,\nwhich include the [[Metropolis-Hastings algorithm]] and [[Gibbs sampling]].\n\n=== Sparse grids ===\n[[Sparse grid]]s were originally developed by Smolyak for the quadrature of high-dimensional functions. The method is always based on a one-dimensional quadrature rule, but performs a more sophisticated combination of univariate results. However, whereas the tensor product rule guarantees that the weights of all of the cubature points will be positive if the weights of the quadrature points were positive, Smolyak's rule does not guarantee that the  weights will all be positive.\n\n=== Bayesian Quadrature ===\nBayesian Quadrature is a statistical approach to the numerical problem of computing integrals and falls under the field of probabilistic numerics. It can provide a full handling of the uncertainty over the solution of the integral expressed as a [[Gaussian Process]] posterior variance. It is also known to provide very fast convergence rates which can be up to exponential in the number of quadrature points n.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|title = Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature: Probabilistic Integration with Theoretical Guarantees |eprint = 1506.02681 |date = 2015-06-08|first = Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier|last = Briol|first2 = Chris J.|last2 = Oates|first3 = Mark|last3 = Girolami|first4 = Michael A.|last4 = Osborne|class = stat.ML }}</ref>\n\n== Connection with differential equations ==\n\nThe problem of evaluating the integral\n:<math>F(x) = \\int_a^x f(u)\\, du</math>\ncan be reduced to an [[initial value problem]] for an [[ordinary differential equation]] by applying the first part of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. By differentiating both sides of the above with respect to the argument ''x'', it is seen that the function ''F'' satisfies\n:<math> \\frac{d F(x)}{d x} = f(x), \\quad F(a) = 0. </math>\nMethods developed for ordinary differential equations, such as [[Runge\u2013Kutta methods]], can be applied to the restated problem and thus be used to evaluate the integral. For instance, the standard fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta method applied to the differential equation yields Simpson's rule from above.\n\nThe differential equation ''F''&thinsp;'&thinsp;(''x'') = &fnof;(''x'') has a special form: the right-hand side contains only the independent variable (here ''x'') and not the dependent variable (here ''F''). This simplifies the theory and algorithms considerably. The problem of evaluating integrals is thus best studied in its own right.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations]]\n* [[Truncation error (numerical integration)]]\n* [[Clenshaw\u2013Curtis quadrature]]\n* [[Gauss-Kronrod quadrature]]\n* [[Riemann Sum]] or [[Riemann Integral]]\n* [[Trapezoidal rule]]\n* [[Romberg's method]]\n* [[Tanh-sinh quadrature]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [[Philip J.

Though that negative has never been located, it has been widely suspected that this version was produced and distributed by the [[Stasi]] or the [[KGB]] in order to arouse anti-semitism among Egyptian and Palestinians against the US backed Israel (and henceforth, support for the Soviet backed Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]).<ref name=\"Hull1973\">{{cite book|last=Hull|first=David Stewart |title=Film in the Third Reich; art and propaganda in Nazi Germany|url=https://archive.org/details/film3rdreichp00davi|url-access=registration|accessdate=2011-12-19|year=1973|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Magill|first=Frank Northen |title=Magill's survey of cinema, foreign language films|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GZZAAAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Salem Press|isbn=978-0-89356-247-2}}</ref><ref name=\"Berkeley1960\">{{cite book|author=University of California, Berkeley|title=Film quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8UAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-12-19|year=1960|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> The copyright of the film is held by the government-owned [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation|F.W.

This was not because of the alleged copycat violence inspired by the film contemporaneously reported by the media, as commonly believed,{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} but because Kubrick had received death threats against his family.

At first, it was screened in theaters all over the United Kingdom and was a grossing hit. However, as time went by the film became unavailable for 11 years; it was said to cause mental and physical health issues all around the world. In addition, religious groups feared what would become of their relation with God if they watched the film. Eventually, the pseudo ban was lifted in 1991 because it was believed the film no longer had the gruesome impact it once did. <ref>https://bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/exorcist</ref>\n|}\n\n==United States==\n{{Main|List of films banned in the United States}}\n\n==Venezuela==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

However, as time went by the film became unavailable for 11 years; it was said to cause mental and physical health issues all around the world. In addition, religious groups feared what would become of their relation with God if they watched the film.

It has been defined by, and is controlled by, the [[National Marine Electronics Association]]. It replaces the earlier '''NMEA 0180''' and '''NMEA 0182''' standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kh-gps.de/nmea.faq |title=The NMEA FAQ |author=Peter Bennett |date=Sep 15, 1997 |accessdate=2013-10-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215150802/http://www.kh-gps.de/nmea.faq |archivedate=2014-02-15 }}</ref> In leisure marine applications it is slowly being phased out in favor of the newer [[NMEA 2000]] standard{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}, though NMEA0183 remains the norm in commercial shipping. \n\nThe electrical standard that is used is [[EIA-422]], although most hardware with NMEA-0183 outputs are also able to drive a single [[EIA-232]] port. Although the standard calls for isolated inputs and outputs, there are various series of hardware that do not adhere to this requirement.\n\nThe NMEA 0183 standard uses a simple [[ASCII]], [[serial communications]] protocol that defines how data are transmitted in a \"sentence\" from one \"talker\" to multiple \"listeners\" at a time.  Through the use of intermediate expanders, a talker can have a unidirectional conversation with a nearly unlimited number of listeners, and using [[multiplexers]], multiple sensors can talk to a single computer port.\n\nAt the application layer, the standard also defines the contents of each sentence (message) type, so that all listeners can parse messages accurately.\n\nWhile NMEA0183 only defines an RS422 transport, there also exists a de facto standard in which the sentences from NMEA0183 are placed in [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] datagrams (one sentence per packet) and sent over an IP network.\n\nThe NMEA standard is proprietary and sells for at least US$250 (except for members of the NMEA) as of November 2017.<ref name=\"NMEA0183\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nmea.org/content/nmea_standards/nmea_0183_v_410.asp |title=Publications and Standards from the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) / NMEA 0183 |publisher=NMEA |date=November 2008 |accessdate=2013-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021183159/http://www.nmea.org/content/nmea_standards/nmea_0183_v_410.asp |archive-date=2013-10-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, much of it has been reverse-engineered from public sources.<ref name=\"NMEA revealed\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/gpsd/NMEA.html |title=NMEA Revealed |last=Raymond |first=Eric S. |date=January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm |title=NMEA data |author=Dale DePriest |accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>\n\n== Serial configuration (data link layer) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is in general use by [[Automatic Identification System|AIS]] devices.\n\n== Message structure ==\n* All transmitted data are printable [[ASCII]] characters between 0x20 (space) to 0x7e (~) \n* Data characters are all the above characters except the reserved characters (See next line)\n* Reserved characters are used by NMEA0183 for the following uses:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

(for messages that have special encapsulation in them)\n* The next five characters identify the talker (two characters) and the type of message (three characters).\n* All data fields that follow are comma-delimited.\n* Where data is unavailable, the corresponding field remains blank (it contains no character before the next delimiter \u2013 see [[#Sample file|Sample file]] section below).\n* The first character that immediately follows the last data field character is an asterisk, but it is only included if a checksum is supplied.\n* The asterisk is immediately followed by a [[checksum]] represented as a two-digit [[hexadecimal]] number. The checksum is the [[Bitwise XOR|bitwise exclusive OR]] of [[ASCII]] codes of all characters between the ''$'' and ''*''. According to the official specification, the checksum is optional for most data sentences, but is compulsory for RMA, RMB, and RMC (among others).\n* [[Newline|<CR><LF>]] ends the message.\n\nAs an example, a waypoint arrival alarm has the form:\n: ''$GPAAM,A,A,0.10,N,WPTNME*32''\n\nAnother example for AIS messages is:\n:!AIVDM,1,1,,A,14eG;o@034o8sd<L9i:a;WF>062D,0*7D\n\n== Vendor extensions ==\nMost GPS manufacturers include special messages in addition to the standard NMEA set in their products for maintenance and diagnostics purposes.

It has been defined by, and is controlled by, the [[National Marine Electronics Association]].

Although the standard calls for isolated inputs and outputs, there are various series of hardware that do not adhere to this requirement.\n\nThe NMEA 0183 standard uses a simple [[ASCII]], [[serial communications]] protocol that defines how data are transmitted in a \"sentence\" from one \"talker\" to multiple \"listeners\" at a time.  Through the use of intermediate expanders, a talker can have a unidirectional conversation with a nearly unlimited number of listeners, and using [[multiplexers]], multiple sensors can talk to a single computer port.\n\nAt the application layer, the standard also defines the contents of each sentence (message) type, so that all listeners can parse messages accurately.\n\nWhile NMEA0183 only defines an RS422 transport, there also exists a de facto standard in which the sentences from NMEA0183 are placed in [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] datagrams (one sentence per packet) and sent over an IP network.\n\nThe NMEA standard is proprietary and sells for at least US$250 (except for members of the NMEA) as of November 2017.<ref name=\"NMEA0183\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nmea.org/content/nmea_standards/nmea_0183_v_410.asp |title=Publications and Standards from the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) / NMEA 0183 |publisher=NMEA |date=November 2008 |accessdate=2013-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021183159/http://www.nmea.org/content/nmea_standards/nmea_0183_v_410.asp |archive-date=2013-10-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, much of it has been reverse-engineered from public sources.<ref name=\"NMEA revealed\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/gpsd/NMEA.html |title=NMEA Revealed |last=Raymond |first=Eric S. |date=January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm |title=NMEA data |author=Dale DePriest |accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>\n\n== Serial configuration (data link layer) ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is in general use by [[Automatic Identification System|AIS]] devices.\n\n== Message structure ==\n* All transmitted data are printable [[ASCII]] characters between 0x20 (space) to 0x7e (~) \n* Data characters are all the above characters except the reserved characters (See next line)\n* Reserved characters are used by NMEA0183 for the following uses:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

(for messages that have special encapsulation in them)\n* The next five characters identify the talker (two characters) and the type of message (three characters).\n* All data fields that follow are comma-delimited.\n* Where data is unavailable, the corresponding field remains blank (it contains no character before the next delimiter \u2013 see [[#Sample file|Sample file]] section below).\n* The first character that immediately follows the last data field character is an asterisk, but it is only included if a checksum is supplied.\n* The asterisk is immediately followed by a [[checksum]] represented as a two-digit [[hexadecimal]] number. The checksum is the [[Bitwise XOR|bitwise exclusive OR]] of [[ASCII]] codes of all characters between the ''$'' and ''*''. According to the official specification, the checksum is optional for most data sentences, but is compulsory for RMA, RMB, and RMC (among others).\n* [[Newline|<CR><LF>]] ends the message.\n\nAs an example, a waypoint arrival alarm has the form:\n: ''$GPAAM,A,A,0.10,N,WPTNME*32''\n\nAnother example for AIS messages is:\n:!AIVDM,1,1,,A,14eG;o@034o8sd<L9i:a;WF>062D,0*7D\n\n== Vendor extensions ==\nMost GPS manufacturers include special messages in addition to the standard NMEA set in their products for maintenance and diagnostics purposes. Extended messages begin with \"$P\". These extended messages are not standardized.\n\n== Software compatibility ==\nNMEA 0183 is supported by various navigation and mapping software.

Consumers could vote by calling 1-800-FUN-COLOR. Ads for the new blue colors featured a plain and an almond blue M&M character as Red and Yellow take notice of trying to do takes in the commercial by painting themselves blue where they appear on stage with [[B.B. King]] singing the blues, but the filmmakers had to cut the scene as they were not the real blue M&M's; another featured Red and Yellow holding their breath to look like the new blue M&M's, where [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] sees the three M&M's, Red, Yellow, and Blue; and one more featuring Weber talking to the blue M&M if he had dived into the chocolate pool, but did not.\n\nIn 2002, Mars solicited votes in their first ever \"M&M's Global Color Vote\" to add a new color from three choices: [[aqua (color)|aqua]] ([[turquoise (color)|turquoise]]), [[pink]], and [[purple]]. Purple won and was featured for a limited time. To help the colors get votes, [[Ken Schrader]] and his [[MB2 Motorsports]] team, who was sponsored by M&M's at the time, ran four paint schemes during the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season]] representing the promotion (one for aqua, one for pink, one for purple, and another one with all three colors on the car). Specially marked packages of M&M's were released in Japan. Finding a bag of all purple M&M's entitled the customer to a prize of 100 million [[Japanese Yen|yen]] (equivalent to approximately USD $852,000).\n\nOn January 1, 2004, at the stroke of midnight, Mars removed all of the colors of M&M's and made them black-and-white on both their candies and the packaging. It coincided with a commercial parodying ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' where [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] is home in bed and looks out of the window and sees what the colors of the four M&M's were. The goal was to help the M&M's find their colors in black-and-white packages of M&M's, in this order: brown, orange, red, green, yellow, and blue. After all of the colors have been found, the colored packaging returned, and began carrying the theme \"Chocolate is better in color\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nSince 2004, M&M's have been available online in 17 colors, with personalized phrases on each candy on the opposite side from the \"m\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mymms.com/|title=Custom Printed MY M&M'S|work=mms.com|publisher=[[Mars, Incorporated]]|accessdate=February 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211174015/http://www.mymms.com/|archive-date=February 11, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Released around Christmas, these custom-printed M&M's were originally intended for [[holiday greetings]], but are now available all year round.\n\nFor the 2008 [[Valentine's Day]] season, Mars introduced all-green bags of M&M's.

Mars also released a \"Crispy Mint\" variety in Australia that year.\n\n[[File:Kyle Busch, 2013 STP Gas Booster 500.JPG|thumb|right|The M&M's sponsored [[NASCAR]] stock car driven by [[Kyle Busch]]]]\nAlso in 2006, M&M's became the official chocolate of [[NASCAR]].\n\nIn 2007, M&M's introduced a limited-edition raspberry flavor called \"M&M's Razzberry Chocolate Candies\".\n\nAlso in 2007, M&M's produced a 50-foot, smiling Lady Liberty M&M statue to kick off a campaign encouraging Americans to create their own M&M characters at mms.com. The website allows for people to log in and create their own character from scratch. They can choose features such as the color, shape, hair, and accessories.\n\nIn 2008, two limited-edition varieties of the candy were introduced \u2013 \"Wildly Cherry\" M&M's, and, as a marketing tie-in with the film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', \"Mint Crisp\" M&M's.\n\nM&M's also introduced another new product called \"M&M's Premiums\" in 2008. They come in five flavors \u2013 chocolate almond, mint chocolate, mocha, raspberry almond, and triple chocolate (milk, dark, and white chocolate), which are sold in small upright cartons with a plastic bag inside. M&M's Premiums do not have a candy shell, but are coated with [[carnauba wax]] and color. Dark chocolate was added in 2009, replacing mocha.\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, My M&M's launched 'Faces,' which allows consumers to print the faces of loved ones on M&M's chocolate candies at mymms.com.\n\nIn February 2009, M&M's launched the \"M&M's Colour Break-Up\" promotion in Australia, where M&M's were sold in separate packs (one for each color): the packs included a code to win prizes.<ref>{{cite news|title=M&M'S Color Break Up|url=http://www.colourbreakup.com.au/html/default.aspx|publisher=Mars|date=February 18, 2009|accessdate=February 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228205617/http://www.colourbreakup.com.au/html/default.aspx|archive-date=February 28, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn Summer 2009, M&M's launched a limited-edition \"Strawberried Peanut Butter\" variant to tie in with the release of ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.

Purple won and was featured for a limited time. To help the colors get votes, [[Ken Schrader]] and his [[MB2 Motorsports]] team, who was sponsored by M&M's at the time, ran four paint schemes during the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season]] representing the promotion (one for aqua, one for pink, one for purple, and another one with all three colors on the car). Specially marked packages of M&M's were released in Japan.

He wrote his senior thesis on the poetry of W. H. Auden. At Harvard he befriended fellow writers [[Kenneth Koch]], [[Barbara Epstein]], [[V. R. Lang]], [[Frank O'Hara]] and [[Edward Gorey]], and was a classmate of [[Robert Creeley]], [[Robert Bly]] and [[Peter Davison (poet)|Peter Davison]].

He was an editor of the 12 issues of ''Art and Literature'' (1964\u201367) and the ''New Poetry'' issue of [[Harry Mathews]]' ''Locus Solus'' (# 3/4; 1962). To make ends meet he translated French murder mysteries, served as the art editor for the European edition of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and was an art critic for ''Art International'' (1960\u201365) and a Paris correspondent for ''[[ARTnews]]'' (1963\u201366), when Thomas Hess took over as editor. During this period he lived with the French poet [[Pierre Martory]], whose books ''Every Question but One'' (1990), ''The Landscape is behind the Door'' (1994) and ''The Landscapist'' he translated (2008), as he did [[Arthur Rimbaud]] (''Illuminations''), [[Max Jacob]] (''The Dice Cup''), [[Pierre Reverdy]] (''Haunted House''), and many titles by [[Raymond Roussel]]. After returning to the United States, he continued his career as an [[art critic]] for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazines while also serving on the editorial board of ''ARTnews'' until 1972. Several years later, he began a stint as an editor at ''[[Partisan Review]]'', serving from 1976 to 1980.\n\nDuring the fall of 1963, Ashbery became acquainted with [[Andy Warhol]] at a scheduled poetry reading at the [[Literary Theatre]] in New York. He had previously written favorable reviews of Warhol's art. That same year he reviewed Warhol's ''Flowers'' exhibition at Galerie [[Ileana Sonnabend]] in Paris, describing Warhol's visit to Paris as \"the biggest transatlantic fuss since [[Oscar Wilde]] brought culture to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] in the nineties\". Ashbery returned to New York near the end of 1965 and was welcomed with a large party at [[the Factory]]. He became close friends with poet [[Gerard Malanga]], Warhol's assistant, on whom he had an important influence as a poet. In 1967 his poem ''Europe'' was used as the central text in [[Eric Salzman|Eric Salzman's]] ''Foxes and Hedgehogs'' as part of the ''New Image of Sound'' series at [[Hunter College]], conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]]. When the poet sent Salzman ''Three Madrigals'' in 1968, the composer featured them in the seminal ''Nude Paper Sermon'', released by [[Nonesuch Records]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flowchartfoundation.org/tc/advanced_search.php?reorder=yes&sortfield=publicationdate&sorttype=desc&se_type=EX&pg=20&/|title=Ashbery Research Center archive|accessdate=September 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141214045519/http://www.flowchartfoundation.org/tc/advanced_search.php?reorder=yes&sortfield=publicationdate&sorttype=desc&se_type=EX&pg=20&/|archivedate=December 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s, Ashbery began teaching at [[Brooklyn College]], where his students included poet [[John Yau]].

He was an editor of the 12 issues of ''Art and Literature'' (1964\u201367) and the ''New Poetry'' issue of [[Harry Mathews]]' ''Locus Solus'' (# 3/4; 1962). To make ends meet he translated French murder mysteries, served as the art editor for the European edition of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and was an art critic for ''Art International'' (1960\u201365) and a Paris correspondent for ''[[ARTnews]]'' (1963\u201366), when Thomas Hess took over as editor. During this period he lived with the French poet [[Pierre Martory]], whose books ''Every Question but One'' (1990), ''The Landscape is behind the Door'' (1994) and ''The Landscapist'' he translated (2008), as he did [[Arthur Rimbaud]] (''Illuminations''), [[Max Jacob]] (''The Dice Cup''), [[Pierre Reverdy]] (''Haunted House''), and many titles by [[Raymond Roussel]]. After returning to the United States, he continued his career as an [[art critic]] for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazines while also serving on the editorial board of ''ARTnews'' until 1972. Several years later, he began a stint as an editor at ''[[Partisan Review]]'', serving from 1976 to 1980.\n\nDuring the fall of 1963, Ashbery became acquainted with [[Andy Warhol]] at a scheduled poetry reading at the [[Literary Theatre]] in New York. He had previously written favorable reviews of Warhol's art. That same year he reviewed Warhol's ''Flowers'' exhibition at Galerie [[Ileana Sonnabend]] in Paris, describing Warhol's visit to Paris as \"the biggest transatlantic fuss since [[Oscar Wilde]] brought culture to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] in the nineties\". Ashbery returned to New York near the end of 1965 and was welcomed with a large party at [[the Factory]]. He became close friends with poet [[Gerard Malanga]], Warhol's assistant, on whom he had an important influence as a poet. In 1967 his poem ''Europe'' was used as the central text in [[Eric Salzman|Eric Salzman's]] ''Foxes and Hedgehogs'' as part of the ''New Image of Sound'' series at [[Hunter College]], conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]]. When the poet sent Salzman ''Three Madrigals'' in 1968, the composer featured them in the seminal ''Nude Paper Sermon'', released by [[Nonesuch Records]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flowchartfoundation.org/tc/advanced_search.php?reorder=yes&sortfield=publicationdate&sorttype=desc&se_type=EX&pg=20&/|title=Ashbery Research Center archive|accessdate=September 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141214045519/http://www.flowchartfoundation.org/tc/advanced_search.php?reorder=yes&sortfield=publicationdate&sorttype=desc&se_type=EX&pg=20&/|archivedate=December 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s, Ashbery began teaching at [[Brooklyn College]], where his students included poet [[John Yau]].

He served on the contributing editorial board of the literary journal ''[[Conjunctions]]''.
