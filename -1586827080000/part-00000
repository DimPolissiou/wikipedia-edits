The single-player campaign, graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay received considerable praise, with reviewers crediting the game for recapturing the spirit of the classic ''Doom'' games and first-person shooters of the 1990s, whereas the multiplayer mode drew the most significant criticism. It was the second best-selling video game in North America and the UK a few weeks after its release and sold over 500,000 copies for PCs within the same time period.

Researchers at the UAC facility have attempted to draw energy from Hell, an alternative dimension inhabited by demons, in order to solve an energy crisis on Earth using the Argent Tower, which siphons energy and allows travel to and from Hell.<ref name=vb-plot>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/05/27/the-deanbeat-doom-is-a-memorable-trip-back-into-shooting-hell/|title=''The DeanBeat'': ''Doom'' is a memorable trip back into shooting hell|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|date=May 27, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref> To supplement their work, Hayden organizes several expeditions into Hell, bringing back captive demons and artifacts for study. Among them is a [[sarcophagus]] containing the [[Doomguy|Doom Slayer]] (along with his Praetor Suit), who the demons imprisoned after his earlier rampage through Hell.\n\nThe facility is overrun by demons after one of Hayden's researchers, Olivia Pierce, makes a pact with them and uses the Tower to open a portal to Hell.<ref name=vb-plot/> In desperation, Hayden releases the Doom Slayer from his sarcophagus to repel the demonic invasion and close the portal. The Doom Slayer recovers his Praetor Suit and fights his way through the overrun facility, where he realigns a comms satellite dish to get a lay of the land, all guided by the AI VEGA. After clearing out the facility core and preventing a meltdown, he pursues Pierce as she destroys the energy induction filters to Hayden's objections. He pursues Pierce up the tower, where she uses an Argent accumulator to open an explosive rift into Hell, destroying the Tower, and where the Slayer is sent back. \n\nFighting his way to a teleporter, the Doom Slayer returns to Mars and makes his way to a tram leading to Hayden. Hayden informs the Slayer of the Helix Stone, an artifact used to study and harness Hell's energy. Entering the Lazarus labs, he observes the Helix Stone, and he learns of the Well, where the portal is powered, and of the magical key-like blade, the Crucible. He makes another excursion into Hell after battling and defeating a contained Cyberdemon and activating its accumulator, and fights through a labyrinthine gauntlet to recover the Crucible from a trio of Hell Guards. Arriving at VEGA's facility in the frozen north, he destroys the AI (while also making a backup copy), using its power to enter the Well, where he uses the Crucible to destroy the portal's power source. Finally, he confronts Pierce, who is transformed by the demons into the monstrous Spider Mastermind, and kills her.\n\nUpon the Doom Slayer's return to Mars, Hayden confiscates the Crucible, which he plans to use in his research. Despite all that has happened, he insists that Earth is too desperate for energy to give up. To keep the Doom Slayer from interfering with his plans, Hayden teleports him to an undisclosed location, saying that they [[Doom Eternal|will meet again]].\n\n==Development==\n===As ''Doom 4''===\n[[File:A screenshot of the canned Doom 4.jpg|thumb|A screenshot of the canceled ''Doom 4'', which showcased a more urban environment than its predecessors]]\n\n[[John Carmack]], co-founder of and then lead developer at [[id Software]], indicated that ''Doom 4'' was in development at [[QuakeCon]] on August 3, 2007.<ref name=\"carmackrage\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2|title=QuakeCon 2007: John Carmack Talks ''Rage'', Id Tech 5 And More|last=Berghammer|first=Billy|date=August 3, 2007|work=Game Informer|accessdate=August 24, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029050912/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2|archivedate=October 29, 2007}}</ref> It was announced in May 2008.<ref name=\"ign_announce\">{{cite web |last=Ocampo |first=Jason |date=May 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/872/872097p1.html |title=''Doom 4'' Announced|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> Id Software CEO [[Todd Hollenshead]] suggested that like ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', the game would take place on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/DOOM-4-Rage-FPS-John-Carmack-id-Tech-5,14837.html|title=Are These Really ''Doom 4'' Screenshots?|first=Kevin|last=Parrish|work=[[Tom's Hardware]]|publisher=[[Purch Group]]|date=February 29, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref> Carmack stated that it would feature gameplay more akin to the original ''Doom'' games rather than the [[survival horror]] gameplay of ''[[Doom 3]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/85484-John-Carmack-Sheds-Some-Light-On-Doom-4 |title=John Carmack Sheds Some Light On Doom 4 |first=Andy|last=Chalk|date=August 6, 2008|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|publisher=[[Defy Media]]|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Carmack claimed that Doom 4 would look \"three times better\" than ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]'' even though it was intended to run at 30 frames per second on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, rather than the 60 that ''Rage'' was targeting.<ref name=1up-new>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/doom-game-announced|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714131428/http://www.1up.com/news/doom-game-announced|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 14, 2012|title=Next ''Doom'' Game Announced|first=Philip|last=Kollar|work=[[1UP.com|1UP]]|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2016}}</ref> It was planned to run at 60 frames per second on Windows with state-of-the-art hardware.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/quakecon_08_quake_live_will_have_no_mod_support_doom_4_run_60hz_pc_locked_30hz_consoles | title=QuakeCon 08: Quake Live Will Have No Mod Support; Doom 4 to Run at 60Hz on PC, Locked at 30Hz for Consoles |date=July 31, 2008 |first=Norman|last=Chan|publisher=[[Maximum PC]]|accessdate=November 30, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628192231/http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/quakecon_08_quake_live_will_have_no_mod_support_doom_4_run_60hz_pc_locked_30hz_consoles|archivedate=June 28, 2011}}</ref> Carmack also stated that the game was running on the [[id Tech 5]] game engine.<ref name=1up-new/> In 2009, he revealed that the multiplayer component was being developed separately and would run at 60 frames per second.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_Ge-35Ld70 | title=John Carmack on Rage |date=July 2009 |work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=CD-Action |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref> He stated in 2011 that \"you can't have 30 guys crawling all over you at 60 frames per second at this graphics technology level because it's painful.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6318725/e3-2011-john-carmack-talks-wii-u-playstation-vita-and-next-gen-rage |title=E3 2011: John Carmack talks Wii U, PlayStation Vita, and next-gen Rage|date=June 9, 2011|first=Tor|last=Thorsen|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=June 9, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128080308/http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6318725/e3-2011-john-carmack-talks-wii-u-playstation-vita-and-next-gen-rage|archivedate=January 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, Hollenshead said that ''Doom 4'' was \"deep in development\".

whereas criticism was predominantly toward the multiplayer mode. Many critics believed that ''Doom'' was a successful return to form for the series. Following the wide release, the game received scores of 85/100 for PC and PlayStation 4 and 87/100 for the Xbox One on [[Metacritic]]. The Nintendo Switch edition, released in November 2017, was also positively received by professional reviewers, garnering a 79/100 on Metacritic: most reviewers praised the job of the port, also conceding that it's not as well-optimized as it was for previous consoles. The final version of the game received very positive reviews from users on [[Steam (service)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-18-the-new-doom-turns-around-steam-user-reviews|title=The new Doom campaign turns around Steam user reviews|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}</ref> It also received praise from other video game creators, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-designer-cliff-bleszinski-praises-new/1100-6439815/|title=Gears of War Designer Cliff Bleszinski Praises New Doom, But Has One Criticism|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 16, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref> and [[Greg Kasavin]], who said that the game answers questions that other modern shooters do not answer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/why-is-the-new-doom-so-important-it-asks-the-questions-other-shooters-aren-t-argues-supergiant-dev/0220857|title=Why is the new Doom so important?

Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun favorably compared ''Doom'' to the 2014 game ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', also published by Bethesda, but added that ''Doom''{{'}}s quality surpassed that of ''Wolfenstein'' due to its fast pace and solid gunplay.<ref name=\"rockpapershotgun\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/16/doom-review-pc/|title=Wot I Think: DOOM (Singleplayer)|last=Meer|first=Alec|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=May 16, 2016|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}</ref> Peter Brown of [[GameSpot]] praised single-player because he thought that the reboot captured the spirits of the older games, while refining them with modern elements. Brown also drew attention toward the soundtrack, calling it \"impactful\".<ref name=\"gamespotreview\"/> Gary Jones in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' felt that the game had one of the best single-player campaigns made for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, successfully combining the traditional gameplay of the series with a very fast pace.<ref name=dereview>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/672439/DOOM-Review-Xbox-One-Bethesda-PS4|title=''DOOM'' Review: The best single-player FPS action on Xbox One and PS4|last=Jones|first=Gary|work=[[Daily Express]]|publisher=[[Express Newspapers]]|date=May 21, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}</ref> Mike Henriquez of [[Game Revolution]] favored the visual and artistic design, calling it \"top-notch\".<ref name=\"gamerevreview\"/> Sam White in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commended id Software for ''Doom''{{'}}s delivery of performance on all platforms and praised the weapon design for ''Doom''{{'}}s continuity to introduce new weapons at a perfect speed so that gamers always play with something new and exciting.<ref name=ttreview>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/doom-review/|title=''Doom'' is a fiendishly moreish, impeccably refined shooter - review|first=Sam|last=White|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|date=May 23, 2016|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]{{'}}s Arthur Gies remarked positively upon the exploration for collectables and secrets, and their relevance to the new upgrade feature, but he was critical of instances where the game would lock away sections of a level without warning.<ref name=\"polygonreview\"/> Zack Furniss of [[Destructoid]] was originally skeptical regarding the \"glory kills\" feature, as were other critics, fearing that they might distract from the fast-paced gameplay. He ultimately considered them to fit well in the flow of gameplay that keeps players in the middle of combat without a slowed pace.<ref name=\"destructoidreview\"/> [[Giant Bomb]]{{'}}s Brad Shoemaker felt that the glory kills' generating small amounts of health and armor \"makes them an essential part of the give-and-take of ''Doom''{{'}}s super fast combat; do you dart into the fray for a glory kill to get a little health back, and risk getting mobbed by all the other enemies around?\"<ref name=\"giantbombreview\"/> Conversely, Kyle Orland of [[Ars Technica]] felt that the glory kills' briefly taking control away from the player can easily disorient players or misposition them, finding them hard to ignore for players that choose not to use them.<ref name=\"arstechreview\">{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/|title=Doom (2016) single-player review: Back to basics|last=Orland|first=Kyle|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe SnapMap mode was also positively received with ''Hardcore Gamer''{{'s}} Jordan Helm's noting the possibilities yet simplicity with its use, calling it an \"admirable feat\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/05/17/review-doom/207490/|title=Doom Review (PS4)|last=Helm|first=Jordan|work=Hardcore Gamer|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Matt Peckham of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' thought that the mode added further value to the overall package of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4336416/doom-review/|title=Review: The New \u2018Doom\u2019 Serves Up a Brew of Nostalgia and Carnage|last=Peckham|first=Matt|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Matt Bertz of ''[[Game Informer]]'' commented upon the accessibility but criticized the lack of diverse settings and possible limitations when compared to a traditional community-based [[mod (video games)|mod]].<ref name=\"gameinformerreview\"/> James Davenport of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' compared it to the modification in the original games, which he views as one of the primary reasons why ''Doom'' is still a recognizable title.

IGN's Joab Gilory was less favorable toward the multiplayer, calling the overall game \"a tale of two very different shooters\", stating that multiplayer did not live up to the standard set by the single-player components and would not satisfy players.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> Simon Miller of ''VideoGamer.com'' found the multiplayer to be only all right.<ref name=\"videogamer.comreview\"/> Matt Buchholtz of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'' criticized what he felt was the network's poor handling of latency, and failing to register on-target shots as hits in some instances while not in others.<ref name=\"egmreview\"/> Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of [[Eurogamer]] singled out the \"Warpath\" multiplayer mode as the most interesting of the match type, describing it as \"memorable\", while

It was released worldwide on [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] in May 2016 and is powered by [[id Tech 6]]. A port for [[Nintendo Switch]] was co-developed with [[Panic Button (company)|Panic Button]] and released in November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stevivor.com/news/doom-on-switch-runs-at-30-fps-has-9gb-multiplayer-download/|title=DOOM on Switch runs at 30 FPS, has 9GB multiplayer download|publisher=Stevivor}}</ref> A reboot of the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' franchise]], it is the fourth title in the main series and the first major installment since ''[[Doom 3]]'' in 2004.\n\n''Doom'' was announced as \"''Doom 4''\" in 2008, and that version underwent an extensive development cycle with different builds and designs before the game was restarted in 2011 and revealed as simply \"''Doom''\" in 2014. It was tested by customers who pre-ordered the 2014 Bethesda game ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'' and also by the general public. [[Mick Gordon (composer)|Mick Gordon]] composed the music for the game, with additional music contributed by Ben F. Carney, Chris Hite, and Chad Mossholder.\n\nPlayers take the role of an [[Doomguy|unnamed space marine]] as he battles demonic forces from [[Hell]] that have been unleashed by the Union Aerospace Corporation on a future-set colonized planet [[Mars]]. The gameplay returns to a faster pace with more open-ended levels, closer to the first two games than the slower [[survival horror]] approach of ''Doom 3''. It also features environment traversal, character upgrades, and the ability to perform executions known as \"glory kills\". The game also supports an online multiplayer component and a level editor known as \"SnapMap\", co-developed with [[Certain Affinity]]{{efn|[[BattleCry Studios]] has since taken over Certain Affinity's development duties.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Holmes|first1=Mike|title=BattleCry devs now working with id on Doom multiplayer|url=http://www.gamereactor.eu/news/443533/BattleCry+devs+now+working+with+id+on+Doom+multiplayer/|website=www.gamereactor.eu|publisher=[[Gamereactor]]|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}</ref>}} and [[Escalation Studios]], respectively.\n\n''Doom'' was well-received by critics and players. The single-player campaign, graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay received considerable praise, with reviewers crediting the game for recapturing the spirit of the classic ''Doom'' games and first-person shooters of the 1990s, whereas the multiplayer mode drew the most significant criticism. It was the second best-selling video game in North America and the UK a few weeks after its release and sold over 500,000 copies for PCs within the same time period. A sequel titled ''[[Doom Eternal]]'' was announced at [[E3 2018]] for Nintendo Switch, Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and was released on March 20, 2020, with the Nintendo Switch port coming later in 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Single-player===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Output OK1Cm5.gif|thumb|left|250px|An animation of the [[Doom Slayer]] sawing two Imps, and the player gaining ammunition]] -->\n\nAccording to the game's executive producer [[Marty Stratton]], the key principles of ''Doom''{{'}}s single-player mode are \"badass demons, big effing guns, and moving really fast\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/hands-on-dooms-coolest-new-gun-is-powered-by-sprinting/|title=Hands-on: ''Doom''{{'}}s coolest new gun is powered by sprinting|date=July 23, 2015|accessdate=October 20, 2016|first=Ian|last=Birnbaum|work=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]}}</ref> The game allows players to perform movements such as double jumps and ledge climbs throughout levels of industrial and corporate fields of a Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) research facility on [[Mars]] and then levels of Hell,<ref name=gi-gruesome>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/01/11/video-the-gruesome-art-design-of-doom.aspx|title=The Gruesome Level Design Of ''Doom''|first=Wade|last=Wojcik|work=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]|date=January 11, 2016|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}</ref> as the combat system puts emphasis upon momentum and speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/doom-revealed-at-quakecon-2014-and-heres-what-we-saw/|title=Doom revealed at QuakeCon 2014, and here's what we saw|first=Ian|last= Birnbaum |date=July 18, 2014|accessdate=July 3, 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> The approach is known as \"push-forward combat\", which discourages players from taking cover behind obstacles or [[Health (games)#Regenerating health|resting to regain health]] while playing from the [[Doom Slayer]] 's perspective.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/08/06/doom-cant-afford-to-let-you-hang-back/|title=''DOOM'' can\u2019t afford to let you hang back|first=Sherif|last=Saed|publisher=[[VG247]]|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=October 21, 2016}}</ref> Players instead collect health and armor pick-ups by killing enemies. \"Glory Kills\" is a newly-introduced melee execution system; when enough damage has been dealt to an enemy, the game will highlight it and allow the player to perform a quick and violent melee takedown, rewarding the player with small health recovery.<ref name=glory-kills/>\n\nThe fights also require the player to develop simple tactics. As the game gets harder, the player needs to use the advantages of fight arenas and their bonuses smarter.

Recurring weapons of the series also make a return, including the super shotgun and [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]]. The BFG has a very small ammunition capacity, but is extremely powerful.

Many of these collectibles can be used as part of ''Doom''{{'}}s progression system, including weapon mods, rune powers, and Praetor Suit upgrades. Weapon points come from field drones and allow the player to unlock alternate modes of fire for many weapons, such as explosive shots and different rate and output of firepower. Each of the weapons' firing modes can be further upgraded using weapon tokens, but they can only be maxed out by completing a challenge related to that particular firing mode. Runes transport the player to a separate arena to perform a combat challenge that grants different abilities when successfully completed, such as better equipment drops from fallen enemies. Players can also upgrade their \"Praetor Suit\" by retrieving special tokens from dead marines and using them to improve functionality such as equipment, navigation and resistances.<ref name=pg-custom>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/11/11657360/doom-trailer-campaign-progression-system|title=''Doom'' developers explain the campaign's progression system|first=Samit|last=Sarkar|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=May 11, 2016|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref> Other pickups include small [[Doomguy]] figurines that allow the player to view 3D models of different characters, and data files that expand on the characters and story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/05/surprise-dooms-campaign-is-actually-fun/|title=Surprise, DOOM's Campaign Is Actually Fun|first=Alex|last=Walker|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, each of the game's levels contains a hidden lever which opens an area extracted from a classic level in the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' or ''[[Doom II]]''.

To accommodate this new progression system, Update 6.66 also reset all players' multiplayer experience progression, but not without giving players the option whether to retain all unlocked items or reset them.

If they are not connected together, the color of the construction pieces changes to notify the player. Players can also use the X-ray camera which temporarily removes all the walls to allow players to view the objects inside. Players can also place enemies into their maps, with the exception of the campaign's [[boss (video games)|bosses]]. Their [[artificial intelligence]] and stats, and the player's own movement speed can also be modified.

Researchers at the UAC facility have attempted to draw energy from Hell, an alternative dimension inhabited by demons, in order to solve an energy crisis on Earth using the Argent Tower, which siphons energy and allows travel to and from Hell.<ref name=vb-plot>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/05/27/the-deanbeat-doom-is-a-memorable-trip-back-into-shooting-hell/|title=''The DeanBeat'': ''Doom'' is a memorable trip back into shooting hell|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|date=May 27, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref> To supplement their work, Hayden organizes several expeditions into Hell, bringing back captive demons and artifacts for study. Among them is a [[sarcophagus]] containing the [[Doomguy|Doom Slayer]] (along with his Praetor Suit), who the demons imprisoned after his earlier rampage through Hell.\n\nThe facility is overrun by demons after one of Hayden's researchers, Olivia Pierce, makes a pact with them and uses the Tower to open a portal to Hell.<ref name=vb-plot/> In desperation, Hayden releases the Doom Slayer from his sarcophagus to repel the demonic invasion and close the portal. The Doom Slayer recovers his Praetor Suit and fights his way through the overrun facility, where he realigns a comms satellite dish to get a lay of the land, all guided by the AI VEGA. After clearing out the facility core and preventing a meltdown, he pursues Pierce as she destroys the energy induction filters to Hayden's objections. He pursues Pierce up the tower, where she uses an Argent accumulator to open an explosive rift into Hell, destroying the Tower, and where the Slayer is sent back. \n\nFighting his way to a teleporter, the Doom Slayer returns to Mars and makes his way to a tram leading to Hayden. Hayden informs the Slayer of the Helix Stone, an artifact used to study and harness Hell's energy. Entering the Lazarus labs, he observes the Helix Stone, and he learns of the Well, where the portal is powered, and of the magical key-like blade, the Crucible. He makes another excursion into Hell after battling and defeating a contained Cyberdemon and activating its accumulator, and fights through a labyrinthine gauntlet to recover the Crucible from a trio of Hell Guards. Arriving at VEGA's facility in the frozen north, he destroys the AI (while also making a backup copy), using its power to enter the Well, where he uses the Crucible to destroy the portal's power source. Finally, he confronts Pierce, who is transformed by the demons into the monstrous Spider Mastermind, and kills her.\n\nUpon the Doom Slayer's return to Mars, Hayden confiscates the Crucible, which he plans to use in his research. Despite all that has happened, he insists that Earth is too desperate for energy to give up. To keep the Doom Slayer from interfering with his plans, Hayden teleports him to an undisclosed location, saying that they [[Doom Eternal|will meet again]].\n\n==Development==\n===As ''Doom 4''===\n[[File:A screenshot of the canned Doom 4.jpg|thumb|A screenshot of the canceled ''Doom 4'', which showcased a more urban environment than its predecessors]]\n\n[[John Carmack]], co-founder of and then lead developer at [[id Software]], indicated that ''Doom 4'' was in development at [[QuakeCon]] on August 3, 2007.<ref name=\"carmackrage\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2|title=QuakeCon 2007: John Carmack Talks ''Rage'', Id Tech 5 And More|last=Berghammer|first=Billy|date=August 3, 2007|work=Game Informer|accessdate=August 24, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029050912/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0803.1731.12214.htm?Page=2|archivedate=October 29, 2007}}</ref> It was announced in May 2008.<ref name=\"ign_announce\">{{cite web |last=Ocampo |first=Jason |date=May 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/872/872097p1.html |title=''Doom 4'' Announced|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> Id Software CEO [[Todd Hollenshead]] suggested that like ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', the game would take place on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/DOOM-4-Rage-FPS-John-Carmack-id-Tech-5,14837.html|title=Are These Really ''Doom 4'' Screenshots?|first=Kevin|last=Parrish|work=[[Tom's Hardware]]|publisher=[[Purch Group]]|date=February 29, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref> Carmack stated that it would feature gameplay more akin to the original ''Doom'' games rather than the [[survival horror]] gameplay of ''[[Doom 3]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/85484-John-Carmack-Sheds-Some-Light-On-Doom-4 |title=John Carmack Sheds Some Light On Doom 4 |first=Andy|last=Chalk|date=August 6, 2008|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|publisher=[[Defy Media]]|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Carmack claimed that Doom 4 would look \"three times better\" than ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]'' even though it was intended to run at 30 frames per second on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, rather than the 60 that ''Rage'' was targeting.<ref name=1up-new>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/doom-game-announced|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714131428/http://www.1up.com/news/doom-game-announced|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 14, 2012|title=Next ''Doom'' Game Announced|first=Philip|last=Kollar|work=[[1UP.com|1UP]]|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2016}}</ref> It was planned to run at 60 frames per second on Windows with state-of-the-art hardware.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/quakecon_08_quake_live_will_have_no_mod_support_doom_4_run_60hz_pc_locked_30hz_consoles | title=QuakeCon 08: Quake Live Will Have No Mod Support; Doom 4 to Run at 60Hz on PC, Locked at 30Hz for Consoles |date=July 31, 2008 |first=Norman|last=Chan|publisher=[[Maximum PC]]|accessdate=November 30, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628192231/http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/quakecon_08_quake_live_will_have_no_mod_support_doom_4_run_60hz_pc_locked_30hz_consoles|archivedate=June 28, 2011}}</ref> Carmack also stated that the game was running on the [[id Tech 5]] game engine.<ref name=1up-new/> In 2009, he revealed that the multiplayer component was being developed separately and would run at 60 frames per second.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_Ge-35Ld70 | title=John Carmack on Rage |date=July 2009 |work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=CD-Action |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref> He stated in 2011 that \"you can't have 30 guys crawling all over you at 60 frames per second at this graphics technology level because it's painful.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6318725/e3-2011-john-carmack-talks-wii-u-playstation-vita-and-next-gen-rage |title=E3 2011: John Carmack talks Wii U, PlayStation Vita, and next-gen Rage|date=June 9, 2011|first=Tor|last=Thorsen|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=June 9, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128080308/http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6318725/e3-2011-john-carmack-talks-wii-u-playstation-vita-and-next-gen-rage|archivedate=January 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, Hollenshead said that ''Doom 4'' was \"deep in development\".

whereas criticism was predominantly toward the multiplayer mode. Many critics believed that ''Doom'' was a successful return to form for the series. Following the wide release, the game received scores of 85/100 for PC and PlayStation 4 and 87/100 for the Xbox One on [[Metacritic]]. The Nintendo Switch edition, released in November 2017, was also positively received by professional reviewers, garnering a 79/100 on Metacritic: most reviewers praised the job of the port, also conceding that it's not as well-optimized as it was for previous consoles. The final version of the game received very positive reviews from users on [[Steam (service)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-18-the-new-doom-turns-around-steam-user-reviews|title=The new Doom campaign turns around Steam user reviews|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}</ref> It also received praise from other video game creators, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-designer-cliff-bleszinski-praises-new/1100-6439815/|title=Gears of War Designer Cliff Bleszinski Praises New Doom, But Has One Criticism|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 16, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref> and [[Greg Kasavin]], who said that the game answers questions that other modern shooters do not answer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/why-is-the-new-doom-so-important-it-asks-the-questions-other-shooters-aren-t-argues-supergiant-dev/0220857|title=Why is the new Doom so important?

Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun favorably compared ''Doom'' to the 2014 game ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]'', also published by Bethesda, but added that ''Doom''{{'}}s quality surpassed that of ''Wolfenstein'' due to its fast pace and solid gunplay.<ref name=\"rockpapershotgun\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/16/doom-review-pc/|title=Wot I Think: DOOM (Singleplayer)|last=Meer|first=Alec|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=May 16, 2016|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}</ref> Peter Brown of [[GameSpot]] praised single-player because he thought that the reboot captured the spirits of the older games, while refining them with modern elements. Brown also drew attention toward the soundtrack, calling it \"impactful\".<ref name=\"gamespotreview\"/> Gary Jones in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' felt that the game had one of the best single-player campaigns made for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, successfully combining the traditional gameplay of the series with a very fast pace.<ref name=dereview>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/672439/DOOM-Review-Xbox-One-Bethesda-PS4|title=''DOOM'' Review: The best single-player FPS action on Xbox One and PS4|last=Jones|first=Gary|work=[[Daily Express]]|publisher=[[Express Newspapers]]|date=May 21, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}</ref> Mike Henriquez of [[Game Revolution]] favored the visual and artistic design, calling it \"top-notch\".<ref name=\"gamerevreview\"/> Sam White in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commended id Software for ''Doom''{{'}}s delivery of performance on all platforms and praised the weapon design for ''Doom''{{'}}s continuity to introduce new weapons at a perfect speed so that gamers always play with something new and exciting.<ref name=ttreview>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/doom-review/|title=''Doom'' is a fiendishly moreish, impeccably refined shooter - review|first=Sam|last=White|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|date=May 23, 2016|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]{{'}}s Arthur Gies remarked positively upon the exploration for collectables and secrets, and their relevance to the new upgrade feature, but he was critical of instances where the game would lock away sections of a level without warning.<ref name=\"polygonreview\"/> Zack Furniss of [[Destructoid]] was originally skeptical regarding the \"glory kills\" feature, as were other critics, fearing that they might distract from the fast-paced gameplay. He ultimately considered them to fit well in the flow of gameplay that keeps players in the middle of combat without a slowed pace.<ref name=\"destructoidreview\"/> [[Giant Bomb]]{{'}}s Brad Shoemaker felt that the glory kills' generating small amounts of health and armor \"makes them an essential part of the give-and-take of ''Doom''{{'}}s super fast combat; do you dart into the fray for a glory kill to get a little health back, and risk getting mobbed by all the other enemies around?\"<ref name=\"giantbombreview\"/> Conversely, Kyle Orland of [[Ars Technica]] felt that the glory kills' briefly taking control away from the player can easily disorient players or misposition them, finding them hard to ignore for players that choose not to use them.<ref name=\"arstechreview\">{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/|title=Doom (2016) single-player review: Back to basics|last=Orland|first=Kyle|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe SnapMap mode was also positively received with ''Hardcore Gamer''{{'s}} Jordan Helm's noting the possibilities yet simplicity with its use, calling it an \"admirable feat\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/05/17/review-doom/207490/|title=Doom Review (PS4)|last=Helm|first=Jordan|work=Hardcore Gamer|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Matt Peckham of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' thought that the mode added further value to the overall package of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/4336416/doom-review/|title=Review: The New \u2018Doom\u2019 Serves Up a Brew of Nostalgia and Carnage|last=Peckham|first=Matt|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Matt Bertz of ''[[Game Informer]]'' commented upon the accessibility but criticized the lack of diverse settings and possible limitations when compared to a traditional community-based [[mod (video games)|mod]].<ref name=\"gameinformerreview\"/> James Davenport of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' compared it to the modification in the original games, which he views as one of the primary reasons why ''Doom'' is still a recognizable title.

IGN's Joab Gilory was less favorable toward the multiplayer, calling the overall game \"a tale of two very different shooters\", stating that multiplayer did not live up to the standard set by the single-player components and would not satisfy players.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> Simon Miller of ''VideoGamer.com'' found the multiplayer to be only all right.<ref name=\"videogamer.comreview\"/> Matt Buchholtz of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'' criticized what he felt was the network's poor handling of latency, and failing to register on-target shots as hits in some instances while not in others.<ref name=\"egmreview\"/> Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of [[Eurogamer]] singled out the \"Warpath\" multiplayer mode as the most interesting of the match type, describing it as \"memorable\", while

name=RSC.org-Nurofen/>  Introduced in 1983, the Nurofen brand was acquired following Reckitt Benckiser's acquisition of [[Boots Healthcare]] in 2005.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The brand is primarily marketed and sold in the United Kingdom,<ref name=RSC.org-Nurofen/> other parts of Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  In 2016 it was the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medication sold in Great Britain, with sales of \u00a3116.8 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=A breakdown of the over-the-counter medicines market in Britain in 2016|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20202662.article|accessdate=29 May 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n[[File:Nurofen tablets on pharmacy shelf.jpg|thumb|Boxes of Nurofen on a pharmacy shelf]]\nThere are 11 variants of Nurofen, all of which contain ibuprofen as an active ingredient.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.Nurofen.com|title=Nurofen website|publisher=Nurofen.com|date= |accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>  The ibuprofen is variously formulated as the [[free acid]], or the [[lysine]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]].  For oral formulations, i.e., taken by mouth, it is available in the conventional solid round tablet, a torpedo-shaped solid caplet, or may alternatively be in the form of a soft gel cap.  It is also available as a topical gel, which is applied directly to the surface of the skin.<ref name=RSC.org-NurofenGel/>  In some cases these are marketed as being useful for treating specific types of pain; such as [[back pain]] or [[period pain]].  The primary difference among the various formulations is speed and duration of ibuprofen absorption.  According to the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (UK MHRA), the form of ibuprofen in 'Nurofen Tension Headache' ([[ibuprofen lysine]]) is absorbed nearly twice as fast as the form in 'Nurofen Period Pain' (ibuprofen free acid), with the former reaching peak blood concentrations in 38&nbsp;minutes, compared to 80&nbsp;minutes for the latter.<ref name=MHRA>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/l-unit1/documents/websiteresources/con2023564.pdf|title=MHRA Approval Summary|format=pdf|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome variants of Nurofen contain additional active ingredients; for example, 'Nurofen Cold & Flu' contains the non-[[sedation|sedating]] [[decongestant]] [[pseudoephedrine]].  Others are advertised as being targeted for specific pain types, for example [[Menstrual pain|period pain]].<ref name=RSC.org-Nurofen/>\n\n====Nurofen Plus====\nNurofen Plus is a pain relief medication based on [[codeine]] and [[ibuprofen]].<ref name=\"MJA\">[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/188_01_070108/dut10966_fm.html The Medical Journal of Australia].

Nurofen Plus is the only product in the Nurofen range that contains codeine.\n\nThe original Nurofen Plus tablet was manufactured in two equal parts, joined together, and then coated.  One part would contain the 12.8&nbsp;mg of codeine phosphate, and the other part contained 200&nbsp;mg of ibuprofen.  The tablets could be forcefully split into their two constituent active ingredients; for recreational use of codeine.

McGuire cost the manufacturers \u00a32.4m, and saved himself \u00a37, when he put anti-psychotic drugs in empty packets of the painkiller.  The scheme involved asking for Nurofen Plus at a pharmacy counter, and then attempting to pay for it with a card he knew would be declined.

name=RSC.org-Nurofen/>  Introduced in 1983, the Nurofen brand was acquired following Reckitt Benckiser's acquisition of [[Boots Healthcare]] in 2005.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The brand is primarily marketed and sold in the United Kingdom,<ref name=RSC.org-Nurofen/> other parts of Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  In 2016 it was the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medication sold in Great Britain, with sales of \u00a3116.8 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=A breakdown of the over-the-counter medicines market in Britain in 2016|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20202662.article|accessdate=29 May 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n[[File:Nurofen tablets on pharmacy shelf.jpg|thumb|Boxes of Nurofen on a pharmacy shelf]]\nThere are 11 variants of Nurofen, all of which contain ibuprofen as an active ingredient.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.Nurofen.com|title=Nurofen website|publisher=Nurofen.com|date= |accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>  The ibuprofen is variously formulated as the [[free acid]], or the [[lysine]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]].  For oral formulations, i.e., taken by mouth, it is available in the conventional solid round tablet, a torpedo-shaped solid caplet, or may alternatively be in the form of a soft gel cap.  It is also available as a topical gel, which is applied directly to the surface of the skin.<ref name=RSC.org-NurofenGel/>  In some cases these are marketed as being useful for treating specific types of pain; such as [[back pain]] or [[period pain]].  The primary difference among the various formulations is speed and duration of ibuprofen absorption.  According to the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (UK MHRA), the form of ibuprofen in 'Nurofen Tension Headache' ([[ibuprofen lysine]]) is absorbed nearly twice as fast as the form in 'Nurofen Period Pain' (ibuprofen free acid), with the former reaching peak blood concentrations in 38&nbsp;minutes, compared to 80&nbsp;minutes for the latter.<ref name=MHRA>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/l-unit1/documents/websiteresources/con2023564.pdf|title=MHRA Approval Summary|format=pdf|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome variants of Nurofen contain additional active ingredients; for example, 'Nurofen Cold & Flu' contains the non-[[sedation|sedating]] [[decongestant]] [[pseudoephedrine]].  Others are advertised as being targeted for specific pain types, for example [[Menstrual pain|period pain]].<ref name=RSC.org-Nurofen/>\n\n====Nurofen Plus====\nNurofen Plus is a pain relief medication based on [[codeine]] and [[ibuprofen]].<ref name=\"MJA\">[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/188_01_070108/dut10966_fm.html The Medical Journal of Australia].

Nurofen Plus is the only product in the Nurofen range that contains codeine.\n\nThe original Nurofen Plus tablet was manufactured in two equal parts, joined together, and then coated.  One part would contain the 12.8&nbsp;mg of codeine phosphate, and the other part contained 200&nbsp;mg of ibuprofen.  The tablets could be forcefully split into their two constituent active ingredients; for recreational use of codeine.  Such drugs have a potential for misuse because they are available freely to the public.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12880547|year=2003|last1=Chetty|first1=R|last2=Baoku|first2=Y|last3=Mildner|first3=R|last4=Banerjee|first4=A|last5=Vallance|first5=D|last6=Haddon|first6=A|last7=Labib|first7=M|title=Severe hypokalaemia and weakness due to Nurofen misuse|volume=40|issue=Pt 4|pages=422\u20133|doi=10.1258/000456303766477101|journal=Annals of Clinical Biochemistry}}</ref>\n\n===2011 product recall===\nOn 25 August 2011, it was reported that several packs of Nurofen Plus were found to contain [[Quetiapine|Seroquel XR]] \u2014 an [[anti-psychotic]] drug used to treat [[schizophrenia]] \u2014 in [[Boots UK|Boots]] stores across London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bellenews.com/2011/08/26/world/nurofen-sabotaged-across-london/|title=Nurofen \"sabotaged\" across London|publisher=Bellenews.com|date=26 August 2011|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper|author=Jo Adetunji|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/aug/26/nurofen-plus-recalled-sabotage|title=Nurofen Plus recalled as drug manufacturer suspects sabotage|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|date=27 August 2011|accessdate=17 November 2011|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8726297/Nurofen-Plus-recalled-amid-sabotage-fears.html|title=Nurofen Plus recalled amid sabotage fears|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|date=26 August 2011|accessdate=17 November 2011|location=London}}</ref>  The next day, a safety alert was issued by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA).  Pharmacists were told to check each package of Nurofen Plus to look for anti-psychotic drugs. Three batches of Nurofen Plus were affected by the alert.  Reckitt Benckiser, manufacturer of Nurofen Plus, said that it did not know where the drugs had been switched.  The product was re-released in October in cellophane-sealed packs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15106529|title=Nurofen Plus goes back on sale in tamper-proof packs|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=29 September 2011|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n\n<!-- CLEAR copyright violation from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen_brand_names#Nurofen_Plus\nI don't have time, was looking it up and found it, please clean up\n\nChristopher McGuire was later found guilty of one count of contaminating goods, and two of administering a noxious substance, and jailed for 18 months.  McGuire cost the manufacturers \u00a32.4m, and saved himself \u00a37, when he put anti-psychotic drugs in empty packets of the painkiller.  The scheme involved asking for Nurofen Plus at a pharmacy counter, and then attempting to pay for it with a card he knew would be declined.  This created a sufficient distraction for McGuire to discreetly swap the contaminated packet for the fresh one and walk away.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18203634|title=Nurofen Plus tampering: Christopher McGuire jailed|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n-->\n\n===Misleading advertising===\n====Australia====\nIn 2010, the Australian consumer advocate [[Choice (Australian consumer organisation)|Choice]] awarded Nurofen a \"Shonky award\" for charging more for \"targeted\" products, all of which had the same active ingredient as the base product.<ref>http://classic.choice.com.au/shonkyaward/hall-of-shame/shonkys-2010/shonky-2010-nurofen.aspx{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the Australian [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] upheld a complaint that Nurofen's advertising of different products for different pain was \"misleading or likely to be misleading\", and ordered that \"any representation that refers to two or more Nurofen products that contain equivalent quantities of ibuprofen and include the same product specific indications on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods must clearly indicate, in the body of the advertisement, that the two products can be used for the same purposes and are interchangeable (or words to that effect)\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/advert-complaint/nurofen-reckitt-benckiser-australia-pty-ltd-complaints-no-2012-08-010-and-2012-10-024|title=Nurofen - Reckitt Benckiser (Australia)|date=9 May 2014|work=tga.gov.au}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, the Australian consumer affairs television programme ''[[The Checkout]]'' ran a story about Nurofen's claims about targeting specific pain.
