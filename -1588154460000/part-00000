The gills of some species, such as [[hermit crab]]s, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large [[surface area]] to the external environment. '''Branchia''' (pl. branchiae) is the zoologists' name for gills (from Ancient Greek {{linktext|\u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03b1}}).\n\nWith the exception of some aquatic [[insect]]s, the filaments and lamellae (folds) contain [[blood]] or [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]], from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls. The blood carries oxygen to other parts of the body. Carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water. Gills or gill-like organs, located in different parts of the body, are found in various groups of aquatic animals, including [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s, insects, fish, and [[amphibian]]s. [[Semiaquatic|Semiterrestrial]] marine animals such as [[crab]]s and [[mudskipper]]s have gill chambers in which they store water, enabling them to use the dissolved oxygen when they are on land.\n\n== History ==\n[[Galen]] observed that fish had multitudes of openings (''foramina''), big enough to admit gases, but too fine to give passage to water. [[Pliny the Elder]] held that fish respired by their gills, but observed that [[Aristotle]] was of another opinion.<ref>{{1728}}</ref> The word ''branchia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03b1}}, \"gills\", plural of {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}} (in singular, meaning a [[fin]]).<ref>\"Branchia\". ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press. 2nd Ed. 1989.</ref>\n\n==Function==\nMany microscopic aquatic animals, and some larger but inactive ones, can absorb sufficient oxygen through the entire surface of their bodies, and so can respire adequately without gills. However, more complex or more active aquatic organisms usually require a gill or gills. Many invertebrates, and even amphibians, use both the body surface and gills for gaseous exchange.<ref name=Dorit>{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

The delicate nature of the gills is possible because the surrounding water provides support. The blood or other body fluid must be in intimate contact with the respiratory surface for ease of diffusion.<ref name=Dorit/>\n\nA high surface area is crucial to the [[gas exchange]] of aquatic organisms, as water contains only a small fraction of the [[dissolved oxygen]] that [[air]] does. A [[cubic meter]] of air contains about 250 [[grams]] of oxygen at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]]. The concentration of oxygen in water is lower than in air and it diffuses more slowly.

In fish and some molluscs, the efficiency of the gills is greatly enhanced by a [[countercurrent exchange]] mechanism in which the water passes over the gills in the opposite direction to the flow of blood through them.

Adjacent slits are separated by a [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] gill arch from which projects a cartilaginous '''gill ray'''. This gill ray is the support for the sheet-like interbranchial [[septum]], which the individual lamellae of the gills lie on either side of. The base of the arch may also support [[gill raker]]s, projections into the pharyngeal cavity that help to prevent large pieces of debris from damaging the delicate gills.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=[[Alfred Romer|Romer, Alfred Sherwood]]|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977|title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International|location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 316\u2013327|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>\n\nA smaller opening, the [[Spiracle (vertebrates)|spiracle]], lies in the back of the first [[gill slit]]. This bears a small '''pseudobranch''' that resembles a gill in structure, but only receives blood already oxygenated by the true gills.<ref name=VB/> The spiracle is thought to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the ear opening in [[higher vertebrates]].<ref>Laurin M. (1998): The importance of global parsimony and historical bias in understanding tetrapod evolution. Part I-systematics, middle ear evolution, and jaw suspension. ''Annales des Sciences Naturelles, Zoologie, Paris'', 13e S\u00e9rie 19: pp 1-42.</ref>\n\nMost sharks rely on ram ventilation, forcing water into the mouth and over the gills by rapidly swimming forward. In slow-moving or bottom-dwelling species, especially among skates and rays, the spiracle may be enlarged, and the fish breathes by sucking water through this opening, instead of through the mouth.<ref name=VB/>\n\n[[Chimaera]]s differ from other cartilagenous fish, having lost both the spiracle and the fifth gill slit. The remaining slits are covered by an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]], developed from the septum of the gill arch in front of the first gill.<ref name=VB/>\n\n====Bony fish====\n[[File:Tuna Gills in Situ cut.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The red gills inside a detached [[tuna]] head (viewed from behind)]]\nIn [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the gills lie in a branchial chamber covered by a bony operculum. The great majority of bony fish species have five pairs of gills, although a few have lost some over the course of evolution. The operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills, so bony fish do not have to rely on ram ventilation (and hence near constant motion) to breathe. Valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping.<ref name=VB/>\n\nThe gill arches of bony fish typically have no septum, so the gills alone project from the arch, supported by individual gill rays. Some species retain gill rakers. Though all but the most primitive bony fish lack spiracles, the pseudobranch associated with them often remains, being located at the base of the operculum. This is, however, often greatly reduced, consisting of a small mass of cells without any remaining gill-like structure.<ref name=VB/>\n\nMarine [[teleost]]s also use their gills to excrete osmolytes (e.g. Na\u207a, Cl<sup>-</sup>). The gills' large surface area tends to create a problem for fish that seek to regulate the [[osmolarity]] of their internal fluids.

The gills of some species, such as [[hermit crab]]s, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large [[surface area]] to the external environment. '''Branchia''' (pl. branchiae) is the zoologists' name for gills (from Ancient Greek {{linktext|\u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03b1}}).\n\nWith the exception of some aquatic [[insect]]s, the filaments and lamellae (folds) contain [[blood]] or [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]], from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls. The blood carries oxygen to other parts of the body. Carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water. Gills or gill-like organs, located in different parts of the body, are found in various groups of aquatic animals, including [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s, insects, fish, and [[amphibian]]s. [[Semiaquatic|Semiterrestrial]] marine animals such as [[crab]]s and [[mudskipper]]s have gill chambers in which they store water, enabling them to use the dissolved oxygen when they are on land.\n\n== History ==\n[[Galen]] observed that fish had multitudes of openings (''foramina''), big enough to admit gases, but too fine to give passage to water. [[Pliny the Elder]] held that fish respired by their gills, but observed that [[Aristotle]] was of another opinion.<ref>{{1728}}</ref> The word ''branchia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03b1}}, \"gills\", plural of {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}} (in singular, meaning a [[fin]]).<ref>\"Branchia\".

However, more complex or more active aquatic organisms usually require a gill or gills. Many invertebrates, and even amphibians, use both the body surface and gills for gaseous exchange.<ref name=Dorit>{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

The delicate nature of the gills is possible because the surrounding water provides support. The blood or other body fluid must be in intimate contact with the respiratory surface for ease of diffusion.<ref name=Dorit/>\n\nA high surface area is crucial to the [[gas exchange]] of aquatic organisms, as water contains only a small fraction of the [[dissolved oxygen]] that [[air]] does. A [[cubic meter]] of air contains about 250 [[grams]] of oxygen at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]]. The concentration of oxygen in water is lower than in air and it diffuses more slowly.

In fish and some molluscs, the efficiency of the gills is greatly enhanced by a [[countercurrent exchange]] mechanism in which the water passes over the gills in the opposite direction to the flow of blood through them.

This gill ray is the support for the sheet-like interbranchial [[septum]], which the individual lamellae of the gills lie on either side of.

In slow-moving or bottom-dwelling species, especially among skates and rays, the spiracle may be enlarged, and the fish breathes by sucking water through this opening, instead of through the mouth.<ref name=VB/>\n\n[[Chimaera]]s differ from other cartilagenous fish, having lost both the spiracle and the fifth gill slit. The remaining slits are covered by an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]], developed from the septum of the gill arch in front of the first gill.<ref name=VB/>\n\n====Bony fish====\n[[File:Tuna Gills in Situ cut.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The red gills inside a detached [[tuna]] head (viewed from behind)]]\nIn [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the gills lie in a branchial chamber covered by a bony operculum. The great majority of bony fish species have five pairs of gills, although a few have lost some over the course of evolution. The operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills, so bony fish do not have to rely on ram ventilation (and hence near constant motion) to breathe. Valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping.<ref name=VB/>\n\nThe gill arches of bony fish typically have no septum, so the gills alone project from the arch, supported by individual gill rays. Some species retain gill rakers. Though all but the most primitive bony fish lack spiracles, the pseudobranch associated with them often remains, being located at the base of the operculum. This is, however, often greatly reduced, consisting of a small mass of cells without any remaining gill-like structure.<ref name=VB/>\n\nMarine [[teleost]]s also use their gills to excrete osmolytes (e.g. Na\u207a, Cl<sup>-</sup>).
