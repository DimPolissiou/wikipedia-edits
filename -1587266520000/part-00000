Antsiranana is the capital of [[Diana Region]]. It had an estimated population of 115,015 in 2013.<ref>Institut National de la Statistique, Antananarivo.</ref>\n\n==History== \nThe bay and city originally used the name Diego-Suarez, named after [[Diogo Soares]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] navigator who visited the bay in 1543\u201344.<ref>Pierre Van Den Boogaerde, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=I_S1D8cnTiEC&pg=PA40&dq=Soares+madagascar&hl=ca&ei=iFvuS67LEtDd-QayvKzeBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Soares%20madagascar&f=false Shipwrecks of Madagascar]'', p.40</ref>\n\nIn the 1880s, the [[Headlands and bays|bay]] was coveted by [[France]], which desired it as a [[coaling station]] for [[steamship]]s. After the first [[Franco-Hova War]], Queen [[Ranavalona III of Madagascar|Ranavalona III]] signed a treaty on December 17, 1885 granting France a protectorate over the bay and surrounding territory, as well as the islands of [[Nosy-Be]] and [[Ste. Marie de Madagascar]].\n\nThe colony's administration was subsumed into that of Madagascar in 1896. The Second Pacific Squadron of [[Imperial Russia]] anchored and was resupplied at Diego-Suarez on its way to the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905.\n\n[[File:Ships in harbour at Diego Suarez.jpg|thumb|left|Warships and British merchant ships in the Antsiranana harbour after the [[Vichy France|French]] had surrendered on 13 May 1942.]]\n\nIn 1942, Diego-Su\u00e1rez was the primary objective of [[Operation Ironclad|Operation ''Ironclad'']], the starting point of the Allied invasion and capture of [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]]. The Allies were concerned that [[Japan]] would pressure [[Vichy France]] into granting use of Madagascar, as they had with [[French Indo-China]] during the previous year, and determined that the island should not be made a base for the interception of Allied shipping. Diego-Suarez, with its superb harbour and a concentration of government officials, was selected as the initial invasion point. The Japanese responded with an attack by midget submarines on the British naval forces in the harbour, damaging the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Ramillies|07|6}} and sinking the oil tanker ''British Loyalty''.<ref>Wilson, Michael; (2000), A Submariners War; Stroud, Tempus. {{ISBN|0-7524-3276-1}}</ref>\n\nFrance continued to operate a military base in the city following Malagasy independence in 1960.  Between 1973 and 1975, French forces were withdrawn.\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Climate ===\n<div style=\"width:70%\">\n{{Weather box \n|location = Antsiranana (1961\u20131990, extremes 1941\u2013present)\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|temperature colour = \n|Jan record high C = 36.3\n|Feb record high C = 34.6\n|Mar record high C = 34.8\n|Apr record high C = 35.0\n|May record high C = 33.6\n|Jun record high C = 33.0\n|Jul record high C = 33.0\n|Aug record high C = 33.0\n|Sep record high C = 33.0\n|Oct record high C = 37.0\n|Nov record high C = 38.0\n|Dec record high C = 39.0\n|year record high C = 39.0\n|Jan high C = 30.2\n|Feb high C = 30.2\n|Mar high C = 30.6\n|Apr high C = 31.0\n|May high C = 30.4\n|Jun high C = 29.3\n|Jul high C = 28.7\n|Aug high C = 28.7\n|Sep high C = 29.5\n|Oct high C = 30.5\n|Nov high C = 31.5\n|Dec high C = 31.4\n|year high C = 30.2\n|Jan mean C = 26.0\n|Feb mean C = 26.0\n|Mar mean C = 26.2\n|Apr mean C = 26.3\n|May mean C = 25.4\n|Jun mean C = 24.1\n|Jul mean C = 23.5\n|Aug mean C = 23.4\n|Sep mean C = 24.1\n|Oct mean C = 25.2\n|Nov mean C = 26.3\n|Dec mean C = 26.5\n|year mean C = 25.2\n|Jan low C = 22.8\n|Feb low C = 22.7\n|Mar low C = 22.9\n|Apr low C = 22.6\n|May low C = 21.6\n|Jun low C = 20.2\n|Jul low C = 19.6\n|Aug low C = 19.4\n|Sep low C = 20.0\n|Oct low C = 21.2\n|Nov low C = 22.5\n|Dec low C = 22.9\n|year low C = 21.5\n|Jan record low C = 17.0\n|Feb record low C = 16.6\n|Mar record low C = 14.0\n|Apr record low C = 17.8\n|May record low C = 16.2\n|Jun record low C = 13.5\n|Jul record low C = 13.8\n|Aug record low C = 13.0\n|Sep record low C = 14.7\n|Oct record low C = 16.3\n|Nov record low C = 18.2\n|Dec record low C = 18.7\n|year record low C = 13.0\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 337.5\n|Feb rain mm = 305.8\n|Mar rain mm = 179.4\n|Apr rain mm = 52.3\n|May rain mm = 13.4\n|Jun rain mm = 19.1\n|Jul rain mm = 19.0\n|Aug rain mm = 18.7\n|Sep rain mm = 8.8\n|Oct rain mm = 17.4\n|Nov rain mm = 54.6\n|Dec rain mm = 170.8\n|year rain mm = 1196.8\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 16\n|Feb precipitation days = 15\n|Mar precipitation days = 12\n|Apr precipitation days = 6\n|May precipitation days = 4\n|Jun precipitation days = 3\n|Jul precipitation days = 4\n|Aug precipitation days = 4\n|Sep precipitation days = 2\n|Oct precipitation days = 3\n|Nov precipitation days = 5\n|Dec precipitation days = 10\n|year precipitation days = 84\n|Jan humidity = 79\n|Feb humidity = 92\n|Mar humidity = 81\n|Apr humidity = 76\n|May humidity = 70\n|Jun humidity = 68\n|Jul humidity = 66\n|Aug humidity = 66\n|Sep humidity = 66\n|Oct humidity = 65\n|Nov humidity = 71\n|Dec humidity = 76\n|year humidity = 72\n|Jan sun = 189.2\n|Feb sun = 170.0\n|Mar sun = 214.9\n|Apr sun = 256.4\n|May sun = 284.8\n|Jun sun = 256.5\n|Jul sun = 273.1\n|Aug sun = 283.6\n|Sep sun = 293.3\n|Oct sun = 306.8\n|Nov sun = 281.5\n|Dec sun = 228.9\n|year sun = 3039.0\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG__I/MG/67009.TXT\n| title = Diego\u2013Suarez/Antsir (Antsiranana) Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = October 19, 2015}}</ref>\n|source 2 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (humidity, 1951\u20131967),<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_670090_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Antsiranana (Di\u00e9go-Suarez) / Madagaskar\n| work = Baseline climate means (1961-1990) from stations all over the world\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| language = German\n| accessdate = 10 June 2016}}</ref> Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)<ref name = meteoclimat>\n{{cite web \n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=773\n| title = Station Antsiranana \n| publisher = Meteo Climat \n|language = French \n| accessdate = 10 June 2016}}</ref>\n|date=October 2015\n}}</div>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Old container vsl.jpg|thumb|Container ship in Antsiranana harbour]]\nAntsiranana is situated on [[Antsiranana Bay]], one of the largest deep-water harbours in the [[Indian Ocean]], but the remote location, and, until recently, a bad road to the south, rendered it unimportant for freight traffic.

'''Diego-Suarez''' prior to 1975, is a city in the far north of [[Madagascar]]. Antsiranana is the capital of [[Diana Region]]. It had an estimated population of 115,015 in 2013.<ref>Institut National de la Statistique, Antananarivo.</ref>\n\n==History== \nThe bay and city originally used the name Diego-Suarez, named after [[Diogo Soares]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] navigator who visited the bay in 1543\u201344.<ref>Pierre Van Den Boogaerde, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=I_S1D8cnTiEC&pg=PA40&dq=Soares+madagascar&hl=ca&ei=iFvuS67LEtDd-QayvKzeBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Soares%20madagascar&f=false Shipwrecks of Madagascar]'', p.40</ref>\n\nIn the 1880s, the [[Headlands and bays|bay]] was coveted by [[France]], which desired it as a [[coaling station]] for [[steamship]]s. After the first [[Franco-Hova War]], Queen [[Ranavalona III of Madagascar|Ranavalona III]] signed a treaty on December 17, 1885 granting France a protectorate over the bay and surrounding territory, as well as the islands of [[Nosy-Be]] and [[Ste. Marie de Madagascar]].\n\nThe colony's administration was subsumed into that of Madagascar in 1896. The Second Pacific Squadron of [[Imperial Russia]] anchored and was resupplied at Diego-Suarez on its way to the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905.\n\n[[File:Ships in harbour at Diego Suarez.jpg|thumb|left|Warships and British merchant ships in the Antsiranana harbour after the [[Vichy France|French]] had surrendered on 13 May 1942.]]\n\nIn 1942, Diego-Su\u00e1rez was the primary objective of [[Operation Ironclad|Operation ''Ironclad'']], the starting point of the Allied invasion and capture of [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]]. The Allies were concerned that [[Japan]] would pressure [[Vichy France]] into granting use of Madagascar, as they had with [[French Indo-China]] during the previous year, and determined that the island should not be made a base for the interception of Allied shipping. Diego-Suarez, with its superb harbour and a concentration of government officials, was selected as the initial invasion point. The Japanese responded with an attack by midget submarines on the British naval forces in the harbour, damaging the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Ramillies|07|6}} and sinking the oil tanker ''British Loyalty''.<ref>Wilson, Michael; (2000), A Submariners War; Stroud, Tempus. {{ISBN|0-7524-3276-1}}</ref>\n\nFrance continued to operate a military base in the city following Malagasy independence in 1960.  Between 1973 and 1975, French forces were withdrawn.\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Climate ===\n<div style=\"width:70%\">\n{{Weather box \n|location = Antsiranana (1961\u20131990, extremes 1941\u2013present)\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|temperature colour = \n|Jan record high C = 36.3\n|Feb record high C = 34.6\n|Mar record high C = 34.8\n|Apr record high C = 35.0\n|May record high C = 33.6\n|Jun record high C = 33.0\n|Jul record high C = 33.0\n|Aug record high C = 33.0\n|Sep record high C = 33.0\n|Oct record high C = 37.0\n|Nov record high C = 38.0\n|Dec record high C = 39.0\n|year record high C = 39.0\n|Jan high C = 30.2\n|Feb high C = 30.2\n|Mar high C = 30.6\n|Apr high C = 31.0\n|May high C = 30.4\n|Jun high C = 29.3\n|Jul high C = 28.7\n|Aug high C = 28.7\n|Sep high C = 29.5\n|Oct high C = 30.5\n|Nov high C = 31.5\n|Dec high C = 31.4\n|year high C = 30.2\n|Jan mean C = 26.0\n|Feb mean C = 26.0\n|Mar mean C = 26.2\n|Apr mean C = 26.3\n|May mean C = 25.4\n|Jun mean C = 24.1\n|Jul mean C = 23.5\n|Aug mean C = 23.4\n|Sep mean C = 24.1\n|Oct mean C = 25.2\n|Nov mean C = 26.3\n|Dec mean C = 26.5\n|year mean C = 25.2\n|Jan low C = 22.8\n|Feb low C = 22.7\n|Mar low C = 22.9\n|Apr low C = 22.6\n|May low C = 21.6\n|Jun low C = 20.2\n|Jul low C = 19.6\n|Aug low C = 19.4\n|Sep low C = 20.0\n|Oct low C = 21.2\n|Nov low C = 22.5\n|Dec low C = 22.9\n|year low C = 21.5\n|Jan record low C = 17.0\n|Feb record low C = 16.6\n|Mar record low C = 14.0\n|Apr record low C = 17.8\n|May record low C = 16.2\n|Jun record low C = 13.5\n|Jul record low C = 13.8\n|Aug record low C = 13.0\n|Sep record low C = 14.7\n|Oct record low C = 16.3\n|Nov record low C = 18.2\n|Dec record low C = 18.7\n|year record low C = 13.0\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 337.5\n|Feb rain mm = 305.8\n|Mar rain mm = 179.4\n|Apr rain mm = 52.3\n|May rain mm = 13.4\n|Jun rain mm = 19.1\n|Jul rain mm = 19.0\n|Aug rain mm = 18.7\n|Sep rain mm = 8.8\n|Oct rain mm = 17.4\n|Nov rain mm = 54.6\n|Dec rain mm = 170.8\n|year rain mm = 1196.8\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 16\n|Feb precipitation days = 15\n|Mar precipitation days = 12\n|Apr precipitation days = 6\n|May precipitation days = 4\n|Jun precipitation days = 3\n|Jul precipitation days = 4\n|Aug precipitation days = 4\n|Sep precipitation days = 2\n|Oct precipitation days = 3\n|Nov precipitation days = 5\n|Dec precipitation days = 10\n|year precipitation days = 84\n|Jan humidity = 79\n|Feb humidity = 92\n|Mar humidity = 81\n|Apr humidity = 76\n|May humidity = 70\n|Jun humidity = 68\n|Jul humidity = 66\n|Aug humidity = 66\n|Sep humidity = 66\n|Oct humidity = 65\n|Nov humidity = 71\n|Dec humidity = 76\n|year humidity = 72\n|Jan sun = 189.2\n|Feb sun = 170.0\n|Mar sun = 214.9\n|Apr sun = 256.4\n|May sun = 284.8\n|Jun sun = 256.5\n|Jul sun = 273.1\n|Aug sun = 283.6\n|Sep sun = 293.3\n|Oct sun = 306.8\n|Nov sun = 281.5\n|Dec sun = 228.9\n|year sun = 3039.0\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG__I/MG/67009.TXT\n| title = Diego\u2013Suarez/Antsir (Antsiranana) Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = October 19, 2015}}</ref>\n|source 2 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (humidity, 1951\u20131967),<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_670090_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Antsiranana (Di\u00e9go-Suarez) / Madagaskar\n| work = Baseline climate means (1961-1990) from stations all over the world\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| language = German\n| accessdate = 10 June 2016}}</ref> Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)<ref name = meteoclimat>\n{{cite web \n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=773\n| title = Station Antsiranana \n| publisher = Meteo Climat \n|language = French \n| accessdate = 10 June 2016}}</ref>\n|date=October 2015\n}}</div>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Old container vsl.jpg|thumb|Container ship in Antsiranana harbour]]\nAntsiranana is situated on [[Antsiranana Bay]], one of the largest deep-water harbours in the [[Indian Ocean]], but the remote location, and, until recently, a bad road to the south, rendered it unimportant for freight traffic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

In 1996 he initiated the first attempt at reconstruction, with the launch of a fund. The vision was that the new palace would be home to galleries, museums and cafes or upstairs apartments and offices.

The square consists of the area around [[St. Nicholas' Church, Potsdam|St. Nicholas' Church]]. Today the term refers in particular to the area directly in front of the church. It is bordered by several prestigious historical buildings.\n\n== History ==\nThe [[City Palace, Potsdam|City Palace]] was originally erected in 1666 under the order of [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]]. At the time the spot was part of a castle grounds. The [[Old City Hall, Potsdam|Old City Hall]] was developed between 1753\u20131755 under the direction of architects [[Jan Bouman]] and [[Carl Ludwig Hildebrant]]. The marble obelisk in front of the church was added in 1753, following a design by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]], in order to emphasize the Roman character of the square. The most famous building in the square, [[St. Nicholas' Church, Potsdam|St. Nicholas' Church]], was erected from 1830\u20131837 as a centrally-planned building after classical-style designs by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]].\n\nThe buildings in the square were largely destroyed by [[World War II]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|air raids]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] in [[April 1945]]. St. Nicholas' Church and the Old City Hall were immediately rebuilt after 1945, and the marble obelisk was restored in 1979. The shaft of the obelisk originally depicted rulers of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] who had heavily influenced [[Potsdam]]: [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], as well as the kings [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]], and [[Frederick the Great]]. Upon restoration the references to the old rulers were removed and replaced by portraits of popular Potsdam architects [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]], [[Carl von Gontard]], [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], and [[Friedrich Ludwig Persius]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=F\u00fcrsten, Helden, gro\u00dfe Geister: Denkmalgeschichten aus der Mark Brandenburg|last=Caspar|first=Helmut|date=2004-01-01|publisher=bebra|isbn=9783814801339|edition=1., Aufl.|pages=77\u201378|language=German|id= {{ASIN|3814801334|country=de}}}}</ref> Other war ruins were demolished and removed, including those of the City Palace and [[Museum Barberini|Barberini Palace]]. The square was thus left open on the south side. Between 1971 and 1977, a modern-style building for the [[Fachhochschule Potsdam]] was added to the west side of the square. Shortly before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], new construction of a theater began in the former location of the City Palace.

The square consists of the area around [[St. Nicholas' Church, Potsdam|St. Nicholas' Church]]. Today the term refers in particular to the area directly in front of the church. It is bordered by several prestigious historical buildings.\n\n== History ==\nThe [[City Palace, Potsdam|City Palace]] was originally erected in 1666 under the order of [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]]. At the time the spot was part of a castle grounds. The [[Old City Hall, Potsdam|Old City Hall]] was developed between 1753\u20131755 under the direction of architects [[Jan Bouman]] and [[Carl Ludwig Hildebrant]]. The marble obelisk in front of the church was added in 1753, following a design by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]], in order to emphasize the Roman character of the square. The most famous building in the square, [[St. Nicholas' Church, Potsdam|St. Nicholas' Church]], was erected from 1830\u20131837 as a centrally-planned building after classical-style designs by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]].\n\nThe buildings in the square were largely destroyed by [[World War II]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|air raids]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] in [[April 1945]]. St. Nicholas' Church and the Old City Hall were immediately rebuilt after 1945, and the marble obelisk was restored in 1979. The shaft of the obelisk originally depicted rulers of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] who had heavily influenced [[Potsdam]]: [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], as well as the kings [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]], and [[Frederick the Great]]. Upon restoration the references to the old rulers were removed and replaced by portraits of popular Potsdam architects [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]], [[Carl von Gontard]], [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], and [[Friedrich Ludwig Persius]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=F\u00fcrsten, Helden, gro\u00dfe Geister: Denkmalgeschichten aus der Mark Brandenburg|last=Caspar|first=Helmut|date=2004-01-01|publisher=bebra|isbn=9783814801339|edition=1., Aufl.|pages=77\u201378|language=German|id= {{ASIN|3814801334|country=de}}}}</ref> Other war ruins were demolished and removed, including those of the City Palace and [[Museum Barberini|Barberini Palace]]. The square was thus left open on the south side. Between 1971 and 1977, a modern-style building for the [[Fachhochschule Potsdam]] was added to the west side of the square. Shortly before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], new construction of a theater began in the former location of the City Palace. Its skeleton was torn down several years after the local government decided to bring new construction in line with the historical style. A new location for the theater (today the [[Hans Otto Theater]]) was selected on the shore of the [[Tiefer See, Potsdam|Tiefer See]] in the city.

This cave is believed to be in present-day China.\n\nFolktales and folk-songs describes places such as [[Shan State|Shan]], Raken (known as [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] in Myanmar) etc. which are located in present-day Myanmar.\n\nWashed up and over by myriads of interpretations and takes, the genesis of the Gangtes is almost like a well-kept secret bedimmed by theories of grandeur or otherwise. As is wont to any tribal history wanting in documentation, the Gangtes have their chronicle etched in folklores and traditional oral transmissions and legends.\n\nThere are two theories regarding the origin of Gangte.\n\nFirstly, the name Gangte derived from a place called \"Ganggam\" and all the inhabitants were called Gang-te, meaning \"from Gang\" or \"people of(from) Ganggam or Gangland\".\n\nSecondly, Gangte is believed to be the name of the ancestor of the Gangte.\n\nAccording to one folktale, Gangte progenitor wandered through the forest with his dog and finally build a village. He had three sons namely Mangte, Mate and Tukgek. Tukgek had a son named Thanglun, who in turn had 10 (ten) sons. These three sons of the progenitor viz Mangte, Mate and Tukgek along with their sons are the clans and sub-clans of present-day Gangte.\n\nAt present days, most of Mangte and Mate people do not speak Gangte as they are mingled with other tribes or communities while most of the descendants of Tukgek speak Gangte, preserve the custom and culture.\n\nThough the term Gangte is much wider used than thought, people mistakenly refer it to descendants of Tukgek such as Thanglun, Teklah, Neihsiel, Thangjom and their sub-clans.\n\n==Socio-political structure==\n\n===Late 19th century and earlier===\n\n====The village====\n\nThe village, as an institution, occupies primacy on par with other forms of institutions among the Gangtes. According to Rev. G.S. Gangte in his book Gangte Chronicle, the village constitute the bedrock of social, economic and administrative complex of the Gangtes. Owing to their nomadic tendency, the Gangtes are rarely famed for establishing a flourishing village. In effect, the location of their jhum sites solely determines the situation of their settlements. It is pertinent to note here that like the rest of the tribes, the Gangtes built their villages on hill-tops in consideration of defence against wild animals and enemies which as per history were not wanting. J. Gin Za Tuang (History of the Zomi Family, 1973) asserted that the tribes of CHIKIM, of which Gangte is a unit, after migrating from Tibet to Central China, hid in caves for fear of enemies. Thus, the inference, the Tribes originated from Khul or Cave.\n\n====Khawmuol====\nKhawmuol is the prelude to any Gangte village, a gateway that leads to the village. Khawmuol is a special zone that one passes through just before entering any village proper. No doubt it occupies a pivot niche in the village affairs. The villagers erect a wooden post at Khawmuol upon which they hang the heads of enemies taken after tribal wars. Dignitaries from outside or other tribes are welcome and received here. Moreover, important dos like magical incantations to cast off wild spirit are presided at the Khawmuol.\n\n====Shelter (home)====\nThe primitive Gangtes maintained utmost sacredness with a cumbersome meticulousness in choosing location for assembling new houses. They, as a matter of tradition, effectuate a ritual which includes erecting three stone pillars, about knee high each, and facing each other in a triangular orientation. Then, an egg would be snapped in two halves and placed on top of a fire lit between the pillars. If the froth falls towards the to-be owner of the house, the site is deemed fit and auspicious. Otherwise, they search and test a new location for setting up a shelter.\n\nWhen built a typical Gangte house is mostly erected out of wood, hay and bamboo. The front wall usually doubles up as the mantelpiece where owners display heads of animals hunted.\n\n====Chieftainship====\nFor the Gangtes, chieftainship occupies the highest court of administration and arbitration. Chieftainship, an ascribed position, exacts unquestioning obedience and undying loyalty from the subjects. Dr. T.S.Gangte, in his magnum opus The Kukis of Manipur, elaborated the power of the chief. Dr Gangte wrote that disobedience of the Chief merits expulsion from the village, and neither could outsiders immigrate without his assent. The power of the Chief is nigh absolute in the sense that even in the distribution of and access to wealth of the land, nothing goes but the Chief's will. The Chief is not only the ruler over his villagers; he is also their protector in times of adversity like famines and tribal wars. If a villager migrate without proper consent of the chief, his property and belonging are detained by the Chief.\n\nThe Gangte Chief is entitled to certain tributes from his subjects viz, Changseu, Salieng and Khuotha.\n\n#'''Changseu''': This is a tribute paid to the chief out of reverence and loyalty. Practised till now, Changseu is a form of tribal taxation system, customarily paid in paddy produce. It varies from two, three or five tins of rice grain. The Chief can exempt certain class of villagers who are needy and poor from paying Changseu. This exempted lot are anticipated to offer either chicken or tribal brew to the Chief on the day of Changseu collection. Another set of exempted class is constituted by the members of the village council. Changseu is annually collected on a particular date, post-harvest; and the Chief is obliged to treat his subjects to a sumptuous buffet or binge session.\n#'''Salieng''': Literally reworded, Salieng means the shoulder blade of animals. This is gifted to the Chief by anyone who caught wild animals in gratitude to his permission to hunt within his Chiefdom. It is also obligatory and villagers who play truancy are punish, punishment entails slaying of a mithun or paying forty rupees to invite the Chief's exoneration.\n#'''Khuotha''': It refers to the collective labour force of all household in the village that a chief can call for if the need arise. Even the villagers are entitled to invite Khuotha but they must provide lunch for the village labour corps on the day of social work. Further, the Chief can make a trade for Khuotha in lieu of Changseu but is not obliged to furnish meal on the day he asks for the labour force.\n\n====Siehmang Upa====\nSiehmang Upa are selected members of the village council who aids the Chief in the Administration of the village. Elite capacities, Siehmang Upa are men of impeccable integrity and excellence in all walks of life. They are exempted from all kinds of tributes and taxes. The number of Siehmang Upa is relative of the size of the village. The combo of the Chief and Siehmang Upa constitute the village court wherein disagreeing parties sort out their differences or grievances. Anyone resolving to litigate against fellow-villager in the village court must pay the customary fee of a pot of country liquor. If any of the party is found guilty, then the same is compel by ethics to slay, as a penalty, either a mithun or a swine and cough up a swelling pot of tribal brew. The village court also employs the service of the Tangsam or town-crier, which invariably is a hereditary status.\n\n====Tangsam====\nOtherwise known as the village/town-crier, the tangsam is the official spokesmen of the village. Dr. T.S. Gangte elucidated that the Tangsam has a prestigious role and the range of his chores is expansive. He is conferred with the duty to inform all the Siehmang Upa when and where the village council is to meet, and also to apprise the villagers of the outcome of the council's deliberations. For all his contributions, the villagers repay him with a tin of paddy each annually. It is hard to limit or detail the exact status and role of the Tangsam as he, literally, is the errand boy of the village who delivers as demanded.\n\n====Thiempu (priest)====\nA conspicuous facet of the primitive Gangte polity is the role played by the village priest, who is also the doctor of the village. Natively known as Thiempu, his status and role is a standout for the fact that there are certain areas of jurisdiction where his decision is the law. Given a situation, priesthood is the only office that can challenge and curb the tyranny of the Chief. However, for all its might and main, priesthood is considered hereditary, certain factors engendering its ascribed-ness. The nuances of healing and enigma of medicine are well-kept secrets, finely hidden from the knowledge of the public. The passage of tricks of the trade is only between the priest and his sons or grandsons. Moreover, one has to spend considerable amount to learn the secrets of healing and this discourage most of the villagers. Rev. Gangte has suggested that under some situations, the priest is considered as the head of the village. His role is more pronounced than that of the chief vis-a-vis festivity and religion.\n\nAs the keeper of the health of the masses, the sickly are referred to the priest who is expected to identify the cause of the illness. The spirit of the age has it that all ailments are the handiwork of evil-spirit, and the priest is expected to cast it out. Patients are treated by the priest with indigenous herbs and magical invocations. So long as the incantation or spell is not revoke from the patients, they are not allowed to socialise with the rest of the society. The priest does not charge any consultation fee from the villagers. But the villagers pay for his service by doling out a tribute in the form of paddy or other items. The priest also conducts divine sessions with the spirit and prays for productivity of the land. Hunters returning from a successful safari are welcome by the priest at the Khawmuol with drums and chants for which the priest is entitled with a bulk of the meat of the hunted.\n\nOne captivating aspect of priesthood concerns the priest unquestionable power to restrict entry to the village. The priest, when circumstances demanded- that often are tribal wars and plague, would hang a branch of tree (Theubawk) at the Khawmuol to signal that sojourners and strangers are not permitted to enter the village. This ban applies even to the next of kin of the priest if they reside in another village. Anyone who trespass this ban is liable to harshest penalty.\n\n====Thiksek====\nThiksek is the blacksmith of the village. In fact, every village has its blacksmith who take care of knives, spades, saws and other instruments implemented for daily work in the fields. Even warfare contraptions like swords, sabres, guns, arrows and gunpowder are the produce of the blacksmith. As such no village can afford to persist without a blacksmith. In appreciation of his deeds, the villagers return the favour in the form of a tin of paddy per household annually. Should any villager be successful in their hunts, they are bonded by custom to gift a chunk of the catch to the blacksmith as Thiksek-sa.\n\n====Suok (slaves)====\nChroniclers like John Shakepeare were the first to highlight the existence of slavery in the CHIKIM society. In his work The Lushai Kuki Clans (1912), he put forth a detailed view on tribal slavery. On the whole, slavery among the tribals vastly differs from that of the West or New World. Tribal slavery is not under duress, it's almost voluntary. Close observation gives the impression that in most cases, slavery seemed the only option for survival. Among the Gangtes three variants of slavery were practiced:\n*'''Inpi Suok''': This refers to the first type of slaves under the chief who is the only one accredited to own slaves. Inpi Suok are mostly orphans, the incapacitated who cannot look after themselves and the poor in abject misery. The Inpi Suok are conventionally treated as members of the Chief's family but they must work and toil harder than genuine members. The chief, being their guardian, is fully responsible for the welfare and security of the Inpi Suok.\n*'''Chemsan Suok''': Rough translation would be \u2018slaves due to stained sword\u2019. Chemsan Suok, the second kind of slaves in the Chief's house, is murderers, accidental or premeditated, and criminals who commit grave lapses that merit revenge as per the contemporary psyche. For such offenders, slavery is the salvation. Once they give in to the chief, they are saved and it is against the law to harm them. Harming them would tantamount to making a mockery of the Chief's chair and the penalty would also be grave. Chemsan Suok also includes insolvents who cannot repay their debts. Chemsan Souk differs from Inpi Suok. The former do not share habitat with the chief, they are slaves by agreement with the condition that the chief is entitled to the dowry of any Chemsan Suok's daughter.\n\n:L.B. Thanga (the Mizos, 1979) says that till 1928, Chemsan Suok can buy freedom by compensating the Chief, his master, with a mithun or forty rupees in cash.\n*'''Tuklut Suok''': Tuklut Suok are slaves as a consequence of village wars and they usually belong to the losing side in the battle. For safety, the losing party give themselves to the victorious one and hence, the label Tuklut, meaning \u2018give in\u2019. Tuklut Suok can build shelter in the victorious village as and when they can handover a healthy mithun to the Chief and if the Tuklut Suok are of small family, even a mithun can buy their freedom.\n\n==Christianization and the new socio-political structure==\n#The Church:\nWith the advent of Christianity in the late 19th century among the Lushais of Mizoram and its subsequent infiltration to the southern parts of Manipur spreading among the Thadous, Hmars, Vaiphei, Gangtes in the early 20th century, the traditional mode of education was soon replaced by the Church. Presently, ESC (Evangelical Synod Church) under ECCI and GBA (Gangte Baptist Church) are the predominant churches.\n\n*Organizations:\n\n#Gangte Tribes Union (GTU) is the apex body of the Gangte people.\n\nBesides, there are numerous organisations among the Gangtes. Wherever there is a Gangte, a certain form of Organisation is established to interact, provide help, communicate and bond the Gangte people.\n\n2.

This cave is believed to be in present-day China.\n\nFolktales and folk-songs describes places such as [[Shan State|Shan]], Raken (known as [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] in Myanmar) etc. which are located in present-day Myanmar.\n\nWashed up and over by myriads of interpretations and takes, the genesis of the Gangtes is almost like a well-kept secret bedimmed by theories of grandeur or otherwise. As is wont to any tribal history wanting in documentation, the Gangtes have their chronicle etched in folklores and traditional oral transmissions and legends.\n\nThere are two theories regarding the origin of Gangte.\n\nFirstly, the name Gangte derived from a place called \"Ganggam\" and all the inhabitants were called Gang-te, meaning \"from Gang\" or \"people of(from) Ganggam or Gangland\".\n\nSecondly, Gangte is believed to be the name of the ancestor of the Gangte.\n\nAccording to one folktale, Gangte progenitor wandered through the forest with his dog and finally build a village. He had three sons namely Mangte, Mate and Tukgek. Tukgek had a son named Thanglun, who in turn had 10 (ten) sons. These three sons of the progenitor viz Mangte, Mate and Tukgek along with their sons are the clans and sub-clans of present-day Gangte.\n\nAt present days, most of Mangte and Mate people do not speak Gangte as they are mingled with other tribes or communities while most of the descendants of Tukgek speak Gangte, preserve the custom and culture.\n\nThough the term Gangte is much wider used than thought, people mistakenly refer it to descendants of Tukgek such as Thanglun, Teklah, Neihsiel, Thangjom and their sub-clans.\n\n==Socio-political structure==\n\n===Late 19th century and earlier===\n\n====The village====\n\nThe village, as an institution, occupies primacy on par with other forms of institutions among the Gangtes. According to Rev. G.S. Gangte in his book Gangte Chronicle, the village constitute the bedrock of social, economic and administrative complex of the Gangtes. Owing to their nomadic tendency, the Gangtes are rarely famed for establishing a flourishing village. In effect, the location of their jhum sites solely determines the situation of their settlements. It is pertinent to note here that like the rest of the tribes, the Gangtes built their villages on hill-tops in consideration of defence against wild animals and enemies which as per history were not wanting. J. Gin Za Tuang (History of the Zomi Family, 1973) asserted that the tribes of CHIKIM, of which Gangte is a unit, after migrating from Tibet to Central China, hid in caves for fear of enemies. Thus, the inference, the Tribes originated from Khul or Cave.\n\n====Khawmuol====\nKhawmuol is the prelude to any Gangte village, a gateway that leads to the village. Khawmuol is a special zone that one passes through just before entering any village proper. No doubt it occupies a pivot niche in the village affairs. The villagers erect a wooden post at Khawmuol upon which they hang the heads of enemies taken after tribal wars. Dignitaries from outside or other tribes are welcome and received here. Moreover, important dos like magical incantations to cast off wild spirit are presided at the Khawmuol.\n\n====Shelter (home)====\nThe primitive Gangtes maintained utmost sacredness with a cumbersome meticulousness in choosing location for assembling new houses. They, as a matter of tradition, effectuate a ritual which includes erecting three stone pillars, about knee high each, and facing each other in a triangular orientation. Then, an egg would be snapped in two halves and placed on top of a fire lit between the pillars. If the froth falls towards the to-be owner of the house, the site is deemed fit and auspicious. Otherwise, they search and test a new location for setting up a shelter.\n\nWhen built a typical Gangte house is mostly erected out of wood, hay and bamboo. The front wall usually doubles up as the mantelpiece where owners display heads of animals hunted.\n\n====Chieftainship====\nFor the Gangtes, chieftainship occupies the highest court of administration and arbitration. Chieftainship, an ascribed position, exacts unquestioning obedience and undying loyalty from the subjects. Dr. T.S.Gangte, in his magnum opus The Kukis of Manipur, elaborated the power of the chief. Dr Gangte wrote that disobedience of the Chief merits expulsion from the village, and neither could outsiders immigrate without his assent. The power of the Chief is nigh absolute in the sense that even in the distribution of and access to wealth of the land, nothing goes but the Chief's will. The Chief is not only the ruler over his villagers; he is also their protector in times of adversity like famines and tribal wars. If a villager migrate without proper consent of the chief, his property and belonging are detained by the Chief.\n\nThe Gangte Chief is entitled to certain tributes from his subjects viz, Changseu, Salieng and Khuotha.\n\n#'''Changseu''': This is a tribute paid to the chief out of reverence and loyalty. Practised till now, Changseu is a form of tribal taxation system, customarily paid in paddy produce. It varies from two, three or five tins of rice grain. The Chief can exempt certain class of villagers who are needy and poor from paying Changseu. This exempted lot are anticipated to offer either chicken or tribal brew to the Chief on the day of Changseu collection. Another set of exempted class is constituted by the members of the village council. Changseu is annually collected on a particular date, post-harvest; and the Chief is obliged to treat his subjects to a sumptuous buffet or binge session.\n#'''Salieng''': Literally reworded, Salieng means the shoulder blade of animals. This is gifted to the Chief by anyone who caught wild animals in gratitude to his permission to hunt within his Chiefdom. It is also obligatory and villagers who play truancy are punish, punishment entails slaying of a mithun or paying forty rupees to invite the Chief's exoneration.\n#'''Khuotha''': It refers to the collective labour force of all household in the village that a chief can call for if the need arise. Even the villagers are entitled to invite Khuotha but they must provide lunch for the village labour corps on the day of social work. Further, the Chief can make a trade for Khuotha in lieu of Changseu but is not obliged to furnish meal on the day he asks for the labour force.\n\n====Siehmang Upa====\nSiehmang Upa are selected members of the village council who aids the Chief in the Administration of the village. Elite capacities, Siehmang Upa are men of impeccable integrity and excellence in all walks of life. They are exempted from all kinds of tributes and taxes. The number of Siehmang Upa is relative of the size of the village. The combo of the Chief and Siehmang Upa constitute the village court wherein disagreeing parties sort out their differences or grievances. Anyone resolving to litigate against fellow-villager in the village court must pay the customary fee of a pot of country liquor. If any of the party is found guilty, then the same is compel by ethics to slay, as a penalty, either a mithun or a swine and cough up a swelling pot of tribal brew. The village court also employs the service of the Tangsam or town-crier, which invariably is a hereditary status.\n\n====Tangsam====\nOtherwise known as the village/town-crier, the tangsam is the official spokesmen of the village. Dr. T.S. Gangte elucidated that the Tangsam has a prestigious role and the range of his chores is expansive. He is conferred with the duty to inform all the Siehmang Upa when and where the village council is to meet, and also to apprise the villagers of the outcome of the council's deliberations. For all his contributions, the villagers repay him with a tin of paddy each annually. It is hard to limit or detail the exact status and role of the Tangsam as he, literally, is the errand boy of the village who delivers as demanded.\n\n====Thiempu (priest)====\nA conspicuous facet of the primitive Gangte polity is the role played by the village priest, who is also the doctor of the village. Natively known as Thiempu, his status and role is a standout for the fact that there are certain areas of jurisdiction where his decision is the law. Given a situation, priesthood is the only office that can challenge and curb the tyranny of the Chief. However, for all its might and main, priesthood is considered hereditary, certain factors engendering its ascribed-ness. The nuances of healing and enigma of medicine are well-kept secrets, finely hidden from the knowledge of the public. The passage of tricks of the trade is only between the priest and his sons or grandsons. Moreover, one has to spend considerable amount to learn the secrets of healing and this discourage most of the villagers. Rev. Gangte has suggested that under some situations, the priest is considered as the head of the village. His role is more pronounced than that of the chief vis-a-vis festivity and religion.\n\nAs the keeper of the health of the masses, the sickly are referred to the priest who is expected to identify the cause of the illness. The spirit of the age has it that all ailments are the handiwork of evil-spirit, and the priest is expected to cast it out. Patients are treated by the priest with indigenous herbs and magical invocations. So long as the incantation or spell is not revoke from the patients, they are not allowed to socialise with the rest of the society. The priest does not charge any consultation fee from the villagers. But the villagers pay for his service by doling out a tribute in the form of paddy or other items. The priest also conducts divine sessions with the spirit and prays for productivity of the land. Hunters returning from a successful safari are welcome by the priest at the Khawmuol with drums and chants for which the priest is entitled with a bulk of the meat of the hunted.\n\nOne captivating aspect of priesthood concerns the priest unquestionable power to restrict entry to the village. The priest, when circumstances demanded- that often are tribal wars and plague, would hang a branch of tree (Theubawk) at the Khawmuol to signal that sojourners and strangers are not permitted to enter the village. This ban applies even to the next of kin of the priest if they reside in another village. Anyone who trespass this ban is liable to harshest penalty.\n\n====Thiksek====\nThiksek is the blacksmith of the village. In fact, every village has its blacksmith who take care of knives, spades, saws and other instruments implemented for daily work in the fields. Even warfare contraptions like swords, sabres, guns, arrows and gunpowder are the produce of the blacksmith. As such no village can afford to persist without a blacksmith. In appreciation of his deeds, the villagers return the favour in the form of a tin of paddy per household annually. Should any villager be successful in their hunts, they are bonded by custom to gift a chunk of the catch to the blacksmith as Thiksek-sa.\n\n====Suok (slaves)====\nChroniclers like John Shakepeare were the first to highlight the existence of slavery in the CHIKIM society. In his work The Lushai Kuki Clans (1912), he put forth a detailed view on tribal slavery. On the whole, slavery among the tribals vastly differs from that of the West or New World. Tribal slavery is not under duress, it's almost voluntary. Close observation gives the impression that in most cases, slavery seemed the only option for survival. Among the Gangtes three variants of slavery were practiced:\n*'''Inpi Suok''': This refers to the first type of slaves under the chief who is the only one accredited to own slaves. Inpi Suok are mostly orphans, the incapacitated who cannot look after themselves and the poor in abject misery. The Inpi Suok are conventionally treated as members of the Chief's family but they must work and toil harder than genuine members. The chief, being their guardian, is fully responsible for the welfare and security of the Inpi Suok.\n*'''Chemsan Suok''': Rough translation would be \u2018slaves due to stained sword\u2019. Chemsan Suok, the second kind of slaves in the Chief's house, is murderers, accidental or premeditated, and criminals who commit grave lapses that merit revenge as per the contemporary psyche. For such offenders, slavery is the salvation. Once they give in to the chief, they are saved and it is against the law to harm them. Harming them would tantamount to making a mockery of the Chief's chair and the penalty would also be grave. Chemsan Suok also includes insolvents who cannot repay their debts. Chemsan Souk differs from Inpi Suok. The former do not share habitat with the chief, they are slaves by agreement with the condition that the chief is entitled to the dowry of any Chemsan Suok's daughter.\n\n:L.B. Thanga (the Mizos, 1979) says that till 1928, Chemsan Suok can buy freedom by compensating the Chief, his master, with a mithun or forty rupees in cash.\n*'''Tuklut Suok''': Tuklut Suok are slaves as a consequence of village wars and they usually belong to the losing side in the battle. For safety, the losing party give themselves to the victorious one and hence, the label Tuklut, meaning \u2018give in\u2019. Tuklut Suok can build shelter in the victorious village as and when they can handover a healthy mithun to the Chief and if the Tuklut Suok are of small family, even a mithun can buy their freedom.\n\n==Christianization and the new socio-political structure==\n#The Church:\nWith the advent of Christianity in the late 19th century among the Lushais of Mizoram and its subsequent infiltration to the southern parts of Manipur spreading among the Thadous, Hmars, Vaiphei, Gangtes in the early 20th century, the traditional mode of education was soon replaced by the Church. Presently, ESC (Evangelical Synod Church) under ECCI and GBA (Gangte Baptist Church) are the predominant churches.\n\n*Organizations:\n\n#Gangte Tribes Union (GTU) is the apex body of the Gangte people.\n\nBesides, there are numerous organisations among the Gangtes. Wherever there is a Gangte, a certain form of Organisation is established to interact, provide help, communicate and bond the Gangte people.\n\n2. Gangte  Youths Organisation (GYO) is a philanthropic organisation working for and helping the needy, destitute and distressed and also working for the welfare of the people.\n\n3. Gangte  Students Organisation (GSO) is an apex students body of the Gangte people. The GSO work for the welfare of the students and learners  either academic or any arts or displine or field of study.\n\n4. Gangte Literature Society (GLS) is a body working for the preservation, promotion and upholding the  Gangte language.\n\n5. Gangte Culture and Custom Society is work for the preserving and promoting the culture, tradition and custom of the Gangte.\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#Education:\nThe Gangtes are one of the most educated and brilliant among the Chin-Kuki-Mizo community. 99% of the population are literate, all persons are well educated and mannered and are mostly fully employed.\n\nThe Gangtes are very well developed. Among the history of the world, India, Burma and Bangladesh: the Chin-Kuki-Mizo in particular, they have set a number of records.\n\nOf those records, mention may be of Dr. Tongngul Gangte who among the tribal people of Manipur was the first person to pass HSLC EXAM (Class X) in 1924.\n\n==Present-day==\nAs in ancient Gangte, the Present day Gangtes are very honorable.
