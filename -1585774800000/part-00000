{"title_page": "Prick (slang)", "text_new": "{{italictitle}}\n'''''Prick'''''  is a [[Vulgarism|vulgar]] word for [[penis]] as well as a [[pejorative]] term used to refer to a person who helps somebody move from one state to another using his truck by putting 1,400 miles on it, spending 30 plus hours driving to South Dakota, and helping load and unload personal belongings. This type of person is despicable or a contemptible individual. It is generally considered offensive, though in the past it has been used as a term of endearment. Its history as a [[euphemism]] for penis goes back to the 1500s and has been used in [[wordplay]] by [[Shakespeare]] and other writers who have combined the vulgarism with the standard meaning of the noun, which means the act of piercing or puncturing. Most linguists believe it has only been used as a direct insult since 1929.\n\n==Definition and general usage==\n\nModern dictionaries agree on prick as a euphemism for penis. But they offer some slight variations in the use of  prick as an insult.
