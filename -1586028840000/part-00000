On 4 July 1995, he was re-elected, beating the only other candidate, the former [[Secretary of State for Wales]], [[John Redwood]].\n\nFor some years the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had been deeply divided on the issue of the [[European Union]] and there had been much speculation each year that Major would be challenged for the leadership during the annual re-election of the leader each November. Many both within and outside the party believed that the constant speculation was highly damaging and so Major took the dramatic step to force an early contest. He announced his decision in a speech in the garden of [[10 Downing Street]], challenging his party opponents to \"put up or shut up\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page724.html|title=1995 \u2013 Mr Major's resignation speech|publisher=johnmajor.co.uk|accessdate=2016-07-13}}</ref>\n\nThe Conservative government was also proving unpopular with the British public at the time, trailing the Labour Party in opinion polls and having suffered heavy losses in local elections for three successive years, as well as a poor performance in the previous year's European elections.\n\n==Rules==\nUnder the rules at the time, (introduced in 1965 and modified in 1975), there would be a series of ballots, conducted by the [[1922 Committee]], with the committee's chairman, [[Marcus Fox|Sir Marcus Fox]], serving as Returning Officer.\n\nSince the leadership was vacant, a contest required the nomination of only two candidates. Under the rules in force, win in the first round, a candidate not only needed to win the backing of an absolute majority of members of parliament,<ref name = \"bbc\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/leadership/lead95.shtml|title=Conservative Party Leadership Election 1995|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=1997|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref> but also needed a majority over the runner-up of 15 per cent of the total electorate.<ref name = \"bbc\"/> If neither of these were achieved, then a second ballot would take place in the following week, nominations would be reopened, and at this stage an absolute majority only would be required to win. If there were no winner on the second ballot, then the top two candidates would go forward to a third round.\n\nBecause of this process, the first round was widely regarded as the expression of confidence (or otherwise) in Major. Many speculated that if he did not achieve outright victory then he would resign, enabling more prominent Conservatives, such as [[Michael Heseltine]] or [[Michael Portillo]], to stand in the second round.<ref name = \"bbc\"/>\n\n==Candidates and their platforms==\n[[John Major]] announced he would be a candidate for re election from the outset, and stood pledging continuity in office and the continuation of a broad-based approach to government.\n\nThe only candidate to enter the race was [[John Redwood]], who resigned from the Cabinet as [[Secretary of State for Wales]]. Redwood ran on a staunchly [[Eurosceptic]], [[Thatcherite]] manifesto.\n\n===Prominent Conservatives who did not stand===\nThere were several Conservatives who did not stand in the first round but were either widely expected to stand in the event of a second round or did not stand for another reason. They included:\n\n*[[Kenneth Clarke]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and on the pro-EU wing of the party\n*[[Michael Heseltine]], [[President of the Board of Trade]] who had challenged [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|contest of 1990]] and also on the pro-EU wing of the party\n*[[Norman Lamont]], former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and a staunch Eurosceptic\n*[[Michael Portillo]], [[Secretary of State for Employment]] and widely seen as the heir to the Thatcherite wing of the party\n*[[Gillian Shephard]], [[Secretary of State for Education]]\n\nInterest was generated when it was reported that both Heseltine and Portillo had had a large number of telephone lines installed at offices, widely presumed (and, in Portillo's case, correctly)<ref name=\"portillo20070415\">{{cite news|last=Portillo|first=Michael|title=Believe me, Mr Miliband, No 10 is within your grasp|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/michael_portillo/article1654875.ece|accessdate=2010-12-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907205855/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/michael_portillo/article1654875.ece | archivedate=2008-09-07 | newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=2007-04-15}}</ref> to be a preparation for a second round bid. When this was raised during [[Prime Minister's Questions]], Major laughingly attributed this to the effect of [[BT Group#privitisation|telephone privatisation]]. During the voting, Heseltine felt the need to publicly display his ballot paper to show that he had voted for Major.\n\n==Campaign==\nThe period between the launch of the election and polling was short. The main interest occurred when [[Michael Heseltine]] publicly and strongly endorsed Major, which many commentators felt reinforced his position. Redwood's leadership bid came under much fire. His campaign slogan was \"No change, no chance\". A poster was issued on his behalf, written by Redwood's campaign manager [[David Evans (British politician)|David Evans]], which urged Conservatives to vote Redwood to {{em|\"Save Your Seat, Save Your Party, and Save Your Country\"}}.\n\nAt a personal level his nickname of \"the Vulcan\" reached prominence and much lampooning in the media, whilst his formal launch of his campaign was dismissed as a collection of all the mavericks on the right of the party, widely undermining his bid's credibility.\n\n==Ballot==\n\nThe ballot was as follows:\n<!-- this section is transcluded on Electoral history of John Major -->:\n<section begin=\"Only ballot: 4 July 1995\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"|Only ballot: 4 July 1995\n\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 170px\"|Candidate\n! style=\"width: 50px\"|Votes\n! style=\"width: 40px\"|%\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | '''[[John Major]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''218'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''66.3'''\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | [[John Redwood]]\n| align=\"right\" | 89\n| align=\"right\" | 27.1\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | Abstentions\n| align=\"right\" | 10\n| align=\"right\" | 3.0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | Spoilt\n| align=\"right\" | 12\n| align=\"right\" | 3.6\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\" | Majority\n| align=\"right\"            | 129\n| align=\"right\"            | 39.2\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\" | Turnout\n| align=\"right\"            | 329\n| align=\"right\" | ''N/A''\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"| John Major re-elected\n|-\n|}<section end=\"Only ballot: 4 July 1995\"/>\n\nMajor had both an outright majority and the necessary 15% margin, but had received only three more votes than his private minimum target of 215.

During the latter warfare, the punitive [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779 mounted by rebel forces destroyed many of the dwellings, as well as the winter stores of the people, and they abandoned the ruins. Following the war and the forced removal of the Seneca from their native land, [[European-Americans]] settled here about 1793. They developed a town encouraged by the [[The Pulteney Association|Pulteney Association]], which owned the land and was selling plots.\n\nAt the end of the Revolutionary War, Lt. Col. Seth Reed (n\u00e9 Read), who had fought at Bunker Hill, was one of many pioneers who moved from Massachusetts into Ontario County. By trade with the Seneca, he bought a tract of land eighteen miles in extent. (This was illegal, as only the US government was authorized to make land deals with the Native Americans.)

Geneva is in the [[Finger Lakes]] region, the largest wine-producing area in New York State. The [[Cayuga-Seneca Canal]] is part of the watershed of [[Keuka Lake]]. It flows north through Geneva, connecting to the [[Erie Canal]], which was completed in 1825, giving access for the region to the Great Lakes and midwestern markets for their produce, as well as to buy natural resource commodities.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 5.8 square miles (15.2&nbsp;km\u00b2). 4.3 square miles (11.0&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it is land and 1.6 square miles (4.1&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it (27.18%) is water.\n\nGeneva is connected via the east\u2013west [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US 20]], concurrent with [[New York State Route 5|NY 5]]. [[New York State Route 14|NY 14]] is a north\u2013south highway through the city. It is fairly equidistant from [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], each being about 45 miles away.\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{wide image|GenevaNYCity2011.jpg|446px|align-cap=center|City of Geneva from the shoreline of [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]]}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"140px\">\nImage: Seneca_Street.jpg|Seneca Street, Geneva\nImage: Pulteney_Park_Geneva.jpg|Pulteney Park, Geneva\nImage: South_Main_Street_Geneva.jpg|South Main Street, Geneva \nImage: Lake Trout Capital.JPG| Lake Trout Capital of the World Sign, Routes 5 & 20, Geneva\n</gallery>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"140px\">\nImage: Belhurst_Castle.jpg|[[Belhurst Castle]] in Geneva\nImage: GenevaLake.jpg|[[Nester House (Geneva, New York)|Geneva on the Lake]]\nImage: S.

During the latter warfare, the punitive [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779 mounted by rebel forces destroyed many of the dwellings, as well as the winter stores of the people, and they abandoned the ruins. Following the war and the forced removal of the Seneca from their native land, [[European-Americans]] settled here about 1793. They developed a town encouraged by the [[The Pulteney Association|Pulteney Association]], which owned the land and was selling plots.\n\nAt the end of the Revolutionary War, Lt. Col.

By trade with the Seneca, he bought a tract of land eighteen miles in extent. (This was illegal, as only the US government was authorized to make land deals with the Native Americans.)

Geneva is in the [[Finger Lakes]] region, the largest wine-producing area in New York State. The [[Cayuga-Seneca Canal]] is part of the watershed of [[Keuka Lake]]. It flows north through Geneva, connecting to the [[Erie Canal]], which was completed in 1825, giving access for the region to the Great Lakes and midwestern markets for their produce, as well as to buy natural resource commodities.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 5.8 square miles (15.2&nbsp;km\u00b2). 4.3 square miles (11.0&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it is land and 1.6 square miles (4.1&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it (27.18%) is water.\n\nGeneva is connected via the east-west [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US 20]], concurrent with [[New York State Route 5|NY 5]]. [[New York State Route 14|NY 14]] is a north-south highway through the city. It is fairly equidistant from [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], each being about 45 miles away.\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{wide image|GenevaNYCity2011.jpg|446px|align-cap=center|City of Geneva from the shoreline of [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]]}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"140px\">\nImage: Seneca_Street.jpg|Seneca Street, Geneva\nImage: Pulteney_Park_Geneva.jpg|Pulteney Park, Geneva\nImage: South_Main_Street_Geneva.jpg|South Main Street, Geneva \nImage: Lake Trout Capital.JPG| Lake Trout Capital of the World Sign, Routes 5 & 20, Geneva\n</gallery>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"140px\">\nImage: Belhurst_Castle.jpg|[[Belhurst Castle]] in Geneva\nImage: GenevaLake.jpg|[[Nester House (Geneva, New York)|Geneva on the Lake]]\nImage: S.

With three major water systems ([[New Croton Aqueduct|Croton]], [[Catskill  Aqueduct|Catskill]], and [[Delaware Aqueduct |Delaware]]) stretching up to 125 miles away from the [[New York City|City]], its [[water supply system]] is one of the most extensive [[Municipal water system|municipal water systems]] in the world. \n\nNew York's [[Water purification|water treatment process]] is simpler than most other American cities. This largely reflects how well-protected its [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] are. The city has sought to restrict [[Land development|development]] surrounding them. One of its largest watershed protection programs is the Land Acquisition Program, under which the [[New York City Department of Environmental Protection]] (DEP) has purchased or protected, through [[conservation easement]], over 130,000 acres (53,000 ha) since 1997<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/20/nyregion/20water.html|title=New York's Water Supply May Need Filtering|last=DePalma|first=Anthony|date=2006-07-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>.

For the first two centuries of European settlement in Manhattan, it was the main water supply system for the growing city. Later, the City was aware of its deteriorated water quality, owing to its rapid population growth (60,000 to 200,000 from 1800 to 1830), which had a considerable danger of causing epidemics. As a result, New York City started to use cast iron pipes to transport spring water into the city. The [[Old Croton Aqueduct]] was established in 1842, and apart from a few inspections during the Civil War era the system has been running unceasingly ever since.<ref name=\":0\" />. In the late 1800s, Additional  aqueducts were systematically installed in New York City to fit the demand.\n\n===Old and New Croton Aqueductd===\n{{further|Old Croton Aqueduct|New Croton Aqueduct}}\nIn 1842, the City's first aqueduct, the [[Croton Aqueduct]], was built from the [[Croton River]] along a section within [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], down to Manhattan. According to [[Government of New York City|New York City\u2019s]] website, the Old Croton Aqueduct's capacity was around 90 million gallons per day. To meet growing needs, the New Croton Aqueduct project was launched in 1885 and established in 1890, running with a capacity of 300 million gallons per day<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/history-of-new-york-citys-drinking-water.page|title=History of New York City's Drinking Water \u2013 DEP|website=www1.nyc.gov|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>\n\n===Catskill Aqueduct===\n{{further|Catskill Aqueduct}}\nIn 1905, the City's newly-established Board of Water Supply launched the [[Catskill Aqueduct]] project, which would play an additional role in supplying the City's ever-growing population of residents and visitors.

New York won the case in May 1931 and construction of the [[Delaware Aqueduct]] was initiated in March 1937. The Aqueduct was completed in 1944 and from 1950 to 1964, Rondout, Neversink, Pepacton, and Cannonsville Reservoirs were established successively to complete the Delaware System<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/history-of-new-york-citys-drinking-water.page|title=History of New York City's Drinking Water \u2013 DEP|website=www1.nyc.gov|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>.

For the first two centuries of European settlement in Manhattan, it was the main water supply system for the growing city. Later, the City was aware of its deteriorated water quality, owing to its rapid population growth (60,000 to 200,000 from 1800 to 1830), which had a considerable danger of causing epidemics. As a result, New York City started to use cast iron pipes to transport spring water into the city. The [[Old Croton Aqueduct]] was established in 1842, and apart from a few inspections during the Civil War era the system has been running unceasingly ever since.<ref name=\":0\" />. In the late 1800s, Additional  aqueducts were systematically installed in New York City to fit the demand.\n\n===Old and New Croton Aqueductd===\n{{further|Old Croton Aqueduct|New Croton Aqueduct}}\nIn 1842, the City's first aqueduct, the [[Croton Aqueduct]], was built from the [[Croton River]] along a section within [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], down to Manhattan. According to [[Government of New York City|New York City\u2019s]] website, the Old Croton Aqueduct's capacity was around 90 million gallons per day. To meet growing needs, the New Croton Aqueduct project was launched in 1885 and established in 1890, running with a capacity of 300 million gallons per day<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/history-of-new-york-citys-drinking-water.page|title=History of New York City's Drinking Water \u2013 DEP|website=www1.nyc.gov|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>\n\n===Catskill Aqueduct===\n{{further|Catskill Aqueduct}}\nIn 1905, the City's newly-established Board of Water Supply launched the [[Catskill Aqueduct]] project, which would play an additional role in supplying the City's ever-growing population of residents and visitors.

Even though the request was approved, the Delaware Aqueduct project was delayed due to a Supreme Court case filed by the State of New Jersey to prevent the State of New York from using the Delaware River as a water source. New York won the case in May 1931 and construction of the [[Delaware Aqueduct]] was initiated in March 1937. The Aqueduct was completed in 1944, and from 1950 to 1964 Rondout, Neversink, Pepacton, and Cannonsville Reservoirs were established successively to complete the Delaware System<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/history-of-new-york-citys-drinking-water.page|title=History of New York City's Drinking Water \u2013 DEP|website=www1.nyc.gov|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>. The Delaware Aqueduct supports half of the whole City's water usage by supplying more than 500 million gallons of water daily.\n\n== Responsible agencies ==\nResponsibility for the city water supply is shared among three institutions: the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\"), which operates and maintains the system and is responsible for investment planning; the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority (\"NYW\"), which raises debt financing in the market to underwrite the system's costs; and the Water Board, which sets rates and collects user payments.\n\n===New York City Department of Environmental Protection===\n{{main|New York City Department of Environmental Protection#Wastewater treatment}}\nThe DEP has a workforce of over 7,000 employees.

They adapted the scientific research of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Isaac Newton]] into a form accessible to laypeople.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\">Herbert, Robert L., ''Neo-impressionism'', New York, Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, 1968</ref> Artists followed new discoveries in perception with great interest.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nChevreul was perhaps the most important influence on artists at the time; his great contribution was producing a color wheel of primary and intermediary hues. Chevreul was a French [[chemistry|chemist]] who restored [[tapestry|tapestries]]. During his restorations he noticed that the only way to restore a section properly was to take into account the influence of the colors around the missing [[wool]]; he could not produce the right hue unless he recognized the surrounding [[dye]]s. Chevreul discovered that two colors juxtaposed, slightly overlapping or very close together, would have the effect of another color when seen from a distance. The discovery of this phenomenon became the basis for the pointillist technique of the Neoimpressionist painters.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nChevreul also realized that the \"halo\" that one sees after looking at a color is the opposing color (also known as [[complementary color]]). For example: After looking at a red object, one may see a cyan echo/halo of the original object. This complementary color (as an example, cyan for red) is due to [[retina]]l persistence. Neoimpressionist painters interested in the interplay of colors made extensive use of complementary colors in their paintings. In his works, Chevreul advised artists to think and paint not just the color of the central object, but to add colors and make appropriate adjustments to achieve a harmony among colors. It seems that the harmony Chevreul wrote about is what Seurat came to call \"emotion\".<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nIt is not clear whether Seurat read all of Chevreul's book on color contrast, published in 1859, but he did copy out several paragraphs from the chapter on painting, and he had read [[Charles Blanc]]'s ''Grammaire des arts du dessin'' (1867),<ref name=techbull/> which cites Chevreul's work. Blanc's book was directed at artists and art connoisseurs. Because of color's emotional significance to him, he made explicit recommendations that were close to the theories later adopted by the Neoimpressionists. He said that color should not be based on the \"judgment of taste\", but rather it should be close to what we experience in reality. Blanc did not want artists to use equal intensities of color, but to consciously plan and understand the role of each hue in creating a whole.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nWhile Chevreul based his theories on Newton's thoughts on the mixing of light, Ogden Rood based his writings on the work of Helmholtz. He analyzed the effects of mixing and juxtaposing material pigments. Rood valued as [[primary colors]] red, green, and blue-violet. Like Chevreul, he said that if two colors are placed next to each other, from a distance they look like a third distinctive color. He also pointed out that the juxtaposition of primary hues next to each other would create a far more intense and pleasing color, when perceived by the eye and mind, than the corresponding color made simply by mixing paint. Rood advised artists to be aware of the difference between additive and subtractive qualities of color, since material pigments and optical pigments (light) do not mix in the same way:\n\n*Material pigments: Red + Yellow + Blue = Black\n*Optical / Light : Red + Green + Blue = White\n\nSeurat was also influenced by Sutter's ''Phenomena of Vision'' (1880), in which he wrote that \"the laws of harmony can be learned as one learns the laws of harmony and music\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Sam|last=Hunter|author-link=Sam Hunter|chapter=Georges Seurat|title=Modern Art |url=https://archive.org/details/modernartpaintin00hunt|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|Harry N.

There remains controversy over the extent to which Henry's ideas were adopted by Seurat.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\n===Language of color===\n[[File:Georges Seurat 019.jpg|thumb|''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|The Circus]]'', 1891, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris]]\nSeurat took to heart the color theorists' notion of a scientific approach to painting. He believed that a painter could use color to create harmony and emotion in art in the same way that a musician uses [[counterpoint]] and variation to create harmony in music. He theorized that the scientific application of color was like any other natural law, and he was driven to prove this conjecture. He thought that the knowledge of perception and optical laws could be used to create a new language of art based on its own set of [[heuristic]]s and he set out to show this language using lines, color intensity and color schema. Seurat called this language [[Chromoluminarism]].<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nIn a letter to the writer Maurice Beaubourg in 1890 he wrote: \"Art is Harmony. Harmony is the analogy of the contrary and of similar elements of tone, of colour and of line. In tone, lighter against darker. In colour, the complementary, red-green, orange-blue, yellow-violet. In line, those that form a right-angle. The frame is in a harmony that opposes those of the tones, colours and lines of the picture, these aspects are considered according to their dominance and under the influence of light, in gay, calm or sad combinations\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=069rL6vA1BAC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&source=web&ots=j2yei95_hn&sig=l8xStuMceDzHyxwN7FosvRR3Ofg#PPA13,M1 |title='&#39;Art of the 20th Century'&#39;, Karl Ruhrberg |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref><ref>Letter to the writer Maurice Beaubourg, 28 August 1890, ''Seurat'' Phaidon Press, London, 1965</ref>\n\nSeurat's theories can be summarized as follows: The emotion of gaiety can be achieved by the domination of luminous hues, by the predominance of warm colors, and by the use of lines directed upward.

They adapted the scientific research of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Isaac Newton]] into a form accessible to laypeople.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\">Herbert, Robert L., ''Neo-impressionism'', New York, Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, 1968</ref> Artists followed new discoveries in perception with great interest.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nChevreul was perhaps the most important influence on artists at the time; his great contribution was producing a color wheel of primary and intermediary hues. Chevreul was a French [[chemistry|chemist]] who restored [[tapestry|tapestries]]. During his restorations he noticed that the only way to restore a section properly was to take into account the influence of the colors around the missing [[wool]]; he could not produce the right hue unless he recognized the surrounding [[dye]]s. Chevreul discovered that two colors juxtaposed, slightly overlapping or very close together, would have the effect of another color when seen from a distance. The discovery of this phenomenon became the basis for the pointillist technique of the Neoimpressionist painters.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nChevreul also realized that the \"halo\" that one sees after looking at a color is the opposing color (also known as [[complementary color]]). For example: After looking at a red object, one may see a cyan echo/halo of the original object. This complementary color (as an example, cyan for red) is due to [[retina]]l persistence. Neoimpressionist painters interested in the interplay of colors made extensive use of complementary colors in their paintings. In his works, Chevreul advised artists to think and paint not just the color of the central object, but to add colors and make appropriate adjustments to achieve a harmony among colors. It seems that the harmony Chevreul wrote about is what Seurat came to call \"emotion\".<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nIt is not clear whether Seurat read all of Chevreul's book on color contrast, published in 1859, but he did copy out several paragraphs from the chapter on painting, and he had read [[Charles Blanc]]'s ''Grammaire des arts du dessin'' (1867),<ref name=techbull/> which cites Chevreul's work. Blanc's book was directed at artists and art connoisseurs. Because of color's emotional significance to him, he made explicit recommendations that were close to the theories later adopted by the Neoimpressionists. He said that color should not be based on the \"judgment of taste\", but rather it should be close to what we experience in reality. Blanc did not want artists to use equal intensities of color, but to consciously plan and understand the role of each hue in creating a whole.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nWhile Chevreul based his theories on Newton's thoughts on the mixing of light, Ogden Rood based his writings on the work of Helmholtz. He analyzed the effects of mixing and juxtaposing material pigments. Rood valued as [[primary colors]] red, green, and blue-violet. Like Chevreul, he said that if two colors are placed next to each other, from a distance they look like a third distinctive color. He also pointed out that the juxtaposition of primary hues next to each other would create a far more intense and pleasing color, when perceived by the eye and mind, than the corresponding color made simply by mixing paint. Rood advised artists to be aware of the difference between additive and subtractive qualities of color, since material pigments and optical pigments (light) do not mix in the same way:\n\n*Material pigments: Red + Yellow + Blue = Black\n*Optical / Light : Red + Green + Blue = White\n\nSeurat was also influenced by Sutter's ''Phenomena of Vision'' (1880), in which he wrote that \"the laws of harmony can be learned as one learns the laws of harmony and music\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Sam|last=Hunter|author-link=Sam Hunter|chapter=Georges Seurat|title=Modern Art |url=https://archive.org/details/modernartpaintin00hunt|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|Harry N. Abrams]] |year=1992|page=[https://archive.org/details/modernartpaintin00hunt/page/27 27]}}</ref> He heard lectures in the 1880s by the mathematician [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], who discussed the [[emotion]]al properties and symbolic meaning of lines and color. There remains controversy over the extent to which Henry's ideas were adopted by Seurat.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\n===Language of color===\n[[File:Georges Seurat 019.jpg|thumb|''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|The Circus]]'', 1891, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris]]\nSeurat took to heart the color theorists' notion of a scientific approach to painting. He believed that a painter could use color to create harmony and emotion in art in the same way that a musician uses [[counterpoint]] and variation to create harmony in music. He theorized that the scientific application of color was like any other natural law, and he was driven to prove this conjecture. He thought that the knowledge of perception and optical laws could be used to create a new language of art based on its own set of [[heuristic]]s and he set out to show this language using lines, color intensity and color schema. Seurat called this language [[Chromoluminarism]].<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nIn a letter to the writer Maurice Beaubourg in 1890 he wrote: \"Art is Harmony. Harmony is the analogy of the contrary and of similar elements of tone, of colour and of line. In tone, lighter against darker. In colour, the complementary, red-green, orange-blue, yellow-violet. In line, those that form a right-angle. The frame is in a harmony that opposes those of the tones, colours and lines of the picture, these aspects are considered according to their dominance and under the influence of light, in gay, calm or sad combinations\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=069rL6vA1BAC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&source=web&ots=j2yei95_hn&sig=l8xStuMceDzHyxwN7FosvRR3Ofg#PPA13,M1 |title='&#39;Art of the 20th Century'&#39;, Karl Ruhrberg |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref><ref>Letter to the writer Maurice Beaubourg, 28 August 1890, ''Seurat'' Phaidon Press, London, 1965</ref>\n\nSeurat's theories can be summarized as follows: The emotion of gaiety can be achieved by the domination of luminous hues, by the predominance of warm colors, and by the use of lines directed upward. Calm is achieved through an equivalence/balance of the use of the light and the dark, by the balance of warm and cold colors, and by lines that are horizontal. Sadness is achieved by using dark and cold colors and by lines pointing downward.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Georges Seurat 066.jpg|thumb|upright=1.28|''[[Parade de cirque|Circus Sideshow (Parade de Cirque)]]'', 1887\u201388, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]\nWhere the dialectic nature of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]'s work had been greatly influential during the highly expressionistic phase of [[proto-Cubism]], between 1908 and 1910, the work of Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures, would capture the attention of the [[Cubism|Cubists]] from 1911.<ref name=\"Mittelmann\">[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]</ref> Seurat in his few years of activity, was able, with his observations on irradiation and the effects of contrast, to create afresh without any guiding tradition, to complete an esthetic system with a new technical method perfectly adapted to its expression.<ref>[[Roger Fry|Fry, Roger]] Essay in [[The Dial]], Camden, New Jersey, September 1926.</ref>\n\n\"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910\u20131911,\" writes art historian Robert Herbert, \"questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. Thanks to several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. ''[[Le Chahut|The Chahut]]'' [Rijksmuseum Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller, Otterlo] was called by Andr\u00e9 Salmon 'one of the great icons of the new devotion', and both it and the ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Cirque (Circus)]]'', Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, according to [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], 'almost belong to Synthetic Cubism'.\"<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\nThe concept was well established among the French artists that painting could be expressed mathematically, in terms of both color and form; and this mathematical expression resulted in an independent and compelling \"objective truth\", perhaps more so than the objective truth of the object represented.<ref name=\"Mittelmann\" />\n\nIndeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis in the domain of color (Seurat addresses both problems in ''Circus'' and ''Dancers'').

Now the principal French-speaking city of [[Switzerland]], [[Geneva]] was an independent city state from the [[Middle Ages]] until the end of the 18th century. [[John Calvin]] was the Protestant leader of the city in the 16th century.\n\n== Antiquity and Early Middle Ages==\nGeneva first appears in history as an [[Allobroges|Allobrogian]] border town, fortified against the Celtic [[Helvetii]] tribe, which the Romans took in 121 BC.\n\nIn 58 BC, Caesar, Roman governor of Gaul, destroyed the Rh\u00f4ne bridge at Geneva and built a 19-mile earthwork from Lake Geneva to the [[Jura Mountains]] in order to block the migration of the Helvetii, who \"attempted, sometimes by day, more often by night, to break through, either by joining boats together and making a number of rafts (''ratis''), or by fording the Rh\u00f4ne where the depth of the stream was least\" (De Bello Gallico, I, 8). Then he helped establish Geneva as a Roman city ([[vicus]] and then [[civitas]]) by setting up camp there and significantly increasing its size.\n\nIn 443, Geneva was taken by Burgundy, and with the latter fell to the [[Frankish Kingdom|Franks]] in 534.

Moutiers, 1871), Geneva was Christianised by Dionysius Areopagita and Paracodus, two of the 72 disciples, in the time of [[Domitian]]. Dionysius went thence to Paris and Paracodus became the first Bishop of [[Bishopric of Geneva|Geneva]] \u2013 but the legend is based on an error, as is that which makes St. Lazarus the first Bishop of Geneva, arising out of the similarity between the Latin names Genava (Geneva) and [[Genoa|Genua]] (Genoa, in northern Italy). The so-called \"Catalogue de St. Pierre\", which names St. Diogenus (Diogenes) as the first Bishop of Geneva, is unreliable.\n\nA letter of [[St. Eucherius]] to Salvius makes it almost certain that the name of the first bishop (c. 400) was Isaac. In 440, [[Salonius]] appears as Bishop of Geneva; he was a son of Eucherius, to whom the latter dedicated his Instructiones'; he took part in the [[Council of Orange (441)]], [[Vaison-la-Romaine|Vaison]] (442) and [[Archbishopric of Arles|Arles]] (about 455), and is supposed to be the author of two small commentaries, ''In parabolas Salomonis'' and on Ecclesisastis.<ref>''In parabolas Salomonis'' and \"on Ecclesisastis\", in P.

The bishops of Geneva had the status of [[prince of the Holy Roman Empire]] from 1154, but had to maintain a long struggle for their independence against the guardians (''advocati'') of the see, the counts of [[County of Geneva|Geneva]] and later the counts of the [[House of Savoy]].\n\nIn 1290, the latter obtained the right of installing the [[vice-dominus]] of the diocese, the title of \"Vidame of Geneva\"<ref>Dioecesis Lausannensis, Genevensis, et Friburgensis, Protocol Records 1200 - 1300, Holy See</ref> was granted by [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]] in the name of the [[Holy See]] (by the [[Foreign relations of the Holy See]]) to the counts of the [[House of Candia]] under count [[Fran\u00e7ois de Candie]] of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]]-Le-Vieux a Chatellaine of the Savoy, this official exercised minor jurisdiction in the town in the bishop's absence.\n\nIn 1387, Bishop Adh\u00e9mar Fabry granted the town its great charter, the basis of its communal self-government,<ref name=Columbia>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Geneva|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-GenevaSwi.html|encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]}}</ref> which every bishop on his accession was expected to confirm. The line of the counts of Geneva ended in 1394, and the House of Savoy came into possession of their territory, assuming after 1416 the title of Duke. The new dynasty sought to bring the city of Geneva under their power, particularly by elevating members of their own family to the episcopal see. In 1447 [[Antipope Felix V]], who was also Duke of [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]], appointed himself as bishop of Geneva, and the Savoy dynasty ruled the episcopal see until 1490, when popular pressure compelled the dynasty to renounce the title of bishop.\n\nIn 1457 a major government organ was established in Geneva, known as the [[Grand Council of Geneva|Grand Council]], which first consisted of 50 deputies and later their number was raised to 200. The members of the Grand Council were elected every year in early February. The Grand Council represented the [[Bourgeois of Geneva|citizens of Geneva]] and decided on political matters and also elected the bishops of Geneva after that position was renounced by the Savoy dynasty in 1490. This same council gradually became estranged from the Duke of Savoy. A new cause of friction between the Grand Council and the Duke of Savoy evolved in 1513, when [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Charles III]] decided to appoint his cousin John of Savoy as bishop and even secured Papal endorsement. Despite being bishop of Geneva, the new Savoy bishop resided most of the time in [[Pignerol]] in Northern Italy, another factor enhancing the alienation between the people in Geneva and the Savoy dynasty.\n\n[[File:History of the great reformation in Europe in the times of Luther and Calvin..

However, after that date the power of Savoy over Geneva gradually declined. In 1521 Jean of Savoy died, and the Grand Council appealed to Pope Leo X to appoint the next bishop, who then appointed [[Pierre de la Baume]]. In addition, the Duke of Savoy also tried to reconcile his political ambitions with local Genevan patriotism, and in 1523 marched into Geneva in a ceremony designated to appease its population, and tried to gain the support of the Geneva merchants by promising them a share in the trade with the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] ([[Beatrice of Portugal, Duchess of Savoy|his wife's]] country of origin) and its territories in [[Brazil]]. However, the independence faction in Geneva did not accept these gestures. Another political crisis occurred in 1524, when the treasurer of Geneva, [[Bernard Boulet]], a supporter of Savoy rule, was accused by the Grand Council of embezzlement. He reacted to the accusations by appealing to Charles III to curtail the powers of the council once more, to which the Duke responded by confiscating assets held by council members in other territories under Savoy rule.\n\nIn January 1525 the council appealed to the Pope to excommunicate Charles III. The deputies' attempt to enlist the support of the bishop [[Pierre de la Baume]] for their cause failed, and the Pope rejected their request. However, Charles III feared another rebellion, and in September 1525 made another proposal of power-sharing to the Grand Council of Geneva, which the council endorsed by 53\u201342. However, Charles III was not satisfied with this and started a new invasion of Geneva in order to destroy the pro-independence faction. The pro-independence faction fled to Fribourg, and in December 1525 the Grand Council acknowledged Charles III as the true sovereign of Geneva (a session known as the \"Assembly of [[Halberd]]s\"). However, members of the pro-independence faction began their own clandestine campaign to enlist support for their cause, and in February 1526 gained the support of bishop Pierre de la Baume. Elections to the Grand Council took place the same month and led to a pro-independence majority that voted to break away from Savoy rule. Eventually the Grand Council succeeded in protecting the liberty of its [[Bourgeois of Geneva|citizens]] by establishing union with the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] ({{lang|de|Alte Eidgenossenschaft}}), by concluding on February 20, 1526 a treaty of alliance with Bern and Fribourg. On March 12, representatives of the other Swiss cantons appeared before the Grand Council in Geneva and swore to protect that republic as part of their confederation.\n\n== Reformation ==\n[[File:ReformationWallGeneva.JPG|thumb|[[Reformation Wall|The International Monument to the Reformation]]]]\n[[File:Map of Geneva in 1841.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Geneva and surroundings in 1841. The colossal fortifications were demolished ten years later.]]\n[[File:Suisses a Geneve 1814.png|thumb|left|Swiss Army in Geneva on June 1, 1814 (painting from 1880 by  [[:fr:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dufaux|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dufaux]])]]\nGeneva, home of [[Calvinism]], was one of the great centres of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. While [[Bern]] favoured the introduction of the new teaching and demanded liberty of preaching for the Reformers [[Guillaume Farel]] and [[Antoine Froment]], Catholic [[Fribourg]] renounced in 1533 its allegiance with Geneva.\n\n=== Background to the Protestant Reformation ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2015}}\nIn 1523, the first Protestants, refugees from France, arrived in Geneva. The new theology soon became very popular. The power of the Catholic Church in Geneva was further weakened following an abortive rebellion in 1526 by the priests in protest of the alliance with Bern and Fribourg. In July 1527, all Catholic priests of noble descent were expelled from Geneva due to their pro-Savoy sentiments. The bishop fled from Geneva to [[Gex, Ain|Gex]] in August 1527, in order to save himself from capture or assassination by Charles III's agents, but still remained officially the bishop of Geneva. The bishop supported for a while the independence of Geneva, but later colluded with Charles III to use his influence to bring about the annulment of the 1526 treaty of alliance. As a result, the [[Grand Council of Geneva|Grand Council]] decided in January 1528 to adhere to the Lutheran faith, and the Pope responded by excommunicating the people of Geneva. Even though Geneva was still under the nominal jurisdiction of a Catholic bishop, the Grand Council took advantage of his absence and initiated a gradual reform in worship along Lutheran lines.\n\nFollowing the 1526 alliance treaty, Charles III of Savoy was not willing to concede defeat in Geneva, and constantly plotted to take over that city again. The fear of Swiss intervention kept him at bay, but he encouraged sporadic acts of violence against Geneva such as acts of robbery and destruction of goods intended for Geneva. The bishop of Geneva, no longer residing within that city, participated in plans to overthrow its independence. Some of the knights who were interested in capturing Geneva for Charles III organized in an unofficial organization termed the Order of the Spoon.<ref>{{cite book|last=d'Aubign\u00e9|first=Jean Henri Merle|title=Geneva and France|year=1880|publisher=R. Carter & brothers|url=https://archive.org/details/historyreformat04unkngoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyreformat04unkngoog/page/n382 357]}}</ref>  The knights of that group attempted an abortive invasion of Geneva by climbing on the city wall with ladders on March 25, 1529, an event to be known as \"day of the ladders\". In addition, the Duke of Savoy sought to convince the other Swiss republics to abrogate their alliance with Geneva, and to that end managed to enlist the support of Francis I of France and of Emperor Charles V. The Emperor Charles V tried to convince the Grand Council of Geneva to return to the Catholic Church, and on July 16, 1529 even wrote a letter to that effect in his own handwriting, but the council of Geneva rejected the plea and Charles V became determined to act with force. The Swiss Federation was alarmed by these developments, and in May 1530 a joint delegation from Bern, Fribourg, [[Zurich]], [[Basel]] and [[Solothurn]] suggested to the Grand Council the abrogation of the 1526 alliance treaty in exchange for looser cooperation. The Grand Council rejected the offer and decided to oppose any attempt to restore Geneva to Savoy rule.\n\nOn June 24, 1530, the Grand Council arrested a public prosecutor named Mandolia, who was a supporter of duke Charles III, and this irritated bishop Baume, who retaliated by arresting Genevan merchants in Gex, where he now resided. He also made a pact with the Knights of the Spoon, and on August 20, issued an episcopal decree ordering them to wage war in order to restore Geneva to its rightful rulers. On September 30, the attack began, as the Knights of the Spoon were joined by the forces of Charles III, reaching up to 800 soldiers total. The Genevan army was only about 600 men strong, but on October 10 reinforcements of about 10,000 men strong arrived from Bern and Fribourg.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oechsli|first=Wilhelm|title=History of Switzerland, 1499-1914|year=1922|publisher=The University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofswitzer00oechuoft|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofswitzer00oechuoft/page/136 136]}}</ref>  In addition, Emperor Charles V, even though a supporter of Savoy interests, refused to participate in that war, and the invading army was forced to withdraw. Following the Savoyard withdrawal, a peace treaty was concluded between Geneva and bishop Baume, by which the Grand Council in Geneva released Mandolia from prison and the bishop released the Genevans arrested at Gex.\n\nDuring the [[Second War of Kappel]] in October 1531, Geneva was politically divided, as the government of Bern requested military aid for the Protestants of Zurich, while Fribourg requested that for the Catholic party. The Grand Council of Geneva was torn between the two parties, but decided to split its forces and assist both simultaneously. Following the defeat of Zurich in the war, Fribourg renounced its alliance with Geneva. As a result, Charles III of Savoy renewed his plans of capturing Geneva. This alarmed the governments of Bern and Fribourg to the point of suggesting to Geneva to renounce the alliance treaty of 1526 and accept Savoy rule, which the council of Geneva rejected.\n\nIn June 1532, street skirmishes between Catholics and Protestants broke out, and the government of Fribourg threatened to tear up its alliance with Geneva if Protestant practices were permitted. The government of Bern, however, pressured the Grand Council of Geneva to allow Protestant preaching. The authority of the Catholic bishop was no longer recognized by the people and institutions of Geneva, but at first they refused to commit their city to the Protestant cause, for fear of antagonizing the Catholic rulers of adjacent kingdoms as well as the Catholic priests within Geneva.\n\n=== Compromise between Catholics and Protestants ===\nThe Catholic priests and monks in Geneva remained a significant social force to reckon with, and used their influence in order to bring about the expulsion of the Protestant preachers, and on March 28, 1533 even tried to incite the Catholic masses to massacre the Protestants - a scheme that failed due to emotions of city solidarity and Grand Council efforts to restore the peace. The Grand Council was cautious in its policies, and attempted a middle course between the two factions. As part of that middle course, it yielded to Protestant demands by approving in March 1533 the publication of the [[Bible]] in French, but only a conservative translation that did not appeal to Protestant sentiments and was acceptable to the Catholics in the republic. The Grand Council also had to take into consideration the need to remain in alliance with both Catholic and Protestant cantons. In February 1533, Fribourg openly revoked the alliance treaty of 1526, and later even made plans to invade Geneva.\n\nIn order to keep the peace between Catholics and Protestants as well as a policy of neutrality between the Catholic and Protestant powers, the Grand Council of Geneva on March 30, 1533 passed a statute of compromise which permitted every Genevan to choose his religious affiliation, while prohibiting open attacks on Catholic doctrines and practices and all religious preaching in open places for both parties. Eating meat on Fridays was prohibited for both parties.<ref>[[Jean-Henri Merle d'Aubign\u00e9]], ''History of the Reformation in Europe in the Time of Calvin'' (En. tr., New York, 1864), vol. III pp. 397-398</ref> However, neither had the intention of abiding by the statute, and street riots broke out from time to time.\n\n=== Protestant triumph ===\nEven after the ousting of bishop la Baume from Geneva, the triumph of Protestantism was not assured, as the Catholic faction within that city conspired with Fribourg to act for the return of the Catholic bishop to Geneva. La Baume himself was reluctant at first, but [[Pope Clement VII]] pressured him to accept. On July 3, 1533 - with military aid from Fribourg - the bishop once again entered Geneva in a procession. The Grand Council demanded from the bishop to honor the traditional freedoms of the republic, which he promised to uphold. However, soon the bishop started arresting conspicuous Protestants in Geneva, and there were rumors that he intended to remove the prisoners to Fribourg and placed beyond the Grand Council's reach. On July 12 riots broke out, and the bishop yielded to popular clamor and delivered the prisoners to the Council's custody. Fearing for his life, the bishop decided to flee the city, which he did on July 14, this time never to return, while moving his headquarters to [[Arbois]] and later to [[Chambery]]. However, de la Baume officially remained the bishop of Geneva and Catholic priests and monks still remained a strong faction within the city. The bishop still tried to exercise his jurisdiction over Geneva and on October 24, 1533 wrote a letter to the council, demanding it to stop Protestant preaching in Geneva, which the council refused to do.\n\nFollowing the bishop's flight, the influence of Protestant preachers in Geneva increased, and this was achieved to the chagrin of the local Catholic priests due to pressure from Bern, which threatened to revoke the 1526 alliance treaty unless freedom was granted to Protestants. In addition, the exiled bishop was gradually losing popularity also with the Catholic sections of Genevan society due to numerous attempts to meddle by proxy with the republic's judicial affairs, which the Genevans viewed as attacks on the liberties of their city. As a result of that, the Grand Council agreed in January 1534 to allow the trials of clergyman by secular authorities. The Catholic influence within Geneva was further diminished following the flight on July 30, 1534 of part of its Catholic population due to the rising tensions between Catholics and Protestants, and at the February 1535 election to the Grand Council, a Protestant majority was secured. Bishop de la Baume, seeing that Geneva was becoming Protestant, issued a decree on June 13, 1535 prohibiting trade with Geneva on pain of [[excommunication]]. The Grand Council, even though consisted of a Protestant majority, still refrained from proclaiming the city as Protestant, for fear of reprisals from Catholic neighboring kingdoms. In order to compel the council to make that move, Protestant leaders such as Guillaume Farel began agitating the crowds to [[Iconoclasm|demolish icons]] and throw the wafers of the [[eucharist]] to the ground in Catholic churches. As a measure of compromise between the two groups, the Grand Council resolved on August 10, 1535, to prohibit the breaking of icons on one hand and to prohibit the celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on the other. This move increased further the flight of Catholics from the city into Savoy territories. Following another unsuccessful invasion of Geneva by Savoy forces in October 1535, which ended in a Savoy defeat at [[Gingins]], the Grand Council decided on February 3, 1536 on the destruction of all castles around Geneva in order not to allow any princes another pretext for invading their city.\n\nOn May 21, 1536, the Genevans declared themselves Protestant by taking a public oath of allegiance to the Lutheran faith where all residents took part, and proclaimed their city a republic.<ref name=Encarta/> This move was in the making for a long time, but was delayed for fears of Savoy invasion. However, the French invasion of Savoy territories earlier that year had removed that obstacle.\n\nThe Protestant leader [[John Calvin]] was based in Geneva from 1536 to his death in 1564 (save for an exile from 1538 to 1541) and became the spiritual leader of the city, a position created by the Grand Council as the city turned Protestant. Geneva became a center of Protestant activity, producing works such as the [[Genevan Psalter]], though there were often tensions between Calvin and the city's civil authorities. Calvin also supported the admission into Geneva of Protestant refugees, which some circles strongly opposed.\n\nThough the city proper remained a Protestant stronghold, a large part of the historic diocese returned to Catholicism in the early seventeenth century under [[St. Francis de Sales]]. Geneva has played a historical role in the spread of Protestantism.\n\nIn addition to becoming a Protestant state, Geneva in the 16th century also became a kind of welfare state, as a general state hospital was established in 1535 by the wealthy Protestant Claude Salomon. A centralized education system was established with the cooperation of John Calvin.\n\n==17th century==\nIn [[L'Escalade]] of 1602 the Duke of Savoy attempted to conquer Geneva.\n\n== 18th century ==\nThroughout this century,<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = Richard Whatmore\n | authorlink = \n | editor = \n | editor-link = \n |date=April 2012\n | title = Geneva's Long Shadow\n | journal = History Today\n | volume = 62\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 37\u201343\n | format = \n | arxiv = \n | id = \n | bibcode = \n | doi = \n | accessdate = \n | url = \n}}</ref> Geneva was plagued by strife between the Francophone oligarchy and radical populist opponents. The elite dominated the councils of the republic, and used their position to raise indirect taxes which hurt the poor more than the rich. They were accused of being pro-French libertine rentiers, committed neither to the republic nor to Calvinism, whereas the opposition subscribed to strict Calvinism and populist republicanism.\n\nConflict between these factions led to rioting in 1734\u20131737, which was settled after the diplomatic intervention of France and Geneva's two Swiss allies, Bern and Zurich. In the 1750s the opposition, led by watchmaker Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Deluc (1698\u20131780), began to call themselves the ''repr\u00e9sentants'' (representatives). They wanted the General Council ([[wikt:AKA|AKA]] the Grand Council, Geneva's legislature) to more truly represent the people and to re-assert its power over the aristocratic ministers on the Council of Twenty-Five (the executive council). This did not happen, but further unrest in 1767 led to another French-brokered agreement between elitists and populists.\n\nMeanwhile, a quarrel between French-speaking intellectuals whipped up the unrest still further. A piece written by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] appeared in 1757 in volume 7 of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' criticising the puritanism of Geneva's Calvinist pastors and advocating the adoption of the enlightened arts as in France. [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] fell out with him and other ''philosophes'' such as [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]] over this, advocating stricter morals and siding with the radicals, although not going so far as to advocate democracy.\n\nFinally, in the abortive [[Geneva Revolution of 1782]], revolutionary ideologues and working-class activists demanding a broader franchise seized the state. Popular representatives were elected to an executive committee which proceeded to enact wide-ranging reforms. However France, Bern and Savoy sent a military force to Geneva, causing the leading revolutionaries to flee to nearby [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] (then under [[Prussia]]), saying they would refound Geneva elsewhere along with industrious fellow-citizens. The invaders imposed a new constitution on Geneva  entrenching the aristocracy. This caused many Genevans to emigrate and try to build a new Geneva at, for example, [[Waterford]], [[Cologne]] or [[Brussels]]. Many radical \u00e9migr\u00e9s went on to do great things, such as participating in the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u20131799).\n\nDuring the French Revolution period, aristocratic and democratic factions again contended for control of Geneva.<ref name=Encarta/>  In 1798, however, France, then under the [[French Directory|Directory]], annexed Geneva and its surrounding territory.<ref name=Encarta/>\n\n== 19th century ==\n[[File:DV307 no.78 Geneva Aug 1858.png|thumb|Geneva, sketched by [[Frances Elizabeth Wynne]] in August 1858]]\nIn 1802, the diocese was united with that of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chamb\u00e9ry|Chamb\u00e9ry]]. At the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814\u201315, the territory of Geneva was extended to cover 15 Savoyard and six French parishes, with more than 16,000 Catholics; at the same time it was admitted to the [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]]. The Congress expressly provided\u2014and the same proviso was included in the [[Treaty of Turin (1816)|Treaty of Turin]] (16 March 1816)\u2014that in these territories transferred to Geneva the Catholic religion was to be protected, and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without the approval of the Holy See. The city's neutrality was guaranteed by the Congress.<ref name=Encarta/> [[Pius VII]] in 1819 united the city of Geneva and 20 parishes with the [[Diocese of Lausanne]], while the rest of the ancient [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg|Diocese of Geneva]] (outside of Switzerland) was reconstituted, in 1822, as the French [[Diocese of Annecy]]. [[File:Geneve panorama 1860.JPG|thumb|right|View of Geneva in 1860]] The Great Council of Geneva (cantonal council) afterwards ignored the responsibilities thus undertaken; in imitation of Napoleon's \"Organic Articles\", it insisted upon the ''[[List of Latin phrases: P|Placet]]'', or previous approval of publication, for all papal documents. Catholic indignation ran high at the civil measures taken against Marilley, the parish priest of Geneva and later bishop of the see, and at the ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', which obliged them to contribute to the budget of the Protestant Church and to that of the [[Old Catholic Church]], without providing any public aid for Catholicism.\n\n== 20th century ==\nOn 30 June 1907, aided by strong Catholic support, Geneva adopted a [[separation of church and state]]. The Protestant faith received a one-time compensatory sum of 800,000 Swiss francs (then about US$160,000), while other faiths received nothing. Since then the Canton of Geneva has given aid to no creed from either state or municipal revenues.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-02454, Genf, Schlusssitzung des V\u00f6lkerbundrates.jpg|thumb|left|League of Nations conference in 1926]]\nThe international status of the city was highlighted after World War I when Geneva became the seat of the [[League of Nations]] in 1919\u2014notably through the work of the Federal Council member [[Gustave Ador|Gustav Ador]] and of Swiss diplomat [[William Rappard]], who was one of the founders of the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]], Europe's oldest graduate school of international and development studies. Furthermore, the [[International School of Geneva]], the oldest currently operating International School in the world, was founded in 1924 by senior members of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[International Labor Office]].\n\nIn the wake of the war, a [[class struggle]] in Switzerland grew and culminated in a [[general strike]] throughout the country\u2014beginning on [[Armistice Day]], 11 November 1918, and directed from the German-speaking part of the nation.

Now the principal French-speaking city of [[Switzerland]], [[Geneva]] was an independent city state from the [[Middle Ages]] until the end of the 18th century. [[John Calvin]] was the Protestant leader of the city in the 16th century.\n\n== Antiquity and Early Middle Ages==\nGeneva first appears in history as an [[Allobroges|Allobrogian]] border town, fortified against the Celtic [[Helvetii]] tribe, which the Romans took in 121 BC.\n\nIn 58 BC, Caesar, Roman governor of Gaul, destroyed the Rh\u00f4ne bridge at Geneva and built a 19-mile earthwork from Lake Geneva to the [[Jura Mountains]] in order to block the migration of the Helvetii, who \"attempted, sometimes by day, more often by night, to break through, either by joining boats together and making a number of rafts (''ratis''), or by fording the Rh\u00f4ne where the depth of the stream was least\" (De Bello Gallico, I, 8). Then he helped establish Geneva as a Roman city ([[vicus]] and then [[civitas]]) by setting up camp there and significantly increasing its size.\n\nIn 443, Geneva was taken by Burgundy, and with the latter fell to the [[Frankish Kingdom|Franks]] in 534. In 888 the town was part of the new [[Kingdom of Burgundy]], and with it was taken over in 1033 by the German Emperor.\n\nIn 563, according to the writings of [[Gregory of Tours]] and [[Marius Aventicensis]], a [[tsunami]] swept along Lake Geneva, destroying many settlements, and causing numerous deaths in Geneva. Simulations indicate that this [[Tauredunum event]] was most likely caused by a massive [[landslide]] near where the [[Rhone]] flows into the lake, which caused a wave eight meters high to reach Geneva within 70 minutes.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kremer | first1 = K. | last2 = Simpson | first2 = G. | last3 = Girardclos | first3 = S.

Moutiers, 1871), Geneva was Christianised by Dionysius Areopagita and Paracodus, two of the 72 disciples, in the time of [[Domitian]]. Dionysius went thence to Paris and Paracodus became the first Bishop of [[Bishopric of Geneva|Geneva]] \u2013 but the legend is based on an error, as is that which makes St. Lazarus the first Bishop of Geneva, arising out of the similarity between the Latin names Genava (Geneva) and [[Genoa|Genua]] (Genoa, in northern Italy). The so-called \"Catalogue de St. Pierre\", which names St. Diogenus (Diogenes) as the first Bishop of Geneva, is unreliable.\n\nA letter of [[St. Eucherius]] to Salvius makes it almost certain that the name of the first bishop (c. 400) was Isaac. In 440, [[Salonius]] appears as Bishop of Geneva; he was a son of Eucherius, to whom the latter dedicated his Instructiones'; he took part in the [[Council of Orange (441)]], [[Vaison-la-Romaine|Vaison]] (442) and [[Archbishopric of Arles|Arles]] (about 455), and is supposed to be the author of two small commentaries, ''In parabolas Salomonis'' and on Ecclesisastis.<ref>''In parabolas Salomonis'' and \"on Ecclesisastis\", in P.

The bishops of Geneva had the status of [[prince of the Holy Roman Empire]] from 1154, but had to maintain a long struggle for their independence against the guardians (''advocati'') of the see, the counts of [[County of Geneva|Geneva]] and later the counts of the [[House of Savoy]].\n\nIn 1290, the latter obtained the right of installing the [[vice-dominus]] of the diocese, the title of \"Vidame of Geneva\"<ref>Dioecesis Lausannensis, Genevensis, et Friburgensis, Protocol Records 1200 - 1300, Holy See</ref> was granted by [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]] in the name of the [[Holy See]] (by the [[Foreign relations of the Holy See]]) to the counts of the [[House of Candia]] under count [[Fran\u00e7ois de Candie]] of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]]-Le-Vieux a Chatellaine of the Savoy, this official exercised minor jurisdiction in the town in the bishop's absence.\n\nIn 1387, Bishop Adh\u00e9mar Fabry granted the town its great charter, the basis of its communal self-government,<ref name=Columbia>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Geneva|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-GenevaSwi.html|encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]}}</ref> which every bishop on his accession was expected to confirm. The line of the counts of Geneva ended in 1394, and the House of Savoy came into possession of their territory, assuming after 1416 the title of Duke. The new dynasty sought to bring the city of Geneva under their power, particularly by elevating members of their own family to the episcopal see. In 1447 [[Antipope Felix V]], who was also Duke of [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]], appointed himself as bishop of Geneva, and the Savoy dynasty ruled the episcopal see until 1490, when popular pressure compelled the dynasty to renounce the title of bishop.\n\nIn 1457 a major government organ was established in Geneva, known as the [[Grand Council of Geneva|Grand Council]], which first consisted of 50 deputies and later their number was raised to 200. The members of the Grand Council were elected every year in early February. The Grand Council represented the [[Bourgeois of Geneva|citizens of Geneva]] and decided on political matters and also elected the bishops of Geneva after that position was renounced by the Savoy dynasty in 1490. This same council gradually became estranged from the Duke of Savoy. A new cause of friction between the Grand Council and the Duke of Savoy evolved in 1513, when [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Charles III]] decided to appoint his cousin John of Savoy as bishop and even secured Papal endorsement. Despite being bishop of Geneva, the new Savoy bishop resided most of the time in [[Pignerol]] in Northern Italy, another factor enhancing the alienation between the people in Geneva and the Savoy dynasty.\n\n[[File:History of the great reformation in Europe in the times of Luther and Calvin.. (1870) (14765803955).jpg|thumb|left|[[:fr:Jean P\u00e9colat|Jean P\u00e9colat]] (in French) being tortured in 1517 under the order of [[:fr:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Savoie|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Savoie]] (in French), Bishop of Geneva]]\n\nIn 1519, the Grand Council of Geneva attempted to forge an alliance with Fribourg, but the Duke of Savoy responded with invasion of the republic, which led to the execution of [[Philibert Berthelier (Geneva patriot)|Philibert Berthelier]] and suspension of the Grand Council's powers. However, after that date the power of Savoy over Geneva gradually declined. In 1521 Jean of Savoy died, and the Grand Council appealed to Pope Leo X to appoint the next bishop, who then appointed [[Pierre de la Baume]]. In addition, the Duke of Savoy also tried to reconcile his political ambitions with local Genevan patriotism, and in 1523 marched into Geneva in a ceremony designated to appease its population, and tried to gain the support of the Geneva merchants by promising them a share in the trade with the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] ([[Beatrice of Portugal, Duchess of Savoy|his wife's]] country of origin) and its territories in [[Brazil]]. However, the independence faction in Geneva did not accept these gestures. Another political crisis occurred in 1524, when the treasurer of Geneva, [[Bernard Boulet]], a supporter of Savoy rule, was accused by the Grand Council of embezzlement. He reacted to the accusations by appealing to Charles III to curtail the powers of the council once more, to which the Duke responded by confiscating assets held by council members in other territories under Savoy rule.\n\nIn January 1525 the council appealed to the Pope to excommunicate Charles III. The deputies' attempt to enlist the support of the bishop [[Pierre de la Baume]] for their cause failed, and the Pope rejected their request. However, Charles III feared another rebellion, and in September 1525 made another proposal of power-sharing to the Grand Council of Geneva, which the council endorsed by 53-42. However, Charles III was not satisfied with this and started a new invasion of Geneva in order to destroy the pro-independence faction. The pro-independence faction fled to Fribourg, and in December 1525 the Grand Council acknowledged Charles III as the true sovereign of Geneva (a session known as the \"Assembly of [[Halberd]]s\"). However, members of the pro-independence faction began their own clandestine campaign to enlist support for their cause, and in February 1526 gained the support of bishop Pierre de la Baume. Elections to the Grand Council took place the same month and led to a pro-independence majority that voted to break away from Savoy rule. Eventually the Grand Council succeeded in protecting the liberty of its [[Bourgeois of Geneva|citizens]] by establishing union with the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] ({{lang|de|Alte Eidgenossenschaft}}), by concluding on February 20, 1526 a treaty of alliance with Bern and Fribourg. On March 12, representatives of the other Swiss cantons appeared before the Grand Council in Geneva and swore to protect that republic as part of their confederation.\n\n== Reformation ==\n[[File:ReformationWallGeneva.JPG|thumb|[[Reformation Wall|The International Monument to the Reformation]]]]\n[[File:Map of Geneva in 1841.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Geneva and surroundings in 1841. The colossal fortifications were demolished ten years later.]]\n[[File:Suisses a Geneve 1814.png|thumb|left|Swiss Army in Geneva on June 1, 1814 (painting from 1880 by  [[:fr:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dufaux|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dufaux]])]]\nGeneva, home of [[Calvinism]], was one of the great centres of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. While [[Bern]] favoured the introduction of the new teaching and demanded liberty of preaching for the Reformers [[Guillaume Farel]] and [[Antoine Froment]], Catholic [[Fribourg]] renounced in 1533 its allegiance with Geneva.\n\n=== Background to the Protestant Reformation ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2015}}\nIn 1523, the first Protestants, refugees from France, arrived in Geneva. The new theology soon became very popular. The power of the Catholic Church in Geneva was further weakened following an abortive rebellion in 1526 by the priests in protest of the alliance with Bern and Fribourg. In July 1527, all Catholic priests of noble descent were expelled from Geneva due to their pro-Savoy sentiments. The bishop fled from Geneva to [[Gex, Ain|Gex]] in August 1527, in order to save himself from capture or assassination by Charles III's agents, but still remained officially the bishop of Geneva. The bishop supported for a while the independence of Geneva, but later colluded with Charles III to use his influence to bring about the annulment of the 1526 treaty of alliance. As a result, the [[Grand Council of Geneva|Grand Council]] decided in January 1528 to adhere to the Lutheran faith, and the Pope responded by excommunicating the people of Geneva. Even though Geneva was still under the nominal jurisdiction of a Catholic bishop, the Grand Council took advantage of his absence and initiated a gradual reform in worship along Lutheran lines.\n\nFollowing the 1526 alliance treaty, Charles III of Savoy was not willing to concede defeat in Geneva, and constantly plotted to take over that city again. The fear of Swiss intervention kept him at bay, but he encouraged sporadic acts of violence against Geneva such as acts of robbery and destruction of goods intended for Geneva. The bishop of Geneva, no longer residing within that city, participated in plans to overthrow its independence. Some of the knights who were interested in capturing Geneva for Charles III organized in an unofficial organization termed the Order of the Spoon.<ref>{{cite book|last=d'Aubign\u00e9|first=Jean Henri Merle|title=Geneva and France|year=1880|publisher=R. Carter & brothers|url=https://archive.org/details/historyreformat04unkngoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyreformat04unkngoog/page/n382 357]}}</ref>  The knights of that group attempted an abortive invasion of Geneva by climbing on the city wall with ladders on March 25, 1529, an event to be known as \"day of the ladders\". In addition, the Duke of Savoy sought to convince the other Swiss republics to abrogate their alliance with Geneva, and to that end managed to enlist the support of Francis I of France and of Emperor Charles V. The Emperor Charles V tried to convince the Grand Council of Geneva to return to the Catholic Church, and on July 16, 1529 even wrote a letter to that effect in his own handwriting, but the council of Geneva rejected the plea and Charles V became determined to act with force. The Swiss Federation was alarmed by these developments, and in May 1530 a joint delegation from Bern, Fribourg, [[Zurich]], [[Basel]] and [[Solothurn]] suggested to the Grand Council the abrogation of the 1526 alliance treaty in exchange for looser cooperation. The Grand Council rejected the offer and decided to oppose any attempt to restore Geneva to Savoy rule.\n\nOn June 24, 1530, the Grand Council arrested a public prosecutor named Mandolia, who was a supporter of duke Charles III, and this irritated bishop Baume, who retaliated by arresting Genevan merchants in Gex, where he now resided. He also made a pact with the Knights of the Spoon, and on August 20, issued an episcopal decree ordering them to wage war in order to restore Geneva to its rightful rulers. On September 30, the attack began, as the Knights of the Spoon were joined by the forces of Charles III, reaching up to 800 soldiers total. The Genevan army was only about 600 men strong, but on October 10 reinforcements of about 10,000 men strong arrived from Bern and Fribourg.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oechsli|first=Wilhelm|title=History of Switzerland, 1499-1914|year=1922|publisher=The University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofswitzer00oechuoft|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofswitzer00oechuoft/page/136 136]}}</ref>  In addition, Emperor Charles V, even though a supporter of Savoy interests, refused to participate in that war, and the invading army was forced to withdraw. Following the Savoyard withdrawal, a peace treaty was concluded between Geneva and bishop Baume, by which the Grand Council in Geneva released Mandolia from prison and the bishop released the Genevans arrested at Gex.\n\nDuring the [[Second War of Kappel]] in October 1531, Geneva was politically divided, as the government of Bern requested military aid for the Protestants of Zurich, while Fribourg requested that for the Catholic party. The Grand Council of Geneva was torn between the two parties, but decided to split its forces and assist both simultaneously. Following the defeat of Zurich in the war, Fribourg renounced its alliance with Geneva. As a result, Charles III of Savoy renewed his plans of capturing Geneva. This alarmed the governments of Bern and Fribourg to the point of suggesting to Geneva to renounce the alliance treaty of 1526 and accept Savoy rule, which the council of Geneva rejected.\n\nIn June 1532, street skirmishes between Catholics and Protestants broke out, and the government of Fribourg threatened to tear up its alliance with Geneva if Protestant practices were permitted. The government of Bern, however, pressured the Grand Council of Geneva to allow Protestant preaching. The authority of the Catholic bishop was no longer recognized by the people and institutions of Geneva, but at first they refused to commit their city to the Protestant cause, for fear of antagonizing the Catholic rulers of adjacent kingdoms as well as the Catholic priests within Geneva.\n\n=== Compromise between Catholics and Protestants ===\nThe Catholic priests and monks in Geneva remained a significant social force to reckon with, and used their influence in order to bring about the expulsion of the Protestant preachers, and on March 28, 1533 even tried to incite the Catholic masses to massacre the Protestants - a scheme that failed due to emotions of city solidarity and Grand Council efforts to restore the peace. The Grand Council was cautious in its policies, and attempted a middle course between the two factions. As part of that middle course, it yielded to Protestant demands by approving in March 1533 the publication of the [[Bible]] in French, but only a conservative translation that did not appeal to Protestant sentiments and was acceptable to the Catholics in the republic. The Grand Council also had to take into consideration the need to remain in alliance with both Catholic and Protestant cantons. In February 1533, Fribourg openly revoked the alliance treaty of 1526, and later even made plans to invade Geneva.\n\nIn order to keep the peace between Catholics and Protestants as well as a policy of neutrality between the Catholic and Protestant powers, the Grand Council of Geneva on March 30, 1533 passed a statute of compromise which permitted every Genevan to choose his religious affiliation, while prohibiting open attacks on Catholic doctrines and practices and all religious preaching in open places for both parties. Eating meat on Fridays was prohibited for both parties.<ref>[[Jean-Henri Merle d'Aubign\u00e9]], ''History of the Reformation in Europe in the Time of Calvin'' (En. tr., New York, 1864), vol. III pp. 397-398</ref> However, neither had the intention of abiding by the statute, and street riots broke out from time to time.\n\n=== Protestant triumph ===\nEven after the ousting of bishop la Baume from Geneva, the triumph of Protestantism was not assured, as the Catholic faction within that city conspired with Fribourg to act for the return of the Catholic bishop to Geneva. La Baume himself was reluctant at first, but [[Pope Clement VII]] pressured him to accept. On July 3, 1533 - with military aid from Fribourg - the bishop once again entered Geneva in a procession. The Grand Council demanded from the bishop to honor the traditional freedoms of the republic, which he promised to uphold. However, soon the bishop started arresting conspicuous Protestants in Geneva, and there were rumors that he intended to remove the prisoners to Fribourg and placed beyond the Grand Council's reach. On July 12 riots broke out, and the bishop yielded to popular clamor and delivered the prisoners to the Council's custody. Fearing for his life, the bishop decided to flee the city, which he did on July 14, this time never to return, while moving his headquarters to [[Arbois]] and later to [[Chambery]]. However, de la Baume officially remained the bishop of Geneva and Catholic priests and monks still remained a strong faction within the city. The bishop still tried to exercise his jurisdiction over Geneva and on October 24, 1533 wrote a letter to the council, demanding it to stop Protestant preaching in Geneva, which the council refused to do.\n\nFollowing the bishop's flight, the influence of Protestant preachers in Geneva increased, and this was achieved to the chagrin of the local Catholic priests due to pressure from Bern, which threatened to revoke the 1526 alliance treaty unless freedom was granted to Protestants. In addition, the exiled bishop was gradually losing popularity also with the Catholic sections of Genevan society due to numerous attempts to meddle by proxy with the republic's judicial affairs, which the Genevans viewed as attacks on the liberties of their city. As a result of that, the Grand Council agreed in January 1534 to allow the trials of clergyman by secular authorities. The Catholic influence within Geneva was further diminished following the flight on July 30, 1534 of part of its Catholic population due to the rising tensions between Catholics and Protestants, and at the February 1535 election to the Grand Council, a Protestant majority was secured. Bishop de la Baume, seeing that Geneva was becoming Protestant, issued a decree on June 13, 1535 prohibiting trade with Geneva on pain of [[excommunication]]. The Grand Council, even though consisted of a Protestant majority, still refrained from proclaiming the city as Protestant, for fear of reprisals from Catholic neighboring kingdoms. In order to compel the council to make that move, Protestant leaders such as Guillaume Farel began agitating the crowds to [[Iconoclasm|demolish icons]] and throw the wafers of the [[eucharist]] to the ground in Catholic churches. As a measure of compromise between the two groups, the Grand Council resolved on August 10, 1535, to prohibit the breaking of icons on one hand and to prohibit the celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on the other. This move increased further the flight of Catholics from the city into Savoy territories. Following another unsuccessful invasion of Geneva by Savoy forces in October 1535, which ended in a Savoy defeat at [[Gingins]], the Grand Council decided on February 3, 1536 on the destruction of all castles around Geneva in order not to allow any princes another pretext for invading their city.\n\nOn May 21, 1536, the Genevans declared themselves Protestant by taking a public oath of allegiance to the Lutheran faith where all residents took part, and proclaimed their city a republic.<ref name=Encarta/> This move was in the making for a long time, but was delayed for fears of Savoy invasion. However, the French invasion of Savoy territories earlier that year had removed that obstacle.\n\nThe Protestant leader [[John Calvin]] was based in Geneva from 1536 to his death in 1564 (save for an exile from 1538 to 1541) and became the spiritual leader of the city, a position created by the Grand Council as the city turned Protestant. Geneva became a center of Protestant activity, producing works such as the [[Genevan Psalter]], though there were often tensions between Calvin and the city's civil authorities. Calvin also supported the admission into Geneva of Protestant refugees, which some circles strongly opposed.\n\nThough the city proper remained a Protestant stronghold, a large part of the historic diocese returned to Catholicism in the early seventeenth century under [[St. Francis de Sales]]. Geneva has played a historical role in the spread of Protestantism.\n\nIn addition to becoming a Protestant state, Geneva in the 16th century also became a kind of welfare state, as a general state hospital was established in 1535 by the wealthy Protestant Claude Salomon. A centralized education system was established with the cooperation of John Calvin.\n\n==17th century==\nIn [[L'Escalade]] of 1602 the Duke of Savoy attempted to conquer Geneva.\n\n== 18th century ==\nThroughout this century,<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = Richard Whatmore\n | authorlink = \n | editor = \n | editor-link = \n |date=April 2012\n | title = Geneva's Long Shadow\n | journal = History Today\n | volume = 62\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 37\u201343\n | format = \n | arxiv = \n | id = \n | bibcode = \n | doi = \n | accessdate = \n | url = \n}}</ref> Geneva was plagued by strife between the Francophone oligarchy and radical populist opponents. The elite dominated the councils of the republic, and used their position to raise indirect taxes which hurt the poor more than the rich. They were accused of being pro-French libertine rentiers, committed neither to the republic nor to Calvinism, whereas the opposition subscribed to strict Calvinism and populist republicanism.\n\nConflict between these factions led to rioting in 1734\u20131737, which was settled after the diplomatic intervention of France and Geneva's two Swiss allies, Bern and Zurich. In the 1750s the opposition, led by watchmaker Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Deluc (1698\u20131780), began to call themselves the ''repr\u00e9sentants'' (representatives). They wanted the General Council ([[wikt:AKA|AKA]] the Grand Council, Geneva's legislature) to more truly represent the people and to re-assert its power over the aristocratic ministers on the Council of Twenty-Five (the executive council). This did not happen, but further unrest in 1767 led to another French-brokered agreement between elitists and populists.\n\nMeanwhile, a quarrel between French-speaking intellectuals whipped up the unrest still further. A piece written by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] appeared in 1757 in volume 7 of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' criticising the puritanism of Geneva's Calvinist pastors and advocating the adoption of the enlightened arts as in France. [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] fell out with him and other ''philosophes'' such as [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]] over this, advocating stricter morals and siding with the radicals, although not going so far as to advocate democracy.\n\nFinally, in the abortive [[Geneva Revolution of 1782]], revolutionary ideologues and working-class activists demanding a broader franchise seized the state. Popular representatives were elected to an executive committee which proceeded to enact wide-ranging reforms. However France, Bern and Savoy sent a military force to Geneva, causing the leading revolutionaries to flee to nearby [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] (then under [[Prussia]]), saying they would refound Geneva elsewhere along with industrious fellow-citizens. The invaders imposed a new constitution on Geneva  entrenching the aristocracy. This caused many Genevans to emigrate and try to build a new Geneva at, for example, [[Waterford]], [[Cologne]] or [[Brussels]]. Many radical \u00e9migr\u00e9s went on to do great things, such as participating in the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u20131799).\n\nDuring the French Revolution period, aristocratic and democratic factions again contended for control of Geneva.<ref name=Encarta/>  In 1798, however, France, then under the [[French Directory|Directory]], annexed Geneva and its surrounding territory.<ref name=Encarta/>\n\n== 19th century ==\n[[File:DV307 no.78 Geneva Aug 1858.png|thumb|Geneva, sketched by [[Frances Elizabeth Wynne]] in August 1858]]\nIn 1802, the diocese was united with that of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chamb\u00e9ry|Chamb\u00e9ry]]. At the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814\u201315, the territory of Geneva was extended to cover 15 Savoyard and six French parishes, with more than 16,000 Catholics; at the same time it was admitted to the [[Restoration and Regeneration in Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]]. The Congress expressly provided\u2014and the same proviso was included in the [[Treaty of Turin (1816)|Treaty of Turin]] (16 March 1816)\u2014that in these territories transferred to Geneva the Catholic religion was to be protected, and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without the approval of the Holy See. The city's neutrality was guaranteed by the Congress.<ref name=Encarta/> [[Pius VII]] in 1819 united the city of Geneva and 20 parishes with the [[Diocese of Lausanne]], while the rest of the ancient [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg|Diocese of Geneva]] (outside of Switzerland) was reconstituted, in 1822, as the French [[Diocese of Annecy]]. [[File:Geneve panorama 1860.JPG|thumb|right|View of Geneva in 1860]] The Great Council of Geneva (cantonal council) afterwards ignored the responsibilities thus undertaken; in imitation of Napoleon's \"Organic Articles\", it insisted upon the ''[[List of Latin phrases: P|Placet]]'', or previous approval of publication, for all papal documents. Catholic indignation ran high at the civil measures taken against Marilley, the parish priest of Geneva and later bishop of the see, and at the ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', which obliged them to contribute to the budget of the Protestant Church and to that of the [[Old Catholic Church]], without providing any public aid for Catholicism.\n\n== 20th century ==\nOn 30 June 1907, aided by strong Catholic support, Geneva adopted a [[separation of church and state]]. The Protestant faith received a one-time compensatory sum of 800,000 Swiss francs (then about US$160,000), while other faiths received nothing. Since then the Canton of Geneva has given aid to no creed from either state or municipal revenues.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-02454, Genf, Schlusssitzung des V\u00f6lkerbundrates.jpg|thumb|left|League of Nations conference in 1926]]\nThe international status of the city was highlighted after World War I when Geneva became the seat of the [[League of Nations]] in 1919\u2014notably through the work of the Federal Council member [[Gustave Ador|Gustav Ador]] and of Swiss diplomat [[William Rappard]], who was one of the founders of the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]], Europe's oldest graduate school of international and development studies. Furthermore, the [[International School of Geneva]], the oldest currently operating International School in the world, was founded in 1924 by senior members of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[International Labor Office]].\n\nIn the wake of the war, a [[class struggle]] in Switzerland grew and culminated in a [[general strike]] throughout the country\u2014beginning on [[Armistice Day]], 11 November 1918, and directed from the German-speaking part of the nation. However the prevailing friendliness toward France in Geneva moderated its effect upon that city.<ref>Binz, Louis ''Br\u00e8ve histoire de Gen\u00e8ve'', p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1932, several small Fascist-inspired political parties, such as the National Union, attacked Socialist leaders, which action led to a later demonstration of the Left against the Fascists. On that occasion, young recruits in the [[Military of Switzerland|Swiss Army]] fired without warning into a crowd, [[Geneva massacre of 9 November 1932|leaving thirteen dead and 63 wounded]].<ref>Binz, Louis ''Br\u00e8ve histoire de Gen\u00e8ve'', p. 69</ref> As a result, a new general strike was called several days later in protest.\n\nAfter World War II, the European headquarters of the United Nations and the seats of dozens of international organizations were installed in Geneva, resulting in the development of tourism and of business.\n\nIn the 1960s, Geneva became one of the first parts of Switzerland in which the [[rights]] movements achieved a certain measure of success.<ref>Binz, Louis ''Br\u00e8ve histoire de Gen\u00e8ve'', p. 78</ref> It was the third canton to grant women's suffrage on the cantonal and communal levels.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Switzerland}}\n* [[Timeline of Geneva]]\n*[[Bourgeois of Geneva]]\n*''[[Outline of Switzerland]]''\n*[[Calvin Auditory]], a chapel in Geneva that played a significant role in the Reformation\n*[[Lausanne and Geneva bishopric(s)]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{see also|Timeline of Geneva#Bibliography}}\n;Published in the 19th century\n* {{cite book |title=Switzerland |publisher = Karl Baedeker |location = Coblenz |year=1863 |chapterurl= https://archive.org/stream/switzerlandwith00firgoog#page/n288/mode/2up |chapter= Geneva }}\n* {{cite book |title=Tourists Handbook to Switzerland |year=1884 |publisher=Nelson |location=London |author=Allbut |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/touristshandboo00allbgoog#page/n239/mode/2up |chapter=Geneva }}\n;Published in the 20th century\n* {{Citation |publisher = Karl Baedeker |location = Leipzig |title = Switzerland, Together with Chamonix and the Italian Lakes |edition=26th |date = 1922 |oclc = 4248970 |chapterurl = https://archive.org/stream/switzerlandtoget00karl#page/255/mode/2up |chapter= Geneva |ol = 23344482M }}\n* Jean de Senarclens, \"''Geneva: Historic Guide''\", Editions du Tricorne, 1995, {{ISBN|2-8293-0144-7}}.\n\n;Published in the 21st century\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180722041229/http://www.helvetia-ge.ch/fileadmin/Helvetia-genevensis/Societe/Histoire/Histoire_de_Geneve.pdf Histoire de Gen\u00e8ve (2006) French]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Florence}}\n[[Category:History of Geneva| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in the 1st millennium BC]]\n[[Category:Former associates of Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Former theocracies]]\n[[Category:Reformation in Switzerland]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHigh and Late Middle Ages:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 53-42 \u2192 53\u201342", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Geneva"}
