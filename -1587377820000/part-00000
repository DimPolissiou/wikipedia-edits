This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account. Ether accounts are pseudonymous in that they are not linked to individual persons, but rather to one or more specific addresses.\n\n===Ether===\n{{Infobox cryptocurrency\n| currency_name = Ether (ETH)\n| image_1 = \n| image_2 = \n| image_background_1 = \n| image_background_2 = \n| image_width_1 = 120\n| alt1 =\n| image_width_2 = \n| alt2 = \n| image_title_1 = ETH Logo\n| image_title_2 = \n| superunit_name_1 = \n| subunit_name_1 = \n| superunit_ratio_1 =\n| subunit_ratio_3 = 10<sup>\u22129</sup>\n| subunit_name_3 = Gwei\n| subunit_ratio_5 = 10<sup>\u221218</sup>\n| subunit_name_5 = Wei\n| plural = Ether(s)\n| symbol = \u039e\n| alt_symbol_title_1 =\n| alt_symbol_1 =\n| ticker_symbol = ETH\n| previous_names =\n| nickname = Ether, Eth\n| precision = 18\n| white_paper = [https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper ethereum whitepaper]\n| implementations = EVM 1\n| initial_release_version = Frontier\n| initial_release_date = {{Start date and age|df=yes|2015|07|30}}\n| code_repository = {{URL|github.com/ethereum}}\n| status = Active\n| latest_release_version = Muir Glacier\n| latest_release_date = {{Start date and age|2020|01|01|df=yes}}\n| project_fork_of = \n| programming_languages = [[C++]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]\n| operating_system = [[Cross-platform software|Cross-platform]]\n| author = [[Vitalik Buterin]], [[Gavin Wood]]\n| developer = Ethereum Foundation\n| source_model = [[Open-source model|Open-Source Model]]\n| license = [[open-source license|Open-Source Licenses]]\n| website = {{URL|ethereum.org}}\n| block_explorer = {{URL|etherchain.org}}, {{URL|etherscan.io}}, {{URL|ethplorer.io}}\n| ledger_start = {{Start date and age|2015|07|30|df=yes}}\n| split_height = 1,920,000\n| split_date = {{Start date and age|2016|07|20|df=yes}}\n| split_from = \n| split_ratio = 1:1\n| hash_function = [[SHA3|Keccack]]\n| issuance_schedule = Block and Uncle/Ommer reward.\n| timestamping = [[Proof-of-work system|Proof-of-Work]] - [[Ethash]]\n| merged_mining_parent = \n| block_time = 15 secs\n| block_reward = 2 ETH\n| circulating_supply = 109,712,230\n| supply_limit =\n| exchange_rate = $278 (Feb. 2020)\n| market_cap = $30.5 billion (Feb. 2020)\n| footnotes = {{notelist|group=infobox}}\n}}\n\n''Ether'' is a fundamental token for operation of Ethereum, which thereby provides a public [[distributed ledger]] for transactions.

In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG), which is a hybrid Proof of Work and Proof of Stake scheme, and Casper Correct-By-Construction (CBC), a separate Proof of Stake design of Casper, are expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/06/11/ethereums-total-supply/|title=Ethereum's supply has crossed 100M, here's what that means|last=Varshney|first=Neer|date=11 June 2018|website=Hard Fork {{!}} The Next Web|language=en-us|access-date=25 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Markets and stores===\nEther can be traded by regular currency [[brokers]], [[cryptocurrency exchanges]], as well as many online [[cryptocurrency wallet]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-11/fans-of-digital-currency-ether-can-now-buy-etns-in-sweden|title=Fans of Digital Currency Ether Can Now Buy ETNs\u2014In Sweden|author=Olga Kharif|date=11 October 2017|website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\n\n=== Virtual Machine ===\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.

This does not rely upon [[unspent transaction outputs]] (UTXOs). The state denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. The state is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate [[Merkle tree|Merkle]] Patricia tree. A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private \"keys\"]] or \"addresses\" which can be used to receive or spend ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 \"HD Wallet\". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.\n\nTo send ether to an account, you need the [[SHA-3|Keccak-256]] hash of the public key of that account.

In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply.

This launched a career on the European nightclub circuit, and the duo began to perform with tigers. They were discovered performing in Paris by Tony Azzie, who asked them to come to Las Vegas in 1967. They spent some time in Puerto Rico, and may have purchased property there.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mydlach  |first1=Jim |last2= Lavery|first2=Jimmy|last3=Mydlach |first3=Louis|date=June 1, 2008 |title=The Secret Life of Siegfried and Roy: How the Tiger Kings Tamed Las Vegas  |url=https://archive.org/details/secretlifeofsieg0000lave  |url-access=registration  |publisher=Phoenix Books |page=[https://archive.org/details/secretlifeofsieg0000lave/page/51 51] |isbn=1597775606}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Ken Feld of [[Feld Entertainment|Irvin & Kenneth Feld Productions]] started the ''Beyond Belief'' show with Siegfried & Roy at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino]].<ref name=ubj>{{cite news|last1=Grove|first1=Lloyd|title=The World According to Kenneth Feld|url=http://upstart.bizjournals.com/views/columns/the-world-according-to/2008/08/28/Interview-With-Kenneth-Feld.html?page=all|accessdate=August 3, 2015|work=Upstart Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=August 28, 2008|page=5,18}}</ref><ref name=lat>{{cite news|title=Disney Ice Extravaganza Opens|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-01/entertainment/ca-6453_1_walt-disney|accessdate=August 10, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Times Wire Services|date=July 1, 1988}}</ref> A revamped version of the show was taken on a world tour in the third quarter of 1988.<ref name=lat/>\n\n==2003 tiger attack==\nOn October 3, 2003, during a show at the [[The Mirage|Mirage]], a seven year old white tiger named Mantecore (frequently misspelled Montecore or Mantacore) attacked Roy. As part of the act but veering off script, Roy held his microphone to Mantecore's mouth and told him to say \"Hello\" to the audience. Mantecore responded by biting Roy's sleeve. Roy swatted the Tiger and barked \"release!\" but Mantecore then knocked Roy down with his leg and pinned him to the floor. \n\nAs standby trainers rushed in from offstage to assist, Mantecore bit into Roy's neck and carried him offstage. Trainers were finally able to get the tiger to release Roy after spraying him with CO<sub>2</sub> canisters, the last resort available.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/siegfried-roys-animal-handler-breaks-silence-tiger-mauling-alleges-cover-up-1197216|title=The Tiger and the Tragic Trick: Siegfried & Roy's Animal Handler Breaks Silence on Mauling, Alleges Cover-Up|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nThe attack severed Roy's spine, inflicted critical blood loss, and caused severe injuries to other parts of his body, permanently affecting his ability to move, walk, and speak.
