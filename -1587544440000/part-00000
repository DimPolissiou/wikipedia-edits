However, Pussy did not go to the sitdown, and Tony thinks that was when the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] flipped him. Later they made him wear a [[Covert listening device|wire]] when he dressed up as Santa. Pussy was a good Santa, but now they need a new one and [[Bobby Baccalieri|Bobby]] is compelled to play the part. He is shy, unhappy, and gauche. \n\nWhen Tony is visiting [[Janice Soprano|Janice]] she starts complaining about a pain in her wrist, which might need an operation, caused by the Russian thug who came to take back [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Svetlana Kirilenko|Svetlana]]'s [[prosthetic leg]].

She ostentatiously embraces and kisses him, while he glances at Tony.

His landslide victory in the 1988 elections from his constituency, Khairpur Mirs, paved way for his appointment as the 17th Chief Minister of Sindh on 2 December 1988.\n\nSubsequently, Shah was elected as a Member of Provincial Assembly (MPA), Sindh in 1990, 1993, 2002 and 2008. He lost the only election of his career in 1997 when the PPP was nearly routed from parliament. Later, he made a bid for a senate seat, and won his first and only senate term in late 1997.<ref>http://www.senate.gov.pk/en/profile.php?uid=347</ref>\n\nHe won seven out of eight general elections he contested, becoming a MPA six times, and Member of National Assembly (MNA) and senator once.

{"title_page": "Legal aid", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=September 2013}}\n'''Legal aid''' is the provision of assistance to people who are unable to afford legal representation and access to the court system. Legal aid is regarded as central in providing access to justice by ensuring [[equality before the law]], the [[right to counsel]] and the [[right to a fair trial]]. This article describes the development of legal aid and its principles, primarily as known in Europe, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[Legal aid in the United States|United States.]]\n\nA number of delivery models for legal aid have emerged, including duty lawyers, community [[legal clinic]]s and the payment of lawyers to deal with cases for individuals who are entitled to legal aid.\n\nLegal aid is essential to guaranteeing equal access to justice for all, as provided for by Article 6.3 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] regarding criminal law cases. Especially for citizens who do not have sufficient financial means, the provision of legal aid to clients by governments will increase the likelihood, within court proceedings, of being assisted by legal professionals for free (or at a lower cost) or of receiving financial aid. Though legal aid aims to create more equity in the sphere of legal practices, aid offered is often limited in its quality or its social impact by economic constraints that dictate who can access these services and where the aforementioned services are geographically located.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abel|first=Richard L.|date=February 1985|title=Law without Politics: Legal Aid under Advanced Capitalism|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/uclalr32&id=493|journal=UCLA Law Review|volume=32|issue=3|pages=474\u2013642|via=HeinOnline}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nLegal aid has a close relationship with the [[welfare state]], and the provision of legal aid by a state is influenced by attitudes towards welfare. Legal aid is a welfare provision by the state to people who could otherwise not afford counsel from the legal system. Legal aid also helps to ensure that welfare provisions are enforced by providing people entitled to welfare provisions, such as social housing, with access to [[legal advice]] and the courts.\n\nHistorically, legal aid has played a strong role in ensuring respect for [[economic, social and cultural rights]] which are engaged in relation to social security, housing, social care, health and education service provision, which may be provided publicly or privately, as well as employment law and anti-discrimination legislation. Jurists such as [[Mauro Cappelletti]] argue that legal aid is essential in providing individuals with access to justice, by allowing the individual legal enforcement of [[economic, social and cultural rights]]. His views developed in the second half of the 20th century, when democracies with capitalist economies established [[liberalism|liberal]] welfare states that focused on the individual. States acted as contractors and service providers within a market-based philosophy that emphasised the [[citizen]] as [[consumer]]. This led to an emphasis on individual enforcement to achieve the realisation of rights for all.<ref name=\"regan\">{{Cite book| last = Regan| first = Francis| title = The Transformation of Legal Aid: Comparative and Historical Studies| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1999| pages =89\u201390 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=khG_4Dk96J4C&dq=legal+aid| isbn = 978-0-19-826589-4 }}</ref>\n\nPrior to the mid-20th century, literature on legal aid emphasised collective enforcement of [[economic, social and cultural rights]]. As classic welfare states were built in the 1940s and following World War II, an underlying principle was that citizens had collective responsibility for economic, social and cultural rights; and the state assumed responsibility for those unable to provide for themselves through illness and unemployment. The enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights was to be collective, through policies rather than individual legal action. Laws were enacted to support welfare provisions, though these were regarded as laws for planners, not lawyers. Legal aid schemes were established, as it was assumed that the state had a responsibility to assist those engaged in legal disputes, but they initially focused primarily on family law and divorce.<ref name=\"regan\"/>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the role of the welfare state changed, and social goals were no longer assumed to be common goals. Individuals were free to pursue their own goals. The welfare state in this time expanded, along with legal aid provisions, as concerns emerged over the power of welfare providers and professionals. In the 1960s and 1970s, demand rose for the right of individuals to legally enforce [[economic, social and cultural rights]] and the welfare provisions they as individuals were entitled to. Mechanisms emerged through which citizens could legally enforce their economic, social and cultural rights, and welfare lawyers used legal aid to advise those on low income when dealing with state officials. Legal aid was extended from family law to a wide range of economic, social and cultural rights.<ref>Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, the role of the classic welfare state was no longer regarded as necessarily positive, and welfare was increasingly provided by private entities. Legal aid was increasingly provided through private providers, but they remained focused on providing assistance in court cases. Citizens were increasingly regarded as consumers, who should be able to choose among services. Where it was not possible to provide such a choice, citizens were given the right to voice their dissatisfaction through administrative complaints processes. This resulted in tension, as legal aid was not designed to offer advice to those seeking redress through administrative complaints processes. Tensions also began to emerge as states which emphasised individual enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights, rather than collective enforcement through policies, reduced funding for legal aid as a welfare state provision. Individual enforcement of welfare entitlement requires the kind of legal aid funding states emphasising collective enforcement were more likely to provide.<ref>Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', p. 91</ref>\n\n==Legal aid movements==\nHistorically legal aid has its roots in the [[right to counsel]] and [[right to a fair trial]] movement of the 19th-century continental European countries. \"[[Poor man's laws]]\" waived court fees for the poor and provided for the appointment of duty solicitors for those who could not afford to pay for a [[solicitor]]. Initially the expectation was that duty solicitors would act on a ''[[pro bono]]'' basis. In the early 20th century, many European countries had no formal approach to legal aid, and the poor relied on the charity of lawyers. Most countries went on to establish laws that provided for the payment of a moderate fee to duty solicitors. To curb demand, legal aid was restricted to lawyer costs in judicial proceedings requiring a lawyer. Countries with a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law legal system]] and [[common law|common law legal systems]] take different approaches to the [[right to counsel]] in [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] proceedings. Civil law countries are more likely to emphasise the right to counsel in civil proceedings, and therefore provide legal aid where a lawyer is required. Common law countries emphasise the right to counsel and provide legal aid primarily in relation to criminal proceedings.<ref name=\"Regan 1999 p. 114\">Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', p. 114</ref>\n\nIn response to rapid [[industrialisation]] in the late 19th-century Europe, [[trade union]] and [[Workers' Party|workers' parties]] emerged that challenged the social policies of governments. They gained passage of laws to provide workers with legal rights in the event of illness or accidents, in an attempt to prevent industrial action by industrial workers. Workers unions in turn started to provide workers with legal advice on their new [[economic, social and cultural rights]]. Demand for these services was high and in an attempt to provide workers with non-partisan advice, many governments started to provide legal aid by the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Regan 1999 p. 114\"/>\n\nIn the 20th century, legal aid has developed together with progressive principles; it has often been supported by those members of the legal profession who felt that it was their responsibility to care for those on low income. Legal aid is driven by what [[lawyers]] can offer to meet the \"legal needs\" of those they have identified as poor, marginalised or discriminated against. According to Francis Regan, legal aid provision is supply driven, not demand driven, leading to wide gaps between provisions that meet perceived needs and actual demand. Legal service initiatives, such as neighbourhood mediation and legal services, frequently have to close due to lack of demand, while others are overwhelmed with clients.<ref>Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', pp. 113\u2013114</ref>\n\n==By country==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Australia===\n[[Australia]] has a federal system of government comprising federal, state and territory jurisdictions. The Australian (Commonwealth) and state and territory governments are each responsible for the provision of legal aid for matters arising under their laws. In addition there is a network of approximately 200 independent, not for profit, [[community legal centre]]s.\n\nLegal aid for both Commonwealth and state matters is primarily delivered through state and territory legal aid commissions (LACs), which are independent statutory agencies established under state and territory legislation. The [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] funds the provision of legal aid for Commonwealth family, civil and criminal law matters under agreements with state and territory governments and LACs. The majority of Commonwealth matters fall within the family law jurisdiction.\n\nLegal aid commissions use a mixed model to deliver legal representation services. A grant of assistance legal representation may be assigned to either a salaried in-house lawyer or referred to a private legal practitioner. The mixed model is particularly advantageous for providing services to clients in regional areas and in cases where a [[conflict of interest]] means the same lawyer cannot represent both parties.\n\nThe Australian Government and most state and territory governments also fund community legal centres, which are independent, non-profit organisations which provide referral, advice and assistance to people with legal problems. Additionally, the Australian Government funds financial assistance for legal services under certain statutory schemes and legal services for Indigenous Australians.\n\nBy way of history, the Australian Government established the Legal Services Bureaux in 1942 to develop a national system. In 1973 the Attorney-General in the Whitlam Labor government, [[Lionel Murphy]], established the Australian Legal Aid Office. Murphy recognised the urgent need for legal aid in order for justice to be equally available for all. Murphy recognised that: \"one of the basic causes of the inequality of citizens before the laws is the absence of adequate and comprehensive legal aid arrangements throughout Australia ... The ultimate object of the Government is that legal aid be readily and equally available to citizens everywhere in Australia and that aid be extended for advice and assistance of litigation as well as for litigation in all legal categories and in all courts.\" (Senator the Hon Lionel Murphy AO QC, Attorney General) The establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office in 1973 was followed by the establishment of state-based Legal Aid Commissions. These offices now provide the majority of free or lowcost legal assistance to those in need.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legalaidmatters.org.au/facts|title=The Facts - Access to Justice|website=www.legalaidmatters.org.au|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> In 1977, the Australian Government enacted the ''Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Act 1977'' (LAC Act), which established cooperative arrangements between the Australian Government and state and territory governments, under which legal aid would be provided by independent legal aid commissions to be established under state and territory legislation. The process of establishing the LACs took more than a decade. It commenced in 1976 with the establishment of the Legal Aid Commission of [[Western Australia]], followed in 1978 the [[Legal Aid Commission of Victoria]] (LACV), and ended in 1990 with the establishment of the Legal Aid Commission of [[Tasmania]]. The cooperative arrangements that were established by the LAC Act provided for Commonwealth and state and territory legal aid funding agreements, which began in 1987.\n\nIn July 1997, the Australian Government changed its arrangements to directly fund legal aid services for Commonwealth law matters. Under this arrangement, the states and territories fund assistance in respect of their own laws. In 2013, a murder trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria was delayed because legal aid was unavailable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-15/trial-put-on-hold-over-legal-aid-row/4521058|title=Trial on hold over Legal Aid row|date=15 February 2013|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref> This has been cited as the effect of a reduction in government-funding for legal aid agencies in Australia and led to an increase in popularity for online legal aid resources such as the Law Handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawhandbook.com.au/|title=The Victorian Law Handbook \u2013 Fitzroy Legal Service|website=Lawhandbook.com.au|accessdate=16 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221210/http://lawhandbook.com.au/|archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref> and LawAnswers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawanswers.com.au/|title=Australia's #1 Legal Aid & Legal Questions Forum |website=LawAnswers.com.au|accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-08/legal-aid-cuts-begin-to-bite/4615314|title=Legal aid cuts begin to bite|date=7 April 2013|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nLegal aid in Australia was discussed in the case of [[Dietrich v The Queen|''Dietrich v The Queen'' (1992)]].<ref>''Dietrich v The Queen'' [1992] HCA 57.</ref> It was found that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n{{Main|Legal aid in New Zealand}}\nThe legal aid system in New Zealand provides Government-funded legal assistance to those who are unable to afford a lawyer.

Consequently, many people\u2014especially those who are poor or otherwise disadvantaged\u2014are left without any real access to legal counsel in both criminal and non-criminal matters.</blockquote>\n\nIn the [[Czech Republic]], qualifying persons (usually those who evidence inadequacy of funds) can apply to the courts or the Czech Bar Association to have an attorney appointed to them.\n\n====Denmark====\nIn Denmark, applicants must satisfy the following criteria to receive legal aid for civil cases: The applicant must not earn more than kr. 289,000 ($50,000) a year and the claims of the party must seem reasonable.

Exception include [[libel]], most personal injury cases (which are now dealt with under Conditional Fee Agreements, a species of [[contingent fee]]), and cases associated with the running of a business. Family cases are also sometimes covered. Depending on the type of case, legal aid may or may not be means tested and in some cases legal aid can be free to those on benefits, out of work and have no savings or assets.\n\nIn July 2004 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the lack of legal aid in defamation cases, which was the position under the [[Legal Aid Act 1988]], applicable at the time of the [[McLibel]] case, could violate a defendant's right.  The [[Access to Justice Act 1999]] has exceptional funding provisions, which allow the [[Lord Chancellor]] to authorise legal aid funding in cases which are otherwise out of scope of the legal aid scheme. A defendant in a position similar to the McLibel defendants could potentially have legal aid assistance if the application met the exceptional funding criteria.\n\nCriminal legal aid is generally provided through private firms of solicitors and barristers in private practice. A limited number of public defenders are directly employed by the Legal Aid Agency in ''Public Defender Service'' offices; they provide advice in police stations and advocacy in magistrates and crown courts. Civil legal aid is provided through solicitors and barristers in private practice but also by lawyers working in [[Law Centre]]s and not-for-profit advice agencies.\n\nThe provision of legal aid is governed by the Access to Justice Act 1999 and supplementary legislation, most recently the [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012]].

Even where it is required to continue to provide free legal aid, for example to defendants to criminal charges and to parents threatened with the removal of their children, the UK is dismantling it indirectly by setting rates of remuneration for the lawyers at levels so uncommercial that, reluctantly, most of them feel unable to do that work.

[[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] maintained ability to get justice had been \"significantly undermined\".  Roughly a million fewer legal aid claims are dealt with each year, over 1,000 fewer legal aid providers received pay for civil legal aid work by 2018 than in 2011\u201312, four legal aid providers dealing with welfare cover Wales and the South West while 41 cover London and the South East, nearly half of all community care legal aid providers are London based.  Richard Miller of the [[Law Society]] said those providing legal advice across England and Wales were ending their service, causing \"legal aid deserts\".  Miller added, \"Even for those cases where legal aid is still supposed to be available, it can be very difficult for a client to find a lawyer willing to take on the case.\"  More litigants represent themselves, there were 65,000 representing themselves in 2017 and under 10,000 six years previously.  The [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act]] 2012 (LASPO) stopped aid for areas of law that include family, welfare, housing and debt  The LASPO also reduced the means test and ended automatic eligibility for people getting means-tested benefits.  Solicitors dealing with legal aid contracts say they must turn people away \"every single day\", but they can no longer send them anywhere.  Steve Hynes of Legal Action group said people solicitors must turn away will turn up in other public services, but by then their problems have increased out of control.  Hynes added, \"For many people across the country, getting help from a legal aid lawyer comes down to a postcode lottery which they are destined to lose.\"  Experts maintain the burden of cost has just been transferred to the courts, NHS and social care, which in the end costs the state more.  [[Law centre]]s have also closed due to funding cuts adding to the problems of people needing legal aid.  Nimrod Ben-Cnaan  of the Law Centres Network, maintained the legal aid market was, \"failing\" since cuts, \"shattered local ecologies of advice\".  He added, \"Legal aid deserts appear when there are not enough local providers of legal assistance, normally because of the Legal Aid Agency's preference of fewer, larger agencies, meaning that if those pull out of a local area there is little provision left. ... The lost goodwill, subject expertise and local knowledge would take time to be rebuilt \u2013 but it is vital for communities that they are rebuilt.\"  Malcolm Richardson, retired magistrate said legal advisers must increasingly guide litigant in person through court proceedings.  He said, \"It puts all the judiciary in a difficult position but also burdens the whole court system.\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46357169 Legal aid advice network 'decimated' by funding cuts] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\nPeople getting legal aid fell by 82% over eight years, this causes unnecessary conflict and stress, also prevents satisfactory justice.

Legal aid is regarded as central in providing access to justice by ensuring [[equality before the law]], the [[right to counsel]] and the [[right to a fair trial]]. This article describes the development of legal aid and its principles, primarily as known in Europe, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[Legal aid in the United States|United States.]]\n\nA number of delivery models for legal aid have emerged, including duty lawyers, community [[legal clinic]]s and the payment of lawyers to deal with cases for individuals who are entitled to legal aid.\n\nLegal aid is essential to guaranteeing equal access to justice for all, as provided for by Article 6.3 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] regarding criminal law cases. Especially for citizens who do not have sufficient financial means, the provision of legal aid to clients by governments will increase the likelihood, within court proceedings, of being assisted by legal professionals for free (or at a lower cost) or of receiving financial aid. Though legal aid aims to create more equity in the sphere of legal practices, aid offered is often limited in its quality or its social impact by economic constraints that dictate who can access these services and where the aforementioned services are geographically located.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abel|first=Richard L.|date=February 1985|title=Law without Politics: Legal Aid under Advanced Capitalism|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/uclalr32&id=493|journal=UCLA Law Review|volume=32|issue=3|pages=474\u2013642|via=HeinOnline}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nLegal aid has a close relationship with the [[welfare state]], and the provision of legal aid by a state is influenced by attitudes towards welfare. Legal aid is a welfare provision by the state to people who could otherwise not afford counsel from the legal system. Legal aid also helps to ensure that welfare provisions are enforced by providing people entitled to welfare provisions, such as social housing, with access to [[legal advice]] and the courts.\n\nHistorically, legal aid has played a strong role in ensuring respect for [[economic, social and cultural rights]] which are engaged in relation to social security, housing, social care, health and education service provision, which may be provided publicly or privately, as well as employment law and anti-discrimination legislation. Jurists such as [[Mauro Cappelletti]] argue that legal aid is essential in providing individuals with access to justice, by allowing the individual legal enforcement of [[economic, social and cultural rights]]. His views developed in the second half of the 20th century, when democracies with capitalist economies established [[liberalism|liberal]] welfare states that focused on the individual. States acted as contractors and service providers within a market-based philosophy that emphasised the [[citizen]] as [[consumer]]. This led to an emphasis on individual enforcement to achieve the realisation of rights for all.<ref name=\"regan\">{{Cite book| last = Regan| first = Francis| title = The Transformation of Legal Aid: Comparative and Historical Studies| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1999| pages =89\u201390 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=khG_4Dk96J4C&dq=legal+aid| isbn = 978-0-19-826589-4 }}</ref>\n\nPrior to the mid-20th century, literature on legal aid emphasised collective enforcement of [[economic, social and cultural rights]]. As classic welfare states were built in the 1940s and following World War II, an underlying principle was that citizens had collective responsibility for economic, social and cultural rights; and the state assumed responsibility for those unable to provide for themselves through illness and unemployment. The enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights was to be collective, through policies rather than individual legal action. Laws were enacted to support welfare provisions, though these were regarded as laws for planners, not lawyers. Legal aid schemes were established, as it was assumed that the state had a responsibility to assist those engaged in legal disputes, but they initially focused primarily on family law and divorce.<ref name=\"regan\"/>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the role of the welfare state changed, and social goals were no longer assumed to be common goals. Individuals were free to pursue their own goals. The welfare state in this time expanded, along with legal aid provisions, as concerns emerged over the power of welfare providers and professionals. In the 1960s and 1970s, demand rose for the right of individuals to legally enforce [[economic, social and cultural rights]] and the welfare provisions they as individuals were entitled to. Mechanisms emerged through which citizens could legally enforce their economic, social and cultural rights, and welfare lawyers used legal aid to advise those on low income when dealing with state officials. Legal aid was extended from family law to a wide range of economic, social and cultural rights.<ref>Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, the role of the classic welfare state was no longer regarded as necessarily positive, and welfare was increasingly provided by private entities. Legal aid was increasingly provided through private providers, but they remained focused on providing assistance in court cases. Citizens were increasingly regarded as consumers, who should be able to choose among services. Where it was not possible to provide such a choice, citizens were given the right to voice their dissatisfaction through administrative complaints processes. This resulted in tension, as legal aid was not designed to offer advice to those seeking redress through administrative complaints processes. Tensions also began to emerge as states which emphasised individual enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights, rather than collective enforcement through policies, reduced funding for legal aid as a welfare state provision. Individual enforcement of welfare entitlement requires the kind of legal aid funding states emphasising collective enforcement were more likely to provide.<ref>Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', p. 91</ref>\n\n==Legal aid movements==\nHistorically legal aid has its roots in the [[right to counsel]] and [[right to a fair trial]] movement of the 19th-century continental European countries. \"[[Poor man's laws]]\" waived court fees for the poor and provided for the appointment of duty solicitors for those who could not afford to pay for a [[solicitor]]. Initially the expectation was that duty solicitors would act on a ''[[pro bono]]'' basis. In the early 20th century, many European countries had no formal approach to legal aid, and the poor relied on the charity of lawyers. Most countries went on to establish laws that provided for the payment of a moderate fee to duty solicitors. To curb demand, legal aid was restricted to lawyer costs in judicial proceedings requiring a lawyer. Countries with a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law legal system]] and [[common law|common law legal systems]] take different approaches to the [[right to counsel]] in [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] proceedings. Civil law countries are more likely to emphasise the right to counsel in civil proceedings, and therefore provide legal aid where a lawyer is required. Common law countries emphasise the right to counsel and provide legal aid primarily in relation to criminal proceedings.<ref name=\"Regan 1999 p. 114\">Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', p. 114</ref>\n\nIn response to rapid [[industrialisation]] in the late 19th-century Europe, [[trade union]] and [[Workers' Party|workers' parties]] emerged that challenged the social policies of governments. They gained passage of laws to provide workers with legal rights in the event of illness or accidents, in an attempt to prevent industrial action by industrial workers. Workers unions in turn started to provide workers with legal advice on their new [[economic, social and cultural rights]]. Demand for these services was high and in an attempt to provide workers with non-partisan advice, many governments started to provide legal aid by the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Regan 1999 p. 114\"/>\n\nIn the 20th century, legal aid has developed together with progressive principles; it has often been supported by those members of the legal profession who felt that it was their responsibility to care for those on low income. Legal aid is driven by what [[lawyers]] can offer to meet the \"legal needs\" of those they have identified as poor, marginalised or discriminated against. According to Francis Regan, legal aid provision is supply driven, not demand driven, leading to wide gaps between provisions that meet perceived needs and actual demand. Legal service initiatives, such as neighbourhood mediation and legal services, frequently have to close due to lack of demand, while others are overwhelmed with clients.<ref>Regan (1999), ''The Transformation of Legal Aid'', pp. 113\u2013114</ref>\n\n==By country==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Australia===\n[[Australia]] has a federal system of government comprising federal, state and territory jurisdictions. The Australian (Commonwealth) and state and territory governments are each responsible for the provision of legal aid for matters arising under their laws. In addition there is a network of approximately 200 independent, not for profit, [[community legal centre]]s.\n\nLegal aid for both Commonwealth and state matters is primarily delivered through state and territory legal aid commissions (LACs), which are independent statutory agencies established under state and territory legislation. The [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] funds the provision of legal aid for Commonwealth family, civil and criminal law matters under agreements with state and territory governments and LACs. The majority of Commonwealth matters fall within the family law jurisdiction.\n\nLegal aid commissions use a mixed model to deliver legal representation services. A grant of assistance legal representation may be assigned to either a salaried in-house lawyer or referred to a private legal practitioner. The mixed model is particularly advantageous for providing services to clients in regional areas and in cases where a [[conflict of interest]] means the same lawyer cannot represent both parties.\n\nThe Australian Government and most state and territory governments also fund community legal centres, which are independent, non-profit organisations which provide referral, advice and assistance to people with legal problems. Additionally, the Australian Government funds financial assistance for legal services under certain statutory schemes and legal services for Indigenous Australians.\n\nBy way of history, the Australian Government established the Legal Services Bureaux in 1942 to develop a national system. In 1973 the Attorney-General in the Whitlam Labor government, [[Lionel Murphy]], established the Australian Legal Aid Office. Murphy recognised the urgent need for legal aid in order for justice to be equally available for all. Murphy recognised that: \"one of the basic causes of the inequality of citizens before the laws is the absence of adequate and comprehensive legal aid arrangements throughout Australia ... The ultimate object of the Government is that legal aid be readily and equally available to citizens everywhere in Australia and that aid be extended for advice and assistance of litigation as well as for litigation in all legal categories and in all courts.\" (Senator the Hon Lionel Murphy AO QC, Attorney General) The establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office in 1973 was followed by the establishment of state-based Legal Aid Commissions. These offices now provide the majority of free or lowcost legal assistance to those in need.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legalaidmatters.org.au/facts|title=The Facts - Access to Justice|website=www.legalaidmatters.org.au|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> In 1977, the Australian Government enacted the ''Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Act 1977'' (LAC Act), which established cooperative arrangements between the Australian Government and state and territory governments, under which legal aid would be provided by independent legal aid commissions to be established under state and territory legislation. The process of establishing the LACs took more than a decade. It commenced in 1976 with the establishment of the Legal Aid Commission of [[Western Australia]], followed in 1978 the [[Legal Aid Commission of Victoria]] (LACV), and ended in 1990 with the establishment of the Legal Aid Commission of [[Tasmania]]. The cooperative arrangements that were established by the LAC Act provided for Commonwealth and state and territory legal aid funding agreements, which began in 1987.\n\nIn July 1997, the Australian Government changed its arrangements to directly fund legal aid services for Commonwealth law matters. Under this arrangement, the states and territories fund assistance in respect of their own laws. In 2013, a murder trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria was delayed because legal aid was unavailable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-15/trial-put-on-hold-over-legal-aid-row/4521058|title=Trial on hold over Legal Aid row|date=15 February 2013|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref> This has been cited as the effect of a reduction in government-funding for legal aid agencies in Australia and led to an increase in popularity for online legal aid resources such as the Law Handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawhandbook.com.au/|title=The Victorian Law Handbook \u2013 Fitzroy Legal Service|website=Lawhandbook.com.au|accessdate=16 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221210/http://lawhandbook.com.au/|archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref> and LawAnswers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawanswers.com.au/|title=Australia's #1 Legal Aid & Legal Questions Forum |website=LawAnswers.com.au|accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-08/legal-aid-cuts-begin-to-bite/4615314|title=Legal aid cuts begin to bite|date=7 April 2013|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nLegal aid in Australia was discussed in the case of [[Dietrich v The Queen|''Dietrich v The Queen'' (1992)]].<ref>''Dietrich v The Queen'' [1992] HCA 57.</ref> It was found that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n{{Main|Legal aid in New Zealand}}\nThe legal aid system in New Zealand provides Government-funded legal assistance to those who are unable to afford a lawyer.

Exception include [[libel]], most personal injury cases (which are now dealt with under Conditional Fee Agreements, a species of [[contingent fee]]), and cases associated with the running of a business. Family cases are also sometimes covered. Depending on the type of case, legal aid may or may not be means tested and in some cases legal aid can be free to those on benefits, out of work and have no savings or assets.\n\nIn July 2004 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the lack of legal aid in defamation cases, which was the position under the [[Legal Aid Act 1988]], applicable at the time of the [[McLibel]] case, could violate a defendant's right.  The [[Access to Justice Act 1999]] has exceptional funding provisions, which allow the [[Lord Chancellor]] to authorise legal aid funding in cases which are otherwise out of scope of the legal aid scheme. A defendant in a position similar to the McLibel defendants could potentially have legal aid assistance if the application met the exceptional funding criteria.\n\nCriminal legal aid is generally provided through private firms of solicitors and barristers in private practice. A limited number of public defenders are directly employed by the Legal Aid Agency in ''Public Defender Service'' offices; they provide advice in police stations and advocacy in magistrates and crown courts. Civil legal aid is provided through solicitors and barristers in private practice but also by lawyers working in [[Law Centre]]s and not-for-profit advice agencies.\n\nThe provision of legal aid is governed by the Access to Justice Act 1999 and supplementary legislation, most recently the [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012]].  There are complaints cuts to legal aid have prevented the poorest people getting justice.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/13/senior-judge-warns-over-shaming-impact-of-legal-aid-cuts  Senior judge warns over 'shaming' impact of legal aid cuts] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\nDisabled people disputing benefit claims are usually denied legal aid forcing them to deal with complex and distressing cases without help.

Wilson said, \u201cThe disadvantaged who needed to be acquainted with their human rights and helped to enforce them were unlikely to be able to do so without free legal advice and representation.  Even where it is required to continue to provide free legal aid, for example to defendants to criminal charges and to parents threatened with the removal of their children, the UK is dismantling it indirectly by setting rates of remuneration for the lawyers at levels so uncommercial that, reluctantly, most of them feel unable to do that work.

[[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] maintained ability to get justice had been \"significantly undermined\".  Roughly a million fewer legal aid claims are dealt with each year, over 1,000 fewer legal aid providers received pay for civil legal aid work by 2018 than in 2011\u201312, four legal aid providers dealing with welfare cover Wales and the South West while 41 cover London and the South East, nearly half of all community care legal aid providers are London based.  Richard Miller of the [[Law Society]] said those providing legal advice across England and Wales were ending their service, causing \"legal aid deserts\".  Miller added, \"Even for those cases where legal aid is still supposed to be available, it can be very difficult for a client to find a lawyer willing to take on the case.\"  More litigants represent themselves, there were 65,000 representing themselves in 2017 and under 10,000 six years previously.  The [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act]] 2012 (LASPO) stopped aid for areas of law that include family, welfare, housing and debt  The LASPO also reduced the means test and ended automatic eligibility for people getting means-tested benefits.  Solicitors dealing with legal aid contracts say they must turn people away \"every single day\", but they can no longer send them anywhere.  Steve Hynes of Legal Action group said people solicitors must turn away will turn up in other public services, but by then their problems have increased out of control.  Hynes added, \"For many people across the country, getting help from a legal aid lawyer comes down to a postcode lottery which they are destined to lose.\"  Experts maintain the burden of cost has just been transferred to the courts, NHS and social care, which in the end costs the state more.  [[Law centre]]s have also closed due to funding cuts adding to the problems of people needing legal aid.  Nimrod Ben-Cnaan  of the Law Centres Network, maintained the legal aid market was, \"failing\" since cuts, \"shattered local ecologies of advice\".  He added, \"Legal aid deserts appear when there are not enough local providers of legal assistance, normally because of the Legal Aid Agency's preference of fewer, larger agencies, meaning that if those pull out of a local area there is little provision left. ... The lost goodwill, subject expertise and local knowledge would take time to be rebuilt \u2013 but it is vital for communities that they are rebuilt.\"  Malcolm Richardson, retired magistrate said legal advisers must increasingly guide litigant in person through court proceedings.

Critiques assert that these asymmetrical, schematically constructed client profiles are required of civic legal aid programs in the capitalist framework of the United States as a tool to appeal to donors and other sources of funding.

The results showed that in 1993, the prevalence of obesity for children aged between 2 and 4.9 was 10.3%. The same study was conducted in 1997, 2000 and 2007 which showed that the prevalence of obesity for children of that said age range has increased to 10.6%, 11.7% and 16.5% respectively. <ref name=\":1\" /> In 2001, the prevalence of obesity for boys and girls aged 8 until 10 years old was 17.8% and 15.3% respectively. <ref name=\":1\" /> Another analysis using data from 1993 by the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) found that \"the children (boys aged 6.0 to 8.9 years and girls aged 6.0 to 7.9 years) were divided into three groups: non-poor urban, rural and poor urban group.\" <ref name=\":1\" /> The results show that the non-poor urban group had a significantly higher prevalence than the rural and poor urban group with 4.9%, 1.0% and 0.7% respectively. \n\nA regional study in 2001 in two cities, Bogor and West Jakarta, revealed that the prevalence of obesity in private school boys and girls aged 8 to 10 was significantly higher with values of 32.7% and 21.2% compared to state school boys and girls with prevalence of 11.0% and 12.5%. \n\nIn 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a regional study on adolescents aged 12 to 15 and found that the prevalence of obesity was 8%.

Higher overall consumption of processed food and dairy products led to higher rates of obesity within the population. <ref name=\":2\" /> In a dietary study by Rachmi et al. (2017), the result was that the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents who frequently ate fried and oily food more than 4 times a week is higher than their counterparts at 7.2% and 4.7% respectively. <ref name=\":1\" /> In a study in 2007 and 2009, conducted in DKI Jakarta and Banda Aceh Municipality, it was evident that higher consumption of fried food contributed to the prevalence of obesity. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Physical activities variables ===\n\nIn 2011, the German Development Economics Conference paper explicitly mentioned that the apart from the change of food consumption pattern, physical activities during both work and leisure time is strongly related to the increasing prevalence of obesity in the Indonesian population. <ref name=\":2\" /> A study conducted by Elsevier, it was found that for children, who played outdoors for less than an hour compared to who played for more than an hour, were likely to be overweight at prevalence rates of 26.2% and 15.5% respectively. <ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, a higher incidence of obesity was displayed for children who played outdoors for less than two hours on the weekend compared to those who played for more than 2 hours at 23.4% and 17.4%. <ref name=\":3\" /> Apart from outdoor activities, indoor activities were found to be evidently contributing to the epidemic. Children who played computer games or tablet for longer than an hour compared to those who spend less than an hour, were more likely show a higher incidence of obesity at 25.0% and 18.8% respectively. \n\nA study by Aizawa and Helble (2017) found that due to increased economic development and urbanization, the labour-intense jobs are being replaced with more automated methods of work thus requiring lesser physical activity. <ref name=\":0\" />The labour-intensive work are generally categorized as hard manual work which is commonly a job title that the poorer population owns. In this sense, the physical activity involved in the automated and less labour-intense job are far less compared to the jobs that require harder physical-intense work that is common among the poor population, which implies that the population working automated methods of work have a higher incidence of obesity and being overweight. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Economic factors ===\n\nIn terms of economic factors, education and the level of income is a main factor in regards to the prevalence of obesity among the population of Indonesia. <ref name=\":3\" /> An article published by Elsevier found that the education attainment for both parents and children have a significant impact on the prevalence of obesity of the population. The study found that there are more children whose mother have lower educational attainment are underweight compared to the children whose mother who are well educated, at 20.8% and 12.6% respectively. <ref name=\":3\" /> Contrasting this, according to the study, mothers of children who are highly educated display a higher prevalence of obesity among their children at 22.9%. Additionally, children in middle and high-income families compared to children in low-income families are found to be more overweight/obese, with prevalence rates of 28.8% and 17.1% respectively. \n\nIn the Basic Health Survey in 2007 and 2010, it was revealed that \"higher economic status was associated with overweight/obesity, both in children and adults\". <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Location (Rural and Non-rural) ===\n\nA study in 2011 found that female adolescents living in non-rural urban areas had a 1.26 fold higher chance of being obese and overweight, whereas the prevalence of obesity in children aged 12 and under in urban areas was double that of children in rural areas with 10.7% and 5.1% respectively. <ref name=\":1\" /> In study conducted in 2013 and 2014 revealed that the prevalence of obesity among adults aged 19 to 55, are substantially higher in those living in non-rural urban areas. <ref name=\":1\" /> According to the World Health Organization (2000), women aged 19 to 55 living in urban areas also have higher prevalence rate compared to their counterpart at 32.4% and 25.9% respectively. \n\nAccording to the German Development Economics Conference paper, in 1998, it is stated that infrastructure in the rural areas of Indonesia had an impact on food consumption thus obesity rates. Infrastructure in rural parts are worse than in urban areas therefore walking is overly common. In addition to walking, smoking is a common habit of Indonesian people. Smoking leads to reduced appetite and influence the metabolism rate to increase.\n\n=== Lifestyle ===\n\nAccording to a local article in 2007, the correlation between household chores and risk of being overweight/obese is found to be inversely related. Meaning regularly doing chores was associated with smaller risk of obesity. <ref name=\":1\" /> The International Physical Activity Questionnaire stated that adolescents aged 16 to 18 who were inactive had a 2.58 fold greater risk to being obese compared to their active \"counterparts\". <ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nIn 2012 and 2013, two studies revealed that adults working with lighter levels of physical activity were found to be at greater risk of being obese. Furthermore, a television was used as a proxy to how Indonesian people spend their leisure time. It was found that owning a television is positively correlated with being obese and having a high BMI. <ref name=\":1\" /> Owning a television increases the tendency to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle which may reduce time for physical activity. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Implication of obesity in Indonesia ==\nIn 2018, the Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention published a research article and was found that obesity was \"one of the risk factor for non-communicable diseases\" which escalates mortality rate.<ref name=\":4\" /> The estimated number of cases that attributed to obesity in 2015 was just below 2 million and the total number of deaths were totalled around 102,000.

It was found that the prevalence rates of obesity amongst school-aged children have increased from 7.95% to 8.80% during the period.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|title=Prevalence of underweight and overweight among school-aged children and it's association with children's sociodemographic and lifestyle in Indonesia|last=Syahrul|first=Syahrul|last2=Kimura|first2=Rumiko|date=25 May 2016|journal=International Journal of Nursing Sciences|volume=3|issue=2|pages=169\u2013177|last3=Tsuda|first3=Akiko|last4=Susanto|first4=Tantut|last5=Saito|first5=Ruko|last6=Ahmad|first6=Fithria|doi=10.1016/j.ijnss.2016.04.004|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIn a published article by Elsevier, the World Health Organization Regional Office for South East Asia Region stated that \"undernutrition and overweight coexist within the population\" <ref name=\":1\" />. The study shows that \"Indonesia currently has the highest prevalence rate of overweight/obesity in under five children\". <ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThe World Health Organization carried out national studies ranging from 1993 until 2011. The results showed that in 1993, the prevalence of obesity for children aged between 2 and 4.9 was 10.3%. The same study was conducted in 1997, 2000 and 2007 which showed that the prevalence of obesity for children of that said age range has increased to 10.6%, 11.7% and 16.5% respectively. <ref name=\":1\" /> In 2001, the prevalence of obesity for boys and girls aged 8 until 10 years old was 17.8% and 15.3% respectively. <ref name=\":1\" /> Another analysis using data from 1993 by the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) found that \"the children (boys aged 6.0 to 8.9 years and girls aged 6.0 to 7.9 years) were divided into three groups: non-poor urban, rural and poor urban group.\" <ref name=\":1\" /> The results show that the non-poor urban group had a significantly higher prevalence than the rural and poor urban group with 4.9%, 1.0% and 0.7% respectively. \n\nA regional study in 2001 in two cities, Bogor and West Jakarta, revealed that the prevalence of obesity in private school boys and girls aged 8 to 10 was significantly higher with values of 32.7% and 21.2% compared to state school boys and girls with prevalence of 11.0% and 12.5%. \n\nIn 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a regional study on adolescents aged 12 to 15 and found that the prevalence of obesity was 8%. In 2007, the same study was conducted for adolescents aged 16 to 18 and the results were that the prevalence for obesity was 2.7% where the prevalence for boys and girls were 2.2% and 3.2% respectively. <ref name=\":1\" /> In 2010, a larger study was conducted by the World Health Organization on a larger age group for adolescents aged from 10 to 19. The results show that the prevalence of obesity was 9.8% where the prevalence for boys and girls were 8.7% and 10.8%. Based on the statistics, girls had a higher statisitc for prevalence of obesity for the adolescents age group for the regional studies. <ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Prevalence in adults ===\nIn 2014, there were four studies conducted using data from the IFLS in years 1993, 2000 and 2007. The first study showed that the prevalence of obesity in adults was increasing over the years for both men and women. <ref name=\":1\" /> Women also proved to have higher obesity rates compared to men. <ref name=\":1\" /> <ref name=\":3\" /> The second study was a data analysis using the 1993 data which showed that the prevalence of obesity amongst Indonesian adults was 14.6% . <ref name=\":1\" /> The data from 1993 and 2007 was used for the third study which found that the prevalence of overweight/obese women, aged 19-49, nearly doubled during the 14-year period. <ref name=\":1\" /> The fourth study using the 2007 data found that the prevalence amongst Indonesian adults was higher for women compared to men. In 2005, a regional study conducted by the Global Health Action found that the prevalence of obesity/overweight for adults in Indonesia, aged 25 to 64, was significantly higher for women than men with rates of 23.9% and 9.5% respectively. \n\nIn 2013, the Basic Healthy Survey conducted by the Ministry of Health showed that the prevalence of obesity in adult women has substantially increased from 14.8% to 32.9%.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Endarti|first=Dwi|last2=Kristina|first2=Susi Ari|last3=Riantoro|first3=Bagus Dwiky|date=1 January 2019|title=Estimating Premature Mortality Cost of Cancers Attributable to Obesity in Indonesia|journal=Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention|volume=20|issue=1|pages=87\u201390|doi=10.31557/APJCP.2019.20.1.87|issn=1513-7368|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics and socioeconomic factors ==\nIn Indonesia, socioeconomic status and lifestyle are risk factors in being diagnosed with obesity. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Food consumption and nutritional variables ===\nIn Indonesia, the economy continues to develop its food chain to undergo rapid changes in transforming the traditional food systems to modern supply chains including the production of fast food, processed food and conveniently packaged high-fat content and energy dense food. <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  \n\nIn 2011, the German Development Economics Conference paper stated that as living standards rise and lifestyle change occur, the demands for food products increases and dietary composition changes. Higher overall consumption of processed food and dairy products led to higher rates of obesity within the population. <ref name=\":2\" /> In a dietary study by Rachmi et al. (2017), the result was that the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents who frequently ate fried and oily food more than 4 times a week is higher than their counterparts at 7.2% and 4.7% respectively. <ref name=\":1\" /> In a study in 2007 and 2009, conducted in DKI Jakarta and Banda Aceh Municipality, it was evident that higher consumption of fried food contributed to the prevalence of obesity. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Physical activities variables ===\n\nIn 2011, the German Development Economics Conference paper explicitly mentioned that the apart from the change of food consumption pattern, physical activities during both work and leisure time is strongly related to the increasing prevalence of obesity in the Indonesian population. <ref name=\":2\" /> A study conducted by Elsevier, it was found that for children, who played outdoors for less than an hour compared to who played for more than an hour, were likely to be overweight at prevalence rates of 26.2% and 15.5% respectively. <ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, a higher incidence of obesity was displayed for children who played outdoors for less than two hours on the weekend compared to those who played for more than 2 hours at 23.4% and 17.4%. <ref name=\":3\" /> Apart from outdoor activities, indoor activities were found to be evidently contributing to the epidemic. Children who played computer games or tablet for longer than an hour compared to those who spend less than an hour, were more likely show a higher incidence of obesity at 25.0% and 18.8% respectively. \n\nA study by Aizawa and Helble (2017) found that due to increased economic development and urbanization, the labour-intense jobs are being replaced with more automated methods of work thus requiring lesser physical activity. <ref name=\":0\" />The labour-intensive work are generally categorized as hard manual work which is commonly a job title that the poorer population owns. In this sense, the physical activity involved in the automated and less labour-intense job are far less compared to the jobs that require harder physical-intense work that is common among the poor population, which implies that the population working automated methods of work have a higher incidence of obesity and being overweight. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Economic factors ===\n\nIn terms of economic factors, education and the level of income is a main factor in regards to the prevalence of obesity among the population of Indonesia. <ref name=\":3\" /> An article published by Elsevier found that the education attainment for both parents and children have a significant impact on the prevalence of obesity of the population. The study found that there are more children whose mother have lower educational attainment are underweight compared to the children whose mother who are well educated, at 20.8% and 12.6% respectively. <ref name=\":3\" /> Contrasting this, according to the study, mothers of children who are highly educated display a higher prevalence of obesity among their children at 22.9%. Additionally, children in middle and high-income families compared to children in low-income families are found to be more overweight/obese, with prevalence rates of 28.8% and 17.1% respectively. \n\nIn the Basic Health Survey in 2007 and 2010, it was revealed that \"higher economic status was associated with overweight/obesity, both in children and adults\". <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Location (Rural and Non-rural) ===\n\nA study in 2011 found that female adolescents living in non-rural urban areas had a 1.26 fold higher chance of being obese and overweight, whereas the prevalence of obesity in children aged 12 and under in urban areas was double that of children in rural areas with 10.7% and 5.1% respectively. <ref name=\":1\" /> In study conducted in 2013 and 2014 revealed that the prevalence of obesity among adults aged 19 to 55, are substantially higher in those living in non-rural urban areas. <ref name=\":1\" /> According to the World Health Organization (2000), women aged 19 to 55 living in urban areas also have higher prevalence rate compared to their counterpart at 32.4% and 25.9% respectively. \n\nAccording to the German Development Economics Conference paper, in 1998, it is stated that infrastructure in the rural areas of Indonesia had an impact on food consumption thus obesity rates. Infrastructure in rural parts are worse than in urban areas therefore walking is overly common. In addition to walking, smoking is a common habit of Indonesian people. Smoking leads to reduced appetite and influence the metabolism rate to increase.\n\n=== Lifestyle ===\n\nAccording to a local article in 2007, the correlation between household chores and risk of being overweight/obese is found to be inversely related. Meaning regularly doing chores was associated with smaller risk of obesity. <ref name=\":1\" /> The International Physical Activity Questionnaire stated that adolescents aged 16 to 18 who were inactive had a 2.58 fold greater risk to being obese compared to their active \"counterparts\". <ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nIn 2012 and 2013, two studies revealed that adults working with lighter levels of physical activity were found to be at greater risk of being obese. Furthermore, a television was used as a proxy to how Indonesian people spend their leisure time. It was found that owning a television is positively correlated with being obese and having a high BMI. <ref name=\":1\" /> Owning a television increases the tendency to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle which may reduce time for physical activity. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Implication of obesity in Indonesia ==\nIn 2018, the Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention published a research article and was found that obesity was \"one of the risk factor for non-communicable diseases\" which escalates mortality rate.<ref name=\":4\" /> The estimated number of cases that attributed to obesity in 2015 was just below 2 million and the total number of deaths were totalled around 102,000. Furthermore, the country's total indirect costs due to obesity amounted to approximately $28.3 billion or equivalent to 368.25 trillion Rupiah. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asiapathways-adbi.org/2018/02/the-economic-burden-of-overweight-and-obesity-in-indonesia/|title=The Economic Burden of Overweight and Obesity Reaches 3% of GDP in Indonesia|last=Kosen|first=Soewarta|date=2 February 2018|website=Asia Pathways|language=en-US|access-date=4 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIndonesia is one of the top 10 countries with the \"highest prevalence\" of cancer mortality due to obesity.

Both Haye and Chisora sat down in the Sky studios and talked about their relationship, explaining how they came to a deal.

Gashi, who suffered the third defeat of his 20-fight professional career which included 17 early knockouts in 17 victories, switched southpaw from the opening bell, landed an effective counter punch in the second but Chisora connected with a good body shot in the third and took control of the fight. Chisora continued to be the aggressor throughout but his opponent survived to the end of the contest.\n\nOn 13 June 2019, a fight between Chisora and former world title challenger [[Artur Szpilka]] was announced to take place at the [[O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London on 20 July 2019, with the bout taking place on the undercard of [[Dillian Whyte vs. Oscar Rivas]] live on [[Sky Box Office|Sky Sports Box Office]].

On 1 October Parker pulled out of the fight due to illness.\n\n==== Chisora vs. Price ====\nOn 8 October 2019, [[David Price (boxer)|David Price]] was announced as Dereck Chisora's replacement opponent at the O2 Arena. Chisora pressured Price from the start of the contest and floored his opponent in the fourth round as the fight was called to a halt following the Price corner throwing in the towel.\n\n==== Chisora vs. Usyk ====\nOn 11 March 2020, a fight between Chisora and undefeated former undisputed cruiserweight world champion [[Oleksandr Usyk]] was announced to take place at the [[O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London on 23 May 2020, live on [[Sky Box Office|Sky Sports Box Office]]\n\n==Personal life==\nIn November 2010, Chisora was found guilty of assaulting his then-girlfriend after finding text messages from another man on her phone. He narrowly escaped being sent to prison, and was given a 12-week sentence suspended for two years. He was ordered to pay \u00a31,500 in compensation and \u00a3500 costs and complete 150 hours community work. The court was told that the fighter also had previous convictions for public order offences, assaulting a police officer and possession of an offensive weapon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11727784|title=Boxer Dereck Chisora guilty of assaulting girlfriend |publisher=BBC|date=10 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2015, Chisora was stopped in his [[Bentley]] near [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in London.

The fight was then stopped by referee Robert Williams after Azzouzi struggled to get to his feet. The official time of the stoppage was at 2:12 of round 2. After the fight, whilst being interviewed by the Sky Sports team, Chisora called over David Haye and his fighter Joe Joyce. Prior to calling them over, Chisora referred to Joyce as a Chihuahua. Chisora first asked Haye if he had confidence in Jocye and then stated, \u201cIn front of the British public on live television, I\u2019ll make a deal with you right now: if he (Joyce) beats me you write me a cheque of \u00a31, if I beat him you give me your purse against Tony (Bellew) and your TV rights.\u201d Haye rejected the offer.

Chisora began to take more punishment as the fight progressed and fell clearly behind on the scorecards. At one point in round 6, referee Howard Foster was looking at possibly stopping the fight with Chisora taking shots against the ropes. By round 7, Takam was landing the better shots and looked to be on his way to an eventual stoppage win; however in round 8, Chisora connected with a big right hand to Takam's head, sending him to the canvas. Takam made it unsteadily to his feet and the fight resumed only for Chisora to immediately land an identical punch and drop Takam a second time. Foster then stopped the fight with 1 minute remaining in the round. With the win, Chisora claimed the vacant WBA International title. Promoter Hearn and pundits in the arena stated he had made his way back into the heavyweight title mix.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/chisora-fights-knockout-takam-results--130395|title=Chisora Fights Through Fire, Sensational Knockout of Takam|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/whyte-vs-parker/news/36153/11452609/1|title=Whyte vs Parker: Dereck Chisora knocks out Carlos Takam|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en}}</ref> After the bout, on who he would like to fight next, he said, \"I definitely want the winner of the main event (Whyte vs. Parker).\" Hearn stated in the post-fight press conference that he would issue a challenge to WBC champion [[Deontay Wilder]] to defend his title against Chisora in either Brooklyn or London.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/24220033/dereck-chisora-knocks-carlos-takam-eighth-round-whyte-parker-undercard|title=Chisora twice floors Takam in 8th for KO win|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/hearn-id-like-deontay-wilder-fight-chisora-whyte--130420|title=Hearn: I'd Like Deontay Wilder To Fight Chisora or Whyte|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n==== Chisora vs. Whyte II ====\nIn mid October 2018, Whyte and Cuban boxer [[Luis Ortiz (Cuban boxer)|Luis Ortiz]] appeared to have a war of words and called each other out, with Ortiz stating he would come to the UK and fight Whyte on 22 December, a potential PPV date allocated to the possible Whyte vs. Chisora rematch.

Gashi, who suffered the third defeat of his 20-fight professional career which included 17 early knockouts in 17 victories, switched southpaw from the opening bell, landed an effective counter punch in the second but Chisora connected with a good body shot in the third and took control of the fight.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state by population, with a total of 103,019 residents at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]), and extends to the south and west.\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. American settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades.

County, Washington|Snohomish County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state by population, with a total of 103,019 residents at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]), and extends to the south and west.\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. American settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses. Everett stages several annual festivals and is also home to minor league sports teams, including the [[Everett Silvertips]] at [[Angel of the Winds Arena]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] Peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

Where ''identity'' can be seen as static, ''sampradaya'' allows flexibility; one can leave one ''sampradaya'' and enter another.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Continuity===\n''Sampradaya'' is a body of practice, views and attitudes, which are transmitted, redefined and reviewed by each successive generation of followers. Participation in ''sampradaya'' forces continuity with the past, or [[tradition]], but at the same time provides a platform for change from within the community of practitioners of this particular traditional group.{{sfn|Gupta|2002}}\n\n===Initiation===\nA particular [[guru]] lineage in [[guru-shishya tradition]] is called ''[[parampara]]'', and may have its own [[akhara]]s and [[gurukula]]s. By receiving [[Diksha|diksha (initiation)]] into the ''parampara'' of a living guru, one belongs to its proper ''sampradaya''.{{sfn|Gupta|2002}} One cannot become a member by [[birth]], as is the case with ''[[gotra]]'', a seminal, or hereditary, [[dynasty]].\n\n===Authority===\nMembership in a ''sampradaya'' not only lends a level of authority to one\u2019s claims on truth in [[Hindu]] traditional context, but also allows one to make those claims in the first place. An often quoted verse from the [[Padma Purana]] states:\n{{quote|Mantras which are not received in ''sampradaya'' are considered fruitless.{{sfn|Gupta|2002}}{{refn|group=note| Sampradayavihina ye mantras te nisphala matah}}}}\n\nAnd another verse states:\n{{quote|Unless one is initiated by a bona-fide spiritual master in the disciplic succession, the mantra he might have received is without any effect.{{sfn|Gupta|2002}}{{refn|group=note|The original [[Sanskrit]] text found in ''Sabda-Kalpa-Druma'' Sanskrit-Sanskrit dictionary and ''Prameya-ratnavali'' 1.5-6 by [[Baladeva Vidyabhushana]] states:\n''sampradaya vihina ye mantras te nisphala matah''<br />\n''atah kalau bhavisyanti catvarah sampradayinah''<br />\n''sri-brahma-rudra-sanaka vaisnavah ksiti-pavanah''<br />\n''catvaras te kalau bhavya hy utkale purusottamat''<br />\n''ramanujam sri svicakre madhvacaryam caturmukhah''<br />\n''sri visnusvaminam rudro nimbadityam catuhsanah''}}}}\n\nAs Wright and Wright put it, \n{{quote|If one cannot prove natal legitimacy, one may be cast out as a bastard. The same social standard applies to religious organizations. If a religious group cannot prove its descent from one of the recognised traditions, it risks being dismissed as illegitimate.{{sfn|Wright|1993}}}}\n\nNevertheless, there are also examples of teachers who were not initiated into a sampradaya, [[Ramana Maharshi]] being a well-known example.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=89}}<ref group=web name=\"Lineage\">[http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ramanamaharshilineage.html Sri Ramanasramam, \"A lineage of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113112549/http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ramanamaharshilineage.html |date=13 January 2012 }}</ref> A sannyasin belonging to the [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham]] once tried to persuade Ramana to be initiated into sannyasa, but Ramana refused.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=89}}\n\n==Type of sampradayas==\n\n===Vaishnava sampradayas===\n{{Main|Vaishnavism}}\n{{Vaishnavism}}\nAccording to the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, one of the eighteen main Pur\u0101\u1e47as, there are four Vaishnava ''samprad\u0101yas'', which preserve the fruitful mantras:{{refn|group=note|Quoted in [[Otto von B\u00f6htlingk|B\u00f6htlingk]]'s [[Sanskrit]]-Sanskrit [[dictionary]], entry ''Samprad\u0101ya''.{{sfn|Apte|1965}}}}\n{{quote|All mantras which have been given (to disciples) not in an authorised Samprad\u0101ya are fruitless.
