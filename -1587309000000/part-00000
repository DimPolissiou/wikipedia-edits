This operation, of taking the rightmost digits of a square, and adding it to the integer formed by the leftmost digits, is known as the Kaprekar operation.\n\nSome examples of Kaprekar numbers in base 10, besides the numbers 9, 99, 999, \u2026, are {{OEIS|id=A006886}}:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

R. The Mathematics of New Self-Numbers Devalali (1963)nn: 19\u201320</ref> which are integers that cannot be generated by taking some other number and adding its own digits to it. For example, 21 is not a self number, since it can be generated from 15:  15 + 1 + 5 = 21. But 20 is a self number, since it cannot be generated from any other integer.  He also gave a test for verifying this property in any number.

Sometimes these are also designated ''Colombian number''s after a later designation.\n\n===Harshad number===\n{{main|Harshad number}}\n\nKaprekar also described the [[Harshad number]]s which he named harshad, meaning \"giving joy\"  ([[Sanskrit]] ''harsha'', joy ''+da'' taddhita pratyaya, [[causative]]); these are defined by the property that they are divisible by the sum of their digits.  Thus 12, which is divisible by 1 + 2 = 3, is a Harshad number.  These were later also called ''Niven numbers'' after  1977 lecture on these by the Canadian mathematician [[Ivan M. Niven]].  Numbers which are Harshad in all bases (only 1, 2, 4, and 6) are called ''all-Harshad numbers''.
