The folding books are the products of professional scribes working under the patronage of deities such as the [[Tonsured Maize God]] and the [[Howler Monkey Gods]]. Most of the codices were destroyed by conquistadors and Catholic priests in the 16th century. The codices have been named for the cities where they eventually settled. The [[Dresden codex]] is generally considered the most important of the few that survive.\n\nThe paper was made from the inner bark of certain trees, the main being the wild fig tree or ''[[amate]]'' (''[[Ficus insipida|Ficus glabrata]]''). This sort of paper was generally known by the word ''[[amatl|\u0101matl]]'' {{IPA-nah|\u02c8a\u02d0mat\u0361\u026c|}} in [[Nahuatl]], and by the word ''huun'' in [[Mayan Languages|Mayan]].

Their range of subject matter in all likelihood embraced more topics than those recorded in stone and buildings, and was more like what is found on painted ceramics (the so-called 'ceramic codex'). Alonso de Zorita wrote that in 1540 he saw numerous such books in the [[Guatemala]]n highlands that \"recorded their history for more than eight hundred years back, and that were interpreted for me by very ancient Indians\" (Zorita 1963, 271-2).\n\nDominican friar [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] lamented that when found, such books were destroyed: \"These books were seen by our clergy, and even I saw part of those that were burned by the monks, apparently because they thought [they] might harm the Indians in matters concerning religion, since at that time they were at the beginning of their conversion.\" The last codices destroyed were those of [[Nojpet\u00e9n]], Guatemala in 6098737377373728383383838838383838383 hahah, the last city conquered in the Americas.<ref>[http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_writing.htm Maya writing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613162647/http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_writing.htm |date=2007-06-13 }}</ref> With their destruction, access to the history of the Maya and opportunity for insight into some key areas of Maya life was greatly diminished.\n\nThere are only three codices whose authenticity is beyond doubt.

It is the most elaborate of the codices, and also a highly important specimen of [[Maya art]]. Many sections are ritualistic (including so-called 'almanacs'), others are of an [[astrological]] nature ([[eclipse]]s, the [[Transits of Venus|Venus cycles]]). The codex is written on a long sheet of paper that is 'screen-folded' to make a book of 39 leaves, written on both sides. It was probably written between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ruggles|first=Clive L.

The only exact replica, including the ''huun'', made by a German artist is displayed at the ''Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda'' in [[Guatemala]] City, since October, 2007.\n\nExactly how the Dresden Codex ended up in Europe is not clear.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vail|first=Gabrielle|date=2015|title=Astronomy in the Dresden Codex|journal=Handbook of Archaeastronomy and Ethnoastronomy|volume=|pages=695\u2013708|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-6141-8_65|isbn=978-1-4614-6140-1}}</ref> It arrived sometime in the late 18th Century, potentially from the first or second generation of Spanish conquistadores. \u00a0Even though the last date entry in the book is from several centuries before its relocation, the book was likely used and added to until just before the conquerors took it. \n\nAbout 65 per cent of the pages in the Dresden Codex contain richly illustrated astronomical tables. These tables focus on eclipses, equinoxes and solstices, the sidereal cycle of Mars, and the synodic cycles of Mars and Venus. These observations allowed the Mayans to plan the calendar year, agriculture, and religious ceremonies around the stars. \u00a0In the text, Mars is represented by a long nosed deer, and Venus is represented by a star. \n\nPages 51-58 are eclipse tables. These tables accurately predicted solar eclipses for 33 years in the 8th Century, though the predictions of lunar eclipses were far less successful. Icons of serpents devouring the sun symbolize eclipses throughout the book. The glyphs show roughly 40 times in the text, making eclipses a major focus of the Dresden Codex. \n\nThe first 52 pages of the Dresden Codex are about divination. The Mayan astronomers would use the codex for day keeping, but also determining the cause of sickness and other misfortunes. \n\nThough a wide variety of gods and goddesses appear in the Dresden Codex, the Moon Goddess is the only neutral figure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnhart|first=Edwin|date=Fall 2005|title=The First Twenty-Three Pages of the Dresden Codex: The Divination Pages|url=https://www.mayaexploration.org/pdf/DresdenCodex1-23.pdf|volume=|pages=1\u2013145|via=}}</ref> In the first 23 pages of the book, she is mentioned far more than any other god. \n\nBetween 1880 and 1900, Dresden librarian [[Ernst F\u00f6rstemann]] succeeded in deciphering the [[Maya numerals]] and the [[Maya calendar]] and realized that the codex is an [[ephemeris]].<ref>Ernst F\u00f6rstemann, ''Commentary on the Maya Manuscript in the Royal  Public Library of Dresden'', Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University Vol. IV \u2014 No.2, Cambridge Mass. 1902</ref> Subsequent studies have decoded these astronomical almanacs, which include records of the cycles of the Sun and Moon, including eclipse tables, and all of the naked-eye planets.<ref>John Eric Sidney Thompson, ''A commentary on the Dresden Codex: A Maya Hieroglyphic Book'', Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society, 1972.</ref> The \"Serpent Series\", pp.&nbsp;61\u201369, is an [[ephemeris]] of these phenomena that uses a base date of 1.18.1.8.0.16 in the prior era (5,482,096 days).<ref>Beyer, Hermann 1933 Emendations of the 'Serpent Numbers' of the Dresden Maya Codex.

The codex first appeared in 1832 as an acquisition of France's ''Biblioth\u00e8que Imp\u00e9riale'' (later the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], or National Library) in [[Paris]]. Three years later the first reproduction drawing of it was prepared for [[Lord Kingsborough]], by his [[Lombardy|Lombardian]] artist [[Agostino Aglio]]. The original drawing is now lost, but a copy survives among some of Kingsborough's unpublished [[galley proof|proof sheet]]s, held in collection at the [[Newberry Library]], [[Chicago]].<ref>See [http://www.famsi.org/mayawriting/codices/paris.html \"The Paris Codex\"], in Marhenke (2003), {{page needed|date=September 2012}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough occasionally referred to over the next quarter-century, its permanent rediscovery is attributed to the French orientalist [[L\u00e9on de Rosny]], who in 1859 recovered the codex from a basket of old papers sequestered in a chimney corner at the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] where it had lain discarded and apparently forgotten.<ref>Coe (1992, p.101), Sharer & Traxler (2006, p.127)</ref> As a result, it is in very poor condition.

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] excavations of Maya sites have turned up a number of rectangular lumps of plaster and paint flakes, most commonly in elite tombs. These lumps are the remains of codices where all the organic material has rotted away. A few of the more coherent of these lumps have been preserved, with the slim hope that some technique to be developed by future generations of archaeologists may be able to recover some information from these remains of ancient pages. The oldest Maya codices known have been found by archaeologists as mortuary offerings with burials in excavations in [[Uaxactun]], [[Guayt\u00e1n]] in San Agust\u00edn Acasaguastl\u00e1n, and Nebaj in [[Quich\u00e9 Department|El Quich\u00e9]], [[Guatemala]], at [[Altun Ha]] in [[Belize]] and at [[Cop\u00e1n]] in [[Honduras]]. The six examples of Maya books discovered in excavations date to the Early Classic (Uaxact\u00fan and Altun Ha), Late Classic (Nebaj, Cop\u00e1n), and Early Postclassic (Guayt\u00e1n) periods. Unfortunately, all of them have degraded into unopenable masses or collections of very small flakes and bits of the original texts. Thus it may never be possible to read them.<ref>Whiting 1998: 207\u2013208</ref>\n\n==Forgeries==\nSince the start of the 20th century, [[forgery|forgeries]] of varying quality have been produced. Two elaborate early 20th-century forged codices were in the collection of [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Although fake codices have seldom fooled serious scholars, the [[Grolier Codex]] may be an exception. Its paper seems to be ancient, and the influential Mayanist [[Michael D. Coe]] believed the artifact to be genuine, followed in this by Stephen Houston and Karl Taube (all three scholars stemming from Yale), but other eminent Mayanists such as [[J.E.S. Thompson]],<ref>Thompson 1975: 1-9; 1976: 64-75</ref> [[Claude Baudez]],<ref>Baudez 2002: 70-79, 98-102</ref> and Susan Milbrath<ref>Milbrath 2002: 50-83</ref> concluded that its pictures and glyphs are falsifications. They pointed out a long series of inconsistencies and errors in the alleged codex, and drew attention to its art historical improbability and its uselessness for astrological and divinatory purposes.<ref>For a succinct account, see Kelker & Bruhns 2010: 95-104</ref> Although their arguments were never effectively countered, no scholarly unanimity has been reached.

The folding books are the products of professional scribes working under the patronage of deities such as the [[Tonsured Maize God]] and the [[Howler Monkey Gods]]. Most of the codices were destroyed by conquistadors and Catholic priests in the 16th century. The codices have been named for the cities where they eventually settled. The [[Dresden codex]] is generally considered the most important of the few that survive.\n\nThe paper was made from the inner bark of certain trees, the main being the wild fig tree or ''[[amate]]'' (''[[Ficus insipida|Ficus glabrata]]''). This sort of paper was generally known by the word ''[[amatl|\u0101matl]]'' {{IPA-nah|\u02c8a\u02d0mat\u0361\u026c|}} in [[Nahuatl]], and by the word ''huun'' in [[Mayan Languages|Mayan]].

Their range of subject matter in all likelihood embraced more topics than those recorded in stone and buildings, and was more like what is found on painted ceramics (the so-called 'ceramic codex'). Alonso de Zorita wrote that in 1540 he saw numerous such books in the [[Guatemala]]n highlands that \"recorded their history for more than eight hundred years back, and that were interpreted for me by very ancient Indians\" (Zorita 1963, 271-2).\n\nDominican friar [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] lamented that when found, such books were destroyed: \"These books were seen by our clergy, and even I saw part of those that were burned by the monks, apparently because they thought [they] might harm the Indians in matters concerning religion, since at that time they were at the beginning of their conversion.\" The last codices destroyed were those of [[Nojpet\u00e9n]], Guatemala in 1697, the last city conquered in the Americas.<ref>[http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_writing.htm Maya writing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613162647/http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_writing.htm |date=2007-06-13 }}</ref> With their destruction, access to the history of the Maya and opportunity for insight into some key areas of Maya life was greatly diminished.\n\nThere are only three codices whose authenticity is beyond doubt.

It is the most elaborate of the codices, and also a highly important specimen of [[Maya art]]. Many sections are ritualistic (including so-called 'almanacs'), others are of an [[astrological]] nature ([[eclipse]]s, the [[Transits of Venus|Venus cycles]]). The codex is written on a long sheet of paper that is 'screen-folded' to make a book of 39 leaves, written on both sides. It was probably written between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ruggles|first=Clive L.

The only exact replica, including the ''huun'', made by a German artist is displayed at the ''Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda'' in [[Guatemala]] City, since October, 2007.\n\nExactly how the Dresden Codex ended up in Europe is not clear.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vail|first=Gabrielle|date=2015|title=Astronomy in the Dresden Codex|journal=Handbook of Archaeastronomy and Ethnoastronomy|volume=|pages=695\u2013708|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-6141-8_65|isbn=978-1-4614-6140-1}}</ref> It arrived sometime in the late 18th Century, potentially from the first or second generation of Spanish conquistadores. \u00a0Even though the last date entry in the book is from several centuries before its relocation, the book was likely used and added to until just before the conquerors took it. \n\nAbout 65 per cent of the pages in the Dresden Codex contain richly illustrated astronomical tables. These tables focus on eclipses, equinoxes and solstices, the sidereal cycle of Mars, and the synodic cycles of Mars and Venus. These observations allowed the Mayans to plan the calendar year, agriculture, and religious ceremonies around the stars. \u00a0In the text, Mars is represented by a long nosed deer, and Venus is represented by a star. \n\nPages 51-58 are eclipse tables. These tables accurately predicted solar eclipses for 33 years in the 8th Century, though the predictions of lunar eclipses were far less successful. Icons of serpents devouring the sun symbolize eclipses throughout the book. The glyphs show roughly 40 times in the text, making eclipses a major focus of the Dresden Codex. \n\nThe first 52 pages of the Dresden Codex are about divination. The Mayan astronomers would use the codex for day keeping, but also determining the cause of sickness and other misfortunes. \n\nThough a wide variety of gods and goddesses appear in the Dresden Codex, the Moon Goddess is the only neutral figure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnhart|first=Edwin|date=Fall 2005|title=The First Twenty-Three Pages of the Dresden Codex: The Divination Pages|url=https://www.mayaexploration.org/pdf/DresdenCodex1-23.pdf|volume=|pages=1\u2013145|via=}}</ref> In the first 23 pages of the book, she is mentioned far more than any other god. \n\nBetween 1880 and 1900, Dresden librarian [[Ernst F\u00f6rstemann]] succeeded in deciphering the [[Maya numerals]] and the [[Maya calendar]] and realized that the codex is an [[ephemeris]].<ref>Ernst F\u00f6rstemann, ''Commentary on the Maya Manuscript in the Royal  Public Library of Dresden'', Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University Vol. IV \u2014 No.2, Cambridge Mass. 1902</ref> Subsequent studies have decoded these astronomical almanacs, which include records of the cycles of the Sun and Moon, including eclipse tables, and all of the naked-eye planets.<ref>John Eric Sidney Thompson, ''A commentary on the Dresden Codex: A Maya Hieroglyphic Book'', Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society, 1972.</ref> The \"Serpent Series\", pp.&nbsp;61\u201369, is an [[ephemeris]] of these phenomena that uses a base date of 1.18.1.8.0.16 in the prior era (5,482,096 days).<ref>Beyer, Hermann 1933 Emendations of the 'Serpent Numbers' of the Dresden Maya Codex.

The codex first appeared in 1832 as an acquisition of France's ''Biblioth\u00e8que Imp\u00e9riale'' (later the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], or National Library) in [[Paris]]. Three years later the first reproduction drawing of it was prepared for [[Lord Kingsborough]], by his [[Lombardy|Lombardian]] artist [[Agostino Aglio]]. The original drawing is now lost, but a copy survives among some of Kingsborough's unpublished [[galley proof|proof sheet]]s, held in collection at the [[Newberry Library]], [[Chicago]].<ref>See [http://www.famsi.org/mayawriting/codices/paris.html \"The Paris Codex\"], in Marhenke (2003), {{page needed|date=September 2012}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough occasionally referred to over the next quarter-century, its permanent rediscovery is attributed to the French orientalist [[L\u00e9on de Rosny]], who in 1859 recovered the codex from a basket of old papers sequestered in a chimney corner at the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] where it had lain discarded and apparently forgotten.<ref>Coe (1992, p.101), Sharer & Traxler (2006, p.127)</ref> As a result, it is in very poor condition.

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] excavations of Maya sites have turned up a number of rectangular lumps of plaster and paint flakes, most commonly in elite tombs. These lumps are the remains of codices where all the organic material has rotted away. A few of the more coherent of these lumps have been preserved, with the slim hope that some technique to be developed by future generations of archaeologists may be able to recover some information from these remains of ancient pages. The oldest Maya codices known have been found by archaeologists as mortuary offerings with burials in excavations in [[Uaxactun]], [[Guayt\u00e1n]] in San Agust\u00edn Acasaguastl\u00e1n, and Nebaj in [[Quich\u00e9 Department|El Quich\u00e9]], [[Guatemala]], at [[Altun Ha]] in [[Belize]] and at [[Cop\u00e1n]] in [[Honduras]]. The six examples of Maya books discovered in excavations date to the Early Classic (Uaxact\u00fan and Altun Ha), Late Classic (Nebaj, Cop\u00e1n), and Early Postclassic (Guayt\u00e1n) periods. Unfortunately, all of them have degraded into unopenable masses or collections of very small flakes and bits of the original texts. Thus it may never be possible to read them.<ref>Whiting 1998: 207\u2013208</ref>\n\n==Forgeries==\nSince the start of the 20th century, [[forgery|forgeries]] of varying quality have been produced. Two elaborate early 20th-century forged codices were in the collection of [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Although fake codices have seldom fooled serious scholars, the [[Grolier Codex]] may be an exception. Its paper seems to be ancient, and the influential Mayanist [[Michael D. Coe]] believed the artifact to be genuine, followed in this by Stephen Houston and Karl Taube (all three scholars stemming from Yale), but other eminent Mayanists such as [[J.E.S. Thompson]],<ref>Thompson 1975: 1-9; 1976: 64-75</ref> [[Claude Baudez]],<ref>Baudez 2002: 70-79, 98-102</ref> and Susan Milbrath<ref>Milbrath 2002: 50-83</ref> concluded that its pictures and glyphs are falsifications. They pointed out a long series of inconsistencies and errors in the alleged codex, and drew attention to its art historical improbability and its uselessness for astrological and divinatory purposes.<ref>For a succinct account, see Kelker & Bruhns 2010: 95-104</ref> Although their arguments were never effectively countered, no scholarly unanimity has been reached. In September 2016 Coe and other researchers published findings supporting its authenticity,<ref name=\"newitz ars technica\">Annalee Newitz (12 September 2016). \"[https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/confirmed-mysterious-ancient-maya-book-grolier-codex-is-genuine/ Confirmed: Mysterious ancient Maya book, Grolier Codex, is genuine: 900 year-old astronomy guide is oldest known book written in the Americas].\" ''[http://arstechnica.co.uk/ Ars Technica]''.

The photograph was taken by expedition leader [[Ernest Shackleton]].]]\n\nThe '''''Nimrod''''' '''Expedition''' of 1907\u20131909, otherwise known as the British Antarctic Expedition, was the first of three<!--not counting the one on which he died?--> expeditions to the [[Antarctic]] led by [[Ernest Shackleton]]. Its main target, among a range of geographical and scientific objectives, was to be first to the [[South Pole]]. This was not attained, but the expedition's southern march reached a [[Farthest South]] latitude of 88\u00b0&nbsp;23'&nbsp;S, just {{convert|97.5|nmi|km mi}} from the pole. This was by far the longest southern polar journey to that date and a record convergence on either Pole.{{efn | Most accounts of the expedition give the \"97&nbsp;miles\" distance without giving the equivalent in statute miles, the symbolism of being within 100&nbsp;miles of the pole being considered all-important. See {{harvnb|Huntford|p=269}}. }} A separate group led by [[Welsh Australian]] geology professor [[Edgeworth David]] reached the estimated location of the [[South Magnetic Pole]], and the expedition also achieved the first ascent of [[Mount Erebus]], Antarctica's second highest volcano.\n\nThe expedition lacked governmental or institutional support, and relied on private loans and individual contributions. It was beset by financial problems and its preparations were hurried. Its ship, [[Nimrod (ship)|''Nimrod'']], was less than half of the size of [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s 1901\u20131904 expedition ship [[RRS Discovery|''Discovery'']], and Shackleton's crew lacked relevant experience. Controversy arose from Shackleton's decision to base the expedition in [[McMurdo Sound]], close to Scott's old headquarters, in contravention of a promise to Scott that he would not do so. Nevertheless, although the expedition's profile was initially much lower than that of Scott's six years earlier, its achievements attracted nationwide interest and made Shackleton a public hero. The scientific team, which included the future [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] leader [[Douglas Mawson]], carried out extensive geological, [[Zoology|zoological]] and [[Meteorology|meteorological]] work. Shackleton's transport arrangements, based on [[Manchuria]]n ponies, motor traction, and [[dog sled|sled dogs]], were innovations which, despite limited success, were later copied by Scott for his ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' Expedition]].\n\nOn his return, Shackleton overcame the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s initial scepticism about his achievements and received many public honours, including a [[knighthood]] from [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]. He made little financial gain from the expedition and eventually depended on a government grant to cover its liabilities. Within three years his southernmost record had been surpassed, as first [[Roald Amundsen|Amundsen]] and then Scott reached the South Pole. In his own moment of triumph, Amundsen nevertheless observed: \"Sir Ernest Shackleton's name will always be written in the annals of Antarctic exploration in letters of fire\".{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II, p. 115}}\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Beardmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt= A well-dressed man with greying hair and a large moustache stands looking directly at the camera. In his right hand is a cigar.|Scottish industrialist [[William Beardmore, 1st Baron Invernairn|Sir William Beardmore, later Lord Invernairn]]]]\n\nShackleton had been a junior officer on Scott's first Antarctic expedition in the ''Discovery''. He had been sent home on the relief ship ''Morning'' in 1903, after a physical collapse during the expedition's main southern journey.{{efn | Shackleton had joined Scott and [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]] on a march south in 1902\u20131903, to establish a record southern latitude at 82\u00b0&nbsp;17'&nbsp;S. All three had suffered on the return journey from exhaustion and probable incipient scurvy, but Shackleton was the worst affected. See {{harvnb|Preston|pp=65\u201366}}. }} Scott's verdict was that he \"ought not to risk further hardships in his present state of health\".{{sfn|Preston|p=68}} Shackleton felt this physical failure as a personal stigma,{{sfn|Huntford|p=117}} and on his return to England he was determined to prove himself, in the words of ''Discovery's'' second-in command [[Albert Armitage]], as \"a better man than Scott\".{{sfn|Huntford|pp=120\u2013121}} He nevertheless declined the opportunity of a swift Antarctic return as chief officer of ''Discovery's'' second relief ship [[Terra Nova (ship)|''Terra Nova'']], after helping to fit her out; he also helped to equip ''Uruguay'', the ship being prepared for the relief of [[Otto Nordenskjold]]'s expedition, stranded in the [[Weddell Sea]].{{sfn|Huntford|pp=120\u2013121}} During the next few years, while nursing intermittent hopes of resuming his Antarctic career, he pursued other options. In 1906 he was working for the industrial [[magnate]] Sir [[William Beardmore, 1st Baron Invernairn|William Beardmore]] as a [[public relations]] officer.{{sfn|Fisher|p=99}}\n\nAccording to his biographer [[Roland Huntford]], the references to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's ''The Voyage of the Discovery'', published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal mission that he should return to the Antarctic and outperform Scott.{{sfn|Huntford|p=145}} He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a cost estimate of \u00a317,000 (updated value \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|17000|1907|r=-4}}}}) for the entire expedition.{{sfn|Fisher|p=103}}{{sfn|Measuring Worth}} He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a \u00a37,000 loan guarantee (updated value \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|7000|1907|r=-4}}}}).{{sfn|Measuring Worth}}{{sfn|Huntford|p=156}} With this in hand, Shackleton felt confident enough to announce his intentions to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS) on 12 February 1907.{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=2\u20133}} One reason for Shackleton's sense of urgency was the knowledge that the Polish explorer [[Henryk Arctowski]] was planning an expedition, which was announced at the RGS on the same day as Shackleton's. In the event, Arctowski's plans were stillborn.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=108\u2013110}}\n\n==Preparations==\n\n===Initial plans===\nShackleton's original unpublished plan envisaged basing himself at the old [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' Expedition]] headquarters in [[McMurdo Sound]]. From there he proposed to launch attempts to reach the geographical [[South Pole]] and the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. Other journeys would follow, and there would be a continuous programme of scientific work.{{sfn|Fisher|p=102}} This early plan also revealed Shackleton's proposed transport methods, involving a combination of dogs, ponies and a specially designed motor vehicle.\n\nNeither ponies nor motor traction had been used in the Antarctic before, although ponies had been used by [[Frederick George Jackson|Frederick Jackson]] during the [[Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition|Jackson-Harmsworth Arctic expedition]] of 1894\u20131897. Despite Jackson's confused reports of his ponies' prowess, and contrary to specific advice from [[Fridtjof Nansen|Nansen]], the renowned Norwegian polar traveller, Shackleton decided he would take 15 ponies, later scaled down to 10.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=171\u2013172}} By the time he announced his plans to the RGS in February 1907 Shackleton had revised his cost estimate to a more realistic \u00a330,000 (updated value \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|30000|1907|r=-4}}}}).{{sfn|Measuring Worth}}{{sfn|Huntford|pp=158\u2013161}} However, the response of the RGS to Shackleton's proposals was muted; Shackleton would learn later that the Society was by this time aware of Scott's wish to lead a new expedition and that the Society wished to reserve its full approval for Scott.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=158\u2013161}}\n\n===''Nimrod''===\n[[File:NimrodDepartingToSouthPole1907.jpg|thumb|alt= A three-masted ship with sails furled, short funnel amidships, flag flying from the stern on left of picture. Two small boats are close by, and a larger vessel decked with bunting is visible in the background.|The expedition's ship [[Nimrod (ship)|''Nimrod'']] departing for the South Pole]]\n\nShackleton intended to arrive in Antarctica in January 1908, which meant leaving England during the 1907 summer. He therefore had six months to secure the financing, acquire and fit out a ship, buy all the equipment and supplies, and recruit the personnel. In April, believing that he had got the backing of Scottish businessman Donald Steuart,{{sfn|Huntford|pp=156\u2013157}} Shackleton travelled to [[Norway]] intending to buy a 700-ton polar vessel, ''Bjorn'', that would have served ideally as an expedition ship. When Steuart withdrew his support, however, ''Bjorn'' was beyond Shackleton's means. ''Bjorn'' was eventually acquired by German explorer [[Wilhelm Filchner]] and, renamed ''Deutschland'', was used in his 1911\u20131913 voyage to the [[Weddell Sea]].{{sfn|Huntford|p=339}} Shackleton had to settle for the elderly, much smaller ''Nimrod'', a 40-year-old wooden [[seal hunting|sealer]] of 334 [[gross register ton]]s,{{efn | 1 = ''Nimrod'' was less than half of the size of [[RRS Discovery|''Discovery'']], a newly built 736 [[gross register tonnage|grt]] vessel used by Scott in the [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' Expedition]] in 1901\u20131904.

Shackleton was able to do this, the extra funds including \u00a32,000 from Sir [[Philip Brocklehurst]], who paid this sum to secure a place on the expedition.{{sfn|Huntford|p=179}}\n\nA last-minute gift of \u00a34,000 from Shackleton's cousin William Bell{{sfn|Huntford|p=183}} still left the expedition far short of the required \u00a330,000, but enabled ''Nimrod'''s refit to be finished. Fundraising continued in Australia after the ship arrived there; a further \u00a35,000 was provided as a gift from the [[Government of Australia]], and the [[New Zealand Government]] gave \u00a31,000.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=138\u2013141}} By these means, and with other smaller loans and donations, the \u00a330,000 was raised, although by the end of the expedition total costs had risen, by Shackleton's estimate, to \u00a345,000.{{efn | It eventually required a British government grant of \u00a320,000 to enable Shackleton to repay his guarantors, and it is likely that some debts were written off. See {{harvnb|Huntford|pp=314\u2013315}}. }}\n\nShackleton expected to make large sums from his book about the expedition and from lectures. He also hoped to profit from sales of special postage stamps bearing the cancellation stamp of the Antarctica post office that Shackleton, appointed temporary postmaster by the New Zealand government, intended to establish there. None of these schemes produced the anticipated riches, although the post office was set up at [[Cape Royds]] and used as a conduit for the expedition's mail.{{sfn|Huntford|p=312}}{{sfn|Fisher|p=128}}{{efn | An Antarctic post office had been established in the South Orkney Islands in 1904 at the Orcadas meteorological station set up by [[William Speirs Bruce]]'s Scottish National Antarctic Expedition.

''Nimrod'''s captain was another naval reserve officer, Rupert England; 23-year-old [[John King Davis]], who would later make his own reputation as an Antarctic captain, was appointed [[First mate|chief officer]] at the last moment.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=123\u2013125}} [[Aeneas Mackintosh]], a [[merchant navy]] officer from the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] shipping line, was originally [[Second mate|second officer]], but was later transferred to the shore party, being replaced as second officer by A. E. Harbord.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=138\u2013141}} Others in the shore party were the two surgeons, Alistair Mackay and [[Eric Marshall]], Bernard Day the motor expert, and Sir Philip Brocklehurst, the subscribing member who had been taken on as assistant geologist.{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=17\u201318}}\n\n[[File:Douglas Mawson crop.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Man, mid-thirties, receding hair, clean shaven, wearing a high collar with tie.

David was influential in securing the Australian government's \u00a35,000 grant.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\nBefore departure for the Antarctic in August 1907, Joyce and Wild took a crash course in printing methods, as it was Shackleton's intention to publish a book or magazine while in the Antarctic.{{sfn|Fisher|p=121}}\n\n==Promise to Scott==\n[[File:Scott of the Antarctic crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt= Man with receding hairline, looking left, wearing naval uniform with medals, polished buttons and heavy shoulder decorations|[[Robert Falcon Scott]]]]\n\nShackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old ''Discovery'' headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\" he wrote, adding: \"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}}\n\nShackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire [[Ross Sea]] quarter until Scott decided \"what limits he puts on his own rights\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} To this Shackleton replied: \"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}}\n\nThe matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170\u00b0&nbsp;W\u2014everything to the west of that line, including [[Ross Island]], McMurdo Sound, and [[Victoria Land]], would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\",{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} and that he would seek to land further east, either at the [[Bay of Whales|Barrier Inlet]] visited briefly during the ''Discovery'' Expedition, or at [[King Edward VII Land]]. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} Polar historian [[Beau Riffenburgh]] believes this was \"a promise that should never ethically have been demanded and one that should never have been given, impacting as it might on the entire safety of Shackleton's expedition\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} The dispute soured relations between the two men (who nevertheless maintained public civilities), and would eventually lead to the complete rupture of Shackleton's formerly close friendship with Wilson.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nIn his own account of the expedition Shackleton makes no reference to the wrangle with Scott. He merely states that \"before we finally left England I had decided that if possible I would establish my base in King Edward VII Land instead of [...] McMurdo Sound\".{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=2\u20133}}\n\n==Expedition==\n\n===Voyage south===\nAfter inspection by [[King Edward VII]] and [[Queen Alexandra]], ''Nimrod'' sailed on 11 August 1907.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=20}} Shackleton remained behind on expedition business; he and other expedition members followed on a faster ship. The entire complement came together in New Zealand, ready for the ship's departure to Antarctica on New Year's Day, 1908. As a means of conserving fuel, Shackleton had arranged with the New Zealand government for ''Nimrod'' to be towed to the [[Antarctic circle]], a distance of approximately {{convert|1400|nmi|km mi|sigfig=2}},{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=148}} the costs of the tow being met partly by the  government and partly by the [[Union Company|Union Steam Ship Company]] as a contribution to the expedition.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=144\u2013145}} On 14 January, in sight of the first icebergs, the towline was cut;{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=144\u2013145}} ''Nimrod'', under her own power, proceeded southward into the floating [[pack ice]], heading for the Barrier Inlet where six years earlier ''Discovery'' had paused to allow Scott and Shackleton to take experimental balloon flights.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nThe Barrier (later known as the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]) was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed significantly in the intervening years, and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the [[Bay of Whales]] after the large number of whales seen there.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=151\u2013153}} Shackleton was not prepared to risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might [[Ice calving|calve]] into the sea, so he turned the ship towards King Edward VII Land. After repeated efforts to approach this coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, ''Nimrod'' was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given to Scott. On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=151\u2013153}}\n\n===Cape Royds===\n\n====Establishing the base====\n[[File:CapeRoyds1908.jpg|thumb|alt= A group of men in woollen jerseys, several smoking pipes, are watching repair work on a sledge.

A poster advertising ladies' [[corset]]s hangs on the wall.]]\n\nOn arriving in McMurdo Sound on 29 January 1908, ''Nimrod'''s progress southward to the ''Discovery'' base at [[Hut Point]] was blocked by frozen sea. Shackleton decided to wait a few days in the hope that the ice would break up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led to the loss of his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with ''Nimrod''. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nOn 3 February Shackleton decided not to wait for the ice to shift but to make his headquarters at the nearest practicable landing place, [[Cape Royds]]. Late that evening the ship was moored, and a suitable site for the expedition's prefabricated hut was selected. The site was separated from Hut Point by {{convert|20|nmi|km mi|}} of sea, with no landward route to the south. Shackleton believed the party was \"fortunate to get winter quarters as near as this to our starting point for the south.\"{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=52\u201356}}\n\nThe following days were occupied with the landing of stores and equipment. This work was hampered by poor weather and by the caution of Captain England, who frequently took the ship out into the bay until ice conditions at the landing ground were in his view safer.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=161\u2013167}} The next fortnight followed this pattern, leading to sharp dissent between Shackleton and the captain. At one point, Shackleton asked England to stand down on the grounds that he was ill, but England refused. The task of unloading became, in Riffenburgh's description, \"mind-numbingly difficult\"{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=161\u2013167}} but was finally completed on 22 February. ''Nimrod'' at last sailed away north, England unaware that ship's engineer Harry Dunlop was carrying a letter from Shackleton to the expedition's New Zealand agent, requesting a replacement captain for the return voyage next year. This knowledge was an open secret among the shore party; Marshall recorded in his diary that he was \"glad to see the last of [England] ... whole thing damned disgrace to name of country!\"{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\n====Ascent of Mount Erebus====\n[[File:Mount Erebus Aerial 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Distant view of a mountain with a smoke emission from its summit|[[Mount Erebus]]]]\nAfter ''Nimrod'''s departure, the sea ice broke up, cutting off the party's route to the Barrier and thus making preparatory sledging and depot-laying impossible. Shackleton decided to give the expedition impetus by ordering an immediate attempt to ascend [[Mount Erebus]].{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=171\u2013177}}\n\nThis mountain, {{convert|12450|ft|m|}} high, had never been climbed. A party from ''Discovery'' (which had included Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce) had explored the foothills in 1904 but had not ascended higher than {{convert|3000|ft|m|}}. Neither Wild nor Joyce was in the ''Nimrod'' Expedition's main Erebus party, which consisted of Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. With Marshall, Adams and Brocklehurst forming a support group, the ascent began on 5 March.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=171\u2013177}}\n\nOn 7 March the two groups combined at around {{convert|5500|ft|m|}}, and all advanced towards the summit. On the following day a [[blizzard]] held them up, but early on 9 March the climb resumed; later that day the summit of the lower, main crater, was achieved.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=171\u2013177}} By this time Brocklehurst's feet were too frostbitten for him to continue, so he was left in camp while the others advanced to the active crater, which they reached after four hours.  Several meteorological experiments were carried out, and many rock samples were taken. Thereafter a rapid descent was made, mainly by sliding down successive snow-slopes. The party reached the Cape Royds hut \"nearly dead\", according to Eric Marshall, on 11 March.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=171\u2013177}}\n\n====Winter 1908====\nThe expedition's hut, a prefabricated structure measuring 33 x 19&nbsp;feet (10m x 5.8m), was ready for occupation by the end of February. It was divided into a series of mainly two-person cubicles, with a kitchen area, a darkroom, storage and laboratory space. The ponies were housed in stalls built on the most sheltered side of the hut, while the dog kennels were placed close to the porch.{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=81\u201391}} Shackleton's inclusive leadership style, in contrast to that of Scott, meant no demarcation between upper and lower decks\u2014all lived, worked and ate together. Morale was high; as assistant geologist Philip Brocklehurst recorded, Shackleton \"had a faculty for treating each member of the expedition as though he were valuable to it\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=185}}\n\nIn the ensuing months of winter darkness Joyce and Wild printed around 30&nbsp;copies of the expedition's book, [[Aurora Australis (book)|''Aurora Australis'']], which were sewn and bound using packaging materials.{{sfn|Mills|p=65}} The most important winter's work, however, was preparing for the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton had been able to reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading the South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=171\u2013177}}\n\n{{anchor|Southern journey}}\n\n===Southern journey===\n\n====Outward march====\nShackleton's choice of a four-man team for the southern journey to the South Pole was largely determined by the number of surviving ponies. Influenced by his experiences on the Discovery Expedition, he had put his confidence in ponies rather than dogs for the long polar march.{{sfn|Mills|p=67}} The motor car, which ran well on flat ice, could not cope with Barrier surfaces and was not considered for the polar journey.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=237\u2013238}} The men chosen by Shackleton to accompany him were Marshall, Adams and Wild. Joyce, whose Antarctic experience exceeded all save Wild's, was excluded from the party after Marshall's medical examination raised doubts about his fitness.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=234\u2013235}}\n\nThe march began on 29 October 1908. Shackleton had calculated the return distance to the Pole as {{convert|1494|nmi|km mi}}. His initial plan allowed 91&nbsp;days for the return journey, requiring a daily average distance of about {{convert|16|nmi|km mi}}.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=201}} After a slow start due to a combination of poor weather and lameness in the horses, Shackleton reduced the daily food allowance to extend the total available journey time to 110&nbsp;days. This required a shorter daily average of around 13\u00bd nautical miles.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=153}} Between 9 and 21 November they made good progress, but the ponies suffered on the difficult Barrier surface, and the first of the four had to be shot when the party reached 81\u00b0&nbsp;S. On 26 November a new farthest south record was established as they passed the 82\u00b0&nbsp;17' mark set by Scott's southern march in December 1902.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=171}} Shackleton's party covered the distance in 29&nbsp;days compared with Scott's 59, using a track considerably east of Scott's to avoid the surface problems the earlier journey had encountered.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=193}}\n\nAs the group moved into unknown territory, the Barrier surface became increasingly disturbed and broken; two more ponies succumbed to the strain. The mountains to the west curved round to block their path southward, and the party's attention was caught by a \"brilliant gleam of light\" in the sky ahead.<ref>{{harvnb|Mills|p=80}}, quoting Frank Wild's diary.</ref> The reason for this phenomenon became clear on 3 December when, after a climb through the foothills of the mountain chain, they saw before them what Shackleton later described as \"an open road to the south, [...] a great glacier, running almost south to north between two huge mountain ranges\".{{sfn|Shackleton|p=180}} \n\nShackleton christened this glacier the \"Beardmore\" after the expedition's biggest sponsor. Travel on the glacier surface proved to be a trial, especially for Socks, the remaining pony, who had great difficulty in finding secure footings. On 7 December, Socks disappeared down a deep [[crevasse]], very nearly taking Wild with him. However, the pony's [[horse harness|harness]] broke, and the sledge containing their supplies remained on the surface. For the rest of the southward journey and the whole of the return trip they had to rely on [[manhauling|man-hauling]].{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=208\u2013209 and 221\u2013222}}\n\nAs the journey continued, personal antagonisms emerged. Wild privately expressed the wish that Marshall would \"fall down a crevasse about a thousand feet deep\".<ref>Wild, diary, quoted by {{harvnb|Mills|p=93}}.</ref> Marshall wrote that following Shackleton to the Pole was \"like following an old woman. Always panicking\".{{sfn|Huntford|pp=263\u2013264}} However, Christmas Day was celebrated with [[cr\u00e8me de menthe]] and cigars. Their position was 85\u00b0&nbsp;51'&nbsp;S, still {{convert|249|nmi|km mi|}} from the Pole, and they were now carrying barely a month's supply of food, having stored the rest in depots for their return journey.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=263\u2013264}} They could not cover the remaining distance to the Pole and back with this amount of food.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=226}} However, Shackleton was not yet prepared to admit that the Pole was beyond them and decided to go forward after cutting food rations further, and dumping all but the most essential equipment.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=200}}\n\nOn [[Boxing Day]] the glacier ascent was at last completed, and the march on the [[polar plateau]] began. Conditions did not ease; Shackleton recorded 31 December as the \"hardest day we have had\".{{sfn|Shackleton|p=204}} On the next day he noted that, having attained 87\u00b0&nbsp;6\u00bd\u2032&nbsp;S, they had beaten North and South polar records.<ref>{{harvnb|Shackleton|p=205}}. The North reference was to [[Robert Peary|Peary]]'s then farthest north of 87\u00b0&nbsp;6'&nbsp;N.</ref> That day, referring to Marshall and Adams, Wild wrote: \"if we only had Joyce and Marston here instead of those two grubscoffing useless beggars we would have done it [the Pole] easily.\"{{sfn|Mills|p=96}} On 4 January 1909, Shackleton finally accepted that the Pole was beyond them, and revised his goal to the symbolic achievement of getting within 100&nbsp;geographical miles of the Pole.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=207}} The party struggled on, at the borders of survival,{{sfn|Huntford|p=270}} until on 9 January 1909, after a last dash forward without the sledge or other equipment, the march ended. \"We have shot our bolt\", wrote Shackleton, \"and the tale is 88\u00b0&nbsp;23'&nbsp;S\".{{sfn|Shackleton|p=210}} They were 97.5&nbsp;geographical [[Farthest South|miles from the South Pole]]. The British flag was duly planted, and Shackleton named the polar plateau after King Edward VII.{{efn | Three years later, on reaching the South Pole, Amundsen named the same plateau after King Haakon of Norway. ({{harvnb|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II, p. 122}}.) Neither name survives on modern maps. }}\n\n====Return journey====\n[[File:Nimrod return 1909.jpg|thumb|alt= On the left is a snow cairn with flags. Three men are nearby, and assorted equipment is strewn on the snow.|On the return journey. The party reach a depot on the Great Ice Barrier]]\n\nThe party turned for home after 73&nbsp;days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders ''Nimrod'', having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened,{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=251\u2013261}} yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=251\u2013261}} As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot;{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=251\u2013261}} during the ascent the same distance had taken 12&nbsp;days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=251\u2013261}}\n\nThe depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with [[dysentery]], was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\".<ref>Wild diary, quoted in {{harvnb|Mills|p=108}}.</ref> A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe [[enteritis]], the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=258}}\n\n[[File:TheSouthernParty.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Four menwearing dishevelled clothing and worn expressions face the camera. The head of a dog is just visible on the left.|Wild, Shackleton, Marshall and Adams aboard ''Nimrod'' after their southern journey]]\n\n\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\", wrote Shackleton.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=221}} From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \"[[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]] plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\".{{sfn|Shackleton|p=223}} Wild's [[Laconic phrase|laconic]] comment was \"Good old Joyce\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=261}}\n\nTheir food worries were now resolved, but they still had to get back to Hut Point before the 1 March deadline. The final leg of their march was interrupted by a blizzard, which held them in camp for 24&nbsp;hours. On 27 February, when they were still {{convert|33|nmi|km mi}} from safety, Marshall collapsed. Shackleton then decided that he and Wild would make a dash for Hut Point in hopes of finding the ship and holding her until the other two could be rescued. They reached the hut late on 28 February.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=262\u2013263}} Hoping that the ship was nearby, they sought to attract its attention by setting fire to a small wooden hut used for [[magnetic]] observations.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=274\u2013278}} Shortly afterwards ''Nimrod'', which had been anchored at the [[Erebus Ice Tongue|Glacier Tongue]], came into view: \"No happier sight ever met the eyes of man\", wrote Wild later.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=274\u2013278}} It was a further three days before Adams and Marshall could be picked up from the Barrier, but by 4 March the whole southern party was aboard and Shackleton was able to order full steam towards the north.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=274\u2013278}}\n\n===Northern Party===\nWhile preparing for his southern journey, Shackleton gave instructions to Edgeworth David to lead a Northern party to Victoria Land to carry out magnetic and geological work. The party was to try to reach the Magnetic Pole, and was to carry out a full geological survey in the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys|Dry Valley]] area.{{efn | The dry valley (snow-free) region of the western mountains had been discovered during Scott's western journey in 1903, but had yet to be properly surveyed. See {{harvnb|Crane|p=270}}. }} David's party consisted of himself, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. It would be a man-hauling party; the dogs remained at base to be used for depot-laying and other routine work.{{sfn|Huntford|p=238}} The party had orders to plant the [[Union Jack]] at the Magnetic Pole and to take possession of Victoria Land for the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=260\u2013262}} After several days' preparatory work, they started out on 5 October 1908, drawn for the first few miles by the motor car.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=265}}\n\n[[File:Northernparty.png|thumb|upright|alt= Three men stand around a flag planted in the snow.|(l. to r.) Mackay, Edgeworth David, and Mawson at the Southern Magnetic Pole, 17 January 1909]]\nDue to sea ice conditions and adverse weather, progress was initially very slow. By the end of October they had crossed McMurdo Sound and advanced 60&nbsp;miles (100&nbsp;km) up the difficult Victoria Land coast, at which point they decided to concentrate all their efforts on reaching the Magnetic Pole.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=238}} After traversing the [[Nordenskjold Ice Tongue]] and the treacherous [[Drygalski Glacier (Antarctica)|Drygalski Glacier]] they were finally able to leave the coast and turn north-west, towards the Magnetic Pole's approximate location. Before then, David had a narrow escape after falling into a crevasse but was rescued by Mawson.<ref>{{harvnb|Shackleton|pp=291\u2013292}} (David's account).</ref>{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=241\u2013249}}\n\nTheir way up to the inland plateau was via a labyrinthine glacier (later named the Reeves Glacier after the Royal Geographical Society's main map curator),{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=293}} which brought them on 27 December to a hard snow surface.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=241\u2013249}} This enabled them to move more swiftly, at a rate of about {{convert|10|nmi|km mi}} daily, taking regular magnetic observations. On 16 January, these observations showed them to be about {{convert|13|nmi|km mi}} from the Magnetic Pole. The next day, 17 January 1909, they reached their goal, fixing the pole's position as 72\u00b0&nbsp;15'&nbsp;S, 155\u00b0&nbsp;16'&nbsp;E, at an elevation of {{convert|7260|ft|m|}}. In a muted ceremony, David took formal possession of the area for the British Empire.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=241\u2013249}}\n\nExhausted, and short of food, the party faced a return journey of {{convert|250|nmi|km mi}}, with just 15&nbsp;days to complete it if they were to make their prearranged coastal rendezvous with ''Nimrod''. Despite increasing physical weakness they maintained their daily distances, and on 31 January were {{convert|16|nmi|km mi}} from their agreed pick-up point. Bad weather delayed them, and the rendezvous was not reached until 2 February. That night, in heavy drifting snow, ''Nimrod'' passed by them, unable to make out their camp.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=241\u2013249}} Two days later, however, after ''Nimrod'' had turned south again, the group was spotted from the ship and was able to scramble to safety, although in the rush to get aboard Mawson fell {{convert|18|ft|m}} down a crevasse. The party had been travelling for four months and were wearing the same clothes in which they had departed Cape Royds; reportedly \"the aroma was overpowering\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=269\u2013273}} Before this rescue, ''Nimrod'' had picked up a geological party consisting of Priestley, Brocklehurst and [[:de:Bertram Armytage]], who had been carrying out geological work in the [[Ferrar Glacier]] region.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=269\u2013273}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Ernest Shackleton.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dark-haired man, hands on hips, looking straight at the camera|Sir Ernest Shackleton: \"What Nansen is to the North, Shackleton is to the South\"\u2014[[Roald Amundsen]]]]\nOn 23 March 1909, Shackleton landed in New Zealand and cabled a 2,500-word report to the London ''[[Daily Mail]]'', with which he had an exclusive contract.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=279}} Amid the acclamation and unstinting praise that Shackleton received from the exploring community, including [[Fridtjof Nansen|Nansen]] and [[Roald Amundsen|Amundsen]], the response of the Royal Geographical Society was more guarded. Its former president, [[Sir Clements Markham]], privately expressed his disbelief of Shackleton's claimed latitude.{{sfn|Huntford|p=308}} However, on 14 June, Shackleton was met at London's [[Charing Cross Station]] by a very large crowd, which included RGS president [[Leonard Darwin]] and a rather reluctant Captain Scott.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=286}}\n\nAs to the latitude claimed, the reason for doubting its accuracy was that after 3 January all  positions  had been computed by [[dead reckoning]]: on direction, speed and elapsed time. The last proper observation, on 3 January had calculated the latitude as 87\u00b0&nbsp;22'. Shackleton's table of distances show that over the next three days they covered just over {{convert|40|nmi|km mi}}, to reach an estimated 88\u00b0&nbsp;7' on 6 January. They were then held up for two days by a blizzard. On 9 January 1909, the table shows that the party travelled a further {{convert|16|nmi|km mi}} to reach their farthest south, and the same distance back to camp.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=362}} This distance in a single day far exceeded those for any other stage of the journey. Shackleton explained that this was a dash, \"half running, half walking\", unencumbered by the sledge or other equipment.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=210}} Each of the four men independently confirmed his belief in the latitude achieved, and none gave any subsequent cause for his word to be doubted.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=294}}\n\nShackleton was made a [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (CVO) by  King Edward, who later conferred a knighthood on him.{{sfn|Huntford|p=315}} The RGS presented him with a gold medal, although apparently with reservations\u2014\"We do not propose to make the Medal so large as that which was awarded to Captain Scott\", recorded an official.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=289\u2013290}} Although in the eyes of the public he was a hero, the riches that Shackleton had anticipated failed to materialise. The soaring costs of the expedition and the need to meet loan guarantees meant that he was saved from financial embarrassment only by a belated government grant of \u00a320,000.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=290}}\n\nThe farthest south record of the ''Nimrod'' Expedition stood for less than three years, until Amundsen reached the South Pole on 15 December 1911. For his trail-breaking achievements, Shackleton received a fulsome tribute from Amundsen: \"What Nansen is to the North, Shackleton is to the South\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=300}} Thereafter, Shackleton's Antarctic ambitions were fixed on a transcontinental crossing, which he attempted unsuccessfully with the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]], 1914\u201317, although his status as a leading figure in the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]] was by then assured.  Other members of the ''Nimrod'' Expedition also achieved fame and standing in future years. Edgeworth David, Adams, Mawson and Priestley all eventually received knighthoods, the latter two continuing their polar work on further expeditions, though neither went south again with Shackleton. Mawson led the 1911\u201313 [[Australian Antarctic Expedition]], and Priestley was part of the [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' Expedition's]] scientific team. Frank Wild was second-in-command to the \"Boss\" on the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition and on the short [[Shackleton-Rowett Expedition|''Quest'' Expedition]] where he took over command after Shackleton's death in [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] in 1922.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=302\u2013303}} Ten years after her return from the Antarctic, ''Nimrod'' was battered to pieces in the [[North Sea]], after running aground on the Barber Sands off the [[Norfolk]] (UK) coast on 31 January 1919. Only two of her 12-person crew survived.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=306\u2013307}}\n\nSeveral mostly intact cases of whisky and brandy left behind at Cape Royds in 1909 were recovered in 2010, for analysis by a distilling company. A revival of the vintage (and since lost) formula for the particular brands found has been offered for sale with a portion of the proceeds to benefit the [[Antarctic Heritage Trust (New Zealand)|New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust]] which discovered the lost spirits.{{sfn|USA Today, ''century-old whisky''}}{{sfn|AP, ''century-old scotch''}}{{sfn|BBC News, ''Whisky recreated''}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Geography}}\n\n* [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]]\n* [[List of Antarctic expeditions]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{notes}}\n\n===References===\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Amundsen\n  | first = Roald\n  | authorlink = Roald Amundsen\n  | year = 1976\n  | title = The South Pole\n  | volume = I & II\n  | publisher = C.

The photograph was taken by expedition leader [[Ernest Shackleton]].]]\n\nThe '''''Nimrod''''' '''Expedition''' of 1907\u20131909, otherwise known as the British Antarctic Expedition, was the first of three<!--not counting the one on which he died?--> expeditions to the [[Antarctic]] led by [[Ernest Shackleton]]. Its main target, among a range of geographical and scientific objectives, was to be first to the [[South Pole]]. This was not attained, but the expedition's southern march reached a [[Farthest South]] latitude of 88\u00b0&nbsp;23'&nbsp;S, just {{convert|97.5|nmi|km mi}} from the pole. This was by far the longest southern polar journey to that date and a record convergence on either Pole.{{efn | Most accounts of the expedition give the \"97&nbsp;miles\" distance without giving the equivalent in statute miles, the symbolism of being within 100&nbsp;miles of the pole being considered all-important. See {{harvnb|Huntford|p=269}}. }} A separate group led by [[Welsh Australian]] geology professor [[Edgeworth David]] reached the estimated location of the [[South Magnetic Pole]], and the expedition also achieved the first ascent of [[Mount Erebus]], Antarctica's second highest volcano.\n\nThe expedition lacked governmental or institutional support, and relied on private loans and individual contributions. It was beset by financial problems and its preparations were hurried. Its ship, [[Nimrod (ship)|''Nimrod'']], was less than half of the size of [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s 1901\u20131904 expedition ship [[RRS Discovery|''Discovery'']], and Shackleton's crew lacked relevant experience. Controversy arose from Shackleton's decision to base the expedition in [[McMurdo Sound]], close to Scott's old headquarters, in contravention of a promise to Scott that he would not do so. Nevertheless, although the expedition's profile was initially much lower than that of Scott's six years earlier, its achievements attracted nationwide interest and made Shackleton a public hero. The scientific team, which included the future [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] leader [[Douglas Mawson]], carried out extensive geological, [[Zoology|zoological]] and [[Meteorology|meteorological]] work. Shackleton's transport arrangements, based on [[Manchuria]]n ponies, motor traction, and [[dog sled|sled dogs]], were innovations which, despite limited success, were later copied by Scott for his ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' Expedition]].\n\nOn his return, Shackleton overcame the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s initial scepticism about his achievements and received many public honours, including a [[knighthood]] from [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]. He made little financial gain from the expedition and eventually depended on a government grant to cover its liabilities. Within three years his southernmost record had been surpassed, as first [[Roald Amundsen|Amundsen]] and then Scott reached the South Pole. In his own moment of triumph, Amundsen nevertheless observed: \"Sir Ernest Shackleton's name will always be written in the annals of Antarctic exploration in letters of fire\".{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II, p. 115}}\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Beardmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt= A well-dressed man with greying hair and a large moustache stands looking directly at the camera. In his right hand is a cigar.|Scottish industrialist [[William Beardmore, 1st Baron Invernairn|Sir William Beardmore, later Lord Invernairn]]]]\n\nShackleton had been a junior officer on Scott's first Antarctic expedition in the ''Discovery''. He had been sent home on the relief ship ''Morning'' in 1903, after a physical collapse during the expedition's main southern journey.{{efn | Shackleton had joined Scott and [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]] on a march south in 1902\u20131903, to establish a record southern latitude at 82\u00b0&nbsp;17'&nbsp;S. All three had suffered on the return journey from exhaustion and probable incipient scurvy, but Shackleton was the worst affected. See {{harvnb|Preston|pp=65\u201366}}. }} Scott's verdict was that he \"ought not to risk further hardships in his present state of health\".{{sfn|Preston|p=68}} Shackleton felt this physical failure as a personal stigma,{{sfn|Huntford|p=117}} and on his return to England he was determined to prove himself, in the words of ''Discovery's'' second-in command [[Albert Armitage]], as \"a better man than Scott\".{{sfn|Huntford|pp=120\u2013121}} He nevertheless declined the opportunity of a swift Antarctic return as chief officer of ''Discovery's'' second relief ship [[Terra Nova (ship)|''Terra Nova'']], after helping to fit her out; he also helped to equip ''Uruguay'', the ship being prepared for the relief of [[Otto Nordenskjold]]'s expedition, stranded in the [[Weddell Sea]].{{sfn|Huntford|pp=120\u2013121}} During the next few years, while nursing intermittent hopes of resuming his Antarctic career, he pursued other options. In 1906 he was working for the industrial [[magnate]] Sir [[William Beardmore, 1st Baron Invernairn|William Beardmore]] as a [[public relations]] officer.{{sfn|Fisher|p=99}}\n\nAccording to his biographer [[Roland Huntford]], the references to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's ''The Voyage of the Discovery'', published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal mission that he should return to the Antarctic and outperform Scott.{{sfn|Huntford|p=145}} He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a cost estimate of \u00a317,000 (updated value \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|17000|1907|r=-4}}}}) for the entire expedition.{{sfn|Fisher|p=103}}{{sfn|Measuring Worth}} He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a \u00a37,000 loan guarantee (updated value \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|7000|1907|r=-4}}}}).{{sfn|Measuring Worth}}{{sfn|Huntford|p=156}} With this in hand, Shackleton felt confident enough to announce his intentions to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS) on 12 February 1907.{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=2\u20133}} One reason for Shackleton's sense of urgency was the knowledge that the Polish explorer [[Henryk Arctowski]] was planning an expedition, which was announced at the RGS on the same day as Shackleton's. In the event, Arctowski's plans were stillborn.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=108\u2013110}}\n\n==Preparations==\n\n===Initial plans===\nShackleton's original unpublished plan envisaged basing himself at the old [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' Expedition]] headquarters in [[McMurdo Sound]]. From there he proposed to launch attempts to reach the geographical [[South Pole]] and the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. Other journeys would follow, and there would be a continuous programme of scientific work.{{sfn|Fisher|p=102}} This early plan also revealed Shackleton's proposed transport methods, involving a combination of dogs, ponies and a specially designed motor vehicle.\n\nNeither ponies nor motor traction had been used in the Antarctic before, although ponies had been used by [[Frederick George Jackson|Frederick Jackson]] during the [[Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition|Jackson-Harmsworth Arctic expedition]] of 1894\u20131897. Despite Jackson's confused reports of his ponies' prowess, and contrary to specific advice from [[Fridtjof Nansen|Nansen]], the renowned Norwegian polar traveller, Shackleton decided he would take 15 ponies, later scaled down to 10.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=171\u2013172}} By the time he announced his plans to the RGS in February 1907 Shackleton had revised his cost estimate to a more realistic \u00a330,000 (updated value \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|30000|1907|r=-4}}}}).{{sfn|Measuring Worth}}{{sfn|Huntford|pp=158\u2013161}} However, the response of the RGS to Shackleton's proposals was muted; Shackleton would learn later that the Society was by this time aware of Scott's wish to lead a new expedition and that the Society wished to reserve its full approval for Scott.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=158\u2013161}}\n\n===''Nimrod''===\n[[File:NimrodDepartingToSouthPole1907.jpg|thumb|alt= A three-masted ship with sails furled, short funnel amidships, flag flying from the stern on left of picture.

He therefore had six months to secure the financing, acquire and fit out a ship, buy all the equipment and supplies, and recruit the personnel. In April, believing that he had got the backing of Scottish businessman Donald Steuart,{{sfn|Huntford|pp=156\u2013157}} Shackleton travelled to [[Norway]] intending to buy a 700-ton polar vessel, ''Bjorn'', that would have served ideally as an expedition ship. When Steuart withdrew his support, however, ''Bjorn'' was beyond Shackleton's means. ''Bjorn'' was eventually acquired by German explorer [[Wilhelm Filchner]] and, renamed ''Deutschland'', was used in his 1911\u20131913 voyage to the [[Weddell Sea]].{{sfn|Huntford|p=339}} Shackleton had to settle for the elderly, much smaller ''Nimrod'', a 40-year-old wooden [[seal hunting|sealer]] of 334 [[gross register ton]]s,{{efn | 1 = ''Nimrod'' was less than half of the size of [[RRS Discovery|''Discovery'']], a newly built 736 [[gross register tonnage|grt]] vessel used by Scott in the [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' Expedition]] in 1901\u20131904.

Shackleton was able to do this, the extra funds including \u00a32,000 from Sir [[Philip Brocklehurst]], who paid this sum to secure a place on the expedition.{{sfn|Huntford|p=179}}\n\nA last-minute gift of \u00a34,000 from Shackleton's cousin William Bell{{sfn|Huntford|p=183}} still left the expedition far short of the required \u00a330,000, but enabled ''Nimrod'''s refit to be finished. Fundraising continued in Australia after the ship arrived there; a further \u00a35,000 was provided as a gift from the [[Government of Australia]], and the [[New Zealand Government]] gave \u00a31,000.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=138\u2013141}} By these means, and with other smaller loans and donations, the \u00a330,000 was raised, although by the end of the expedition total costs had risen, by Shackleton's estimate, to \u00a345,000.{{efn | It eventually required a British government grant of \u00a320,000 to enable Shackleton to repay his guarantors, and it is likely that some debts were written off.

He also hoped to profit from sales of special postage stamps bearing the cancellation stamp of the Antarctica post office that Shackleton, appointed temporary postmaster by the New Zealand government, intended to establish there. None of these schemes produced the anticipated riches, although the post office was set up at [[Cape Royds]] and used as a conduit for the expedition's mail.{{sfn|Huntford|p=312}}{{sfn|Fisher|p=128}}{{efn | An Antarctic post office had been established in the South Orkney Islands in 1904 at the Orcadas meteorological station set up by [[William Speirs Bruce]]'s Scottish National Antarctic Expedition.

''Nimrod'''s captain was another naval reserve officer, Rupert England; 23-year-old [[John King Davis]], who would later make his own reputation as an Antarctic captain, was appointed [[First mate|chief officer]] at the last moment.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=123\u2013125}} [[Aeneas Mackintosh]], a [[merchant navy]] officer from the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] shipping line, was originally [[Second mate|second officer]], but was later transferred to the shore party, being replaced as second officer by A. E. Harbord.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=138\u2013141}} Others in the shore party were the two surgeons, Alistair Mackay and [[Eric Marshall]], Bernard Day the motor expert, and Sir Philip Brocklehurst, the subscribing member who had been taken on as assistant geologist.{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=17\u201318}}\n\n[[File:Douglas Mawson crop.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Man, mid-thirties, receding hair, clean shaven, wearing a high collar with tie.

David was influential in securing the Australian government's \u00a35,000 grant.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\nBefore departure for the Antarctic in August 1907, Joyce and Wild took a crash course in printing methods, as it was Shackleton's intention to publish a book or magazine while in the Antarctic.{{sfn|Fisher|p=121}}\n\n==Promise to Scott==\n[[File:Scott of the Antarctic crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt= Man with receding hairline, looking left, wearing naval uniform with medals, polished buttons and heavy shoulder decorations|[[Robert Falcon Scott]]]]\n\nShackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old ''Discovery'' headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\" he wrote, adding: \"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}}\n\nShackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire [[Ross Sea]] quarter until Scott decided \"what limits he puts on his own rights\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} To this Shackleton replied: \"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}}\n\nThe matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170\u00b0&nbsp;W\u2014everything to the west of that line, including [[Ross Island]], McMurdo Sound, and [[Victoria Land]], would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\",{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} and that he would seek to land further east, either at the [[Bay of Whales|Barrier Inlet]] visited briefly during the ''Discovery'' Expedition, or at [[King Edward VII Land]]. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} Polar historian [[Beau Riffenburgh]] believes this was \"a promise that should never ethically have been demanded and one that should never have been given, impacting as it might on the entire safety of Shackleton's expedition\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=110\u2013116}} The dispute soured relations between the two men (who nevertheless maintained public civilities), and would eventually lead to the complete rupture of Shackleton's formerly close friendship with Wilson.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nIn his own account of the expedition Shackleton makes no reference to the wrangle with Scott. He merely states that \"before we finally left England I had decided that if possible I would establish my base in King Edward VII Land instead of [...] McMurdo Sound\".{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=2\u20133}}\n\n==Expedition==\n\n===Voyage south===\nAfter inspection by [[King Edward VII]] and [[Queen Alexandra]], ''Nimrod'' sailed on 11 August 1907.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=20}} Shackleton remained behind on expedition business; he and other expedition members followed on a faster ship. The entire complement came together in New Zealand, ready for the ship's departure to Antarctica on New Year's Day, 1908. As a means of conserving fuel, Shackleton had arranged with the New Zealand government for ''Nimrod'' to be towed to the [[Antarctic circle]], a distance of approximately {{convert|1400|nmi|km mi|sigfig=2}},{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=148}} the costs of the tow being met partly by the  government and partly by the [[Union Company|Union Steam Ship Company]] as a contribution to the expedition.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=144\u2013145}} On 14 January, in sight of the first icebergs, the towline was cut;{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=144\u2013145}} ''Nimrod'', under her own power, proceeded southward into the floating [[pack ice]], heading for the Barrier Inlet where six years earlier ''Discovery'' had paused to allow Scott and Shackleton to take experimental balloon flights.{{sfn|Fisher|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nThe Barrier (later known as the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]) was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed significantly in the intervening years, and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the [[Bay of Whales]] after the large number of whales seen there.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=151\u2013153}} Shackleton was not prepared to risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might [[Ice calving|calve]] into the sea, so he turned the ship towards King Edward VII Land. After repeated efforts to approach this coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, ''Nimrod'' was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given to Scott. On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=151\u2013153}}\n\n===Cape Royds===\n\n====Establishing the base====\n[[File:CapeRoyds1908.jpg|thumb|alt= A group of men in woollen jerseys, several smoking pipes, are watching repair work on a sledge.

A poster advertising ladies' [[corset]]s hangs on the wall.]]\n\nOn arriving in McMurdo Sound on 29 January 1908, ''Nimrod'''s progress southward to the ''Discovery'' base at [[Hut Point]] was blocked by frozen sea. Shackleton decided to wait a few days in the hope that the ice would break up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led to the loss of his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with ''Nimrod''. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nOn 3 February Shackleton decided not to wait for the ice to shift but to make his headquarters at the nearest practicable landing place, [[Cape Royds]]. Late that evening the ship was moored, and a suitable site for the expedition's prefabricated hut was selected. The site was separated from Hut Point by {{convert|20|nmi|km mi|}} of sea, with no landward route to the south. Shackleton believed the party was \"fortunate to get winter quarters as near as this to our starting point for the south.\"{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=52\u201356}}\n\nThe following days were occupied with the landing of stores and equipment. This work was hampered by poor weather and by the caution of Captain England, who frequently took the ship out into the bay until ice conditions at the landing ground were in his view safer.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=161\u2013167}} The next fortnight followed this pattern, leading to sharp dissent between Shackleton and the captain. At one point, Shackleton asked England to stand down on the grounds that he was ill, but England refused. The task of unloading became, in Riffenburgh's description, \"mind-numbingly difficult\"{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=161\u2013167}} but was finally completed on 22 February. ''Nimrod'' at last sailed away north, England unaware that ship's engineer Harry Dunlop was carrying a letter from Shackleton to the expedition's New Zealand agent, requesting a replacement captain for the return voyage next year. This knowledge was an open secret among the shore party; Marshall recorded in his diary that he was \"glad to see the last of [England] ... whole thing damned disgrace to name of country!\"{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\n====Ascent of Mount Erebus====\n[[File:Mount Erebus Aerial 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Distant view of a mountain with a smoke emission from its summit|[[Mount Erebus]]]]\nAfter ''Nimrod'''s departure, the sea ice broke up, cutting off the party's route to the Barrier and thus making preparatory sledging and depot-laying impossible. Shackleton decided to give the expedition impetus by ordering an immediate attempt to ascend [[Mount Erebus]].{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=171\u2013177}}\n\nThis mountain, {{convert|12450|ft|m|}} high, had never been climbed. A party from ''Discovery'' (which had included Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce) had explored the foothills in 1904 but had not ascended higher than {{convert|3000|ft|m|}}. Neither Wild nor Joyce was in the ''Nimrod'' Expedition's main Erebus party, which consisted of Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. With Marshall, Adams and Brocklehurst forming a support group, the ascent began on 5 March.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=171\u2013177}}\n\nOn 7 March the two groups combined at around {{convert|5500|ft|m|}}, and all advanced towards the summit. On the following day a [[blizzard]] held them up, but early on 9 March the climb resumed; later that day the summit of the lower, main crater, was achieved.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=171\u2013177}} By this time Brocklehurst's feet were too frostbitten for him to continue, so he was left in camp while the others advanced to the active crater, which they reached after four hours.  Several meteorological experiments were carried out, and many rock samples were taken. Thereafter a rapid descent was made, mainly by sliding down successive snow-slopes. The party reached the Cape Royds hut \"nearly dead\", according to Eric Marshall, on 11 March.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=171\u2013177}}\n\n====Winter 1908====\nThe expedition's hut, a prefabricated structure measuring 33 x 19&nbsp;feet (10m x 5.8m), was ready for occupation by the end of February. It was divided into a series of mainly two-person cubicles, with a kitchen area, a darkroom, storage and laboratory space. The ponies were housed in stalls built on the most sheltered side of the hut, while the dog kennels were placed close to the porch.{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=81\u201391}} Shackleton's inclusive leadership style, in contrast to that of Scott, meant no demarcation between upper and lower decks\u2014all lived, worked and ate together. Morale was high; as assistant geologist Philip Brocklehurst recorded, Shackleton \"had a faculty for treating each member of the expedition as though he were valuable to it\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=185}}\n\nIn the ensuing months of winter darkness Joyce and Wild printed around 30&nbsp;copies of the expedition's book, [[Aurora Australis (book)|''Aurora Australis'']], which were sewn and bound using packaging materials.{{sfn|Mills|p=65}} The most important winter's work, however, was preparing for the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton had been able to reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading the South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=171\u2013177}}\n\n{{anchor|Southern journey}}\n\n===Southern journey===\n\n====Outward march====\nShackleton's choice of a four-man team for the southern journey to the South Pole was largely determined by the number of surviving ponies. Influenced by his experiences on the Discovery Expedition, he had put his confidence in ponies rather than dogs for the long polar march.{{sfn|Mills|p=67}} The motor car, which ran well on flat ice, could not cope with Barrier surfaces and was not considered for the polar journey.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=237\u2013238}} The men chosen by Shackleton to accompany him were Marshall, Adams and Wild. Joyce, whose Antarctic experience exceeded all save Wild's, was excluded from the party after Marshall's medical examination raised doubts about his fitness.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=234\u2013235}}\n\nThe march began on 29 October 1908. Shackleton had calculated the return distance to the Pole as {{convert|1494|nmi|km mi}}. His initial plan allowed 91&nbsp;days for the return journey, requiring a daily average distance of about {{convert|16|nmi|km mi}}.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=201}} After a slow start due to a combination of poor weather and lameness in the horses, Shackleton reduced the daily food allowance to extend the total available journey time to 110&nbsp;days. This required a shorter daily average of around 13\u00bd nautical miles.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=153}} Between 9 and 21 November they made good progress, but the ponies suffered on the difficult Barrier surface, and the first of the four had to be shot when the party reached 81\u00b0&nbsp;S. On 26 November a new farthest south record was established as they passed the 82\u00b0&nbsp;17' mark set by Scott's southern march in December 1902.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=171}} Shackleton's party covered the distance in 29&nbsp;days compared with Scott's 59, using a track considerably east of Scott's to avoid the surface problems the earlier journey had encountered.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=193}}\n\nAs the group moved into unknown territory, the Barrier surface became increasingly disturbed and broken; two more ponies succumbed to the strain. The mountains to the west curved round to block their path southward, and the party's attention was caught by a \"brilliant gleam of light\" in the sky ahead.<ref>{{harvnb|Mills|p=80}}, quoting Frank Wild's diary.</ref> The reason for this phenomenon became clear on 3 December when, after a climb through the foothills of the mountain chain, they saw before them what Shackleton later described as \"an open road to the south, [...] a great glacier, running almost south to north between two huge mountain ranges\".{{sfn|Shackleton|p=180}} \n\nShackleton christened this glacier the \"Beardmore\" after the expedition's biggest sponsor. Travel on the glacier surface proved to be a trial, especially for Socks, the remaining pony, who had great difficulty in finding secure footings. On 7 December, Socks disappeared down a deep [[crevasse]], very nearly taking Wild with him. However, the pony's [[horse harness|harness]] broke, and the sledge containing their supplies remained on the surface. For the rest of the southward journey and the whole of the return trip they had to rely on [[manhauling|man-hauling]].{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=208\u2013209 and 221\u2013222}}\n\nAs the journey continued, personal antagonisms emerged. Wild privately expressed the wish that Marshall would \"fall down a crevasse about a thousand feet deep\".<ref>Wild, diary, quoted by {{harvnb|Mills|p=93}}.</ref> Marshall wrote that following Shackleton to the Pole was \"like following an old woman. Always panicking\".{{sfn|Huntford|pp=263\u2013264}} However, Christmas Day was celebrated with [[cr\u00e8me de menthe]] and cigars. Their position was 85\u00b0&nbsp;51'&nbsp;S, still {{convert|249|nmi|km mi|}} from the Pole, and they were now carrying barely a month's supply of food, having stored the rest in depots for their return journey.{{sfn|Huntford|pp=263\u2013264}} They could not cover the remaining distance to the Pole and back with this amount of food.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=226}} However, Shackleton was not yet prepared to admit that the Pole was beyond them and decided to go forward after cutting food rations further, and dumping all but the most essential equipment.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=200}}\n\nOn [[Boxing Day]] the glacier ascent was at last completed, and the march on the [[polar plateau]] began. Conditions did not ease; Shackleton recorded 31 December as the \"hardest day we have had\".{{sfn|Shackleton|p=204}} On the next day he noted that, having attained 87\u00b0&nbsp;6\u00bd\u2032&nbsp;S, they had beaten North and South polar records.<ref>{{harvnb|Shackleton|p=205}}. The North reference was to [[Robert Peary|Peary]]'s then farthest north of 87\u00b0&nbsp;6'&nbsp;N.</ref> That day, referring to Marshall and Adams, Wild wrote: \"if we only had Joyce and Marston here instead of those two grubscoffing useless beggars we would have done it [the Pole] easily.\"{{sfn|Mills|p=96}} On 4 January 1909, Shackleton finally accepted that the Pole was beyond them, and revised his goal to the symbolic achievement of getting within 100&nbsp;geographical miles of the Pole.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=207}} The party struggled on, at the borders of survival,{{sfn|Huntford|p=270}} until on 9 January 1909, after a last dash forward without the sledge or other equipment, the march ended. \"We have shot our bolt\", wrote Shackleton, \"and the tale is 88\u00b0&nbsp;23'&nbsp;S\".{{sfn|Shackleton|p=210}} They were 97.5&nbsp;geographical [[Farthest South|miles from the South Pole]]. The British flag was duly planted, and Shackleton named the polar plateau after King Edward VII.{{efn | Three years later, on reaching the South Pole, Amundsen named the same plateau after King Haakon of Norway. ({{harvnb|Amundsen | loc=Vol. II, p. 122}}.) Neither name survives on modern maps. }}\n\n====Return journey====\n[[File:Nimrod return 1909.jpg|thumb|alt= On the left is a snow cairn with flags. Three men are nearby, and assorted equipment is strewn on the snow.|On the return journey. The party reach a depot on the Great Ice Barrier]]\n\nThe party turned for home after 73&nbsp;days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders ''Nimrod'', having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened,{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=251\u2013261}} yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=251\u2013261}} As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot;{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=251\u2013261}} during the ascent the same distance had taken 12&nbsp;days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=251\u2013261}}\n\nThe depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with [[dysentery]], was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\".<ref>Wild diary, quoted in {{harvnb|Mills|p=108}}.</ref> A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe [[enteritis]], the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=258}}\n\n[[File:TheSouthernParty.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Four menwearing dishevelled clothing and worn expressions face the camera. The head of a dog is just visible on the left.|Wild, Shackleton, Marshall and Adams aboard ''Nimrod'' after their southern journey]]\n\n\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\", wrote Shackleton.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=221}} From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \"[[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]] plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\".{{sfn|Shackleton|p=223}} Wild's [[Laconic phrase|laconic]] comment was \"Good old Joyce\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=261}}\n\nTheir food worries were now resolved, but they still had to get back to Hut Point before the 1 March deadline. The final leg of their march was interrupted by a blizzard, which held them in camp for 24&nbsp;hours. On 27 February, when they were still {{convert|33|nmi|km mi}} from safety, Marshall collapsed. Shackleton then decided that he and Wild would make a dash for Hut Point in hopes of finding the ship and holding her until the other two could be rescued. They reached the hut late on 28 February.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=262\u2013263}} Hoping that the ship was nearby, they sought to attract its attention by setting fire to a small wooden hut used for [[magnetic]] observations.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=274\u2013278}} Shortly afterwards ''Nimrod'', which had been anchored at the [[Erebus Ice Tongue|Glacier Tongue]], came into view: \"No happier sight ever met the eyes of man\", wrote Wild later.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=274\u2013278}} It was a further three days before Adams and Marshall could be picked up from the Barrier, but by 4 March the whole southern party was aboard and Shackleton was able to order full steam towards the north.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=274\u2013278}}\n\n===Northern Party===\nWhile preparing for his southern journey, Shackleton gave instructions to Edgeworth David to lead a Northern party to Victoria Land to carry out magnetic and geological work. The party was to try to reach the Magnetic Pole, and was to carry out a full geological survey in the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys|Dry Valley]] area.{{efn | The dry valley (snow-free) region of the western mountains had been discovered during Scott's western journey in 1903, but had yet to be properly surveyed. See {{harvnb|Crane|p=270}}. }} David's party consisted of himself, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. It would be a man-hauling party; the dogs remained at base to be used for depot-laying and other routine work.{{sfn|Huntford|p=238}} The party had orders to plant the [[Union Jack]] at the Magnetic Pole and to take possession of Victoria Land for the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Shackleton|pp=260\u2013262}} After several days' preparatory work, they started out on 5 October 1908, drawn for the first few miles by the motor car.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=265}}\n\n[[File:Northernparty.png|thumb|upright|alt= Three men stand around a flag planted in the snow.|(l. to r.) Mackay, Edgeworth David, and Mawson at the Southern Magnetic Pole, 17 January 1909]]\nDue to sea ice conditions and adverse weather, progress was initially very slow. By the end of October they had crossed McMurdo Sound and advanced 60&nbsp;miles (100&nbsp;km) up the difficult Victoria Land coast, at which point they decided to concentrate all their efforts on reaching the Magnetic Pole.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=238}} After traversing the [[Nordenskjold Ice Tongue]] and the treacherous [[Drygalski Glacier (Antarctica)|Drygalski Glacier]] they were finally able to leave the coast and turn north-west, towards the Magnetic Pole's approximate location. Before then, David had a narrow escape after falling into a crevasse but was rescued by Mawson.<ref>{{harvnb|Shackleton|pp=291\u2013292}} (David's account).</ref>{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=241\u2013249}}\n\nTheir way up to the inland plateau was via a labyrinthine glacier (later named the Reeves Glacier after the Royal Geographical Society's main map curator),{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=293}} which brought them on 27 December to a hard snow surface.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=241\u2013249}} This enabled them to move more swiftly, at a rate of about {{convert|10|nmi|km mi}} daily, taking regular magnetic observations. On 16 January, these observations showed them to be about {{convert|13|nmi|km mi}} from the Magnetic Pole. The next day, 17 January 1909, they reached their goal, fixing the pole's position as 72\u00b0&nbsp;15'&nbsp;S, 155\u00b0&nbsp;16'&nbsp;E, at an elevation of {{convert|7260|ft|m|}}. In a muted ceremony, David took formal possession of the area for the British Empire.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=241\u2013249}}\n\nExhausted, and short of food, the party faced a return journey of {{convert|250|nmi|km mi}}, with just 15&nbsp;days to complete it if they were to make their prearranged coastal rendezvous with ''Nimrod''. Despite increasing physical weakness they maintained their daily distances, and on 31 January were {{convert|16|nmi|km mi}} from their agreed pick-up point. Bad weather delayed them, and the rendezvous was not reached until 2 February. That night, in heavy drifting snow, ''Nimrod'' passed by them, unable to make out their camp.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=241\u2013249}} Two days later, however, after ''Nimrod'' had turned south again, the group was spotted from the ship and was able to scramble to safety, although in the rush to get aboard Mawson fell {{convert|18|ft|m}} down a crevasse. The party had been travelling for four months and were wearing the same clothes in which they had departed Cape Royds; reportedly \"the aroma was overpowering\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=269\u2013273}} Before this rescue, ''Nimrod'' had picked up a geological party consisting of Priestley, Brocklehurst and [[:de:Bertram Armytage]], who had been carrying out geological work in the [[Ferrar Glacier]] region.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=269\u2013273}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Ernest Shackleton.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dark-haired man, hands on hips, looking straight at the camera|Sir Ernest Shackleton: \"What Nansen is to the North, Shackleton is to the South\"\u2014[[Roald Amundsen]]]]\nOn 23 March 1909, Shackleton landed in New Zealand and cabled a 2,500-word report to the London ''[[Daily Mail]]'', with which he had an exclusive contract.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=279}} Amid the acclamation and unstinting praise that Shackleton received from the exploring community, including [[Fridtjof Nansen|Nansen]] and [[Roald Amundsen|Amundsen]], the response of the Royal Geographical Society was more guarded. Its former president, [[Sir Clements Markham]], privately expressed his disbelief of Shackleton's claimed latitude.{{sfn|Huntford|p=308}} However, on 14 June, Shackleton was met at London's [[Charing Cross Station]] by a very large crowd, which included RGS president [[Leonard Darwin]] and a rather reluctant Captain Scott.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=286}}\n\nAs to the latitude claimed, the reason for doubting its accuracy was that after 3 January all  positions  had been computed by [[dead reckoning]]: on direction, speed and elapsed time. The last proper observation, on 3 January had calculated the latitude as 87\u00b0&nbsp;22'. Shackleton's table of distances show that over the next three days they covered just over {{convert|40|nmi|km mi}}, to reach an estimated 88\u00b0&nbsp;7' on 6 January. They were then held up for two days by a blizzard. On 9 January 1909, the table shows that the party travelled a further {{convert|16|nmi|km mi}} to reach their farthest south, and the same distance back to camp.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=362}} This distance in a single day far exceeded those for any other stage of the journey. Shackleton explained that this was a dash, \"half running, half walking\", unencumbered by the sledge or other equipment.{{sfn|Shackleton|p=210}} Each of the four men independently confirmed his belief in the latitude achieved, and none gave any subsequent cause for his word to be doubted.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=294}}\n\nShackleton was made a [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (CVO) by  King Edward, who later conferred a knighthood on him.{{sfn|Huntford|p=315}} The RGS presented him with a gold medal, although apparently with reservations\u2014\"We do not propose to make the Medal so large as that which was awarded to Captain Scott\", recorded an official.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=289\u2013290}} Although in the eyes of the public he was a hero, the riches that Shackleton had anticipated failed to materialise. The soaring costs of the expedition and the need to meet loan guarantees meant that he was saved from financial embarrassment only by a belated government grant of \u00a320,000.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=290}}\n\nThe farthest south record of the ''Nimrod'' Expedition stood for less than three years, until Amundsen reached the South Pole on 15 December 1911. For his trail-breaking achievements, Shackleton received a fulsome tribute from Amundsen: \"What Nansen is to the North, Shackleton is to the South\".{{sfn|Riffenburgh|p=300}} Thereafter, Shackleton's Antarctic ambitions were fixed on a transcontinental crossing, which he attempted unsuccessfully with the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]], 1914\u201317, although his status as a leading figure in the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]] was by then assured.  Other members of the ''Nimrod'' Expedition also achieved fame and standing in future years. Edgeworth David, Adams, Mawson and Priestley all eventually received knighthoods, the latter two continuing their polar work on further expeditions, though neither went south again with Shackleton. Mawson led the 1911\u201313 [[Australian Antarctic Expedition]], and Priestley was part of the [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' Expedition's]] scientific team. Frank Wild was second-in-command to the \"Boss\" on the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition and on the short [[Shackleton-Rowett Expedition|''Quest'' Expedition]] where he took over command after Shackleton's death in [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] in 1922.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=302\u2013303}} Ten years after her return from the Antarctic, ''Nimrod'' was battered to pieces in the [[North Sea]], after running aground on the Barber Sands off the [[Norfolk]] (UK) coast on 31 January 1919. Only two of her 12-person crew survived.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|pp=306\u2013307}}\n\nSeveral mostly intact cases of whisky and brandy left behind at Cape Royds in 1909 were recovered in 2010, for analysis by a distilling company. A revival of the vintage (and since lost) formula for the particular brands found has been offered for sale with a portion of the proceeds to benefit the [[Antarctic Heritage Trust (New Zealand)|New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust]] which discovered the lost spirits.{{sfn|USA Today, ''century-old whisky''}}{{sfn|AP, ''century-old scotch''}}{{sfn|BBC News, ''Whisky recreated''}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Geography}}\n\n* [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]]\n* [[List of Antarctic expeditions]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{notes}}\n\n===References===\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Amundsen\n  | first = Roald\n  | authorlink = Roald Amundsen\n  | year = 1976\n  | title = The South Pole\n  | volume = I & II\n  | publisher = C.

He holds [[England national football team|England]]'s record for goals in the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals, with 10 scored. Lineker's media career began with the [[BBC]], where he has presented the flagship football programme ''[[Match of the Day]]'' since the late 1990s. He has also worked for [[Al Jazeera Sports]], [[Eredivisie Live]], [[NBC Sports Network]] and currently hosts [[BT Sport]]'s coverage of the [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\nLineker began his football career at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 1978, and finished as the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]'s joint top goalscorer in 1984\u201385. He then moved to League Champions [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] where he developed as a clinical finisher, scoring 30 goals in 41 games. His first team honours came at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], where he won the [[Copa del Rey]] in 1988 and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1989. He returned to England in 1989, joining [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and over three seasons he scored 67 goals in 105 games and won the [[FA Cup]]. Lineker's final club was [[Nagoya Grampus|Nagoya Grampus Eight]] and he retired in 1994 after two seasons at the Japanese side.\n\nLineker made his England debut in 1984, earning 80 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scoring 48 goals over an eight-year international career, and is England's third highest scorer, behind [[Bobby Charlton]] and [[Wayne Rooney]]. His international goals-to-games ratio remains one of the best for the country and he is regarded as one of the all-time best English [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strikers]]. He was top scorer in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] and received the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]], the only time an Englishman had done so until [[Harry Kane]] in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]]. He is also the only player to have been the top scorer in England with three clubs (Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur).\n\nEven though he enjoyed a long career, Lineker never received a [[Caution (football)|yellow]] or [[Dismissal (football)|red card]].<ref name=\"kielty\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/patrickkielty/guests/gary_lineker.shtml |title=Northern Ireland \u2013 Patrick Kielty, Almost Live |publisher=BBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031214002405/http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/patrickkielty/guests/gary_lineker.shtml|date=14 December 2003 |archive-date=14 December 2003|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Multi-talented footballers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/aug/10/theknowledge.sport |first=James |last=Dart |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 August 2005}}</ref> As a result, he was honoured in 1990 with the [[FIFA Fair Play Award]]. In a senior career which spanned 16 years and 567 competitive games, Lineker scored a total of 330 goals, including 282 goals at club level. After his retirement from football he was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]]. A keen supporter of Leicester City, he led a consortium that invested in his old club, saving it from bankruptcy, and was appointed honorary vice-president.\n\n==Early life==\nLineker was born in [[Leicester]], the son of Margaret P.

He went to the City of Leicester Boys' Grammar School (now [[City of Leicester College]]) on Downing Drive in [[Evington]], inside the borough of Leicester due to his preference for football rather than rugby, which was the main sport of most schools near his home. As a result, he lived with his grandmother, who lived in the city, while attending school. Lineker was equally talented at both football and [[cricket]]. From the ages of 11 to 16 he captained the Leicestershire Schools cricket team, and had felt that he had a higher chance of succeeding at it rather than football.<ref name=\"indep\">{{cite news |title=Passed/Failed: An education in the life of Gary Lineker |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passedfailed-an-education-in-the-life-of-gary-lineker-match-of-the-day-presenter-and-former-footballer-1915343.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=4 March 2010}}</ref> He later stated on ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]'' that as a teenager he idolised former [[England cricket team|England]] captain [[David Gower]], who was playing for [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] at the time.<ref>{{cite episode|title=6-02|episodelink=List of They Think It's All Over episodes#Series 6|series=They Think It's All Over|serieslink=They Think It's All Over (TV series)|season=6|number=2|network=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|date=19 November 1998}}</ref> During his youth he played for [[Aylestone Park F.C.|Aylestone Park Youth]], later becoming the club's president.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/7934620.stm Grass-roots football gets \u00a311m] BBC News, 10 March 2009</ref>\n\nLineker left school with four [[O Level]]s.

He then joined the youth academy at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 1976.<ref name=\"indep\" />\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Leicester City===\nLineker began his career at his home town club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] after leaving school in 1977, turning professional in the [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]] season and making his senior debut on New Year's Day 1979 in a 2\u20130 win over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] at [[Filbert Street]]. He earned a Second Division title medal a year later with 19 appearances, but played just nine league games in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]] as Leicester went straight back down.\n\nHowever, he became a regular player in [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]], scoring 19 goals in all competitions that season. Although Leicester missed out on promotion, they reached the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]], and clinched promotion a year later as Lineker scored 26 times in the Second Division. In [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384]], he enjoyed regular First Division action for the first time and was the division's second highest scorer with 22 goals, although Leicester failed to finish anywhere near the top of the league. He was the First Division's joint top scorer in [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385]] with 24 goals, and was enjoying a prolific partnership with [[Alan Smith (footballer, born 1962)|Alan Smith]]. However, by this stage, he was attracting the attention of bigger clubs, and a move from [[Filbert Street]] was looking certain.\n\n===Everton===\nIn the 1985 close season, defending league champions [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] signed Lineker for \u00a3800,000; he scored 40 goals in 57 games for his new team in the [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]] season. He was again the First Division's leading goal scorer, this time with 30 goals (including three hat-tricks), and helped Everton finish second in the league. While at Everton, they reached the [[FA Cup]] final for the third consecutive year but lost 3\u20131 to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], despite Lineker giving them an early lead when he outpaced [[Alan Hansen]] to score. Liverpool had also pipped Everton to the title by just two points.\n\"I was only on Merseyside a short time, nine or 10 months in total really, but it was still a happy time personally, while professionally it was one of the most successful periods of my career,\" he says.\n\"I still have an affinity towards Everton.\"\n\nLineker scored three [[hat-tricks]] for Everton; at home to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in a 4\u20131 league win on 31 August 1985, at home to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in a 4\u20130 home win on 11 February 1986, and then in the penultimate league game of the season on 3 May 1986, when they kept their title hopes alive with a 6\u20131 home win over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. On his final league appearance, he scored twice in a 3\u20131 home win over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] whose own title hopes had just disappeared. However, he and his colleagues were denied title glory as Liverpool also won their final league game of the season at Chelsea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonresults.com/198586.htm|title=Everton Results|website=www.evertonresults.com}}</ref>\nLineker has consistently stated since retiring from football that this Everton team was the best club side he ever played in.\n\n===Barcelona===\nAfter winning the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico, Lineker was signed by [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] for \u00a32.8&nbsp;million. Barcelona were being managed by former [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] manager [[Terry Venables]], who had also brought in [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]] striker [[Mark Hughes]]. Barcelona gave Lineker his first chance of European football, as Leicester had never qualified for Europe while he played for them, and Everton were denied a place in the [[European Cup]] for 1985\u201386 due to the commencement of the ban on English clubs in European competitions following the [[Heysel disaster]].\n\nHis Golden Boot-winning performance at the finals generated much anticipation of success at the [[Camp Nou]], and he did not disappoint, scoring 21 goals in 41 games during his first season, including a [[hat-trick]] in a 3\u20132 win over archrivals [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/football_legends_gary_lineker.html|title=Gary Lineker|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Talk Football}}</ref> Barcelona went on to win the [[Copa del Rey]] in 1988 and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1989. Lineker played in Barcelona's shock home and away defeats to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. Barcelona manager [[Johan Cruyff]] decided to play Lineker on the right of the midfield and he was eventually no longer an automatic choice in the team.\n\nWith 42 goals in 103 La Liga appearances, Lineker became the highest scoring British player in the competition's history, but was later surpassed by [[Gareth Bale]] in March 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3502065/Gary-Lineker-loses-British-scoring-record-La-Liga-Gareth-Bale-takes-crown.html|title=Gareth Bale breaks La Liga British scoring record as Gary Lineker loses the crown|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=21 March 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Wikipedia guidelines state that tabloid sourcing should not be used for biographies.|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Tottenham Hotspur===\n[[Manchester United]] manager [[Alex Ferguson]] attempted to sign Lineker to partner his ex-Barcelona teammate [[Mark Hughes]] in attack,{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} but Lineker instead signed for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in July 1989 for \u00a31.1&nbsp;million. Over three seasons, he scored 67 goals in 105 league games and won the FA Cup while playing for the club. He finished as top scorer in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]] season, scoring 24 goals as Spurs finished third.\n\nHe finally collected an English trophy when he won the [[1991 FA Cup Final]] with Spurs, who beat [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 2\u20131. This was despite Lineker having a goal controversially disallowed for offside and also having a penalty saved by goalkeeper [[Mark Crossley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/archive/E-ON-Great-Saves-1991-FA-Cup-final-special-Totttenham-2-1-Nottingham-Forest-unseen-pictures-of-Mark-Crossley-Gary-Lineker-Brian-Clough-and-co-plus-original-Daily-Mirror-match-reports-and-features-from-our-archive-article321299.html|title=E.ON Great Saves No.6: Mark Crossley|publisher=Mirror Football|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> Lineker had contributed to Tottenham's run to the final.

Despite Lineker's personal performance, Tottenham finished this final pre-[[Premier League]] season in 15th place.

He holds [[England national football team|England]]'s record for goals in the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals, with 10 scored. Lineker's media career began with the [[BBC]], where he has presented the flagship football programme ''[[Match of the Day]]'' since the late 1990s. He has also worked for [[Al Jazeera Sports]], [[Eredivisie Live]], [[NBC Sports Network]] and currently hosts [[BT Sport]]'s coverage of the [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\nLineker began his football career at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 1978, and finished as the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]'s joint top goalscorer in 1984\u201385. He then moved to League Champions [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] where he developed as a clinical finisher, scoring 30 goals in 41 games. His first team honours came at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], where he won the [[Copa del Rey]] in 1988 and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1989. He returned to England in 1989, joining [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and over three seasons he scored 67 goals in 105 games and won the [[FA Cup]]. Lineker's final club was [[Nagoya Grampus|Nagoya Grampus Eight]] and he retired in 1994 after two seasons at the Japanese side.\n\nLineker made his England debut in 1984, earning 80 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scoring 48 goals over an eight-year international career, and is England's third highest scorer, behind [[Bobby Charlton]] and [[Wayne Rooney]]. His international goals-to-games ratio remains one of the best for the country and he is regarded as one of the all-time best English [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strikers]]. He was top scorer in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] and received the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]], the only time an Englishman had done so until [[Harry Kane]] in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]]. He is also the only player to have been the top scorer in England with three clubs (Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur).\n\nEven though he enjoyed a long career, Lineker never received a [[Caution (football)|yellow]] or [[Dismissal (football)|red card]].<ref name=\"kielty\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/patrickkielty/guests/gary_lineker.shtml |title=Northern Ireland \u2013 Patrick Kielty, Almost Live |publisher=BBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031214002405/http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/patrickkielty/guests/gary_lineker.shtml|date=14 December 2003 |archive-date=14 December 2003|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Multi-talented footballers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/aug/10/theknowledge.sport |first=James |last=Dart |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 August 2005}}</ref> As a result, he was honoured in 1990 with the [[FIFA Fair Play Award]].

He went to the City of Leicester Boys' Grammar School (now [[City of Leicester College]]) on Downing Drive in [[Evington]], inside the borough of Leicester due to his preference for football rather than rugby, which was the main sport of most schools near his home. As a result, he lived with his grandmother, who lived in the city, while attending school. Lineker was equally talented at both football and [[cricket]].

He earned a Second Division title medal a year later with 19 appearances, but played just nine league games in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]] as Leicester went straight back down.\n\nHowever, he became a regular player in [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]], scoring 19 goals in all competitions that season. Although Leicester missed out on promotion, they reached the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]], and clinched promotion a year later as Lineker scored 26 times in the Second Division. In [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384]], he enjoyed regular First Division action for the first time and was the division's second highest scorer with 22 goals, although Leicester failed to finish anywhere near the top of the league. He was the First Division's joint top scorer in [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385]] with 24 goals, and was enjoying a prolific partnership with [[Alan Smith (footballer, born 1962)|Alan Smith]]. However, by this stage, he was attracting the attention of bigger clubs, and a move from [[Filbert Street]] was looking certain.\n\n===Everton===\nIn the 1985 close season, defending league champions [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] signed Lineker for \u00a3800,000; he scored 40 goals in 57 games for his new team in the [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]] season. He was again the First Division's leading goal scorer, this time with 30 goals (including three hat-tricks), and helped Everton finish second in the league. While at Everton, they reached the [[FA Cup]] final for the third consecutive year but lost 3\u20131 to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], despite Lineker giving them an early lead when he outpaced [[Alan Hansen]] to score. Liverpool had also pipped Everton to the title by just two points.\n\"I was only on Merseyside a short time, nine or 10 months in total really, but it was still a happy time personally, while professionally it was one of the most successful periods of my career,\" he says.\n\"I still have an affinity towards Everton.\"\n\nLineker scored three [[hat-tricks]] for Everton; at home to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in a 4\u20131 league win on 31 August 1985, at home to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in a 4\u20130 home win on 11 February 1986, and then in the penultimate league game of the season on 3 May 1986, when they kept their title hopes alive with a 6\u20131 home win over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. On his final league appearance, he scored twice in a 3\u20131 home win over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] whose own title hopes had just disappeared.
