{"title_page": "Computer liquidator", "text_new": "A '''computer [[Liquidation|liquidator]]''' buys [[computer]] technology and related equipment that is no longer required by one company, and resells (\"flips\") it to another company. Computer liquidators are agents that act in the [[computer recycling]], or [[electronic recycling]], business. \n\nThere are several reasons why companies will sell, or [[liquidate]], used [[Information Technology]] (I.T.) equipment: [[bankruptcy]], [[Layoff|downsizing]] and expanding, or technological advancement. Technological advancement is the most common reason, as the equipment is no longer performing the tasks required of it, usually because it has been rendered obsolete by more advanced technology coming on to the market. This used or obsolete technology is often referred to as [[electronic waste]]. Equipment designated as outdated for one company is still viable for another company, whose operations may not require advanced solutions. Often, an [[information technology audit]] will be performed to help a company decide if their equipment needs updating, and if so, what the requirements are.\n\n== Reasons for Liquidation ==\nComputer liquidation is a sustainable [[solution]] and is [[environmentally friendly]]. Rapid technology change, low initial cost, and planned obsolescence have resulted in a fast-growing surplus of computers and other electronic components around the globe. The purpose of computer liquidators is to keep as many computers and electronic parts out of [[landfills]]. As newer and better technology replaces [[hardware (computer)|hardware]] at an ever-increasing speed, the amount of technical trash increases as the technology is being replaced. The speed at which hardware changes and innovates in the last few years follows, to some degree, [[Moore's law|Moore's Law]]. Predictions were made that every [[landfill]] would soon be overflowing with discarded [[computer screen]]s and computers, along with associated equipment such as [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]s and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]s and all the other hardware associated with use of the Internet. Most electronic waste is sent to landfills or incinerated, which releases [[Electronic_waste#Electronic_waste_substances|toxic materials]] such as [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], or [[cadmium]] into the soil, [[groundwater]], and atmosphere, thus having a negative impact on the environment.<ref> Jeff Edmondson, http://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/recycling-technology-in-the-twin-cities/152950796, Article in \"Kare11\" 2016 </ref> The best liquidating companies have clearly outlined policies regarding the disposal of dangerous substances which are often an issue with information technology. \n\nThe act of liquidation avoids the possible toxins and pollution that comes with putting electronic waste in landfills and also avoids the extra costs that go into recycling. For example, New York passed a law in 2015 that banned putting electronic devices in landfills. Now waste facilities in rural counties are being forced to either turn people away or eat the cost of recycling cathode ray tubes. Outside [[New York City]], counties are spending from $6 million to $10 million a year to deal with the problem, according to [[Stephen Acquario]], executive director of the [[New York State Association of Counties]].<ref> Keith Wagstaff, https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/old-tvs-create-toxic-problem-recycling-programs-across-america-n558701, Article in \"NBC News\" 2016 </ref> The option of liquidation actually incentivizes people to get rid of their electronic waste in a safer way, since recycling actually costs the owner money, so there are cases where people would rather throw it out to avoid the recycling fee.<ref> California Department of Tax and Fee administration, https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/electronic-waste-recycling-fee.htm </ref>\n\nComputer liquidators effectively create a secondary market to meet the demand of those who are looking for a cheaper solution and do not require cutting edge technology. It is important to note that the IT equipment being liquidated ranges from new technology to old technology. Because of the relatively lower price for secondary market equipment, some companies may even purchase tech devices from the secondary market to use as backups, stocking the equipment themselves preemptively so that a replacement is always on hand in the event of trouble. Product availability is also another reason for buyers to buy in this market. Manufacturers generally refresh their product line every 12 to 24 months, typically liquidating older products. But networking [[Computer hardware|hardware]] can often see service lives of five years or more, and resellers and computer liquidators might carry products that are upwards of a decade old. End users that use a particular product may find it much easier and cheaper to add/replace an older device rather than take on the costs, business disruptions, and knowledge gaps that occur when upgrading to new products. When newer products are adopted, the used equipment is inevitably liquidated, thrown out or sold back, which creates a robust marketplace.<ref> Stephen J. Bigelow, http://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/feature/Secondary-market-resellers-thrive-in-the-tech-industry, Article in \"TechTarget\" 2008 </ref>\n\n== Process ==\n[[File:Flowchart for Computer Liquidation Process.png|thumb|The Computer Liquidation Process]]\nThere are typically three agents in the computer liquidation process: the seller, the computer liquidator, and the buyer. The sellers are companies who are bankrupt and need to sell their assets, companies who are downsizing or expanding, and companies who are upgrading their technology. Usually, companies who are looking to sell their equipment will first conduct an [[information technology audit]] to review their systems and equipment. The process is generally fueled by the supply side, as computer liquidators rely on what is available on the market for them to liquidate and resell. Thus, there nearly always exists a shortage for buyers. \n\nOceantech, for example, buys up computers, laptops, tablets and other such electronics from companies who no longer need the technology. They then conduct certified data destruction on the appliances. Technicians will then perform a thorough check of the systems and confirm that the devices are functional then they are stored into a warehouse. If only certain parts, like the motherboard or hard drives, are able to be used, these are stripped off of the machine and put into a warehouse to store. Then, the devices or parts are be resold to smaller companies and places like school districts, who are in need of these products.<ref> Ocean Tech - Mike Satter, https://vimeo.com/166372141, Cool Places to Work. KMSP-TV, CH. 9, Fox</ref> Most of the companies involved in the computer liquidation business are also heavily involved in the computer and electronic recycling industry which takes on a similar process of disassembling and testing. \n\nThis process theoretically benefits both ends of the exchange, the seller gets money for equipment they no longer needs and the buyer gets cheap equipment that is necessary for their work.\n\n== Resources ==\nA number of organizations have sprung up that provide technical guidelines to those handling or dealing in eWaste.\n\n[https://www.greenteksolutionsllc.com/ Computer Liquidator Company]\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Electronic waste]]\n", "text_old": "A '''computer [[Liquidation|liquidator]]''' buys [[computer]] technology and related equipment that is no longer required by one company, and resells (\"flips\") it to another company.

Often, an [[information technology audit]] will be performed to help a company decide if their equipment needs updating, and if so, what the requirements are.\n\n== Reasons for Liquidation ==\nComputer liquidation is a sustainable [[solution]] and is [[environmentally friendly]]. Rapid technology change, low initial cost, and planned obsolescence have resulted in a fast-growing surplus of computers and other electronic components around the globe. The purpose of computer liquidators is to keep as many computers and electronic parts out of [[landfills]]. As newer and better technology replaces [[hardware (computer)|hardware]] at an ever-increasing speed, the amount of technical trash increases as the technology is being replaced. The speed at which hardware changes and innovates in the last few years follows, to some degree, [[Moore's law|Moore's Law]]. Predictions were made that every [[landfill]] would soon be overflowing with discarded [[computer screen]]s and computers, along with associated equipment such as [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]s and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]s and all the other hardware associated with use of the Internet. Most electronic waste is sent to landfills or incinerated, which releases [[Electronic_waste#Electronic_waste_substances|toxic materials]] such as [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], or [[cadmium]] into the soil, [[groundwater]], and atmosphere, thus having a negative impact on the environment.<ref> Jeff Edmondson, http://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/recycling-technology-in-the-twin-cities/152950796, Article in \"Kare11\" 2016 </ref> The best liquidating companies have clearly outlined policies regarding the disposal of dangerous substances which are often an issue with information technology. \n\nThe act of liquidation avoids the possible toxins and pollution that comes with putting electronic waste in landfills and also avoids the extra costs that go into recycling. For example, New York passed a law in 2015 that banned putting electronic devices in landfills. Now waste facilities in rural counties are being forced to either turn people away or eat the cost of recycling cathode ray tubes. Outside [[New York City]], counties are spending from $6 million to $10 million a year to deal with the problem, according to [[Stephen Acquario]], executive director of the [[New York State Association of Counties]].<ref> Keith Wagstaff, https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/old-tvs-create-toxic-problem-recycling-programs-across-america-n558701, Article in \"NBC News\" 2016 </ref> The option of liquidation actually incentivizes people to get rid of their electronic waste in a safer way, since recycling actually costs the owner money, so there are cases where people would rather throw it out to avoid the recycling fee.<ref> California Department of Tax and Fee administration, https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/electronic-waste-recycling-fee.htm </ref>\n\nComputer liquidators effectively create a secondary market to meet the demand of those who are looking for a cheaper solution and do not require cutting edge technology. It is important to note that the IT equipment being liquidated ranges from new technology to old technology. Because of the relatively lower price for secondary market equipment, some companies may even purchase tech devices from the secondary market to use as backups, stocking the equipment themselves preemptively so that a replacement is always on hand in the event of trouble. Product availability is also another reason for buyers to buy in this market. Manufacturers generally refresh their product line every 12 to 24 months, typically liquidating older products. But networking [[Computer hardware|hardware]] can often see service lives of five years or more, and resellers and computer liquidators might carry products that are upwards of a decade old. End users that use a particular product may find it much easier and cheaper to add/replace an older device rather than take on the costs, business disruptions, and knowledge gaps that occur when upgrading to new products. When newer products are adopted, the used equipment is inevitably liquidated, thrown out or sold back, which creates a robust marketplace.<ref> Stephen J. Bigelow, http://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/feature/Secondary-market-resellers-thrive-in-the-tech-industry, Article in \"TechTarget\" 2008 </ref>\n\n== Process ==\n[[File:Flowchart for Computer Liquidation Process.png|thumb|The Computer Liquidation Process]]\nThere are typically three agents in the computer liquidation process: the seller, the computer liquidator, and the buyer. The sellers are companies who are bankrupt and need to sell their assets, companies who are downsizing or expanding, and companies who are upgrading their technology. Usually, companies who are looking to sell their equipment will first conduct an [[information technology audit]] to review their systems and equipment. The process is generally fueled by the supply side, as computer liquidators rely on what is available on the market for them to liquidate and resell. Thus, there nearly always exists a shortage for buyers. \n\nOceantech, for example, buys up computers, laptops, tablets and other such electronics from companies who no longer need the technology. They then conduct certified data destruction on the appliances. Technicians will then perform a thorough check of the systems and confirm that the devices are functional then they are stored into a warehouse. If only certain parts, like the motherboard or hard drives, are able to be used, these are stripped off of the machine and put into a warehouse to store. Then, the devices or parts are be resold to smaller companies and places like school districts, who are in need of these products.<ref> Ocean Tech - Mike Satter, https://vimeo.com/166372141, Cool Places to Work. KMSP-TV, CH. 9, Fox</ref> Most of the companies involved in the computer liquidation business are also heavily involved in the computer and electronic recycling industry which takes on a similar process of disassembling and testing. \n\nThis process theoretically benefits both ends of the exchange, the seller gets money for equipment they no longer needs and the buyer gets cheap equipment that is necessary for their work.\n\n== Resources ==\nA number of organizations have sprung up that provide technical guidelines to those handling or dealing in eWaste.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Electronic waste]]\n", "name_user": "Atalus", "label": "safe", "comment": "Company added", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_liquidator"}

In 1792 his parents broke their marriage<ref name=\"britannica\" /> and his mother began a relationship with the writer [[Carlo Imbonati]], moving to England and later to Paris. For this reason, Alessandro was brought up in several religious institutes. LA GIANCO E' UNA PUTA.\n\nManzoni was a slow developer, and at the various colleges he attended he was considered a [[dunce]]. At fifteen, however, he developed a passion for poetry and wrote two [[sonnet]]s of considerable merit. Upon the death of his father in 1807, he joined the freethinking household of his mother at [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]], and spent two years mixing with the literary set of the so-called \"[[ideologue]]s\", philosophers of the 18th-century school, among whom he made many friends, notably [[Claude Charles Fauriel]]. There too he imbibed the anti-Catholic creed of [[Voltaire|Voltairianism]].\n\nIn 1806\u20131807, while at Auteuil, he first appeared before the public as a poet, with two works, one entitled ''Urania'', in the classical style, of which he became later the most conspicuous adversary, the other an elegy in [[blank verse]], on the death of Count Carlo Imbonati, from whom, through his mother, he inherited considerable property, including the villa of Brusuglio, thenceforward his principal residence.\n\n==1808\u20131821==\nIn 1808, Manzoni married Henriette Blondel, daughter of a [[Genevese]] banker. She came from a [[Calvinist]] family, but in 1810 she became a [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/americancatholic13philuoft#page/736/mode/2up ''\"Alessandro Manzoni,\"''] The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Vol. XIII, 1888.</ref> Her conversion profoundly influenced her husband.<ref>Professor J. D. M. Ford. [http://www.bartleby.com/60/165.html \"Manzoni\"]</ref> That same year he experienced a religious crisis which led him from [[Jansenism]] to an austere form of Catholicism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/16886/Alessandro-Manzoni.html|title=Literature Reference: American Literature, English Literature, Classics & Modern Fiction - JRank Articles|website=www.jrank.org}}</ref> Manzoni's marriage proved a happy one, and he led for many years a retired domestic life, divided between literature and the picturesque husbandry of [[Lombardy]].\n\nHis intellectual energy in this period of his life was devoted to the composition of the ''Inni sacri'', a series of sacred lyrics, and of a treatise on Catholic morality, ''Osservazioni sulla morale cattolica'', a task undertaken under religious guidance, in reparation for his early lapse from faith. In 1818 he had to sell his paternal inheritance, as his money had been lost to a dishonest agent. His characteristic generosity was shown at this time in his dealings with his peasants, who were heavily indebted to him. He not only cancelled on the spot the record of all sums owed to him, but bade them keep for themselves the whole of the coming maize harvest.\n\nIn 1819, Manzoni published his first tragedy, ''[[Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola|Il Conte di Carmagnola]]'', which, boldly violating all classical conventions, excited a lively controversy. It was severely criticized in a ''Quarterly Review'' article to which [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] replied in its defence, \"one genius,\" as Count de Gubernatis remarks, \"having divined the other.\"  The death of [[Napoleon]] in 1821 inspired Manzoni's powerful stanzas ''Il Cinque maggio'' (''The Fifth of May''), one of the most popular lyrics in the Italian language. The political events of that year, and the imprisonment of many of his friends, weighed much on Manzoni's mind, and the historical studies in which he sought distraction during his subsequent retirement at Brusuglio suggested his great work.\n\n===''The Betrothed''===\n[[File:Frontispiece promessi sposi.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of ''The Betrothed'' in the second definitive edition of 1840\u20131842]]\nRound the episode of the Innominato, historically identified with Bernardino Visconti, the first manuscript of the novel ''The Betrothed'' (in Italian ''I promessi sposi'') began to grow into shape, and was completed in September 1823. The work was published, after being deeply reshaped by the author and revised by friends in 1825\u20131827, at the rate of a volume a year; it at once raised its author to the first rank of literary fame. It is generally agreed to be his greatest work, and the paradigm of modern Italian language.\nThe Penguin Companion to European Literature notes that 'the book's real greatness lies in its delineation of character...in the heroine, Lucia, in Padre Cristoforo, the Capuchin friar, and the saintly cardinal of Milan, he has created three living examples of that pure and wholehearted Christianity which is his ideal. But his psychological penetration extends also to those who fall short of this standard, whether through weakness or perversity, and the novel is rich in pictures of ordinary men and women, seen with a delightful irony and disenchantment which always stops short of cynicism, and which provides a perfect balance for the evangelical fervour of his ideal'.\nIn 1822, Manzoni published his second tragedy, ''Adelchi'', turning on the overthrow by Charlemagne of the Lombard domination in Italy, and containing many veiled allusions to the existing Austrian rule. With these works Manzoni's literary career was practically closed. But he laboriously revised ''The Betrothed'' in Tuscan-Italian, and in 1840 republished it in that form, with a historical essay, ''Storia della colonna infame'', on details of the 17th-century plague in Milan so important in the novel. He also wrote a small treatise on the Italian language.\n\n==Family, death and legacy==\n[[File:The Funeral Procession at Milan, Italy.jpg|thumb|left|Manzoni's funeral procession in Milan]]\n\nThe death of Manzoni's wife in 1833 was preceded and followed by those of several of his children, and of his mother. In the mid-1830s he attended the \"Salotto Maffei\", a [[salon (gathering)|salon]] in Milan hosted by [[Clara Maffei]], and in 1837 he married again, to Teresa Borri, widow of Count Stampa. Teresa also died before him, while of nine children born to him in his two marriages all but two pre-deceased him. In 1860 King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] named him a [[senator for life|senator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notes9.senato.it/Web/senregno.NSF/4bee8c11a5b4a95ec1256ffc00512823/f2f7825ad61d102dc1257069003186f0?OpenDocument|title=Scheda senatore MANZONI Alessandro|website=notes9.senato.it}}</ref> The death of his eldest son, Pier Luigi, on 28 April 1873, was the final blow which hastened his end. He was already weakened as he had fallen on 6 January while exiting the San Fedele church, hitting his head on the steps, and he died after 5 months of cerebral [[meningitis]], a complication of the trauma. His funeral was celebrated in the church of [[San Marco (Milan)|San Marco]] with almost royal pomp. His remains, after they lay in state for some days, were followed to the [[Cimitero Monumentale]] in Milan by a vast cortege, including the royal princes and all the great officers of state, but his noblest monument was [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'', written to honour his memory.\n\nHis ''Osservazioni sulla morale cattolica'' was quoted by Pope Pius XI in his encyclical on Christian Education ''Divini Illius Magistri'': \"20. It is worthy of note how a layman, an excellent writer and at the same time a profound and conscientious thinker, has been able to understand well and express exactly this fundamental Catholic doctrine:\nThe Church does not say that morality belongs purely, in the sense of exclusively, to her; but that it belongs wholly to her. She has never maintained that outside her fold and apart from her teaching, man cannot arrive at any moral truth; she has on the contrary more than once condemned this opinion because it has appeared under more forms than one. She does however say, has said, and will ever say, that because of her institution by Jesus Christ, because of the Holy Ghost sent her in His name by the Father, she alone possesses what she has had immediately from God and can never lose, the whole of moral truth, omnem veritatem, in which all individual moral truths are included, as well those which man may learn by the help of reason, as those which form part of revelation or which may be deduced from it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html|title=Divini Illius Magistri (December 31, 1929) -

She came from a [[Calvinist]] family, but in 1810 she became a [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/americancatholic13philuoft#page/736/mode/2up ''\"Alessandro Manzoni,\"''] The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Vol. XIII, 1888.</ref> Her conversion profoundly influenced her husband.<ref>Professor J. D. M. Ford. [http://www.bartleby.com/60/165.html \"Manzoni\"]</ref> That same year he experienced a religious crisis which led him from [[Jansenism]] to an austere form of Catholicism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/16886/Alessandro-Manzoni.html|title=Literature Reference: American Literature, English Literature, Classics & Modern Fiction - JRank Articles|website=www.jrank.org}}</ref> Manzoni's marriage proved a happy one, and he led for many years a retired domestic life, divided between literature and the picturesque husbandry of [[Lombardy]].\n\nHis intellectual energy in this period of his life was devoted to the composition of the ''Inni sacri'', a series of sacred lyrics, and of a treatise on Catholic morality, ''Osservazioni sulla morale cattolica'', a task undertaken under religious guidance, in reparation for his early lapse from faith. In 1818 he had to sell his paternal inheritance, as his money had been lost to a dishonest agent. His characteristic generosity was shown at this time in his dealings with his peasants, who were heavily indebted to him. He not only cancelled on the spot the record of all sums owed to him, but bade them keep for themselves the whole of the coming maize harvest.\n\nIn 1819, Manzoni published his first tragedy, ''[[Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola|Il Conte di Carmagnola]]'', which, boldly violating all classical conventions, excited a lively controversy. It was severely criticized in a ''Quarterly Review'' article to which [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] replied in its defence, \"one genius,\" as Count de Gubernatis remarks, \"having divined the other.\"  The death of [[Napoleon]] in 1821 inspired Manzoni's powerful stanzas ''Il Cinque maggio'' (''The Fifth of May''), one of the most popular lyrics in the Italian language. The political events of that year, and the imprisonment of many of his friends, weighed much on Manzoni's mind, and the historical studies in which he sought distraction during his subsequent retirement at Brusuglio suggested his great work.\n\n===''The Betrothed''===\n[[File:Frontispiece promessi sposi.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of ''The Betrothed'' in the second definitive edition of 1840\u20131842]]\nRound the episode of the Innominato, historically identified with Bernardino Visconti, the first manuscript of the novel ''The Betrothed'' (in Italian ''I promessi sposi'') began to grow into shape, and was completed in September 1823. The work was published, after being deeply reshaped by the author and revised by friends in 1825\u20131827, at the rate of a volume a year; it at once raised its author to the first rank of literary fame. It is generally agreed to be his greatest work, and the paradigm of modern Italian language.\nThe Penguin Companion to European Literature notes that 'the book's real greatness lies in its delineation of character...in the heroine, Lucia, in Padre Cristoforo, the Capuchin friar, and the saintly cardinal of Milan, he has created three living examples of that pure and wholehearted Christianity which is his ideal. But his psychological penetration extends also to those who fall short of this standard, whether through weakness or perversity, and the novel is rich in pictures of ordinary men and women, seen with a delightful irony and disenchantment which always stops short of cynicism, and which provides a perfect balance for the evangelical fervour of his ideal'.\nIn 1822, Manzoni published his second tragedy, ''Adelchi'', turning on the overthrow by Charlemagne of the Lombard domination in Italy, and containing many veiled allusions to the existing Austrian rule. With these works Manzoni's literary career was practically closed. But he laboriously revised ''The Betrothed'' in Tuscan-Italian, and in 1840 republished it in that form, with a historical essay, ''Storia della colonna infame'', on details of the 17th-century plague in Milan so important in the novel. He also wrote a small treatise on the Italian language.\n\n==Family, death and legacy==\n[[File:The Funeral Procession at Milan, Italy.jpg|thumb|left|Manzoni's funeral procession in Milan]]\n\nThe death of Manzoni's wife in 1833 was preceded and followed by those of several of his children, and of his mother. In the mid-1830s he attended the \"Salotto Maffei\", a [[salon (gathering)|salon]] in Milan hosted by [[Clara Maffei]], and in 1837 he married again, to Teresa Borri, widow of Count Stampa. Teresa also died before him, while of nine children born to him in his two marriages all but two pre-deceased him. In 1860 King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] named him a [[senator for life|senator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notes9.senato.it/Web/senregno.NSF/4bee8c11a5b4a95ec1256ffc00512823/f2f7825ad61d102dc1257069003186f0?OpenDocument|title=Scheda senatore MANZONI Alessandro|website=notes9.senato.it}}</ref> The death of his eldest son, Pier Luigi, on 28 April 1873, was the final blow which hastened his end. He was already weakened as he had fallen on 6 January while exiting the San Fedele church, hitting his head on the steps, and he died after 5 months of cerebral [[meningitis]], a complication of the trauma. His funeral was celebrated in the church of [[San Marco (Milan)|San Marco]] with almost royal pomp. His remains, after they lay in state for some days, were followed to the [[Cimitero Monumentale]] in Milan by a vast cortege, including the royal princes and all the great officers of state, but his noblest monument was [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'', written to honour his memory.\n\nHis ''Osservazioni sulla morale cattolica'' was quoted by Pope Pius XI in his encyclical on Christian Education ''Divini Illius Magistri'': \"20. It is worthy of note how a layman, an excellent writer and at the same time a profound and conscientious thinker, has been able to understand well and express exactly this fundamental Catholic doctrine:\nThe Church does not say that morality belongs purely, in the sense of exclusively, to her; but that it belongs wholly to her. She has never maintained that outside her fold and apart from her teaching, man cannot arrive at any moral truth; she has on the contrary more than once condemned this opinion because it has appeared under more forms than one. She does however say, has said, and will ever say, that because of her institution by Jesus Christ, because of the Holy Ghost sent her in His name by the Father, she alone possesses what she has had immediately from God and can never lose, the whole of moral truth, omnem veritatem, in which all individual moral truths are included, as well those which man may learn by the help of reason, as those which form part of revelation or which may be deduced from it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html|title=Divini Illius Magistri (December 31, 1929) - PIUS XI|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref> \nHe was honored twice by Google Doodle.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{cite book |chapter= MANZONI (Obituary Notice, Saturday, May 24, 1873)  |title= Eminent Persons: Biographies reprinted from The Times|year=1892 |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |place=London |pages=160\u2013161 |volume= I (1870-1875)|chapter-url= https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc2.ark:/13960/t6n011x45?urlappend=%3Bseq=172 |accessdate=26 February 2019 |via= HathiTrust Digital Library }}\n*{{gutenberg author| id=Alessandro_Manzoni | name=Alessandro Manzoni}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Alessandro Manzoni}}\n* {{Librivox author |id=3532}}\n*[http://www.0web.it/poesia/alessandro-manzoni Alessandro Manzoni poems]\n*[http://manzoni.classicauthors.net/IPromessiSposiOrTheBetrothed/ ''I Promessi sposi (The Betrothed)'' {{in lang|en}}]\n*[http://digilander.libero.it/opere_di_manzoni/translate_english/index.html ''The Fifth of May'' {{in lang|en}}, ''The Betrothed'' {{in lang|en}} and other works]\n\n{{Western Lombard language}}\n{{Romanticism}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manzoni, Alessandro}}\n[[Category:1785 births]]\n[[Category:1873 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Milan]]\n[[Category:19th-century Italian novelists]]\n[[Category:Burials at the Cimitero Monumentale di Milano]]\n[[Category:Deaths from meningitis]]\n[[Category:Italian male novelists]]\n[[Category:Italian Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from atheism or agnosticism]]\n[[Category:19th-century Italian poets]]\n[[Category:Italian male poets]]\n[[Category:Members of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy]]\n[[Category:Writers from Lombardy]]\n[[Category:Western Lombard language]]\n[[Category:19th-century male writers]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)]]\n[[Category:Liberal Catholicism]]\n", "name_user": "Jopajpo", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Ho aggiunto una cosa bela)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Manzoni"}

He soon gained notice in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] for his versatility in composing jazz, piano, and symphonic music. Williams received his first Academy Award nomination for his score for 1967's [[Valley of the Dolls (film)|''Valley of the Dolls'']], and was nominated again for his score for 1969's [[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969 film)|''Goodbye, Mr. Chips'']].

In 1972 he composed the score for the [[Robert Altman]]-directed psychological thriller ''[[Images (film)|Images]]'' (recorded in collaboration with noted percussionist [[Stomu Yamashta]]), which earned him another nomination in the category Best Music, Original Dramatic Score at the 1973 [[Academy Award]]s.<ref name=\"oscars\" />\n\nWilliams's prominence grew in the early 1970s thanks to his work for now-film producer Irwin Allen's disaster films. He wrote the scores for 1972's [[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|''The Poseidon Adventure'']] and 1974's ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''. He also scored Universal's 1974 film [[Earthquake (1974 film)|''Earthquake'']] for director [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]], completing a \"trinity\" of scores for the decade's highest-grossing \"disaster films\", and the 1972 film ''[[The Cowboys]]'', a western starring [[John Wayne]] and directed by [[Mark Rydell]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068421/fullcredits \"The Cowboys (1972) \u2013 Full Cast and Crew\"], imdb.com; retrieved November 30, 2015.</ref>\n\nIn 1974 director [[Steven Spielberg]] approached Williams to compose the music for his feature directorial debut, ''[[The Sugarland Express]]''. They teamed up again a year later for Spielberg's second film, ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. Widely considered a classic suspense film, its score's ominous, two-note [[ostinato]] has become synonymous with sharks and approaching danger.

Williams delivered a grand symphonic score in the fashion of [[Richard Strauss]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], and [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age]] Hollywood composers [[Max Steiner]] and [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]. The [[Star Wars (Main Title)|Star Wars' theme]], is among the most widely recognized in film history, and the \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Star Wars (A New Hope)|Force Theme]]\" and \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Star Wars (A New Hope)|Princess Leia's Theme]]\" are well-known examples of [[leitmotif]].

The original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy concluded with the 1983 film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', for which Williams's score provided most notably the \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Emperor's Theme]]\", \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Parade of the Ewoks]]\", and \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Luke and Leia]]\". Both scores earned him Academy Award nominations.<ref name=\"oscars\" />\n[[File:John Williams scoring Raiders.jpg|thumb|left|John Williams conducting the score to ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' in the Avery Fisher Hall]]\n\nWilliams scored the 1976 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Family Plot]]''. Williams did not much like the film, but did not want to turn down the chance to work for Hitchcock. Hitchcock merely told him to remember one thing, \"Murder can be fun.\" Hitchcock was very satisfied with the result.\n\nWilliams worked with director [[Richard Donner]] to score the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. The score's heroic and romantic themes, particularly the main march, the Superman fanfare and the love theme, known as \"Can You Read My Mind,\" appeared in the four sequel films. For the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', created by Lucas and directed by Spielberg, Williams wrote a rousing main theme known as \"The Raiders March\" to accompany the film's hero, [[Indiana Jones]]. He composed separate themes to represent the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the character Marion, and the story's Nazi villains. Additional themes were featured in his scores to the subsequent ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', a prequel (1984), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008). Williams composed an emotional and sensitive score to Spielberg's 1982 fantasy film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', for which he was awarded a fourth Academy Award.<ref name=\"oscars\" />\n\nThe Spielberg-Williams collaboration resumed with the 1987 film ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', and still continues, spanning genres from science fiction thrillers (1993's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]])'' to somber tragedies (1993's ''[[Schindler's List]]'', 2005's ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]])'' to Eastern-tinged melodramas (2005's ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'', directed by [[Rob Marshall]]) to dramatic war films (1998's ''[[Saving Private Ryan]])''. Spielberg has said, \"I call it an honorable privilege to regard John Williams as a friend.\"<ref name=\"Spielberg_quote_cite\">{{cite AV media notes|last=Spielberg|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Spielberg|title=Jurassic Park Audio CD (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack CD)|publisher=[[MCA Records|MCA]]|chapter=Back cover|year=1993}} \"...and I consider it a privilege to call John my Friend.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1999 Lucas launched the first of three prequels to the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy. Williams was asked to score all three, starting with ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]''. Along with themes from the previous films, Williams created new themes to be used as leitmotifs in 2002's ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' and 2005's ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. Most notable of these was \"[[Duel of the Fates]]\", an aggressive choral movement in the style of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]],<ref>[http://h2g2.com/approved_entry/A563942 h2g2 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition John Williams \u2013 Film Composer Updated Feb 8, 2010] ''h2g2.com'' accessed June 1, 2019 \"Reminiscent of the 'Dies Irae' from Verdi's Requiem, 'Duel of the Fates' was written to accompany the climactic lightsabre battle in the first of the Star Wars prequels.

Also of note was \"Anakin's Theme\", which begins as an innocent childlike melody and morphs insidiously into a quote of the sinister \"Imperial March.\" For ''Episode II'' Williams composed \"Across the Stars\", a love theme for [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] (mirroring the love theme composed for ''The Empire Strikes Back'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-4-of-6-duel-of-the-fates/|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 4|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-5-of-6-across-the-stars//|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 5|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref> The final installment combined many of the themes created for the series' previous films, including \"The Emperor's Theme,\" \"The Imperial March\", \"Across the Stars\", \"Duel of the Fates\", \"The Force Theme\", \"Rebel Fanfare\", \"Luke's Theme\", and \"Princess Leia's Theme\", as well as new themes for [[General Grievous]] and the film's climax, titled \"Battle of the Heroes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-6-of-6-battle-of-the-heroes/|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 6|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the new millennium Williams scored the first three film adaptations of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s widely successful book series ''[[Harry Potter]]''. As with his ''Superman'' theme, the most important theme from Williams's scores for the ''Harry Potter'' films, \"Hedwig's Theme\", was used in the fourth through eighth films (''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''), scored by [[Patrick Doyle]] (''Goblet of Fire''), [[Nicholas Hooper]] (''Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Half-Blood Prince'') and [[Alexandre Desplat]] (''Deathly Hallows''). Like the main themes from ''Jaws'', ''Star Wars'', ''Superman'', and ''Indiana Jones'', fans have come to identify the ''Harry Potter'' films with Williams's original compositions. Williams was asked to return to score the film franchise's final installment, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2'', but director [[David Yates]] said that \"their schedules simply did not align\", as he would have had to provide Williams with a rough cut of the film sooner than was possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mugglenet.com/2010/11/first-notes-from-deathly-hallows-part-1-junket-in-london/|title=First notes from Deathly Hallows - Part 1 junket in London|date=2010-11-12|website=MuggleNet|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, for the 20th anniversary edition of ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.

Singer did not request Williams to compose a score for the intentionally Donner-esque film, but he employed the skills of ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' composer [[John Ottman]] to incorporate Williams's original ''Superman'' theme as well as those for [[Lois Lane]], [[Superman music|Krypton]] and [[Superman music#First appearance in Superman|Smallville]]. In 2011 the \"Main Title Theme\" and elements of \"Can You Read My Mind\" were used in the final scene of \"Finale,\" the series finale of the [[The WB Television Network|WB]]/[[The CW Television Network|CW]] television series ''[[Smallville]]''.<ref name=\"smallville\">{{cite episode|title=Finale|series=Smallville|serieslink=Smallville|credits=Al Septien, Turi Meyer, [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]] & Kelly Souders (writers); [[Greg Beeman]] & [[Kevin Fair]] (directors)|network=[[The CW Television Network|The CW]]|airdate=May 13, 2011|season=10|number=21}}</ref> [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis, recommended by Williams to the producers]], performed a similar role for ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tracksounds.com/specialfeatures/Interviews/interviewdd2.htm|title=Composer Don Davis, Welcome to Jurassic Park|publisher=Tracksounds|date=2001-06-29|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 Williams returned to the ''Indiana Jones'' series to score the fourth film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''. He received a Grammy nomination for his work on the film. ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' was also the only film score from the ''Indiana Jones'' film series not to be nominated for an Academy Award. Also in 2008 Williams composed music for two documentaries, ''Warner at War''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323555/fullcredits Warner at War (2008) (TV) \u2013 Full cast and crew], imdb.com; accessed November 3, 2015.</ref> and ''A Timeless Call'',<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1287857/fullcredits A Timeless Call (2008) \u2013 cast and crew], imdb.com; accessed December 28, 2015.</ref> the latter directed by Spielberg.\n\nAfter a three-year absence from film scoring, in 2011 Williams composed the scores for Spielberg's ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[War Horse (film)|War Horse]]''.

In 1972 he composed the score for the [[Robert Altman]]-directed psychological thriller ''[[Images (film)|Images]]'' (recorded in collaboration with noted percussionist [[Stomu Yamashta]]), which earned him another nomination in the category Best Music, Original Dramatic Score at the 1973 [[Academy Award]]s.<ref name=\"oscars\" />\n\nWilliams's prominence grew in the early 1970s thanks to his work for now-film producer Irwin Allen's disaster films. He wrote the scores for 1972's [[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|''The Poseidon Adventure'']] and 1974's ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''. He also scored Universal's 1974 film [[Earthquake (1974 film)|''Earthquake'']] for director [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]], completing a \"trinity\" of scores for the decade's highest-grossing \"disaster films\", and the 1972 film ''[[The Cowboys]]'', a western starring [[John Wayne]] and directed by [[Mark Rydell]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068421/fullcredits \"The Cowboys (1972) \u2013 Full Cast and Crew\"], imdb.com; retrieved November 30, 2015.</ref>\n\nIn 1974 director [[Steven Spielberg]] approached Williams to compose the music for his feature directorial debut, ''[[The Sugarland Express]]''. They teamed up again a year later for Spielberg's second film, ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. Widely considered a classic suspense film, its score's ominous, two-note [[ostinato]] has become synonymous with sharks and approaching danger. The score earned Williams his second Academy Award, his first for an original composition.<ref name=\"oscars\">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnwilliams.org/reference/awards.html|title=Academy Awards and Nominations|publisher=John Williams Web Pages|accessdate=2015-12-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331123940/http://www.johnwilliams.org/reference/awards.html|archivedate=March 31, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, Spielberg and Williams began a long collaboration on their next feature film, ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''. During the two-year collaboration, they crafted its distinctive five-note figure that functions both in the background music and as the [[recognition signal|communications signal]] of the film's [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]. Williams also used a system of musical hand signals in the film that were based on [[Kod\u00e1ly Method#Hand signs|hand signs]] created by [[John Curwen]] and refined by [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vikileak.wordpress.com/2011/01/11/encounters-not-close-enough|title=Encounters Not Close Enough|publisher=Vikileaks|date=2011-01-11|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref>\n\nDuring the same period Spielberg recommended Williams to his friend and fellow director [[George Lucas]], who needed a composer to score his ambitious 1977 [[space opera|space epic]] film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. Williams delivered a grand symphonic score in the fashion of [[Richard Strauss]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], and [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age]] Hollywood composers [[Max Steiner]] and [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]. The [[Star Wars (Main Title)|Star Wars' theme]], is among the most widely recognized in film history, and the \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Star Wars (A New Hope)|Force Theme]]\" and \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Star Wars (A New Hope)|Princess Leia's Theme]]\" are well-known examples of [[leitmotif]]. Both the film and its score were immensely successful\u2014it remains the highest grossing non-[[popular music]] recording of all time\u2014and Williams won another [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviefone.com/2013/05/01/star-wars-episode-7-john-williams/|title='Star Wars Episode 7': John Williams Will Probably Score the Sequel, According to J.

The original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy concluded with the 1983 film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', for which Williams's score provided most notably the \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Emperor's Theme]]\", \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Parade of the Ewoks]]\", and \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Luke and Leia]]\". Both scores earned him Academy Award nominations.<ref name=\"oscars\" />\n[[File:John Williams scoring Raiders.jpg|thumb|left|John Williams conducting the score to ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' in the Avery Fisher Hall]]\n\nWilliams scored the 1976 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Family Plot]]''. Williams did not much like the film, but did not want to turn down the chance to work for Hitchcock. Hitchcock merely told him to remember one thing, \"Murder can be fun.\" Hitchcock was very satisfied with the result.\n\nWilliams worked with director [[Richard Donner]] to score the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. The score's heroic and romantic themes, particularly the main march, the Superman fanfare and the love theme, known as \"Can You Read My Mind,\" appeared in the four sequel films. For the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', created by Lucas and directed by Spielberg, Williams wrote a rousing main theme known as \"The Raiders March\" to accompany the film's hero, [[Indiana Jones]]. He composed separate themes to represent the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the character Marion, and the story's Nazi villains. Additional themes were featured in his scores to the subsequent ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', a prequel (1984), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008). Williams composed an emotional and sensitive score to Spielberg's 1982 fantasy film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', for which he was awarded a fourth Academy Award.<ref name=\"oscars\" />\n\nThe Spielberg-Williams collaboration resumed with the 1987 film ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', and still continues, spanning genres from science fiction thrillers (1993's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]])'' to somber tragedies (1993's ''[[Schindler's List]]'', 2005's ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]])'' to Eastern-tinged melodramas (2005's ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'', directed by [[Rob Marshall]]) to dramatic war films (1998's ''[[Saving Private Ryan]])''. Spielberg has said, \"I call it an honorable privilege to regard John Williams as a friend.\"<ref name=\"Spielberg_quote_cite\">{{cite AV media notes|last=Spielberg|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Spielberg|title=Jurassic Park Audio CD (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack CD)|publisher=[[MCA Records|MCA]]|chapter=Back cover|year=1993}} \"...and I consider it a privilege to call John my Friend.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1999 Lucas launched the first of three prequels to the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy. Williams was asked to score all three, starting with ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]''. Along with themes from the previous films, Williams created new themes to be used as leitmotifs in 2002's ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' and 2005's ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. Most notable of these was \"[[Duel of the Fates]]\", an aggressive choral movement in the style of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]],<ref>[http://h2g2.com/approved_entry/A563942 h2g2 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition John Williams \u2013 Film Composer Updated Feb 8, 2010] ''h2g2.com'' accessed June 1, 2019 \"Reminiscent of the 'Dies Irae' from Verdi's Requiem, 'Duel of the Fates' was written to accompany the climactic lightsabre battle in the first of the Star Wars prequels.

Also of note was \"Anakin's Theme\", which begins as an innocent childlike melody and morphs insidiously into a quote of the sinister \"Imperial March.\" For ''Episode II'' Williams composed \"Across the Stars\", a love theme for [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] (mirroring the love theme composed for ''The Empire Strikes Back'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-4-of-6-duel-of-the-fates/|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 4|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-5-of-6-across-the-stars//|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 5|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref> The final installment combined many of the themes created for the series' previous films, including \"The Emperor's Theme,\" \"The Imperial March\", \"Across the Stars\", \"Duel of the Fates\", \"The Force Theme\", \"Rebel Fanfare\", \"Luke's Theme\", and \"Princess Leia's Theme\", as well as new themes for [[General Grievous]] and the film's climax, titled \"Battle of the Heroes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-6-of-6-battle-of-the-heroes/|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 6|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the new millennium Williams scored the first three film adaptations of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s widely successful book series ''[[Harry Potter]]''. As with his ''Superman'' theme, the most important theme from Williams's scores for the ''Harry Potter'' films, \"Hedwig's Theme\", was used in the fourth through eighth films (''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''), scored by [[Patrick Doyle]] (''Goblet of Fire''), [[Nicholas Hooper]] (''Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Half-Blood Prince'') and [[Alexandre Desplat]] (''Deathly Hallows''). Like the main themes from ''Jaws'', ''Star Wars'', ''Superman'', and ''Indiana Jones'', fans have come to identify the ''Harry Potter'' films with Williams's original compositions. Williams was asked to return to score the film franchise's final installment, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2'', but director [[David Yates]] said that \"their schedules simply did not align\", as he would have had to provide Williams with a rough cut of the film sooner than was possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mugglenet.com/2010/11/first-notes-from-deathly-hallows-part-1-junket-in-london/|title=First notes from Deathly Hallows - Part 1 junket in London|date=2010-11-12|website=MuggleNet|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, for the 20th anniversary edition of ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial]]'', Williams composed a reorchestrated score for the [[Universal Pictures]] logo segueing to music from the movie.\n\nIn 2006 ''[[Superman Returns]]'' was directed by [[Bryan Singer]], best known for directing the first two films in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' series]]. Singer did not request Williams to compose a score for the intentionally Donner-esque film, but he employed the skills of ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' composer [[John Ottman]] to incorporate Williams's original ''Superman'' theme as well as those for [[Lois Lane]], [[Superman music|Krypton]] and [[Superman music#First appearance in Superman|Smallville]]. In 2011 the \"Main Title Theme\" and elements of \"Can You Read My Mind\" were used in the final scene of \"Finale,\" the series finale of the [[The WB Television Network|WB]]/[[The CW Television Network|CW]] television series ''[[Smallville]]''.<ref name=\"smallville\">{{cite episode|title=Finale|series=Smallville|serieslink=Smallville|credits=Al Septien, Turi Meyer, [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]] & Kelly Souders (writers); [[Greg Beeman]] & [[Kevin Fair]] (directors)|network=[[The CW Television Network|The CW]]|airdate=May 13, 2011|season=10|number=21}}</ref> [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis, recommended by Williams to the producers]], performed a similar role for ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tracksounds.com/specialfeatures/Interviews/interviewdd2.htm|title=Composer Don Davis, Welcome to Jurassic Park|publisher=Tracksounds|date=2001-06-29|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 Williams returned to the ''Indiana Jones'' series to score the fourth film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''. He received a Grammy nomination for his work on the film. ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' was also the only film score from the ''Indiana Jones'' film series not to be nominated for an Academy Award. Also in 2008 Williams composed music for two documentaries, ''Warner at War''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323555/fullcredits Warner at War (2008) (TV) \u2013 Full cast and crew], imdb.com; accessed November 3, 2015.</ref> and ''A Timeless Call'',<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1287857/fullcredits A Timeless Call (2008) \u2013 cast and crew], imdb.com; accessed December 28, 2015.</ref> the latter directed by Spielberg.\n\nAfter a three-year absence from film scoring, in 2011 Williams composed the scores for Spielberg's ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[War Horse (film)|War Horse]]''.

About nine o'clock at night the day the moullah was killed, a great storm of wind suddenly rose and raged with violence for half an hour, and then stopped as suddenly as it came. Such a wind at night was altogether unusual, so the people said that this was the passing of the soul of the Moullah. Then cholera came, and, according to former outbreaks, another visitation was not due for four years to come, and this was also regarded as part of the fulfillment of the moullah's prophecy, and hence the great fear of the Amir and the prince, who thought they saw in all this their own death and it accounts also for the prince losing control of himself when his favourite wife died.|Frank A.

Failing to obtain a legal status, the Ahmadiyya community decided to seek registration as a non-commercial organisation with the Blagoevgrad Regional Court, where one of its biggest congregations is based. This too was rejected on the grounds that \"the community had been denied registration as a religion\" and that \"only registered religious communities are allowed to create non-commercial entities to promote their faith\". However, the community was able to successfully challenge this latter decision and gained registration as such in December 2005. Subsequently, their legal status as a non-commercial organisation was again opposed by the Religious Affairs Directorate and the Regional Prosecutor's Office lodged a suit to the regional court calling for it to revoke the registration. The Bulgarian authorities citied the Pakistani government's legal measures against the Ahmadis as a reason to restrict their rights also.

Failing to obtain a legal status, the Ahmadiyya community decided to seek registration as a non-commercial organisation with the Blagoevgrad Regional Court, where one of its biggest congregations is based. This too was rejected on the grounds that \"the community had been denied registration as a religion\" and that \"only registered religious communities are allowed to create non-commercial entities to promote their faith\". However, the community was able to successfully challenge this latter decision and gained registration as such in December 2005. Subsequently, their legal status as a non-commercial organisation was again opposed by the Religious Affairs Directorate and the Regional Prosecutor's Office lodged a suit to the regional court calling for it to revoke the registration. The Bulgarian authorities citied the Pakistani government's legal measures against the Ahmadis as a reason to restrict their rights also.
