The royalists ousted the Somers Isles Company's Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimingham as their leader.

The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of [[tobacco]] produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the company's charter in 1684, and the company was dissolved.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda\"/>\n\nBermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the entire island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century. Bermudians also vigorously pursued [[whaling]], [[privateering]], and the merchant trade.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the [[Royal Navy]]. The Bermuda sloop {{HMS|Pickle|1800|6}} carried dispatches of the victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], and news of the death of [[Admiral Lord Nelson|Admiral Nelson]], to England.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Bermuda and the American War of Independence===\nBermuda's ambivalence towards the American rebellion changed in September 1774, when the [[Continental Congress]] resolved to ban trade with Great Britain, Ireland, and the West Indies after 10 September 1775. Such an embargo would mean the collapse of their intercolonial commerce, famine and civil unrest. Lacking political channels with Great Britain, [[Henry Tucker (President of the Council of Bermuda)|the Tucker Family]] met in May 1775 with eight other parishioners, and resolved to send delegates to the Continental Congress in July, with the goal of an exemption from the ban. Henry Tucker noted a clause in the ban which allowed the exchange of American goods for military supplies. The clause was confirmed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] when Tucker met with the Pennsylvania [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]]. Independently, Tucker's sons St. George and Thomas Tudor confirmed this business arrangement with [[Peyton Randolph]] and the Charlestown Committee of Safety, while another Bermudian, Harris, did so with [[George Washington]].<ref name=Jarvis>{{cite book|last1=Jarvis|first1=Michael|title=In the Eye of All Trade|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807872840|pages=385\u2013389}}</ref>\n\nThree American vessels, independently operating from Charlestown, Philadelphia and Newport, sailed to Bermuda, and on 14 August 1775, 100 barrels of gunpowder were taken from the Bermudian magazine, while Governor [[George James Bruere]] slept, and loaded onto these vessels. As a consequence, on 2 October the Continental Congress exempted Bermuda from their trade ban, and Bermuda acquired a reputation for disloyalty. Later that year, the British Parliament passed the [[Prohibitory Act]] to prohibit trade with the American rebelling colonies, and sent HMS ''Scorpion'' to keep watch over the island. The island's forts were stripped of cannon, such that by the end of 1775, all of Bermuda's forts were without cannon, shot and powder. Yet, wartime trade of contraband continued along well-established family connections. With 120 vessels by 1775, Bermuda continued to trade with [[St. Eustatius]] until 1781, and provided salt to North American ports, despite the presence of hundreds of privateers.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|389\u2013415}}\n\nIn June 1776, HMS ''Nautilus'' secured the island, followed by {{HMS|Galatea|1776|6}} in September. Yet, the two British captains seemed more intent on capturing prize money, causing a severe food shortage on the island until the departure of ''Nautilus'' in October. After France's entry into the war in 1778, [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]] refortified and garrisoned the island under the command of Major [[William Sutherland (British Army officer)|William Sutherland]]. As a result, 91 French and American ships were captured in the winter of 1778\u20131779, bringing the population once again to the brink of starvation. Bermudian trade was severely hampered by the combined efforts of the Royal Navy, the British garrison and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist privateers]], such that famine struck the island in 1779.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|416\u2013427}}\n\nThe death of George Bruere in 1780 turned the governorship over to his son, George Jr., an active loyalist. Under his leadership, smuggling was stopped, and the Bermudian colonial government populated with like-minded loyalists.

After the acknowledgement by the British Government of the independence of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen continental colonies]] (including Virginia and the Carolinas) in 1783, Bermuda was generally grouped regionally by the British Government with [[The Maritimes]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], substantially nearer to Bermuda than is the Caribbean. However, with the confederation of Canada and the Maritimes and their attainment of [[Dominion]] status in the 1860s, the British political, naval and military hierarchy in Bermuda became increasingly separated from that of the Canadian Government (the Royal Navy headquarters had spent summers at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and winters at Bermuda, but settled at Bermuda year round with the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax]] finally being transferred to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] in 1907, and the [[Bermuda Garrison]] had been placed under the military Commander-in-Chief America in New York during the American War of Independence, and had been part of the Nova Scotia Command thereafter, but became the separate ''Bermuda Command'' from the 1860s with the Major-General or Lieutenant-General appointed as Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda also filling the civil role of [[Governor of Bermuda]]), and Bermuda was increasingly perceived by the British Government as in, or at least grouped for convenience with, the British West Indies (although the established [[Church of England]] in Bermuda, which from 1825 to 1839 had been attached to the See of [[Nova Scotia]]) remained part of the [[Diocese of Newfoundland|Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda]] until 1879, when the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own bishop). Newfoundland attained Dominion status in 1907, leaving the nearest other territories to Bermuda that were still within the [[Commonwealth realm|British Realm]] (a term which replaced ''Dominion'' in 1952 as the dominions and many colonies moved towards full political independence) as the British colonies in the [[British West Indies]].\n\n\nBermuda became an associate member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) in July 2003, despite not being in the Caribbean region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bermuda-online.org/bdagovt.htm |title= Bermuda Government today |work=Bermuda-Online.org |accessdate =9 July 2010 |quote=In July 2003, Bermuda formally joined the Caribbean Community as an Associate Member (non-voting member), in certain areas but not in others.

For the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to [[privateering]] at every opportunity. The Bermuda government maintained a local (infantry) militia and fortified coastal artillery batteries manned by volunteer artillerymen. Bermuda tended toward the Royalist side during the [[English Civil War]], being the first of six colonies to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King on the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1649, and was one of those targeted by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]], which was passed on the 30 October, 1650. With control of the \"army\" (the militia and coastal artillery), the colony's Royalists deposed the Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, elected John Trimingham to replace him, and exiled many of its Parliamentary-leaning [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] to settle the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Bermuda's barrier reef, coastal artillery batteries and  militia provided a defence too powerful for the fleet sent in 1651 by Parliament under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]] to capture the Royalist colonies. The Parliamentary Navy was consequently forced to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a peace.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], Bermuda was established as the Western Atlantic headquarters of the [[Royal Navy]]. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, the militias were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony raised [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]].\n\nDue to its isolated location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second World War, both the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] were operating [[Seaplane]] bases on Bermuda.\n\nIn May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005.</ref> In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). The US Army established the [[Bermuda Base Command]] in 1941 to co-ordinate its [[USAAF|air]], anti-aircraft, and [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|coast artillery]] assets during the war. The US Navy operated a [[USN Submarine Base, Ordnance Island, Bermuda|submarine base]] on [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]] from 1942 through 1945.<ref name=\"bermuda-online.org\"/>\n\nConstruction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of {{convert|5.8|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}} of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[US Air Force]] transport and refuelling aircraft and by [[US Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and, later, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.\n\nThe original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a [[seaplane]] base until the mid-1960s, was designated as the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex. It provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting US Navy, [[US Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size. An additional US Navy compound known as [[Naval Facility Bermuda]] (NAVFAC Bermuda), a submarine-detecting [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility in the Tudor Hill area; it was converted from a US Army coast artillery bunker in 1954 and operated until 1995. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nCanada, which had operated a war-time naval base, [[HMCS Somers Isles|HMCS ''Somers Isles'']], on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head in the West End of the islands during this time.\n\nIn the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small Royal Navy supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Malabar'']], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.\n\n[[File:HMS Ambuscade in Bermuda.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Ambuscade (F172)|HMS ''Ambuscade'']] at the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard in 1988]]]]\nBermudians served in the British armed forces during both [[World War I]] and World War II. After the latter, Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest-ranking soldier, was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and their descendants had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey. When promoted to brigadier at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], Harvey became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.\n\nToday, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than [[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps|naval]] and army cadet corps, is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription: balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18.\n\nIn early 2020 Bermuda formed the Bermuda Coast Guard. Its 24-hour on-duty service includes search and rescue, counter-narcotics operations, border control, and protection of Bermuda's maritime interests. The Bermuda Coast Guard will interact with the Bermuda Regiment, Bermuda Police Service.<ref>https://www.gov.bm/articles/launch-bermuda-coast-guard</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of Bermuda}}\n[[File:Front Street, Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Front Street, Hamilton]]\nBanking and other financial services form the largest sector of the economy at circa 85% of GDP, with tourism being the second largest industry at 5%.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/><ref name=Smithsonian/> Industrial and agriculture activities occur, however these are on a very limited scale and Bermuda is heavily reliant on imports.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/> Living standards are high and as of 2019 Bermuda has the 6th highest GDP per capita in the world.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/>\n\n===Currency===\nIn 1970 the country switched its currency from the [[Bermudian pound]] to the [[Bermudian dollar]], which is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] at par with the US dollar.

The private school sector consists of six traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single-gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools, which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation. The only boys' school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s, and in 1996, one of the aided schools became a private school.\n\nPrior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was racially segregated.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} When the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, two of the formerly maintained \"white\" schools and both single-sex schools opted to become private schools.

English is the primary and official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] ones.\n\nA second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture.\n\nThe first notable, and historically important, book credited to a Bermudian was ''[[Mary Prince#Publication of The History of Mary Prince|The History of Mary Prince]]'', a [[slave narrative]] by [[Mary Prince]]. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the [[British Empire]]. [[Graham Ingham|Ernest Graham Ingham]], an expatriate author, published his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing). The novelist [[Brian Burland]] (1931\u2013 2010) achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally. More recently, [[Angela Barry]] has won critical recognition for her published fiction.\n\n===Arts===\n{{see also|Music of Bermuda}}\nMusic and dance are an important part of Bermudian culture. West Indian musicians introduced [[calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-Second World War aviation. Local icons, [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], performed calypso music for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]''. While calypso appealed more to tourists than to the local residents, [[reggae]] has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrants.\n[[File:Gombey dancers from Bermuda2001.jpg|thumb|left|Gombey dancers from Bermuda at the 2001 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C.]]\nNoted Bermudian musicians include [[tenor|operatic tenor]] Dr. Gary Burgess; jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]]; singer-songwriter and poet, [[Heather Nova]], and her brother [[Mishka (musician)|Mishka]], reggae musician; classical musician and conductor [[Kenneth Amis]]; and more recently, [[dancehall]] artist [[Collie Buddz]].\n\nThe dances of the colourful [[Gombey]] dancers, seen at many events, are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British cultural traditions. In summer 2001, they performed at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. These Gombey Dancers continue to showcase their work for locals and visitors during the Harbour Nights festival on Bermuda's Front Street every Wednesday evening (during the summer months) and draw very large crowds.\n\nBermuda's early literature was limited to the works of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the islands. These included [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith's]] ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' (1624), and [[Edmund Waller]]'s poem, \"Battle of the Summer Islands\" (1645).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|title=The Battle Of The Summer Islands : Canto 1 \u2013 Poem by Edmund Waller|website=poemhunter.com|access-date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008224321/http://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|archive-date=8 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/217/0304.html|title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907\u201321), Volume VII.

The cup was contested annually by teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units stationed in Bermuda.]]\n\nMany sports popular today were formalised by British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public schools]] and universities in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the [[British empire]], and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as [[the Football Association]] (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players. The [[Bermuda national football team]] managed to qualify to the [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the country's first ever major football competition.\n\nThe professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby football]], and even [[Lawn tennis|tennis]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to [[Yacht racing|sail racing]], founding the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]]). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.\n\n[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a {{convert|130|kg}} police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a [[One-Day International]] (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]], a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual \"Cup Match\" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark ''forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery''. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the ''St. George's Garrison'' (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).<ref>Stranack</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on 16\u201317 October 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009.

Football did not become popular with Bermudians 'til after the [[Second World War]], though teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units of Bermuda had competed annually for the Governor's Cup introduced by Major-General Sir [[George Bullock (British Army officer)|George Mackworth Bullock]] in 1913. A combined team of the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and the [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (BMI) defeated {{HMS|Malabar|shore establishment|6}} to win the cup on 21 March 1943, becoming the first team of a locally raised unit to do so, and the third British Army team to do so since 1926.<ref>''Bermuda Militia Win Governor's Football Cup''. The Recorder. Page 1. City of Hamilton, Bermuda. 24th of March, 1943.</ref> Bermuda's most prominent footballers are [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Kyle Lightbourne]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]] and [[Nahki Wells]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team played in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]] but folded in 2013.\n\n[[Sailing]], [[fishing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport\u2013Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year-old tradition, with boats racing between [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and Bermuda. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |accessdate =20 June 2010}}</ref> In December 2013, Bermuda's bid to host the [[2017 America's Cup]] was announced.\n\nAt the [[Bermuda at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events.

The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of [[tobacco]] produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the company's charter in 1684, and the company was dissolved.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda\"/>\n\nBermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the entire island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century. Bermudians also vigorously pursued [[whaling]], [[privateering]], and the merchant trade.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the [[Royal Navy]].

Such an embargo would mean the collapse of their intercolonial commerce, famine and civil unrest. Lacking political channels with Great Britain, [[Henry Tucker (President of the Council of Bermuda)|the Tucker Family]] met in May 1775 with eight other parishioners, and resolved to send delegates to the Continental Congress in July, with the goal of an exemption from the ban. Henry Tucker noted a clause in the ban which allowed the exchange of American goods for military supplies. The clause was confirmed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] when Tucker met with the Pennsylvania [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]]. Independently, Tucker's sons St. George and Thomas Tudor confirmed this business arrangement with [[Peyton Randolph]] and the Charlestown Committee of Safety, while another Bermudian, Harris, did so with [[George Washington]].<ref name=Jarvis>{{cite book|last1=Jarvis|first1=Michael|title=In the Eye of All Trade|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807872840|pages=385\u2013389}}</ref>\n\nThree American vessels, independently operating from Charlestown, Philadelphia and Newport, sailed to Bermuda, and on 14 August 1775, 100 barrels of gunpowder were taken from the Bermudian magazine, while Governor [[George James Bruere]] slept, and loaded onto these vessels. As a consequence, on 2 October the Continental Congress exempted Bermuda from their trade ban, and Bermuda acquired a reputation for disloyalty. Later that year, the British Parliament passed the [[Prohibitory Act]] to prohibit trade with the American rebelling colonies, and sent HMS ''Scorpion'' to keep watch over the island. The island's forts were stripped of cannon, such that by the end of 1775, all of Bermuda's forts were without cannon, shot and powder. Yet, wartime trade of contraband continued along well-established family connections. With 120 vessels by 1775, Bermuda continued to trade with [[St. Eustatius]] until 1781, and provided salt to North American ports, despite the presence of hundreds of privateers.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|389\u2013415}}\n\nIn June 1776, HMS ''Nautilus'' secured the island, followed by {{HMS|Galatea|1776|6}} in September. Yet, the two British captains seemed more intent on capturing prize money, causing a severe food shortage on the island until the departure of ''Nautilus'' in October. After France's entry into the war in 1778, [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]] refortified and garrisoned the island under the command of Major [[William Sutherland (British Army officer)|William Sutherland]]. As a result, 91 French and American ships were captured in the winter of 1778\u20131779, bringing the population once again to the brink of starvation. Bermudian trade was severely hampered by the combined efforts of the Royal Navy, the British garrison and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist privateers]], such that famine struck the island in 1779.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|416\u2013427}}\n\nThe death of George Bruere in 1780 turned the governorship over to his son, George Jr., an active loyalist. Under his leadership, smuggling was stopped, and the Bermudian colonial government populated with like-minded loyalists. Even Henry Tucker abandoned trading with the United States, because of the presence of many privateers. Loyalist privateers based in Bermuda captured 114 prizes between 1777 and 1781, while 130 were captured in 1782.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|428\u2013433}}\n\n[[The Bermuda Gazette]], Bermuda's first newspaper, began publishing in 1784.<ref name=\"Stark\">{{cite book |last1=Stark |first1=James Henry |title=Stark's Illustrated Bermuda Guide: A Description of Everything on Or about These Places of which the Visitor Or Resident May Desire Information, Including Their History, Inhabitants, Climate, Agriculture, Geology, Government and Resources |date=1897 |publisher=J.H.Stark |location=Bermuda Island (Bermuda Islands) |page=250 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T11qAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA150&q=1784%20bermuda%20stockdale |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"200th\">{{cite web |last1=Rigby |first1=Neil |title=1984 200th Anniversary of Bermuda's first Newspaper and Postal Service |date=26 January 1984 |url=http://www.bermudastamps.co.uk/1984/01/26/200th-anniversary-bermudas-first-newspaper-postal-service/ |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"TBG\">{{cite web |title=The Bermuda gazette |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sn89049233/ |publisher=United States Library of Congress |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Devonshire Redoubt (Bermuda).png|thumb|left|An illustration of the Devonshire Redoubt, Bermuda, 1614]]\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], the [[Royal Navy]] began improving the harbours on the Bermudas.

After the acknowledgement by the British Government of the independence of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen continental colonies]] (including Virginia and the Carolinas) in 1783, Bermuda was generally grouped regionally by the British Government with [[The Maritimes]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], substantially nearer to Bermuda than is the Caribbean. However, with the confederation of Canada and the Maritimes and their attainment of [[Dominion]] status in the 1860s, the British political, naval and military hierarchy in Bermuda became increasingly separated from that of the Canadian Government (the Royal Navy headquarters had spent summers at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and winters at Bermuda, but settled at Bermuda year round, and the Bermuda Garrison had been placed under the military Commander-in-Chief America in New York during the American War of Independence, as part of the Nova Scotia Command thereafter, and a separate Bermuda Command from the 1860s with the Major-General or Lieutenant-General appointed as Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda also filling the civil role of [[Governor of Bermuda]]), and Bermuda was increasingly perceived by the British Government as in, or at least grouped for convenience with, the British West Indies (although the established [[Church of England]] in Bermuda, which from 1825 to 1839 had been attached to the See of [[Nova Scotia]]) remained part of the [[Diocese of Newfoundland|Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda]] until 1879, when the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own bishop). Newfoundland attained Dominion status in 1907, leaving the nearest other territories to Bermuda that were still within the [[Commonwealth realm|British Realm]] (a term which replaced ''Dominion'' in 1952 as the dominions and many colonies moved towards full political independence) as the British colonies in the [[British West Indies]].\n\n\nBermuda became an associate member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) in July 2003, despite not being in the Caribbean region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bermuda-online.org/bdagovt.htm |title= Bermuda Government today |work=Bermuda-Online.org |accessdate =9 July 2010 |quote=In July 2003, Bermuda formally joined the Caribbean Community as an Associate Member (non-voting member), in certain areas but not in others.

For the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to [[privateering]] at every opportunity. The Bermuda government maintained a local (infantry) militia and fortified coastal artillery batteries manned by volunteer artillerymen. Bermuda tended toward the Royalist side during the [[English Civil War]], being the first of six colonies to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King on the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1649, and was one of those targeted by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]], which was passed on the 30 October, 1650. With control of the \"army\" (the militia and coastal artillery), the colony's Royalists deposed the Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, elected John Trimingham to replace him, and exiled many of its Parliamentary-leaning [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] to settle the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Bermuda's barrier reef, coastal artillery batteries and  militia provided a defence too powerful for the fleet sent in 1651 by Parliament under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]] to capture the Royalist colonies. The Parliamentary Navy was consequently forced to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a peace.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], Bermuda was established as the Western Atlantic headquarters of the [[Royal Navy]]. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, the militias were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony raised [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]].\n\nDue to its isolated location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second World War, both the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] were operating [[Seaplane]] bases on Bermuda.\n\nIn May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005.</ref> In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). The US Army established the [[Bermuda Base Command]] in 1941 to co-ordinate its [[USAAF|air]], anti-aircraft, and [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|coast artillery]] assets during the war. The US Navy operated a [[USN Submarine Base, Ordnance Island, Bermuda|submarine base]] on [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]] from 1942 through 1945.<ref name=\"bermuda-online.org\"/>\n\nConstruction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of {{convert|5.8|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}} of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[US Air Force]] transport and refuelling aircraft and by [[US Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and, later, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.\n\nThe original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a [[seaplane]] base until the mid-1960s, was designated as the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex. It provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting US Navy, [[US Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size. An additional US Navy compound known as [[Naval Facility Bermuda]] (NAVFAC Bermuda), a submarine-detecting [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility in the Tudor Hill area; it was converted from a US Army coast artillery bunker in 1954 and operated until 1995. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nCanada, which had operated a war-time naval base, [[HMCS Somers Isles|HMCS ''Somers Isles'']], on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head in the West End of the islands during this time.\n\nIn the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small Royal Navy supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Malabar'']], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.\n\n[[File:HMS Ambuscade in Bermuda.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Ambuscade (F172)|HMS ''Ambuscade'']] at the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard in 1988]]]]\nBermudians served in the British armed forces during both [[World War I]] and World War II. After the latter, Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest-ranking soldier, was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and their descendants had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey. When promoted to brigadier at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], Harvey became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.\n\nToday, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than [[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps|naval]] and army cadet corps, is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription: balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18.\n\nIn early 2020 Bermuda formed the Bermuda Coast Guard. Its 24-hour on-duty service includes search and rescue, counter-narcotics operations, border control, and protection of Bermuda's maritime interests. The Bermuda Coast Guard will interact with the Bermuda Regiment, Bermuda Police Service.<ref>https://www.gov.bm/articles/launch-bermuda-coast-guard</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of Bermuda}}\n[[File:Front Street, Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Front Street, Hamilton]]\nBanking and other financial services form the largest sector of the economy at circa 85% of GDP, with tourism being the second largest industry at 5%.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/><ref name=Smithsonian/> Industrial and agriculture activities occur, however these are on a very limited scale and Bermuda is heavily reliant on imports.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/> Living standards are high and as of 2019 Bermuda has the 6th highest GDP per capita in the world.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/>\n\n===Currency===\nIn 1970 the country switched its currency from the [[Bermudian pound]] to the [[Bermudian dollar]], which is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] at par with the US dollar.

The private school sector consists of six traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single-gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools, which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation. The only boys' school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s, and in 1996, one of the aided schools became a private school.\n\nPrior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was racially segregated.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} When the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, two of the formerly maintained \"white\" schools and both single-sex schools opted to become private schools.

English is the primary and official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] ones.\n\nA second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture.\n\nThe first notable, and historically important, book credited to a Bermudian was ''[[Mary Prince#Publication of The History of Mary Prince|The History of Mary Prince]]'', a [[slave narrative]] by [[Mary Prince]]. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the [[British Empire]]. [[Graham Ingham|Ernest Graham Ingham]], an expatriate author, published his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing). The novelist [[Brian Burland]] (1931\u2013 2010) achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally. More recently, [[Angela Barry]] has won critical recognition for her published fiction.\n\n===Arts===\n{{see also|Music of Bermuda}}\nMusic and dance are an important part of Bermudian culture. West Indian musicians introduced [[calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-Second World War aviation. Local icons, [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], performed calypso music for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]''. While calypso appealed more to tourists than to the local residents, [[reggae]] has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrants.\n[[File:Gombey dancers from Bermuda2001.jpg|thumb|left|Gombey dancers from Bermuda at the 2001 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C.]]\nNoted Bermudian musicians include [[tenor|operatic tenor]] Dr. Gary Burgess; jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]]; singer-songwriter and poet, [[Heather Nova]], and her brother [[Mishka (musician)|Mishka]], reggae musician; classical musician and conductor [[Kenneth Amis]]; and more recently, [[dancehall]] artist [[Collie Buddz]].\n\nThe dances of the colourful [[Gombey]] dancers, seen at many events, are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British cultural traditions. In summer 2001, they performed at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. These Gombey Dancers continue to showcase their work for locals and visitors during the Harbour Nights festival on Bermuda's Front Street every Wednesday evening (during the summer months) and draw very large crowds.\n\nBermuda's early literature was limited to the works of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the islands. These included [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith's]] ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' (1624), and [[Edmund Waller]]'s poem, \"Battle of the Summer Islands\" (1645).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|title=The Battle Of The Summer Islands : Canto 1 \u2013 Poem by Edmund Waller|website=poemhunter.com|access-date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008224321/http://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|archive-date=8 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/217/0304.html|title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907\u201321), Volume VII.

The cup was contested annually by teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units stationed in Bermuda.]]\n\nMany sports popular today were formalised by British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public schools]] and universities in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the [[British empire]], and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as [[the Football Association]] (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players. The [[Bermuda national football team]] managed to qualify to the [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the country's first ever major football competition.\n\nThe professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby football]], and even [[Lawn tennis|tennis]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to [[Yacht racing|sail racing]], founding the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]]). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.\n\n[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a {{convert|130|kg}} police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a [[One-Day International]] (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]], a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual \"Cup Match\" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark ''forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery''. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the ''St. George's Garrison'' (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).<ref>Stranack</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on 16\u201317 October 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009.

Football did not become popular with Bermudians 'til after the [[Second World War]], though teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units of Bermuda had competed annually for the Governor's Cup introduced by Major-General Sir [[George Bullock (British Army officer)|George Mackworth Bullock]] in 1913. A combined team of the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and the [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (BMI) defeated {{HMS|Malabar|shore establishment|6}} to win the cup on 21 March 1943, becoming the first team of a locally raised unit to do so, and the third British Army team to do so since 1926.<ref>''Bermuda Militia Win Governor's Football Cup''. The Recorder. Page 1. City of Hamilton, Bermuda. 24th of March, 1943.</ref> Bermuda's most prominent footballers are [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Kyle Lightbourne]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]] and [[Nahki Wells]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team played in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]] but folded in 2013.\n\n[[Sailing]], [[fishing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport\u2013Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year-old tradition, with boats racing between [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and Bermuda. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |accessdate =20 June 2010}}</ref> In December 2013, Bermuda's bid to host the [[2017 America's Cup]] was announced.\n\nAt the [[Bermuda at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events.

Cosmic harmony was achieved by correct public and ritual life. Any disturbance in cosmic harmony could have consequences for the individual as well as the state.

In one [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (2062 to c.1664 BCE) text, the creator declares \"''I made every man like his fellow''\".

Maat was the spirit in which justice was applied rather than the detailed legalistic exposition of rules. Maat represented the normal and basic values that formed the backdrop for the application of justice that had to be carried out in the spirit of truth and fairness. From the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] (c. 2510\u20132370 BCE) onwards, the [[vizier]] responsible for justice was called the ''Priest of Maat'' and in later periods judges wore images of Maat.<ref>{{cite book| author = Siegfried Morenz| title = Egyptian Religion: Siegried Morenz| year = 1973| isbn = 978-0-8014-8029-4| pages = 117\u2013125 }}</ref>\n\nLater scholars and philosophers also would embody concepts from the [[Sebayt]], a native [[wisdom literature]]. These spiritual texts dealt with common social or professional situations, and how each was best to be resolved or addressed in the spirit of Maat. It was very practical advice, and highly case-based, so few specific and general rules could be derived from them.<ref>{{cite book| author = Roland Murphy| title = The Interpretation of Old Testament Wisdom Literature| year = 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Greek period in Egyptian history]], Greek law existed alongside Egyptian law. The Egyptian law preserved the rights of women, who were allowed to act independently of men and own substantial personal property, and in time, this influenced the more restrictive conventions of the Greeks and Romans.<ref>{{cite book| author = Anton Powell| title = The Greek World| year = 1995| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-415-17042-0| page = 303 }}</ref> When the Romans took control of Egypt, the Roman legal system, which existed throughout the Roman Empire, was imposed in Egypt.\n\n===Scribes===\nScribes held prestigious positions in ancient Egyptian society in view of their importance in the transmission of religious, political, and commercial information.<ref>Black, p. 130</ref>\n\nThoth was the patron of scribes who is described as the one \"who reveals Maat and reckons Maat; who loves Maat and gives Maat to the doer of Maat\".<ref>Black, p. 131</ref> In texts such as the [[Instruction of Amenemope]] the scribe is urged to follow the precepts of Maat in his private life as well as his work.<ref>Black, p. 132</ref> The exhortations to live according to Maat are such that these kinds of instructional texts have been described as \"Maat Literature\".<ref>Black, p. 157</ref>\n\n==Goddess==\n{{Hiero|Goddess Maat<ref>Hieroglyphs can be found in (Collier and Manley pp. 27, 29, 154)</ref><ref name=Budge416>Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 416</ref>|<hiero>U5:a-t-C10 ! or H6 ! or U5:D36-X1-Y1:Z1*Z1*Z1*Z1 ! or U1-Aa11:X1-C10 ! or C10 ! or U5:D42-X1:Y1:Z2-I12 ! or U5:D42:X1-H6-C10-Y1-Z3 ! or H6-X1:H8-C10 </hiero>|align=right|era=egypt}}\n\nMaat was the goddess of harmony, justice, and truth represented as a young woman.<ref>{{cite book| author = Robert A.

This is why hearts were left in Egyptian mummies while their other organs were removed, as the heart (called \"ib\") was seen as part of the [[Egyptian soul]]. If the heart was found to be lighter or equal in weight to the feather of Maat, the deceased had led a virtuous life and would go on to [[Aaru]]. [[Osiris]] came to be seen as the guardian of the gates of Aaru after he became part of the Egyptian pantheon and displaced [[Anubis]] in the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad tradition]]. A heart which was unworthy was devoured by the goddess [[Ammit]] and its owner condemned to remain in the Duat.<ref name=Weighing>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/young_explorers/discover/museum_explorer/ancient_egypt/death/weighing_the_heart.aspx |title= Death in Ancient Egypt: Weighing the Heart |website= British Museum |publisher= British Museum |accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe weighing of the heart, pictured on [[papyrus]] in the [[Book of the Dead]] typically, or in tomb scenes, shows Anubis overseeing the weighing and Ammit seated awaiting the results so she could consume those who failed. The image would be the vertical heart on one flat surface of the ''balance scale'' and the vertical Shu-feather standing on the other balance scale surface.  Other traditions hold that Anubis brought the soul before the posthumous Osiris who performed the weighing. While the heart was weighed the deceased recited the 42 Negative Confessions as the [[Assessors of Maat]] looked on.<ref name=Weighing/>\n\n===Funerary texts===\n[[File:Egypt dauingevekten.jpg|thumb|A section of the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' showing the [[Weighing of the Heart]] in the [[Duat]] using the feather of Maat as the measure in balance]]\n\nEgyptians were often entombed with funerary texts in order to be well equipped for the afterlife as mandated by [[ancient Egyptian funerary practices]]. These often served to guide the deceased through the afterlife, and the most famous one is the ''Book of the Dead'' or ''[[Papyrus of Ani]]'' (known to the ancient Egyptians as ''The Book of Coming Forth by Day''). The lines of these texts are often collectively called the \"Forty-Two Declarations of Purity\".<ref name=Ani>{{cite web| url= https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Books/Papyrus_Ani.html|title= The Papyrus of Ani}}</ref> These declarations varied somewhat from tomb to tomb as they were tailored to the individual, and so cannot be considered a canonical definition of Maat. Rather, they appear to express each tomb owner's individual practices in life to please Maat, as well as words of absolution from misdeeds or mistakes, made by the tomb owner in life, which could be declared as not having been done, and through the power of the written word, wipe particular misdeed from the afterlife record of the deceased. Many of the lines are similar, however, and paint a very unified picture of Maat.<ref name=Ani/>\n\nThe doctrine of Maat is represented in the declarations to Rekhti-merti-f-ent-Maat and the 42 Negative Confessions listed in the ''Papyrus of Ani''.

Allen| title = Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs| year = 2000| isbn = 978-0-521-77483-3| page = 116 }}</ref>\n\nTo the Egyptian mind, Maat bound all things together in an indestructible unity: the universe, the natural world, the state, and the individual were all seen as parts of the wider order generated by Maat.\n\nA passage in the Instruction of [[Ptahhotep]] presents Maat as follows:\n\n:''Maat is good and its worth is lasting.''\n:''It has not been disturbed since the day of its creator,'' \n:''whereas he who transgresses its ordinances is punished.''\n:''It lies as a path in front even of him who knows nothing.''\n:''Wrongdoing has never yet brought its venture to port.''\n:''It is true that evil may gain wealth but the strength of truth is that it lasts;''\n:''a man can say: \"It was the property of my father.\"''<ref>{{cite book |last=Frankfort |first=Henri |title=Ancient Egyptian Religion |page=62}}</ref>\n\n===Law===\n[[Image:maat.jpg|thumb|Maat wearing feather of truth]]\n\nThere is little surviving literature that describes the practice of ancient Egyptian law. Maat was the spirit in which justice was applied rather than the detailed legalistic exposition of rules. Maat represented the normal and basic values that formed the backdrop for the application of justice that had to be carried out in the spirit of truth and fairness. From the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] (c. 2510\u20132370 BCE) onwards, the [[vizier]] responsible for justice was called the ''Priest of Maat'' and in later periods judges wore images of Maat.<ref>{{cite book| author = Siegfried Morenz| title = Egyptian Religion: Siegried Morenz| year = 1973| isbn = 978-0-8014-8029-4| pages = 117\u2013125 }}</ref>\n\nLater scholars and philosophers also would embody concepts from the [[Sebayt]], a native [[wisdom literature]]. These spiritual texts dealt with common social or professional situations, and how each was best to be resolved or addressed in the spirit of Maat. It was very practical advice, and highly case-based, so few specific and general rules could be derived from them.<ref>{{cite book| author = Roland Murphy| title = The Interpretation of Old Testament Wisdom Literature| year = 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Greek period in Egyptian history]], Greek law existed alongside Egyptian law. The Egyptian law preserved the rights of women, who were allowed to act independently of men and own substantial personal property, and in time, this influenced the more restrictive conventions of the Greeks and Romans.<ref>{{cite book| author = Anton Powell| title = The Greek World| year = 1995| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-415-17042-0| page = 303 }}</ref> When the Romans took control of Egypt, the Roman legal system, which existed throughout the Roman Empire, was imposed in Egypt.\n\n===Scribes===\nScribes held prestigious positions in ancient Egyptian society in view of their importance in the transmission of religious, political, and commercial information.<ref>Black, p. 130</ref>\n\nThoth was the patron of scribes who is described as the one \"who reveals Maat and reckons Maat; who loves Maat and gives Maat to the doer of Maat\".<ref>Black, p. 131</ref> In texts such as the [[Instruction of Amenemope]] the scribe is urged to follow the precepts of Maat in his private life as well as his work.<ref>Black, p. 132</ref> The exhortations to live according to Maat are such that these kinds of instructional texts have been described as \"Maat Literature\".<ref>Black, p. 157</ref>\n\n==Goddess==\n{{Hiero|Goddess Maat<ref>Hieroglyphs can be found in (Collier and Manley pp. 27, 29, 154)</ref><ref name=Budge416>Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 416</ref>|<hiero>U5:a-t-C10 ! or H6 ! or U5:D36-X1-Y1:Z1*Z1*Z1*Z1 ! or U1-Aa11:X1-C10 ! or C10 ! or U5:D42-X1:Y1:Z2-I12 ! or U5:D42:X1-H6-C10-Y1-Z3 ! or H6-X1:H8-C10 </hiero>|align=right|era=egypt}}\n\nMaat was the goddess of harmony, justice, and truth represented as a young woman.<ref>{{cite book| author = Robert A.

[[Amenhotep III]] commissioned a temple in the [[Karnak]] complex, whilst textual evidence indicates that other temples of Maat were located in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and at [[Deir el-Medina]].<ref>''The Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology: The Oxford Guide'', p. 190, Berkeley Reference, 2003, {{ISBN|0-425-19096-X}}</ref> The Maat temple at the Karnak complex was also used by courts to meet regarding the robberies of the royal tombs during the rule of [[Ramesses IX]].<ref name=\"Vol p. 320\"/>\n\n==Afterlife==\n{{See also|Maat Kheru|l1=True of Voice}}\n\n===Weighing of the Heart===\nIn the [[Duat]], the Egyptian [[underworld]], the hearts of the dead were said to be weighed against her single \"Feather of Maat\", symbolically representing the concept of Maat, in the ''Hall of Two Truths''. This is why hearts were left in Egyptian mummies while their other organs were removed, as the heart (called \"ib\") was seen as part of the [[Egyptian soul]]. If the heart was found to be lighter or equal in weight to the feather of Maat, the deceased had led a virtuous life and would go on to [[Aaru]]. [[Osiris]] came to be seen as the guardian of the gates of Aaru after he became part of the Egyptian pantheon and displaced [[Anubis]] in the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad tradition]]. A heart which was unworthy was devoured by the goddess [[Ammit]] and its owner condemned to remain in the Duat.<ref name=Weighing>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/young_explorers/discover/museum_explorer/ancient_egypt/death/weighing_the_heart.aspx |title= Death in Ancient Egypt: Weighing the Heart |website= British Museum |publisher= British Museum |accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe weighing of the heart, pictured on [[papyrus]] in the [[Book of the Dead]] typically, or in tomb scenes, shows Anubis overseeing the weighing and Ammit seated awaiting the results so she could consume those who failed. The image would be the vertical heart on one flat surface of the ''balance scale'' and the vertical Shu-feather standing on the other balance scale surface.  Other traditions hold that Anubis brought the soul before the posthumous Osiris who performed the weighing. While the heart was weighed the deceased recited the 42 Negative Confessions as the [[Assessors of Maat]] looked on.<ref name=Weighing/>\n\n===Funerary texts===\n[[File:Egypt dauingevekten.jpg|thumb|A section of the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' showing the [[Weighing of the Heart]] in the [[Duat]] using the feather of Maat as the measure in balance]]\n\nEgyptians were often entombed with funerary texts in order to be well equipped for the afterlife as mandated by [[ancient Egyptian funerary practices]]. These often served to guide the deceased through the afterlife, and the most famous one is the ''Book of the Dead'' or ''[[Papyrus of Ani]]'' (known to the ancient Egyptians as ''The Book of Coming Forth by Day''). The lines of these texts are often collectively called the \"Forty-Two Declarations of Purity\".<ref name=Ani>{{cite web| url= https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Books/Papyrus_Ani.html|title= The Papyrus of Ani}}</ref> These declarations varied somewhat from tomb to tomb as they were tailored to the individual, and so cannot be considered a canonical definition of Maat. Rather, they appear to express each tomb owner's individual practices in life to please Maat, as well as words of absolution from misdeeds or mistakes, made by the tomb owner in life, which could be declared as not having been done, and through the power of the written word, wipe particular misdeed from the afterlife record of the deceased. Many of the lines are similar, however, and paint a very unified picture of Maat.<ref name=Ani/>\n\nThe doctrine of Maat is represented in the declarations to Rekhti-merti-f-ent-Maat and the 42 Negative Confessions listed in the ''Papyrus of Ani''.

Voiced by actress [[Nancy Cartwright]], Rufus is a pet [[naked mole-rat]] owned by Ron Stoppable, [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]]'s best friend and sidekick, and first appears in the show's [[Pilot Episode|pilot episode]] \"Crush\", which premiered on June 7, 2002. Residing and traveling in his owner's pocket, Rufus accompanies Kim and Ron on missions to protect the world from evildoers, at times proving beneficial to their success.\n\nSeries creators [[Bob Schooley]] and [[Mark McCorkle]] created Rufus at the behest of [[Disney Channel]] executives who insisted that the animated series required an animal sidekick, conceiving the character as a naked mole-rat to trick the network into saying the word \"naked\" whenever the character is mentioned. The writers took several [[Artistic License|creative liberties]] that differentiated Rufus from real naked mole-rats, such as a longer lifespan. The character is [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]], but apart from the occasional spoken word communicates using mostly squeaks and giggles, improvised by Cartwright. After considering having the character portrayed by either a live or puppeted mole rat in the live-action film, the filmmakers opted to make Rufus computer-animated instead, spending several months finalizing a design that was realistic yet appealing.\n\nThe character has been called a [[Breakout character|fan favorite]] and one of the series' most popular characters. Cartwright was nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program|Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program]] for her performance. Rufus has also been named the most famous naked mole-rat by various media and scientific publications, and is credited with introducing the species into mainstream popular culture.\n\n== Role ==\nRufus is the [[anthropomorphic]] pet naked mole-rat of Ron Stoppable,<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/will-rufus-be-in-the-new-kim-possible-movie-heres-what-the-naked-mole-rat-looks-like-15808346|title=Will Rufus Be In The New 'Kim Possible' Movie?

Voiced by actress [[Nancy Cartwright]], Rufus is a pet [[naked mole-rat]] owned by Ron Stoppable, [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]]'s best friend and sidekick, and first appears in the show's [[Pilot Episode|pilot episode]] \"Crush\", which premiered on June 7, 2002. Residing and traveling in his owner's pocket, Rufus accompanies Kim and Ron on missions to protect the world from evildoers, at times proving beneficial to their success.\n\nSeries creators [[Bob Schooley]] and [[Mark McCorkle]] created Rufus at the behest of [[Disney Channel]] executives who insisted that the animated series required an animal sidekick, conceiving the character as a naked mole-rat to trick the network into saying the word \"naked\" whenever the character is mentioned. The writers took several [[Artistic License|creative liberties]] that differentiated Rufus from real naked mole-rats, such as a longer lifespan. The character is [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]], but apart from the occasional spoken word communicates using mostly squeaks and giggles, improvised by Cartwright. After considering having the character portrayed by either a live or puppeted mole rat in the live-action film, the filmmakers opted to make Rufus computer-animated instead, spending several months finalizing a design that was realistic yet appealing.\n\nThe character has been called a [[Breakout character|fan favorite]] and one of the series' most popular characters. Cartwright was nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program|Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program]] for her performance. Rufus has also been named the most famous naked mole-rat by various media and scientific publications, and is credited with introducing the species into mainstream popular culture.\n\n== Role ==\nRufus is the [[anthropomorphic]] pet naked mole-rat of Ron Stoppable,<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/will-rufus-be-in-the-new-kim-possible-movie-heres-what-the-naked-mole-rat-looks-like-15808346|title=Will Rufus Be In The New 'Kim Possible' Movie?

The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Freistadt===\nIn October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were [[Old Lutherans]] who had resisted the Prussian government's attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].<ref>Ozaukee County.

It was the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, what would become the [[Lutheran Synod of Buffalo]] was organized in Freistadt.

Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.\n\nThien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: Village of Thiensville|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/village-of-thiensville/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThiensville grew in part because of its location on the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway]], which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.\n\nIn 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A.

Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier.

The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Freistadt===\nIn October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon.

{"title_page": "KOI8-R", "text_new": "{{infobox character encoding\n|name=KOI8-R\n|lang=[[Russian language|Russian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]\n|classification=8-bit [[KOI character encodings|KOI]], [[extended ASCII]]\n|basedon=[[KOI-8]]\n|extends=[[KOI8-B]]\n|otherrelated=[[KOI8-U]], [[KOI8-RU]]\n}}\n'''KOI8-R''' (RFC 1489) is an 8-bit [[character encoding]], designed to cover [[Russian language|Russian]], which uses a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] alphabet. It also happens to cover [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], but has not been used for that purpose since [[CP1251]] was accepted. A derivative encoding is [[KOI8-U]], which adds [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] characters. The original [[KOI-8]] encoding was designed by Soviet authorities in 1974. \nKOI8 remains much more commonly used than [[ISO 8859-5]], which never really caught on. Another common Cyrillic character encoding is [[Windows-1251]]. The use of these older code pages is being replaced with [[Unicode]] as a more common way to represent Cyrillic together with other languages.\n\nIn [[Microsoft Windows]], KOI8-R is assigned the code page number 20866. In [[IBM]], KOI8-R is assigned code page 878.<ref name=\"IBM\"/><ref name=\"IBM_878\"/>\n\nKOI8 stands for ''Kod Obmena Informatsiey, 8 bit'' ({{lang-ru|\u041a\u043e\u0434 \u041e\u0431\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u0439, 8 \u0431\u0438\u0442}}) which means \"Code for Information Exchange, 8 bit\".\n\nThe KOI8 character sets have the property that the Russian Cyrillic letters are in pseudo-Roman order rather than the normal Cyrillic alphabetical order as in ISO 8859-5 or Unicode. Although this may seem unnatural, it has the useful property that if the 8th bit is stripped, the text is partially readable in ASCII and may convert to syntactically correct [[KOI7]]. For instance, \"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0422\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\" in KOI8-R becomes ''rUSSKIJ tEKST'' (\"Russian Text\") if the 8th bit is stripped; attempting to interpret the ASCII string ''rUSSKIJ tEKST'' as KOI7 yields \"\u0420\u0423\u0421\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0419 \u0422\u0415\u041a\u0421\u0422\". KOI8 was based on [[Russian Morse code]], which was created from Latin [[Morse code]] based on sound similarities, and which has the same connection to the Latin Morse codes for A-Z as KOI8 has with [[ASCII]].\n\n==Character set==\nThe following table shows the KOI8-R encoding.<ref name=\"IBM\"/><ref name=\"Unicode_2016_KOI8-R\"/> Each character is shown with its equivalent [[Unicode]] code

It also happens to cover [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], but has not been used for that purpose since [[CP1251]] was accepted. A derivative encoding is [[KOI8-U]], which adds [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] characters. The original [[KOI-8]] encoding was designed by Soviet authorities in 1974. \nKOI8 remains much more commonly used than [[ISO 8859-5]], which never really caught on. Another common Cyrillic character encoding is [[Windows-1251]]. The use of these older code pages is being replaced with [[Unicode]] as a more common way to represent Cyrillic together with other languages.\n\nIn [[Microsoft Windows]], KOI8-R is assigned the code page number 20866. In [[IBM]], KOI8-R is assigned code page 878.<ref name=\"IBM\"/><ref name=\"IBM_878\"/>\n\nKOI8 stands for ''Kod Obmena Informatsiey, 8 bit'' ({{lang-ru|\u041a\u043e\u0434 \u041e\u0431\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u0439, 8 \u0431\u0438\u0442}}) which means \"Code for Information Exchange, 8 bit\".\n\nThe KOI8 character sets have the property that the Russian Cyrillic letters are in pseudo-Roman order rather than the normal Cyrillic alphabetical order as in ISO 8859-5 or Unicode. Although this may seem unnatural, it has the useful property that if the 8th bit is stripped, the text is partially readable in ASCII and may convert to syntactically correct [[KOI7]]. For instance, \"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0422\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\" in KOI8-R becomes ''rUSSKIJ tEKST'' (\"Russian Text\") if the 8th bit is stripped; attempting to interpret the ASCII string ''rUSSKIJ tEKST'' as KOI7 yields \"\u0420\u0423\u0421\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0419 \u0422\u0415\u041a\u0421\u0422\". KOI8 was based on [[Russian Morse code]], which was created from Latin [[Morse code]] based on sound similarities, and which has the same connection to the Latin Morse codes for A-Z as KOI8 has with [[ASCII]].\n\n==Character set==\nThe following table shows the KOI8-R encoding.<ref name=\"IBM\"/><ref name=\"Unicode_2016_KOI8-R\"/> Each character is shown with its equivalent [[Unicode]] code
