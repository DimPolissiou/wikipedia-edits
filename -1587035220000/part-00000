The system called BrainNet, produces phosphenes using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS). The goal of the research is to connect thoughts [[brain]] to brain using a system where signals are sent using [[electroencephalography]] ([[EEG]]) and  received using  [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS). An experiment was conducted with 5 different groups, each contained three people. The subjects were split into two groups. Two subjects functioned as the senders, and were connected to EEG electrodes, and a third person functioned as the receiver, who wore the TMS helmet. Each person was stationed in front of a television screen with a [[Tetris]]-style game. The senders had to determine if there was a need to rotate the falling blocks, but without the ability to rotate them \u2013 only the receiver was able to perform this operation. At the edges of each screen, were two icons with two flashing lights in two different frequencies, (one at 15&nbsp;Hz and the other at 17&nbsp;Hz). The sender focused on one icon, or the other to signal that the block should be rotated to the right or the left. The [[EEG]] produced a unique signal, which was transmitted to the TMS helmet of the receiver, who perceived phosphenes which differed for the 15&nbsp;Hz and 17&nbsp;Hz  signal, and rotated the block in the relevant direction. The experiment achieved 81% success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Rajesh P.

The system called BrainNet, produces phosphenes using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS). The goal of the research is to connect thoughts [[brain]] to brain using a system where signals are sent using [[electroencephalography]] ([[EEG]]) and  received using  [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS). An experiment was conducted with 5 different groups, each contained three people. The subjects were split into two groups. Two subjects functioned as the senders, and were connected to EEG electrodes, and a third person functioned as the receiver, who wore the TMS helmet. Each person was stationed in front of a television screen with a [[Tetris]]-style game. The senders had to determine if there was a need to rotate the falling blocks, but without the ability to rotate them \u2013 only the receiver was able to perform this operation. At the edges of each screen, were two icons with two flashing lights in two different frequencies, (one at 15&nbsp;Hz and the other at 17&nbsp;Hz). The sender focused on one icon, or the other to signal that the block should be rotated to the right or the left. The [[EEG]] produced a unique signal, which was transmitted to the TMS helmet of the receiver, who perceived phosphenes which differed for the 15 Hz and 17 Hz  signal, and rotated the block in the relevant direction. The experiment achieved 81% success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Rajesh P.
