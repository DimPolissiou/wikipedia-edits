It was sold under the brand name '''Amevive''' in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Australia]]. In 2011, the manufacturers made a decision to cease promotion, manufacturing, distribution and sales of Amevive during a supply disruption. According to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.,<ref>https://www.psoriasis.org/media/press-releases/amevive-alefacept-voluntarily-discontinued-us</ref> the decision to cease Amevive sales was neither the result of any specific safety concern nor the result of any FDA-mandated or voluntary product recall. On the other hand, usage of Amevive was associated with a certain risk of development systemic diseases such as malignancies. This drug was never approved for the European drug market.\n \nAlefacept is used to control [[inflammation]] in moderate to severe [[psoriasis]] with plaque formation, where it interferes with [[lymphocyte]] activation.<ref>{{cite journal\n |year=2004 \n |title='''New drugs''' \n |journal=Australian Prescriber \n |volume=27 \n |issue=101 \n |pages=5 \n |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/27/4/101/5/ \n |accessdate=2006-08-20 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824043206/http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/27/4/101/5/ \n |archivedate=2006-08-24 \n}}</ref> It is also being studied in the treatment of [[cutaneous T-cell lymphoma]] and [[T-cell]] [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].<ref name=\"NCI-cancer-dict\">{{NCI-cancer-dict|article=Alefacept|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?CdrID=538645}}</ref>\n\nAlefacept is a [[fusion protein]]: it combines part of an [[antibody]] with a [[protein]] that blocks the growth of some types of T cells.<ref name=\"NCI-cancer-dict\"/>\n\n==Mechanism of action==\nThe mechanism of action involves dual mechanisms.  Alefacept inhibits the activation of [[CD4]]<sup>+</sup> and [[CD8]]<sup>+</sup> [[T cell]]s by interfering with [[CD2]] on the T cell membrane thereby blocking the costimulatory molecule [[LFA-3]]/CD2 interaction. Another mechanism is inducing [[apoptosis]] of memory-effector T lymphocytes.

Most of these were [[nonmelanoma]] and [[melanoma]] [[skin cancer]]s, other [[solid tumor]]s, and [[lymphoma]]s.\n* Infections : In clinical studies 0.9% of patients experienced significant infections compared to 0.2% in the placebo group. Among the infections were serious ones such as [[sepsis]], [[pneumonia]], [[abscess]]es, [[wound infection]]s and [[toxic shock syndrome]].\n* Sensitivity reactions: [[Urticaria]] and [[angioedema]] were observed. If an [[anaphylactic reaction]] should occur symptomatic treatment should be initiated at once.\n* Forming of [[antibody|antibodies]] to alefacept : About 3% of patients developed low-titer antibodies with unknown importance for the clinical efficiency of the drug. Long-term immune effects have not been well explored.\n* Hepatic Toxicity : Postmarketing reports revealed asymtomatic increases in [[transaminases]] ([[alanine transaminase|ALT]] and/or [[aspartate transaminase|AST]]), [[fatty liver degeneration]], decompensation of preexisting [[liver cirrhosis]], and acute treatment-related [[liver failure]]. It is not known if some or all of these manifestations are attributable to alefacept-therapy, but it is recommended to discontinue therapy as soon as any sign of liver toxicity develops.\n* Different Common Side Effects : side effects such as [[pharyngitis]], [[cough]], [[dizziness]], [[nausea]], [[pruritus]], [[myalgia]]s, [[Rigor (medicine)|chills]], and reactions at injection sites were observed quite frequently.\n\n==Interactions==\n* Patients currently undergoing immunosuppressive therapy (phototherapy, or concomitant application of other immunosuppressant agents) should not receive alefacept to avoid the risks of excessive immunosuppression.

It was sold under the brand name '''Amevive''' in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Australia]]. In 2011, the manufacturers made a decision to cease promotion, manufacturing, distribution and sales of Amevive during a supply disruption. According to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.,<ref>https://www.psoriasis.org/media/press-releases/amevive-alefacept-voluntarily-discontinued-us</ref> the decision to cease Amevive sales was neither the result of any specific safety concern nor the result of any FDA-mandated or voluntary product recall. On the other hand, usage of Amevive was associated with a certain risk of development systemic diseases such as malignancies. This drug was never approved for the European drug market.\n \nAlefacept is used to control [[inflammation]] in moderate to severe [[psoriasis]] with plaque formation, where it interferes with [[lymphocyte]] activation.<ref>{{cite journal\n |year=2004 \n |title='''New drugs''' \n |journal=Australian Prescriber \n |volume=27 \n |issue=101 \n |pages=5 \n |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/27/4/101/5/ \n |accessdate=2006-08-20 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824043206/http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/27/4/101/5/ \n |archivedate=2006-08-24 \n}}</ref> It is also being studied in the treatment of [[cutaneous T-cell lymphoma]] and [[T-cell]] [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].<ref name=\"NCI-cancer-dict\">{{NCI-cancer-dict|article=Alefacept|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?CdrID=538645}}</ref>\n\nAlefacept is a [[fusion protein]]: it combines part of an [[antibody]] with a [[protein]] that blocks the growth of some types of T cells.<ref name=\"NCI-cancer-dict\"/>\n\n==Mechanism of action==\nThe mechanism of action involves dual mechanisms.  Alefacept inhibits the activation of [[CD4]]<sup>+</sup> and [[CD8]]<sup>+</sup> [[T cell]]s by interfering with [[CD2]] on the T cell membrane thereby blocking the costimulatory molecule [[LFA-3]]/CD2 interaction. Another mechanism is inducing [[apoptosis]] of memory-effector T lymphocytes. If the T cells were to become activated they would stimulate [[cell growth|proliferation]] of [[keratinocyte]]s resulting in the typical psoriatic symptoms. Therefore, alefacept leads to clinical improvement of moderate to severe psoriasis by blunting these reactions.  Combinations of therapeutic modalities have been utilized to meet the challenge of difficult to treat psoriasis.<ref>Scheinfeld N.

He designed the Wu-Tang Clan logo.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0TdA6nnVCY</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn and raised in [[Jamaica, Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Mathematics was introduced to hip hop by his brother who used to bring home recordings of the genre's pioneers like [[Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five]], Treacherous Three and [[Cold Crush Brothers]]. He began his career in 1987 DJing block parties and park jams in Baisley Projects, going by the name Supreme Cut Master. In 1988, he became the full-time DJ for experienced rapper Victor C, doing countless shows in clubs and colleges in New York City.\n\nIn 1990, Mathematics linked up with [[GZA]]/Genius, who would soon become one of the Wu-Tang Clan's founding members, but at the time was struggling to build a career on the [[Prism Records|Cold Chillin']] label. This partnership earned Mathematics a spot on his first official tour, The Cold Chillin Blizzard Tour (with popular acts such as [[Biz Markie]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Kool G. Rap]] & [[DJ Polo]] and [[Marley Marl]]).\n\nGZA left Cold Chillin after his first album, ''[[Words from the Genius]]'', did not achieve the sales target that was anticipated. He and Mathematics took to the road again, but this time with the help of GZA's cousins, [[RZA]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. These three soon became the founding members of Wu-Tang Clan, then known as [[All In Together Now Crew|All In Together Now]]. The group soon dissolved, however, and the trio set their minds on creating the Wu group. During the group's inception, Mathematics used his experience as a [[graffiti]] artist to design a logo for the up-and-coming crew, as well as various other logos and designs the Wu-Tang's artists would use. In the years to come, he became a Wu-Element under the guidance of RZA.\n\nMathematics' first real exposure to production came late one night when he attended a session where he assisted RZA, his mentor, in constructing a beat from nothing. The track eventually developed into \"Ice Cream\" on [[Raekwon]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx]]'' album. RZA inspired Mathematics to follow the Wu-Tang, giving him advice on the nuances of hip hop production over the coming years. In 1996, Mathematics began record producing, in Staten Island, New York (Shaolin) and at home, in the P-Funk City, Plainfield, New Jersey, between heavily scheduled tour dates and rigorous road travelling with his father's gospel group, The Soul Seekers.\n\nHis first track, \"Fast Life\" featuring [[Ghostface Killah]] and the [[American football]] star [[Andre Rison]], was included in the ''[[NFL Jams (1996 album)|NFL Jams]]'' compilation album. Though this track faded into obscurity somewhat, it led to several more collaborations between Mathematics and Ghostface; Mathematics also began to produce for many other Wu-Tang members and affiliates, including several tracks on GZA's second album ''[[Beneath the Surface (GZA album)|Beneath The Surface]]'' as well as [[Method Man]]'s ''[[Tical 2000: Judgement Day]]'', [[Inspectah Deck]]'s ''[[Uncontrolled Substance]]'' and Method Man & [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]]'s ''[[Blackout! (Method Man & Redman album)|Blackout!]]''. Eventually, he produced for the Clan as a group, with \"Do You Really (Thang, Thang)\", \"Careful (Click, Click)\".\n\nIn 2003, Mathematics moved into TV work, as he produced the main theme and all original music for the short lived show ''Wanda At Large'', which starred [[Wanda Sykes]] and was broadcast by the [[Fox Network]]. During this time and between continuous touring, Mathematics started work on his first solo full length project, ''[[Love, Hell Or Right]]''. Completely mixed, arranged and produced by himself, ''Love Hell or Right'' was released fall 2003 on his own Quewisha Records label in conjunction with High Times Records, and it went on to sell 30,000 units.\n\nAs well as using rappers from Mathematics' home borough of Queens, Eyes-Low and Buddah Bless, ''Love Hell Or Right'' had appearances from all the Wu-Tang Clan members except GZA and the then-imprisoned [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. Mathematics soon signed to the popular independent hip hop label Nature Sounds (home to Wu-Tang colleague [[Masta Killa]] as well as [[Daniel Dumile|MF DOOM]]) and released his second album ''[[The Problem (album)|The Problem]]'' in 2005. On this album the entire Wu-Tang Clan appeared, including a posthumous appearance from Ol' Dirty Bastard. As well as working on his solo albums, Mathematics has continued to contribute beats to many Wu-Tang releases, including the first albums by Masta Killa and Streetlife. In January 2012 he was to release a sequel to ''The Problem'' entitled ''The Answer'', entirely produced by him with Wu-Tang members such as Raekwon, GZA, Method Man, [[Cappadonna]], Masta Killa, Ol' Dirty Bastard, [[Ghostface Killah]]. Other artists include Redman and artists he is developing such as Ali Vegas, Eyeslow and Bad Luck.<ref name=\"vodpod\">{{cite web|url=http://vodpod.com/watch/15492951-mathematics-interview|title=Your shoppable fashion magazine &#124; Ador.com|publisher=vodpod.com|accessdate=2014-10-18}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn August 2017, it was confirmed that [[Wu-Tang Clan]] will release a new album, ''Wu-Tang: The Saga Continues'', which was entirely produced by Mathematics and was released on October 13, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2017/08/wu-tang-clan-new-album-people-say-redman/ |title=Wu-Tang Clan Have a New Album On The Way, Drop 'People Say' With Redman |publisher=xxlmag.com |date=August 25, 2017 |accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref> The first track off the album is titled \"People Say\" and features [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]].\n\n==Discography==\n\n=== Albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:350px;\"|Album Name\n! style=\"width:150px; text-align:center;\"|Release Date\n! style=\"width:150px; text-align:center;\"|Status\n|-\n|''[[Love, Hell or Right]]''\n|August 26, 2003\n|\n|-\n|''[[The Problem (album)|The Problem]]''\n|June 28, 2005\n|\n|-\n|''Soul of a Man''\n|June 13, 2006\n|\n|-\n|''[[Mathematics Presents Wu-Tang Clan & Friends Unreleased]]''\n|February 6, 2007\n|\n|-\n|''[[Return of the Wu & Friends|Mathematics Presents...

He designed the Wu-Tang Clan logo.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0TdA6nnVCY</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn and raised in [[Jamaica, Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Mathematics was introduced to hip hop by his brother who used to bring home recordings of the genre's pioneers like [[Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five]], Treacherous Three and [[Cold Crush Brothers]]. He began his career in 1987 DJing block parties and park jams in Baisley Projects, going by the name Supreme Cut Master. In 1988, he became the full-time DJ for experienced rapper Victor C, doing countless shows in clubs and colleges in New York City.\n\nIn 1990, Mathematics linked up with [[GZA]]/Genius, who would soon become one of the Wu-Tang Clan's founding members, but at the time was struggling to build a career on the [[Prism Records|Cold Chillin']] label. This partnership earned Mathematics a spot on his first official tour, The Cold Chillin Blizzard Tour (with popular acts such as [[Biz Markie]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Kool G. Rap]] & [[DJ Polo]] and [[Marley Marl]]).\n\nGZA left Cold Chillin after his first album, ''[[Words from the Genius]]'', did not achieve the sales target that was anticipated. He and Mathematics took to the road again, but this time with the help of GZA's cousins, [[RZA]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. These three soon became the founding members of Wu-Tang Clan, then known as [[All In Together Now Crew|All In Together Now]]. The group soon dissolved, however, and the trio set their minds on creating the Wu group. During the group's inception, Mathematics used his experience as a [[graffiti]] artist to design a logo for the up-and-coming crew, as well as various other logos and designs the Wu-Tang's artists would use. In the years to come, he became a Wu-Element under the guidance of RZA.\n\nMathematics' first real exposure to production came late one night when he attended a session where he assisted RZA, his mentor, in constructing a beat from nothing. The track eventually developed into \"Ice Cream\" on [[Raekwon]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx]]'' album. RZA inspired Mathematics to follow the Wu-Tang, giving him advice on the nuances of hip hop production over the coming years. In 1996, Mathematics began record producing, in Staten Island, New York (Shaolin) and at home, in the P-Funk City, Plainfield, New Jersey, between heavily scheduled tour dates and rigorous road travelling with his father's gospel group, The Soul Seekers.\n\nHis first track, \"Fast Life\" featuring [[Ghostface Killah]] and the [[American football]] star [[Andre Rison]], was included in the ''[[NFL Jams (1996 album)|NFL Jams]]'' compilation album. Though this track faded into obscurity somewhat, it led to several more collaborations between Mathematics and Ghostface; Mathematics also began to produce for many other Wu-Tang members and affiliates, including several tracks on GZA's second album ''[[Beneath the Surface (GZA album)|Beneath The Surface]]'' as well as [[Method Man]]'s ''[[Tical 2000: Judgement Day]]'', [[Inspectah Deck]]'s ''[[Uncontrolled Substance]]'' and Method Man & [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]]'s ''[[Blackout! (Method Man & Redman album)|Blackout!]]''. Eventually, he produced for the Clan as a group, with \"Do You Really (Thang, Thang)\", \"Careful (Click, Click)\".\n\nIn 2003, Mathematics moved into TV work, as he produced the main theme and all original music for the short lived show ''Wanda At Large'', which starred [[Wanda Sykes]] and was broadcast by the [[Fox Network]]. During this time and between continuous touring, Mathematics started work on his first solo full length project, ''[[Love, Hell Or Right]]''. Completely mixed, arranged and produced by himself, ''Love Hell or Right'' was released fall 2003 on his own Quewisha Records label in conjunction with High Times Records, and it went on to sell 30,000 units.\n\nAs well as using rappers from Mathematics' home borough of Queens, Eyes-Low and Buddah Bless, ''Love Hell Or Right'' had appearances from all the Wu-Tang Clan members except GZA and the then-imprisoned [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. Mathematics soon signed to the popular independent hip hop label Nature Sounds (home to Wu-Tang colleague [[Masta Killa]] as well as [[Daniel Dumile|MF DOOM]]) and released his second album ''[[The Problem (album)|The Problem]]'' in 2005. On this album the entire Wu-Tang Clan appeared, including a posthumous appearance from Ol' Dirty Bastard. As well as working on his solo albums, Mathematics has continued to contribute beats to many Wu-Tang releases, including the first albums by Masta Killa and Streetlife. In January 2012 he was to release a sequel to ''The Problem'' entitled ''The Answer'', entirely produced by him with Wu-Tang members such as Raekwon, GZA, Method Man, [[Cappadonna]], Masta Killa, Ol' Dirty Bastard, [[Ghostface Killah]]. Other artists include Redman and artists he is developing such as Ali Vegas, Eyeslow and Bad Luck.<ref name=\"vodpod\">{{cite web|url=http://vodpod.com/watch/15492951-mathematics-interview|title=Your shoppable fashion magazine &#124; Ador.com|publisher=vodpod.com|accessdate=2014-10-18}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn August 2017, it was confirmed that [[Wu-Tang Clan]] will release a new album, ''Wu-Tang: The Saga Continues'', which was entirely produced by Mathematics and was released on October 13, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2017/08/wu-tang-clan-new-album-people-say-redman/ |title=Wu-Tang Clan Have a New Album On The Way, Drop 'People Say' With Redman |publisher=xxlmag.com |date=August 25, 2017 |accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref> The first track off the album is titled \"People Say\" and features [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]].\n\n==Discography==\n\n=== Albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:350px;\"|Album Name\n! style=\"width:150px; text-align:center;\"|Release Date\n! style=\"width:150px; text-align:center;\"|Status\n|-\n|''[[Love, Hell or Right]]''\n|August 26, 2003\n|\n|-\n|''[[The Problem (album)|The Problem]]''\n|June 28, 2005\n|\n|-\n|''Soul of a Man''\n|June 13, 2006\n|\n|-\n|''[[Mathematics Presents Wu-Tang Clan & Friends Unreleased]]''\n|February 6, 2007\n|\n|-\n|''[[Return of the Wu & Friends|Mathematics Presents...

There has been a continuous movement of people between the islands of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]] due to their proximity. This tide has ebbed and flowed in response to politics, economics and social conditions of both places. Ireland was a feudal [[Lordship of Ireland|Lordship]] of the [[List of English monarchs|Kings of England]] between 1171 and 1541; a [[Kingdom of Ireland|Kingdom]] in [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] between 1542 and 1801; and politically united with Great Britain as the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] between 1801 and 1922. Today, Ireland is divided between the independent [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], a constituent of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nToday, millions of residents of Great Britain are either from Ireland or have Irish ancestry. It is estimated that as many as six million people living in the UK have at least one Irish grandparent (around 10% of the UK population).<ref name=accordingtotheGuardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/13/britishidentity.travelnews|title=More Britons applying for Irish passports|first1=Owen|last1=Bowcott|first2=Ireland|last2=correspondent|date=13 September 2006|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Irish diaspora]] ({{lang-ga|Diasp\u00f3ra na nGael}}) refers to [[Irish people]] and their descendants who live outside [[Ireland]]. This article refers to those who reside in Great Britain, the largest island and principal territory of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==Medieval era==\nDuring the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], significant Irish settlement of western Britain took place. The 'traditional' view is that [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic language]] and culture was brought to [[Scotland]], probably in the 4th century, by settlers from Ireland,  who founded the Gaelic kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] on Scotland's west coast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Charles|title=The Edinburgh history of the Scots language|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1997|page=551|isbn=978-0-7486-0754-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Nora Kershaw Chadwick|first=Myles Dyllon|title=The Celtic Realms|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=1972|page=66|isbn=978-0-7607-4284-6}}</ref> This is based mostly on medieval writings from the 9th and 10th centuries. However, recently some archeologists have argued against this view, saying that there is no archeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites.<ref name=ewancampbell>Campbell, Ewan. \"[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/articles/scotsirish.htm Were the Scots Irish?]\" in ''Antiquity'' #75 (2001).</ref> Due to the growth of D\u00e1l Riata, in both size and influence, Scotland became almost wholly Gaelic-speaking until Northumbrian English began to replace Gaelic in the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]]. [[Scottish Gaelic]] remained the dominant language of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] into the 19th century, but has since declined.\n\nBefore and during the [[Gregorian mission]] of 596 AD, Irish Christians such as [[Columba]] (521\u201397), [[Buriana]], [[Diuma]], [[Ceollach]], [[Saint Machar]], [[Saint Cathan]], [[Saint Blane]], [[Jaruman]], [[Wyllow]], [[Kessog]], [[St Govan]], [[Donn\u00e1n of Eigg]], [[Foillan]] and [[Saint Fursey]] began the conversion of the English and Pictish peoples. [[Modwenna]] and others were significant in the following century.\n\nSome English monarchs, such as [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] (c. 612 \u2013 15 February 670), [[Aldfrith]] (died 704 or 705) and [[Harold Godwinson]] (died 1066) were either raised in or sought refuge in Ireland, as did Welsh rulers such as [[Gruffudd ap Cynan]]. [[Alfred the Great]] may have spent some of his childhood in Ireland.\n\nIn the year 902 Vikings who had been forced out of Ireland were given permission by the English to settle in [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], in the north west of England. An Irish historical record known as \"The Three Fragments\" refers to a distinct group of settlers living among these Vikings as \"Irishmen\". Further evidence of this Irish migration to Wirral comes from the name of the village of [[Irby, Merseyside|Irby]] in Wirral, which means \"settlement of the Irish\", and St Bridget's church, which is known to have been founded by \"Vikings from Ireland\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saintpatrickscrossliverpool.webs.com/|title=Saint Patrick's Cross Liverpool|website=Saint Patrick's Cross Liverpool}}</ref>\n\nIrish people who made Britain their home in the later medieval era included [[Aoife MacMurrough]], Princess of Leinster (1145\u201388), the poet [[Muireadhach Albanach]] (fl. 1213), the lawyer [[William of Drogheada]] (died 1245), [[M\u00e1el Muire \u00d3 Lacht\u00e1in]] (died 1249), [[Malachias Hibernicus]] (fl. 1279\u20131300), [[Gilbert \u00d3 Tigernaig]] (died 1323), Diarmait MacCairbre (executed 1490) and [[Germyn Lynch]] (fl. 1441\u20131483), all of whom made successful lives in the various kingdoms of Britain.\n\n==Sixteenth to eighteenth centuries==\nHistorically, Irish immigrants to the United Kingdom in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were considered over-represented amongst those appearing in court. However, research suggests that policing strategy may have put immigrants at a disadvantage by targeting only the most public forms of crime, while locals were more likely able to engage in the types of crimes that could be conducted behind locked doors.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = How Criminal were the Irish?

It is estimated that more than one million people died and almost the same again emigrated. A further wave of emigration to England also took place between the 1930s, and 1960s by Irish escaping poor economic conditions following the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]]. This was furthered by the severe labour shortage in Britain during the mid-20th century, which depended largely on Irish immigrants to work in the areas of construction and domestic labour. The extent of the Irish contribution to Britain's construction industry in the 20th century may be gauged from Sir William MacAlpine's 1998 assertion that the contribution of the Irish to the success of his industry had been 'immeasurable'.\n\nIreland's population fell from more than 8 million to just 6.5 million between 1841 and 1851. A century later it had dropped to 4.3 million. By the late 19th century, emigration was heaviest from Ireland's most rural southern and western counties. [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Mayo|Mayo]], [[County Sligo|Sligo]], [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] and [[County Limerick|Limerick]] alone provided nearly half of Ireland's emigrants. Some of this movement was temporary, made up of seasonal harvest labourers working in Britain and returning home for winter and spring. By the mid-1930s, Great Britain was the choice of many who had to leave Ireland. Britain's wartime economy (1939\u201345) and post-war boom attracted many Irish people to expanding cities and towns such as [[London]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Luton]]. Prior to the 2000s financial crisis, ongoing [[The Troubles|sectarian violence]] and its economic aftermath was another major factor for immigration.\n\nAccording to the [[UK 2001 Census]], white Irish-born residents make up 1.2% of those living in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/commentaries/ethnicity.asp|title=2011 Census - Office for National Statistics|website=Statistics.gov.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> In 1997, the [[Irish Government]] in its ''White Paper on Foreign Policy'' claimed that there were around two million Irish citizens living in Britain, the majority of them British-born. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The 2001 Census also showed that Irish people are more likely to be employed in managerial or professional occupations than those classed as \"White British\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=463 |title=Employment Patterns |publisher=ONS |accessdate=10 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501051546/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=463 |archivedate= 1 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|Irish financial crisis]], emigration from Ireland has risen significantly.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/ireland-business-blog-with-lisa-ocarroll/2011/jan/20/ireland-emigration-australia|title=Irish emigration worse than 1980s|first=Lisa|last=O'Carroll|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref> Data published in June 2011 showed that Irish emigration to Britain had risen by 25 per cent to 13,920 in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/0614/1224298865280.html|title=Emigration to Britain up 25% to almost 14,000, data reveals|first=Jamie|last=Smyth|work=The Irish Times|date=14 June 2011|accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nSome notable people born in Ireland who settled in Great Britain in the 19th century:\n\n* [[Oscar Wilde]], (1854{{spaced ndash}}1900)\n\n==London Irish==\n[[File:Forgotten Irish of London memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial to the \"Forgotten Irish\" of London, Church of the Sacred Heart, [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]].]]\nThe term 'London Irish' relates to people born in London of Irish descent. London has Great Britain's biggest Irish population and there was a particularly big community in the (affectionately known) [[Kilburn, London|'County Kilburn']] area of northwest [[London]].  With urban [[gentrification]] and higher housing costs, many of London's [[working-class]] [[Irish-Catholic]] community have moved further out from [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] to [[Cricklewood]].  \n\nAnother large Irish community was in the [[Archway, London|Archway]] area, where many Irish \"[[navvies]]\" came to work in building railways and roads from the 1830s onwards.<ref name=Archway>{{cite news |last=Finch |first=Emily |date=8 December 2017 |title=Navigator Square \u2013 built on the pluck of the Irish |url=http://camdennewjournal.com/article/navigator-square-built-on-the-pluck-of-the-irish|work=Camden New Journal |location=London |access-date=17 March 2018 }}</ref>  The community grew larger throughout the Famine years and then again after the [[Second World War]] when the [[Whittington Hospital]] in Archway recruited nurses from Ireland.<ref name=Archway/> This area became associated with Irish political activism with the election of [[Michael O'Halloran (British politician)|Michael O'Halloran]] as MP for [[Islington North]] in 1969.

The Irish Cultural Centre is located in [[Hammersmith]], West London. [[Greenford]] in the [[London Borough of Ealing]] is home to a large Irish community and contains Tir Chonaill Park, home to the [[T\u00edr Chonaill Gaels]] [[Gaelic Football]] club.\n\n== Irish in Britain ==\n===Irish in England===<!-- This section is linked from [[Stoke Newington]] -->\nIn 2001, there were 674,786 people in England (1.4 per cent of the population) who had been born in Ireland. This is the greatest concentration of Irish-born\u2014as distinct from persons of Irish ancestry\u2014abroad anywhere in the world and was equivalent to 12.1% of the population of the island of Ireland (5.6 million) in 2001.\n\n====Sports teams====\n{{Original research section|date=July 2016}}\nSports teams with links to the Irish community exist in England, although this is not as marked as in Scotland.\n\nIn football, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]],   [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Leeds United]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] have a tradition of representing the Irish communities in their area {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} although unlike many clubs in Scotland they were not formed on the basis of representing the Irish community. For example, Arsenal has featured ethnically Irish players such as [[Liam Brady]], [[Terry Neill]], [[Pat Rice]], [[Niall Quinn]], [[David O'Leary]] and [[Graham Barrett]]. Aston Villa has featured many Irish players such as [[Steve Staunton]], [[Paul McGrath (footballer)|Paul McGrath]], [[Richard Dunne]] and former managers [[David O'Leary]] and [[Martin O'Neill]]. Aston Villa has a large Irish following in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] which has the highest proportion of Irish people in England. Both Everton and Liverpool have roots in a [[Methodist church]] but [[Everton F.C.]] was often described as Liverpool's [[Irish Catholic]] team, probably because Everton had a number of Irish internationals in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} [[Liverpool F.C.]] was formed by a prominent [[Orange Order|Orangeman]] but this fact did not deter Liverpool people from a Catholic background supporting the team. Everton has notably produced [[Wayne Rooney]] who is of Irish descent and have recently featured promising Irish international [[S\u00e9amus Coleman]]; as were prominent Liverpool players who were Everton fans in their youth such as [[Jamie Carragher]] and [[Steve McManaman]]. Recently [[Jonjo Shelvey]] has become the latest in a line of Liverpool players with Irish heritage, going back to the days of [[Mark Lawrenson]], [[Ronnie Whelan]] and [[Ray Houghton]]. Neither [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] nor [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] have a [[sectarian]] affiliation and many families are split in support of the clubs.\nWith the managership of [[Matt Busby|Sir Matt Busby]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] also emerged as a club with a considerable Irish following both in Great Britain and in Ireland itself as well as having notable Irish stars like [[George Best]], [[Norman Whiteside]], [[Mal Donaghy]], [[Denis Irwin]], [[Roy Keane]], and recently [[John O'Shea]].\n\nIn [[Rugby league]], [[Dewsbury Celtic]] represented the large Irish community in [[Dewsbury]], and [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] represent communities in [[Merseyside]]. The rugby union club [[London Irish]] represents the community in London. There is also a [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] Londain (London in [[Irish language|Irish]]) team representing the GAA clubs in London, that plays in the [[Connacht]] province (in [[Gaelic football]]) and [[Ulster]] (in [[hurling]]) (see [[London GAA]]).\n\n====Barrow-in-Furness====\nDuring the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 19th Century, Barrow-in-Furness was seen as a desirable location that many Irish (along with Scottish and Cornish) fled to. This was in part due to ease of access to reach the town's port from Ireland (particularly from [[Ulster]]), and secondly because it was a booming town as a result of the Industrial Revolution with guaranteed work, particularly in the emerging steelworks and shipbuilding industries in the town. At its peak, it was estimated that somewhere between 7-11% of Barrow's population were Irish or Scottish.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cultureconflictm00macr_0|url-access=registration|title=Culture, Conflict, and Migration: The Irish in Victorian Cumbria|first=Donald M.|last=MacRaild|date=10 January 1998|publisher=Liverpool University Press|accessdate=10 January 2018|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780853236528}}</ref> As a result of this, to this day a huge number of Barrow's population are of Irish descent.\n\n====Birmingham====\n[[Birmingham]] has a large Irish community, dating back to the [[Industrial Revolution]], it is estimated that Birmingham has the largest Irish population per capita in Britain. [[Digbeth]] is the traditional Irish area in Birmingham. During the 1950s [[Sparkbrook]] and [[Sparkhill]] were the main Irish areas. Today many Irish people live in areas such as [[Hall Green]] and [[Solihull]]. Birmingham has the UK's largest [[St Patricks Day]]'s Parade (and the world's third biggest) and Britain's only 'Irish Quarter', with many traditional [[Irish pub]]s and the Birmingham Irish centre. Irish people have always moved to Birmingham for work especially for the construction, factory and industrial work which the city had to offer. Many Irish people moved to Birmingham to build [[canal]]s, [[road]]s and [[railway]]s in the city's industrial past. It is estimated a significant percentage of people from Birmingham have Irish ancestry. [[St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham|St Chad's Cathedral]] is one of only two of the minor Basilicas in the UK. It is very important as the first Catholic church built in Britain after the [[English Reformation]], and was designed by the architect [[Augustus Pugin]].\n\nCommunity relations for the Irish in Birmingham were complicated by the [[Birmingham pub bombings|pub bombings of November 1974]], At inquests into the deaths of the 21 victims, \"Witness O\" named the men responsible as Seamus McLoughlin, Mick Murray, Michael Hayes and James Gavin. He said he had been given permission to reveal the names by the current head of the IRA in Dublin.[[Provisional IRA]].  There were very limited physical attacks on Irish people in the aftermath of the bombings.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Birmingham pub bombings: 'My Irish father was attacked by friends' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-birmingham-46242612/birmingham-pub-bombings-my-irish-father-was-attacked-by-friends |work=BBC |location=Birmingham & Black Country |date=17 November 2018 |access-date=30 November 2018 }} </ref>  In November 2018, Birmingham's Irish Association revealed a memorial to those killed outside [[Birmingham New Street Station]].<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Birmingham pub bombings memorial offers 'peace and hope' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-46289920 |work=BBC |location=Birmingham & Black Country |date=21 November 2018 |access-date=30 November 2018 }} </ref>\n\n====Bolton====\nA large number settled here in the 1950s as work was scarce at home, especially in the South. Many found work in the mills and factories and encouraged other family members to come over as there were jobs waiting for them.\n\n====Bradford====\nBradford largely expanded into the city it is today during the 19th Century, due to jobs in the newly built textile mills attracting many immigrants in dire need of work. The population increase, in fact, saw Bradford go from a small town of 6000 in 1801, to 103,000 by 1851 according to records taken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/bradford.html|title=A History of Bradford|website=Localhistories.org|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> Many of these newly arriving people were Irish escaping the Great Famine, and could easily take advantage of all the work Bradford had on offer due to the ease to reach there from Ireland. J B Hammond once commented on this, saying of the distance from Ireland to Yorkshire, \"It was easier to reach Yorkshire from Ireland than from Norfolk or Dorset\u2026 Labourers who were sent to Lancashire were taken to London, put on a boat of Pickfords\u2026carried to Manchester in four or five days at a cost of fourteen shillings. But an Irishman could cross to Liverpool in fourteen hours for two shillings and sixpence\". In 1851, records showed that Bradford had the highest proportion of Irish-born people in Yorkshire at the time.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/content/articles/2006/05/12/bradford_irish_katie_feature.shtml|title=BBC - Bradford and West Yorkshire - Around West Yorkshire - Against the odds?|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> In Donald M. MacRaid's book \"Irish Migration in Modern Britain\", he comments on research showing that a large number of Bradford's Irish originally came from [[County Mayo]], [[County Sligo]], [[County Dublin]], and [[County Laois]], with records also suggesting that there was a common migration trail at the time from [[County Roscommon]] to Bradford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlmayo2/irish_bradford_yorkshire.html|title=RootsWeb.com Home Page|website=Rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> Many of the Irish from Mayo and Sligo originated from a rural background, and at first struggled to adapt to urban life in Bradford.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> To this day, many residents of Bradford and the surrounding area are of Irish descent.\n\nThere was an Irish Diaspora Research Unit at the University of Bradford in the early 21st Century under Dr. Patrick O'Sullivan, but the Unit did not continue after he moved to New York University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arch.oucs.ox.ac.uk/detail/94844/index.html|title=(ARCH) Irish diaspora studies|website=arch.oucs.ox.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Braintree, Essex====\nIn the 1950s many thousands of Irish migrated to Braintree in Essex to meet the demands of the labour shortage primarily in the Courtauld's textile mills, both in Braintree and nearby Halstead. They also helped meet the need for labour both in Critall's main Braintree factory, and it secondary factory in nearby Witham.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n====Coventry====\nCoventry had a large influx of Irish from around the middle of the 20th Century, when the city's motor industry was booming. To this day, Coventry remains one of the cities in the UK with a higher Irish population, and retains strong Irish links. The city council put the town's Irish population at 2.3% in 2009, higher than the UK national average of 1%, and additionally the Coventry Irish Society estimated that around 10% of the city's population are of Irish descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-26977052|title=Coventry's lure to Ireland president|first=David|last=Lumb|date=11 April 2014|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Gateshead====\nDuring the 19th Century, many of the towns in [[County Durham]] (the county [[Gateshead]] historically belonged to), which before that point had mostly been a rural county, began to take advantage of emerging new technology and discovered resources in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. This not only changed the face of the county, urbanizing much of it, but also led to expansion on a massive scale. People from all over the United Kingdom, ranging from the south of England to Ireland, moved to the area to take advantage of the large amount of work that these industries brought in roles such as coal mining and shipbuilding. As in many other instances around this time, it was the potato famine which caused many from Ireland in particular to be drawn to jobs in the County Durham area, and make the move. A further advantage was that the county was quite straightforward to reach from Ireland, due to easy access by rail to there from the western port of [[Whitehaven]], itself easily accessible by ferry from Ireland itself (in particular, Ulster). Gateshead in particular was one of the towns that changed most significantly due to the events of Industrial Revolution, but moreover took in one of the largest numbers of Irish of all the County Durham towns. In 1871, the town was recorded as having the densest number of Irish-born in County Durham, at 6.7%, and a year later it was recorded that 1 in 4 people in the town were Irish. The town also went through a huge population increase, rising by approximately 100,000 people over the course of the 19th Century which the Irish undeniably contributed to. To this day, many people in the town are of Irish descent.<ref name=\"etheses.dur.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1907/1/1907.pdf?EThOS%20(BL)|format=PDF|title=The Irish in County Durham and Newcastle c.1840-1880|author=Cooter, Roger|website=Etheses.dur.ac.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Halifax====\nSimilarly to Bradford, Halifax was a desirable location for Irish escaping the Great Famine due to ease of access to reach, and the fact that its growth into an industrial boomtown over the 19th Century coincided with the time of the famine. Many of the jobs on offer in Halifax were in newly opened cotton spinning mills, opened as a result of taking advantage of technological innovation in the then emerging textile industry. There were said to be as many as 24 mills in the town by 1850. The Irish contributed to its population growth from around 9000 in 1800, to 25000 by the middle of the century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/wtw/timeline/1810-1850/1810-1850-1.html|title=Calderdale history timeline: 1810 - 1850AD: From weaver to web|first=Calderdale Libraries, Northgate, Halifax, West Yorkshire|last=England|website=Calderdale.gov.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> In 1872, records showed that the Irish numbered \"from a sixth to an eighth of the population\" in Halifax, with it also being noted that \"the political strength of the Irish people in Halifax is considerable\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vItRDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=Irish+in+Rochdale#v=onepage&q=Halifax&f=false|title=A Survey of the Irish in England (1872)|first=Alan|last=O'Day|date=1 July 1993|page=79|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9780826422941}}</ref> Irish heritage still lives on in Halifax through the likes of the town's football team, ''Halifax Irish F.C.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/hxirishclub|title=Halifax Irish Football Club|website=Pitchero.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Heywood====\nAs [[Heywood, Greater Manchester|Heywood]] developed into a mill town during the Industrial Revolution, this brought a large number of new residents to the town, including many Irish escaping the potato famine. Additionally, many Irish migrants took up jobs in the area working as '[[Navvy|navvies]]' on the local railway, a fact that still lives on in the town's legacy as some say that these navvies may have been the influence behind Heywood's nickname, 'Monkey Town'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitrochdale.com/about-the-area/heywood|title=Heywood - Visit Rochdale|website=Visitrochdale.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Jarrow====\nAlso situated in County Durham, the story behind why many Irish moved to Jarrow is similar to that of Gateshead. Shipbuilding, in particular, drew many of them to Jarrow. The town to this day is still sometimes nicknamed 'Little Ireland', and has a large Catholic community, as a result of the sheer number of Irish who moved there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/the-irish-community-s-impact-on-south-tyneside-1-1288157|title=The Irish community's impact on South Tyneside|website=Shieldsgazette.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Keighley====\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, Keighley flourished in the textile and weaving industries, which encouraged many Irish fleeing the potato famine and looking for work to move there. This resulted in a significant Irish community, and to this day the town still has a large number of inhabitants of Irish descent. The Irish redefined aspects of Keighley as a town significantly. It was once commented that the (then fairly new) Irish community in Keighley \"contributed more to the Home-Rule than [in] either of the populous towns of Glasgow or Liverpool\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jygdBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA132&lpg=PA132&dq=Irish+in+Keighley#v=onepage&q=Irish+in+Keighley&f=false|title=The Irish Diaspora in Britain, 1750-1939|first=Donald M.|last=MacRaild|date=24 November 2010|page=132|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|via=Google Books|isbn=9781137268037}}</ref> The influence of the Irish also led to there being a large Catholic community in Keighley, which has lived on in both Catholic churches and schools that exist in the town today.\n\n====Leeds====\nThere is an Irish community in Leeds, although it is generally smaller than in other large cities in Britain.  The Leeds Irish Centre is on York Road on the east side of the city.  The nearby area of [[East End Park, Leeds|East End Park]] is the area most associated with Leeds's Irish community.  In the years after the Famine, 3.3% of Leeds's population was Irish-born.  There was a particular concentration of migrants from the Irish county of [[County Mayo|Mayo]].  A book on the subject of migration from Ireland to Leeds in the 20th Century was published in 2010: ''Taking The Boat: The Irish in Leeds, 1931-81''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2010/06/04/book-review-taking-the-boat-the-irish-in-leeds-1931-81-brendan-mcgowan/#.WnW9QCXFKM8|title=Book Review ~ Taking The Boat: The Irish in Leeds, 1931-81 ~ Brendan McGowan |last=Eoin |first=Purcell |date=2010 |website=The Irish Story |access-date=3 February 2018 }}</ref>\n\n====Liverpool====\n[[Liverpool]] is widely known for having the strongest Irish heritage of any UK city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1372 |title=Culture and Ethnicity Differences in Liverpool \u2013 European Communities |publisher=Chambr\u00e9 Hardman Trust |accessdate=6 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110073826/http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1372 |archivedate=10 January 2009  }}</ref> This originates from [[Liverpool docks|the city's port]] being close to Ireland, which made it easy to reach for all those escaping the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] between 1845 and 1849.

It has been estimated that around 35% of [[Manchester]]'s population has some Irish ancestry. As in Liverpool, city residents of Irish heritage have been influential in the music industry. All four members of [[the Smiths]] had Irish roots, as do the Gallagher brothers of the band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].

Unlike many other towns in England at the time, Middlesbrough showed no signs of sectarianism or segregation within the various communities that lived alongside each other, there were no \"Irish quarters\"<ref>[http://www.slideshare.net/mrudigawa/middlesbrough ''Middlesbrough - A study into Irish immigration and influence on the Middlesbrough dialect''], Barbara Fennell, Mark J. Jones & Carmen Llamas, Slideshare.net</ref> and the many Irish that settled in Middlesbrough integrated into their adopted home. This was most likely as a result of the town's infancy, it was essentially a migrant town. Although the number of Irish born currently residing in Middlesbrough may not be as substantial as it once was, Middlesbrough retains a strong Irish connection and heritage through the ancestry of many residents.\n\n====Sunderland====\nSunderland was another place in County Durham that many Irish escaping the famine saw as desirable. Once dubbed \"the largest shipbuilding town in the world\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/ship-building/background.shtml|title=BBC - Nation on Film - Shipbuilding - Background|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> the city largely expanded into what it is today as a result of the number of people this work, and the demand for manual labour in other local jobs such as coal mining and chemical works,<ref name=\"etheses.dur.ac.uk\"/> encouraged to move there.

Thousands passed through the town to move on to work for themselves elsewhere in England, such as the aforementioned County Durham, however many also stayed in the area and many people in the town still have Irish heritage today.\n\n====Widnes====\nWidnes became a boom town during the Industrial Revolution, having a successful chemical industry brought on by a factory opened in the town in 1847, which led to many Irish workers (among others from Wales, Poland and Lithuania) moving there for work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolcityregion.uk/the-history-of-halton.html|title=The History of Halton - Liverpool City Region - Liverpool - Wirral - Sefton - St.Helens - Knowsley - Halton|website=Liverpoolcityregion.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> Further making Widnes advantageous for the Irish to move to was its close proximity to Liverpool.

As well as this, Wolverhampton had a longstanding Roman Catholic community from as early as the 18th Century, leading to the city sometimes being nicknamed 'Little Rome', which began to attract Irish to the city from an early stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/people/migration/irish|title=Irish Migrants|first=Richard|last=Inman|date=13 January 2006|website=Wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Irish in Scotland===\nThere are long standing migration links between [[Scotland]] and the [[Province]] of [[Ulster]], especially between [[County Donegal]], [[County Antrim]] and [[County Down]] with the west coast of Scotland. Considering the [[Dal Riada]] kingdoms and the [[gaelicisation]] of Scotland in the early [[Middle Ages]], it is difficult to determine how many Scots have genetic ancestry from Ireland historically or how many were [[Picts]] who adopted Irish lifestyles, although the general consensus is that both happened as Pictish culture vanished by the 11th century. In 2001, around 55,000 people in [[Scotland]] (1.1 per cent of the Scottish population) had been born in [[Ireland]], while people of [[Irish people|Irish]] (either [[Protestant]] or [[Catholic]]) ancestry make up 20% of the Scottish population. [[Scotland]] has a greater number of persons born in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[County Donegal]] (0.66 per cent) than in the rest of the [[Republic of Ireland]] (0.43%).

[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] are overwhelmingly, though not exclusively, supported by people from a Catholic background. [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] were formed as clubs representing Irish Catholics, however there is little vestige of these founding values today. Teams such as [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] (though founded before Dundee United on entirely secular grounds), [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] and [[Lanarkshire]] teams such as [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] and [[Airdrieonians F.C.|Airdrie]] are contentiously perceived by some as [[Protestant]] clubs. [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] are seen as having retained a [[Protestant]] identity, despite signing a number of Catholic players since the 1980s.\n\nToday a very small minority of the Irish [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] community in [[Scotland]] take part in [[Irish republican]] marches (mainly in [[Strathclyde]]) though these marches do not have exclusively Catholics in attendance with many Protestants and others of various faiths or none involved,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/17888117.glasgows-irish-republican-marches-marred-paedo-scum-chants-loyalist-protesters/|title=Chaotic scene at Glasgow's Irish Republican marches|website=Glasgow Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/18040684.policing-irish-republican-marches-glasgow-cost-150k-loyalist-parades/|title=Policing Irish Republican marches in Glasgow cost \u00a3150k more than Loyalist parades|website=Glasgow Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> and the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] has a large membership in [[Scotland]], predominantly in [[Glasgow]], [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Ayrshire]].

There has been a continuous movement of people between the islands of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]] due to their proximity. This tide has ebbed and flowed in response to politics, economics and social conditions of both places. Ireland was a feudal [[Lordship of Ireland|Lordship]] of the [[List of English monarchs|Kings of England]] between 1171 and 1541; a [[Kingdom of Ireland|Kingdom]] in [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] between 1542 and 1801; and politically united with Great Britain as the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] between 1801 and 1922. Today, Ireland is divided between the independent [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], a constituent of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nToday, millions of residents of Great Britain are either from Ireland or have Irish ancestry. It is estimated that as many as six million people living in the UK have at least one Irish grandparent (around 10% of the UK population).<ref name=accordingtotheGuardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/13/britishidentity.travelnews|title=More Britons applying for Irish passports|first1=Owen|last1=Bowcott|first2=Ireland|last2=correspondent|date=13 September 2006|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Irish diaspora]] ({{lang-ga|Diasp\u00f3ra na nGael}}) refers to [[Irish people]] and their descendants who live outside [[Ireland]]. This article refers to those who reside in Great Britain, the largest island and principal territory of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==Medieval era==\nDuring the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], significant Irish settlement of western Britain took place. The 'traditional' view is that [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic language]] and culture was brought to [[Scotland]], probably in the 4th century, by settlers from Ireland,  who founded the Gaelic kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] on Scotland's west coast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Charles|title=The Edinburgh history of the Scots language|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1997|page=551|isbn=978-0-7486-0754-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Nora Kershaw Chadwick|first=Myles Dyllon|title=The Celtic Realms|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=1972|page=66|isbn=978-0-7607-4284-6}}</ref> This is based mostly on medieval writings from the 9th and 10th centuries. However, recently some archeologists have argued against this view, saying that there is no archeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites.<ref name=ewancampbell>Campbell, Ewan. \"[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/articles/scotsirish.htm Were the Scots Irish?]\" in ''Antiquity'' #75 (2001).</ref> Due to the growth of D\u00e1l Riata, in both size and influence, Scotland became almost wholly Gaelic-speaking until Northumbrian English began to replace Gaelic in the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]]. [[Scottish Gaelic]] remained the dominant language of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] into the 19th century, but has since declined.\n\nBefore and during the [[Gregorian mission]] of 596 AD, Irish Christians such as [[Columba]] (521\u201397), [[Buriana]], [[Diuma]], [[Ceollach]], [[Saint Machar]], [[Saint Cathan]], [[Saint Blane]], [[Jaruman]], [[Wyllow]], [[Kessog]], [[St Govan]], [[Donn\u00e1n of Eigg]], [[Foillan]] and [[Saint Fursey]] began the conversion of the English and Pictish peoples. [[Modwenna]] and others were significant in the following century.\n\nSome English monarchs, such as [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] (c. 612 \u2013 15 February 670), [[Aldfrith]] (died 704 or 705) and [[Harold Godwinson]] (died 1066) were either raised in or sought refuge in Ireland, as did Welsh rulers such as [[Gruffudd ap Cynan]]. [[Alfred the Great]] may have spent some of his childhood in Ireland.\n\nIn the year 902 Vikings who had been forced out of Ireland were given permission by the English to settle in [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], in the north west of England. An Irish historical record known as \"The Three Fragments\" refers to a distinct group of settlers living among these Vikings as \"Irishmen\". Further evidence of this Irish migration to Wirral comes from the name of the village of [[Irby, Merseyside|Irby]] in Wirral, which means \"settlement of the Irish\", and St Bridget's church, which is known to have been founded by \"Vikings from Ireland\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saintpatrickscrossliverpool.webs.com/|title=Saint Patrick's Cross Liverpool|website=Saint Patrick's Cross Liverpool}}</ref>\n\nIrish people who made Britain their home in the later medieval era included [[Aoife MacMurrough]], Princess of Leinster (1145\u201388), the poet [[Muireadhach Albanach]] (fl. 1213), the lawyer [[William of Drogheada]] (died 1245), [[M\u00e1el Muire \u00d3 Lacht\u00e1in]] (died 1249), [[Malachias Hibernicus]] (fl. 1279\u20131300), [[Gilbert \u00d3 Tigernaig]] (died 1323), Diarmait MacCairbre (executed 1490) and [[Germyn Lynch]] (fl. 1441\u20131483), all of whom made successful lives in the various kingdoms of Britain.\n\n==Sixteenth to eighteenth centuries==\nHistorically, Irish immigrants to the United Kingdom in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were considered over-represented amongst those appearing in court. However, research suggests that policing strategy may have put immigrants at a disadvantage by targeting only the most public forms of crime, while locals were more likely able to engage in the types of crimes that could be conducted behind locked doors.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = How Criminal were the Irish?

It is estimated that more than one million people died and almost the same again emigrated. A further wave of emigration to England also took place between the 1930s, and 1960s by Irish escaping poor economic conditions following the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]]. This was furthered by the severe labour shortage in Britain during the mid-20th century, which depended largely on Irish immigrants to work in the areas of construction and domestic labour. The extent of the Irish contribution to Britain's construction industry in the 20th century may be gauged from Sir William MacAlpine's 1998 assertion that the contribution of the Irish to the success of his industry had been 'immeasurable'.\n\nIreland's population fell from more than 8 million to just 6.5 million between 1841 and 1851. A century later it had dropped to 4.3 million. By the late 19th century, emigration was heaviest from Ireland's most rural southern and western counties. [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Mayo|Mayo]], [[County Sligo|Sligo]], [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] and [[County Limerick|Limerick]] alone provided nearly half of Ireland's emigrants. Some of this movement was temporary, made up of seasonal harvest labourers working in Britain and returning home for winter and spring. By the mid-1930s, Great Britain was the choice of many who had to leave Ireland. Britain's wartime economy (1939\u201345) and post-war boom attracted many Irish people to expanding cities and towns such as [[London]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Luton]]. Prior to the 2000s financial crisis, ongoing [[The Troubles|sectarian violence]] and its economic aftermath was another major factor for immigration.\n\nAccording to the [[UK 2001 Census]], white Irish-born residents make up 1.2% of those living in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/commentaries/ethnicity.asp|title=2011 Census - Office for National Statistics|website=Statistics.gov.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> In 1997, the [[Irish Government]] in its ''White Paper on Foreign Policy'' claimed that there were around two million Irish citizens living in Britain, the majority of them British-born. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The 2001 Census also showed that Irish people are more likely to be employed in managerial or professional occupations than those classed as \"White British\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=463 |title=Employment Patterns |publisher=ONS |accessdate=10 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501051546/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=463 |archivedate= 1 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|Irish financial crisis]], emigration from Ireland has risen significantly.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/ireland-business-blog-with-lisa-ocarroll/2011/jan/20/ireland-emigration-australia|title=Irish emigration worse than 1980s|first=Lisa|last=O'Carroll|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref> Data published in June 2011 showed that Irish emigration to Britain had risen by 25 per cent to 13,920 in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/0614/1224298865280.html|title=Emigration to Britain up 25% to almost 14,000, data reveals|first=Jamie|last=Smyth|work=The Irish Times|date=14 June 2011|accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nSome notable people born in Ireland who settled in Great Britain in the 19th century:\n\n* [[Oscar Wilde]], (1854{{spaced ndash}}1900)\n\n==London Irish==\n[[File:Forgotten Irish of London memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial to the \"Forgotten Irish\" of London, Church of the Sacred Heart, [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]].]]\nThe term 'London Irish' relates to people born in London of Irish descent. London has Great Britain's biggest Irish population and there was a particularly big community in the (affectionately known) [[Kilburn, London|'County Kilburn']] area of northwest [[London]].  With urban [[gentrification]] and higher housing costs, many of London's [[working-class]] [[Irish-Catholic]] community have moved further out from [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] to [[Cricklewood]].  \n\nAnother large Irish community was in the [[Archway, London|Archway]] area, where many Irish \"[[navvies]]\" came to work in building railways and roads from the 1830s onwards.<ref name=Archway>{{cite news |last=Finch |first=Emily |date=8 December 2017 |title=Navigator Square \u2013 built on the pluck of the Irish |url=http://camdennewjournal.com/article/navigator-square-built-on-the-pluck-of-the-irish|work=Camden New Journal |location=London |access-date=17 March 2018 }}</ref>  The community grew larger throughout the Famine years and then again after the [[Second World War]] when the [[Whittington Hospital]] in Archway recruited nurses from Ireland.<ref name=Archway/> This area became associated with Irish political activism with the election of [[Michael O'Halloran (British politician)|Michael O'Halloran]] as MP for [[Islington North]] in 1969.

The Irish Cultural Centre is located in [[Hammersmith]], West London. [[Greenford]] in the [[London Borough of Ealing]] is home to a large Irish community and contains Tir Chonaill Park, home to the [[T\u00edr Chonaill Gaels]] [[Gaelic Football]] club.\n\n== Irish in Britain ==\n===Irish in England===<!-- This section is linked from [[Stoke Newington]] -->\nIn 2001, there were 674,786 people in England (1.4 per cent of the population) who had been born in Ireland. This is the greatest concentration of Irish-born\u2014as distinct from persons of Irish ancestry\u2014abroad anywhere in the world and was equivalent to 12.1% of the population of the island of Ireland (5.6 million) in 2001.\n\n====Sports teams====\n{{Original research section|date=July 2016}}\nSports teams with links to the Irish community exist in England, although this is not as marked as in Scotland.\n\nIn football, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]],   [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Leeds United]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] have a tradition of representing the Irish communities in their area {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} although unlike many clubs in Scotland they were not formed on the basis of representing the Irish community. For example, Arsenal has featured ethnically Irish players such as [[Liam Brady]], [[Terry Neill]], [[Pat Rice]], [[Niall Quinn]], [[David O'Leary]] and [[Graham Barrett]]. Aston Villa has featured many Irish players such as [[Steve Staunton]], [[Paul McGrath (footballer)|Paul McGrath]], [[Richard Dunne]] and former managers [[David O'Leary]] and [[Martin O'Neill]]. Aston Villa has a large Irish following in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] which has the highest proportion of Irish people in England. Both Everton and Liverpool have roots in a [[Methodist church]] but [[Everton F.C.]] was often described as Liverpool's [[Irish Catholic]] team, probably because Everton had a number of Irish internationals in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} [[Liverpool F.C.]] was formed by a prominent [[Orange Order|Orangeman]] but this fact did not deter Liverpool people from a Catholic background supporting the team. Everton has notably produced [[Wayne Rooney]] who is of Irish descent and have recently featured promising Irish international [[S\u00e9amus Coleman]]; as were prominent Liverpool players who were Everton fans in their youth such as [[Jamie Carragher]] and [[Steve McManaman]]. Recently [[Jonjo Shelvey]] has become the latest in a line of Liverpool players with Irish heritage, going back to the days of [[Mark Lawrenson]], [[Ronnie Whelan]] and [[Ray Houghton]]. Neither [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] nor [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] have a [[sectarian]] affiliation and many families are split in support of the clubs.\nWith the managership of [[Matt Busby|Sir Matt Busby]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] also emerged as a club with a considerable Irish following both in Great Britain and in Ireland itself as well as having notable Irish stars like [[George Best]], [[Norman Whiteside]], [[Mal Donaghy]], [[Denis Irwin]], [[Roy Keane]], and recently [[John O'Shea]].\n\nIn [[Rugby league]], [[Dewsbury Celtic]] represented the large Irish community in [[Dewsbury]], and [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] represent communities in [[Merseyside]]. The rugby union club [[London Irish]] represents the community in London. There is also a [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] Londain (London in [[Irish language|Irish]]) team representing the GAA clubs in London, that plays in the [[Connacht]] province (in [[Gaelic football]]) and [[Ulster]] (in [[hurling]]) (see [[London GAA]]).\n\n====Barrow-in-Furness====\nDuring the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 19th Century, Barrow-in-Furness was seen as a desirable location that many Irish (along with Scottish and Cornish) fled to. This was in part due to ease of access to reach the town's port from Ireland (particularly from [[Ulster]]), and secondly because it was a booming town as a result of the Industrial Revolution with guaranteed work, particularly in the emerging steelworks and shipbuilding industries in the town. At its peak, it was estimated that somewhere between 7-11% of Barrow's population were Irish or Scottish.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cultureconflictm00macr_0|url-access=registration|title=Culture, Conflict, and Migration: The Irish in Victorian Cumbria|first=Donald M.|last=MacRaild|date=10 January 1998|publisher=Liverpool University Press|accessdate=10 January 2018|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780853236528}}</ref> As a result of this, to this day a huge number of Barrow's population are of Irish descent.\n\n====Birmingham====\n[[Birmingham]] has a large Irish community, dating back to the [[Industrial Revolution]], it is estimated that Birmingham has the largest Irish population per capita in Britain. [[Digbeth]] is the traditional Irish area in Birmingham. During the 1950s [[Sparkbrook]] and [[Sparkhill]] were the main Irish areas. Today many Irish people live in areas such as [[Hall Green]] and [[Solihull]]. Birmingham has the UK's largest [[St Patricks Day]]'s Parade (and the world's third biggest) and Britain's only 'Irish Quarter', with many traditional [[Irish pub]]s and the Birmingham Irish centre. Irish people have always moved to Birmingham for work especially for the construction, factory and industrial work which the city had to offer. Many Irish people moved to Birmingham to build [[canal]]s, [[road]]s and [[railway]]s in the city's industrial past. It is estimated a significant percentage of people from Birmingham have Irish ancestry. [[St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham|St Chad's Cathedral]] is one of only two of the minor Basilicas in the UK. It is very important as the first Catholic church built in Britain after the [[English Reformation]], and was designed by the architect [[Augustus Pugin]].\n\nCommunity relations for the Irish in Birmingham were complicated by the [[Birmingham pub bombings|pub bombings of November 1974]], At inquests into the deaths of the 21 victims, \"Witness O\" named the men responsible as Seamus McLoughlin, Mick Murray, Michael Hayes and James Gavin. He said he had been given permission to reveal the names by the current head of the IRA in Dublin.[[Provisional IRA]].  There were very limited physical attacks on Irish people in the aftermath of the bombings.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Birmingham pub bombings: 'My Irish father was attacked by friends' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-birmingham-46242612/birmingham-pub-bombings-my-irish-father-was-attacked-by-friends |work=BBC |location=Birmingham & Black Country |date=17 November 2018 |access-date=30 November 2018 }} </ref>  In November 2018, Birmingham's Irish Association revealed a memorial to those killed outside [[Birmingham New Street Station]].<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Birmingham pub bombings memorial offers 'peace and hope' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-46289920 |work=BBC |location=Birmingham & Black Country |date=21 November 2018 |access-date=30 November 2018 }} </ref>\n\n====Bolton====\nA large number settled here in the 1950s as work was scarce at home, especially in the South. Many found work in the mills and factories and encouraged other family members to come over as there were jobs waiting for them.\n\n====Bradford====\nBradford largely expanded into the city it is today during the 19th Century, due to jobs in the newly built textile mills attracting many immigrants in dire need of work. The population increase, in fact, saw Bradford go from a small town of 6000 in 1801, to 103,000 by 1851 according to records taken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/bradford.html|title=A History of Bradford|website=Localhistories.org|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> Many of these newly arriving people were Irish escaping the Great Famine, and could easily take advantage of all the work Bradford had on offer due to the ease to reach there from Ireland. J B Hammond once commented on this, saying of the distance from Ireland to Yorkshire, \"It was easier to reach Yorkshire from Ireland than from Norfolk or Dorset\u2026 Labourers who were sent to Lancashire were taken to London, put on a boat of Pickfords\u2026carried to Manchester in four or five days at a cost of fourteen shillings. But an Irishman could cross to Liverpool in fourteen hours for two shillings and sixpence\". In 1851, records showed that Bradford had the highest proportion of Irish-born people in Yorkshire at the time.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/content/articles/2006/05/12/bradford_irish_katie_feature.shtml|title=BBC - Bradford and West Yorkshire - Around West Yorkshire - Against the odds?|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> In Donald M. MacRaid's book \"Irish Migration in Modern Britain\", he comments on research showing that a large number of Bradford's Irish originally came from [[County Mayo]], [[County Sligo]], [[County Dublin]], and [[County Laois]], with records also suggesting that there was a common migration trail at the time from [[County Roscommon]] to Bradford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlmayo2/irish_bradford_yorkshire.html|title=RootsWeb.com Home Page|website=Rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> Many of the Irish from Mayo and Sligo originated from a rural background, and at first struggled to adapt to urban life in Bradford.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> To this day, many residents of Bradford and the surrounding area are of Irish descent.\n\nThere was an Irish Diaspora Research Unit at the University of Bradford in the early 21st Century under Dr. Patrick O'Sullivan, but the Unit did not continue after he moved to New York University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arch.oucs.ox.ac.uk/detail/94844/index.html|title=(ARCH) Irish diaspora studies|website=arch.oucs.ox.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Braintree, Essex====\nIn the 1950s many thousands of Irish migrated to Braintree in Essex to meet the demands of the labour shortage primarily in the Courtauld's textile mills, both in Braintree and nearby Halstead. They also helped meet the need for labour both in Critall's main Braintree factory, and it secondary factory in nearby Witham.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n====Coventry====\nCoventry had a large influx of Irish from around the middle of the 20th Century, when the city's motor industry was booming. To this day, Coventry remains one of the cities in the UK with a higher Irish population, and retains strong Irish links. The city council put the town's Irish population at 2.3% in 2009, higher than the UK national average of 1%, and additionally the Coventry Irish Society estimated that around 10% of the city's population are of Irish descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-26977052|title=Coventry's lure to Ireland president|first=David|last=Lumb|date=11 April 2014|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Gateshead====\nDuring the 19th Century, many of the towns in [[County Durham]] (the county [[Gateshead]] historically belonged to), which before that point had mostly been a rural county, began to take advantage of emerging new technology and discovered resources in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. This not only changed the face of the county, urbanizing much of it, but also led to expansion on a massive scale. People from all over the United Kingdom, ranging from the south of England to Ireland, moved to the area to take advantage of the large amount of work that these industries brought in roles such as coal mining and shipbuilding. As in many other instances around this time, it was the potato famine which caused many from Ireland in particular to be drawn to jobs in the County Durham area, and make the move. A further advantage was that the county was quite straightforward to reach from Ireland, due to easy access by rail to there from the western port of [[Whitehaven]], itself easily accessible by ferry from Ireland itself (in particular, Ulster). Gateshead in particular was one of the towns that changed most significantly due to the events of Industrial Revolution, but moreover took in one of the largest numbers of Irish of all the County Durham towns. In 1871, the town was recorded as having the densest number of Irish-born in County Durham, at 6.7%, and a year later it was recorded that 1 in 4 people in the town were Irish. The town also went through a huge population increase, rising by approximately 100,000 people over the course of the 19th Century which the Irish undeniably contributed to. To this day, many people in the town are of Irish descent.<ref name=\"etheses.dur.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1907/1/1907.pdf?EThOS%20(BL)|format=PDF|title=The Irish in County Durham and Newcastle c.1840-1880|author=Cooter, Roger|website=Etheses.dur.ac.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Halifax====\nSimilarly to Bradford, Halifax was a desirable location for Irish escaping the Great Famine due to ease of access to reach, and the fact that its growth into an industrial boomtown over the 19th Century coincided with the time of the famine. Many of the jobs on offer in Halifax were in newly opened cotton spinning mills, opened as a result of taking advantage of technological innovation in the then emerging textile industry. There were said to be as many as 24 mills in the town by 1850. The Irish contributed to its population growth from around 9000 in 1800, to 25000 by the middle of the century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/wtw/timeline/1810-1850/1810-1850-1.html|title=Calderdale history timeline: 1810 - 1850AD: From weaver to web|first=Calderdale Libraries, Northgate, Halifax, West Yorkshire|last=England|website=Calderdale.gov.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> In 1872, records showed that the Irish numbered \"from a sixth to an eighth of the population\" in Halifax, with it also being noted that \"the political strength of the Irish people in Halifax is considerable\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vItRDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=Irish+in+Rochdale#v=onepage&q=Halifax&f=false|title=A Survey of the Irish in England (1872)|first=Alan|last=O'Day|date=1 July 1993|page=79|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9780826422941}}</ref> Irish heritage still lives on in Halifax through the likes of the town's football team, ''Halifax Irish F.C.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/hxirishclub|title=Halifax Irish Football Club|website=Pitchero.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Heywood====\nAs [[Heywood, Greater Manchester|Heywood]] developed into a mill town during the Industrial Revolution, this brought a large number of new residents to the town, including many Irish escaping the potato famine. Additionally, many Irish migrants took up jobs in the area working as '[[Navvy|navvies]]' on the local railway, a fact that still lives on in the town's legacy as some say that these navvies may have been the influence behind Heywood's nickname, 'Monkey Town'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitrochdale.com/about-the-area/heywood|title=Heywood - Visit Rochdale|website=Visitrochdale.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Jarrow====\nAlso situated in County Durham, the story behind why many Irish moved to Jarrow is similar to that of Gateshead. Shipbuilding, in particular, drew many of them to Jarrow. The town to this day is still sometimes nicknamed 'Little Ireland', and has a large Catholic community, as a result of the sheer number of Irish who moved there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/the-irish-community-s-impact-on-south-tyneside-1-1288157|title=The Irish community's impact on South Tyneside|website=Shieldsgazette.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Keighley====\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, Keighley flourished in the textile and weaving industries, which encouraged many Irish fleeing the potato famine and looking for work to move there. This resulted in a significant Irish community, and to this day the town still has a large number of inhabitants of Irish descent. The Irish redefined aspects of Keighley as a town significantly. It was once commented that the (then fairly new) Irish community in Keighley \"contributed more to the Home-Rule than [in] either of the populous towns of Glasgow or Liverpool\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jygdBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA132&lpg=PA132&dq=Irish+in+Keighley#v=onepage&q=Irish+in+Keighley&f=false|title=The Irish Diaspora in Britain, 1750-1939|first=Donald M.|last=MacRaild|date=24 November 2010|page=132|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|via=Google Books|isbn=9781137268037}}</ref> The influence of the Irish also led to there being a large Catholic community in Keighley, which has lived on in both Catholic churches and schools that exist in the town today.\n\n====Leeds====\nThere is an Irish community in Leeds, although it is generally smaller than in other large cities in Britain.  The Leeds Irish Centre is on York Road on the east side of the city.  The nearby area of [[East End Park, Leeds|East End Park]] is the area most associated with Leeds's Irish community.  In the years after the Famine, 3.3% of Leeds's population was Irish-born.  There was a particular concentration of migrants from the Irish county of [[County Mayo|Mayo]].  A book on the subject of migration from Ireland to Leeds in the 20th Century was published in 2010: ''Taking The Boat: The Irish in Leeds, 1931-81''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2010/06/04/book-review-taking-the-boat-the-irish-in-leeds-1931-81-brendan-mcgowan/#.WnW9QCXFKM8|title=Book Review ~ Taking The Boat: The Irish in Leeds, 1931-81 ~ Brendan McGowan |last=Eoin |first=Purcell |date=2010 |website=The Irish Story |access-date=3 February 2018 }}</ref>\n\n====Liverpool====\n[[Liverpool]] is widely known for having the strongest Irish heritage of any UK city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1372 |title=Culture and Ethnicity Differences in Liverpool \u2013 European Communities |publisher=Chambr\u00e9 Hardman Trust |accessdate=6 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110073826/http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1372 |archivedate=10 January 2009  }}</ref> This originates from [[Liverpool docks|the city's port]] being close to Ireland, which made it easy to reach for all those escaping the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] between 1845 and 1849.

It has been estimated that around 35% of [[Manchester]]'s population has some Irish ancestry. As in Liverpool, city residents of Irish heritage have been influential in the music industry. All four members of [[the Smiths]] had Irish roots, as do the Gallagher brothers of the band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].

Unlike many other towns in England at the time, Middlesbrough showed no signs of sectarianism or segregation within the various communities that lived alongside each other, there were no \"Irish quarters\"<ref>[http://www.slideshare.net/mrudigawa/middlesbrough ''Middlesbrough - A study into Irish immigration and influence on the Middlesbrough dialect''], Barbara Fennell, Mark J. Jones & Carmen Llamas, Slideshare.net</ref> and the many Irish that settled in Middlesbrough integrated into their adopted home. This was most likely as a result of the town's infancy, it was essentially a migrant town. Although the number of Irish born currently residing in Middlesbrough may not be as substantial as it once was, Middlesbrough retains a strong Irish connection and heritage through the ancestry of many residents.\n\n====Sunderland====\nSunderland was another place in County Durham that many Irish escaping the famine saw as desirable. Once dubbed \"the largest shipbuilding town in the world\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/ship-building/background.shtml|title=BBC - Nation on Film - Shipbuilding - Background|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> the city largely expanded into what it is today as a result of the number of people this work, and the demand for manual labour in other local jobs such as coal mining and chemical works,<ref name=\"etheses.dur.ac.uk\"/> encouraged to move there.

Thousands passed through the town to move on to work for themselves elsewhere in England, such as the aforementioned County Durham, however many also stayed in the area and many people in the town still have Irish heritage today.\n\n====Widnes====\nWidnes became a boom town during the Industrial Revolution, having a successful chemical industry brought on by a factory opened in the town in 1847, which led to many Irish workers (among others from Wales, Poland and Lithuania) moving there for work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolcityregion.uk/the-history-of-halton.html|title=The History of Halton - Liverpool City Region - Liverpool - Wirral - Sefton - St.Helens - Knowsley - Halton|website=Liverpoolcityregion.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> Further making Widnes advantageous for the Irish to move to was its close proximity to Liverpool.

As well as this, Wolverhampton had a longstanding Roman Catholic community from as early as the 18th Century, leading to the city sometimes being nicknamed 'Little Rome', which began to attract Irish to the city from an early stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/people/migration/irish|title=Irish Migrants|first=Richard|last=Inman|date=13 January 2006|website=Wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Irish in Scotland===\nThere are long standing migration links between [[Scotland]] and the [[Province]] of [[Ulster]], especially between [[County Donegal]], [[County Antrim]] and [[County Down]] with the west coast of Scotland. Considering the [[Dal Riada]] kingdoms and the [[gaelicisation]] of Scotland in the early [[Middle Ages]], it is difficult to determine how many Scots have genetic ancestry from Ireland historically or how many were [[Picts]] who adopted Irish lifestyles, although the general consensus is that both happened as Pictish culture vanished by the 11th century. In 2001, around 55,000 people in [[Scotland]] (1.1 per cent of the Scottish population) had been born in [[Ireland]], while people of [[Irish people|Irish]] (either [[Protestant]] or [[Catholic]]) ancestry make up 20% of the Scottish population. [[Scotland]] has a greater number of persons born in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[County Donegal]] (0.66 per cent) than in the rest of the [[Republic of Ireland]] (0.43%).

[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] are overwhelmingly, though not exclusively, supported by people from a Catholic background. [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] were formed as clubs representing Irish Catholics, however there is little vestige of these founding values today. Teams such as [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] (though founded before Dundee United on entirely secular grounds), [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] and [[Lanarkshire]] teams such as [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] and [[Airdrieonians F.C.|Airdrie]] are contentiously perceived by some as [[Protestant]] clubs. [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] are seen as having retained a [[Protestant]] identity, despite signing a number of Catholic players since the 1980s.\n\nToday a very small minority of the Irish [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] community in [[Scotland]] take part in [[Irish republican]] marches (mainly in [[Strathclyde]]) though these marches do not have exclusively Catholics in attendance with many Protestants and others of various faiths or none involved,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/17888117.glasgows-irish-republican-marches-marred-paedo-scum-chants-loyalist-protesters/|title=Chaotic scene at Glasgow's Irish Republican marches|website=Glasgow Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/18040684.policing-irish-republican-marches-glasgow-cost-150k-loyalist-parades/|title=Policing Irish Republican marches in Glasgow cost \u00a3150k more than Loyalist parades|website=Glasgow Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> and the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] has a large membership in [[Scotland]], predominantly in [[Glasgow]], [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Ayrshire]].

[[Incidental music]] for the original production was written by [[Darius Milhaud]].<ref>Jean Anouilh, ''Le Voyageur sans bagage'': Edition de Bernard Beugnot, Gallimard, Paris 2007</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nGaston, a veteran of [[World War I]], suffers from [[amnesia]] and has spent the last 18 years in a hospital trying to regain his memories. Although he's claimed as a son by various families, a rich Duchess believes the true family Gaston belongs to is the Renauds. Gaston travels to the Renauds' estate alongside his lawyer, Huspar. A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate. Gaston has difficulty reconciling his current personality with that of his past. His brother's wife, Valentine (with whom he had an affair during adolescence), tells him about a tiny scar on his shoulder, sustained when Valentine attacked him with a hat pin in a fit of jealousy. Gaston sees this scar in a mirror but doesn't tell Valentine about it. Soon thereafter, numerous families arrive at the Renaud estate, searching for their lost loved one from the war. Gaston spots a young boy. This boy, who is the only surviving member of the Madensales, a family who died in a boating accident when he was an infant, is searching for his long-lost nephew who happens to be much older than himself. Gaston tells the young boy about the scar on his shoulder and fabricates a story about the scar belonging to the boy's long-lost nephew. Gaston leaves the Renauds to become a member of the boy's family, later writing a letter to Jacques' brother Georges, stating that their Jacques is dead and they need not search for him any longer.\n\n==Inspiration and reception==\nInspired by the story of an amnesiac soldier, [[Anthelme Mangin]], who was claimed by over a dozen families,<ref>Jean Yves Le Naour, ''Le Soldat inconnu vivant'', Hachette Litt\u00e9rature, Paris 2002</ref> the play was Anouilh's first major hit with critics and audiences alike. According to biographer Edward Owen Marsh, the playwright enjoyed \"his first financial success in the theatre, when perhaps the poorest theatre-director in Paris, [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]], produced what is generally considered to be one of Anouilh's finest plays, ''Le Voyageur sans bagage''. This production put the seal on his reputation and marked him as one of the most interesting younger dramatists.\"<ref>Edward Owen Marsh, ''Jean Anouilh: Poet of Pierrot and Pantaloon'', WH Allen, London 1953</ref> As ''The Traveller Without Luggage'', the play was first presented in the UK at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre on 3 September 1951, in a translation by Lewis Galantiere.<ref>'London Theatres: Bristol Premiere', ''The Stage'' 1 September 1951</ref> Subsequent translators of the play included the dramatist [[John Whiting]]<ref>Jean Anouilh, translator: John Whiting, ''Traveller Without Luggage'', Methuen, London 1959</ref> and actress [[Lucienne Hill]].<ref>Jean Anouilh, translator: Lucienne Hill, ''Traveller Without Luggage'', in ''Jean Anouilh: The Collected Plays Volume 1'', Methuen, London 1966</ref>\n\n==Original productions==\n\n'''Paris''' \u2013 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Mathurins, 16 February 1937<ref>Jean Anouilh, ''Le Voyageur sans bagage'': Edition de Bernard Beugnot, Gallimard, Paris 2007</ref>\n\n*Gaston \u2013 [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]]\n*Georges Renaud \u2013 [[Louis Salou]]\n*Mme Renaud \u2013 [[Marthe Mellot]]\n*Valentine Renaud \u2013 Nadine Picard\n*La duchesse Dupont-Dufort \u2013 Nora Sylv\u00e8re\n*Ma\u00eetre Huspar \u2013 Raymond Dagand\n*Le petit gar\u00e7on \u2013 Ludmilla Pito\u00ebff\n*Ma\u00eetre Picwick \u2013 Henri Grall\n*Le ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel \u2013 Henri Gaultier\n*Le chauffeur \u2013 [[L\u00e9on Larive]]\n*Le valet de chambre \u2013 [[Gabriel Gobin]]\n* La cuisini\u00e8re \u2013 [[Andr\u00e9e Tainsy]]\n*Juliette \u2013 [[Madeleine Milhaud]]\n\nDirected by [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]]\n\n'''London''' \u2013 ''Traveller Without Luggage'' \u2013 Arts Theatre, 29 January 1959<ref>Jean Anouilh, translator: John Whiting, ''Traveller Without Luggage'', Methuen, London 1959</ref>\n\n*Gaston \u2013 [[Denholm Elliott]]\n*Georges Renaud \u2013 [[Geoffrey Keen]]\n*Mme Renaud \u2013 [[Irene Browne]]\n*Valentine Renaud \u2013 [[Elizabeth Sellars]]\n*The Duchesse Dupont-Dufort \u2013 [[Joyce Carey]]\n*Ma\u00eetre Huspar \u2013 [[Douglas Wilmer]]\n*a small boy \u2013 Hugh James\n*Ma\u00eetre Picwick \u2013 Norman Pitt\n*A butler \u2013 Anthony Blake\n*A chauffeur \u2013 James Wellman\n*A valet \u2013 John Warner\n*A cook \u2013 [[Peggy Ann Clifford]]\n*Juliette \u2013 Violetta\n\nDirected by [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]]\n\nTranslated by [[John Whiting]]\n\n'''New York''' \u2013 ''Traveller Without Luggage'' \u2013 ANTA Playhouse, 17 September 1964<ref>https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/traveller-without-luggage-3210</ref>\n\n*Gaston \u2013 [[Ben Gazzara]]\n*Georges Renaud \u2013 [[Stephen Elliott (actor)|Stephen Elliott]]\n*Mme Renaud \u2013 [[Mildred Dunnock]]\n*Valentine Renaud \u2013 [[Nancy Wickwire]]\n*The Duchesse Dupont-Dufort \u2013 Margaret Braidwood\n*Ma\u00eetre Huspar \u2013 Boris Tumarin\n*A small boy \u2013 Jeffrey Neal\n*Mr Truggle [ie, Ma\u00eetre Picwick] \u2013 Ronald Dawson\n*A butler \u2013 William Cottrell\n*A valet \u2013 Anthony Palmer\n*Juliette \u2013 [[Rae Allen]]\n\nDirected by [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]]\n\nTranslated by [[Lucienne Hill]]\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe play has been adapted frequently, firstly as [[Traveling Light (1944 film)|a film in 1944]], directed by Anouilh himself, and then several times on television - in Great Britain (October 1959, February 1965), Australia (August 1961), Canada (January 1962), Spain (February 1964, February 1968), and France (September 2004, directed by [[Pierre Boutron]]).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0030478/</ref>\n\nThe play has twice been presented on BBC Radio, first in March 1953<ref>''Radio Times'' # 1532, 20 March 1953</ref> and subsequently in June 1980.<ref>''Radio Times'' # 2954, 19 June 1980</ref> A new stage adaptation by Anthony Weigh, transposed to 1950s America and titled ''Welcome Home, Captain Fox!'', was produced at London's [[Donmar Warehouse]] in March 2016.<ref>https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/welcome-home-captain-fox-review-at-the-donmar-warehouse-london-sweet-strange-and-stylish/</ref>\n\nIn India, on Mumbai (Bombay) Doordarshan TV the play was directed in Marathi by celebrated Marathi director Chandrakant Kulkarni and performed by Bhakti Barve Inamdar, Tushar Dalvi (title role), Aardra Athalye (small boy), Prasad Athalye and others.

Gaston tells the young boy about the scar on his shoulder and fabricates a story about the scar belonging to the boy's long-lost nephew. Gaston leaves the Renauds to become a member of the boy's family, later writing a letter to Jacques' brother Georges, stating that their Jacques is dead and they need not search for him any longer.\n\n==Inspiration and reception==\nInspired by the story of an amnesiac soldier, [[Anthelme Mangin]], who was claimed by over a dozen families,<ref>Jean Yves Le Naour, ''Le Soldat inconnu vivant'', Hachette Litt\u00e9rature, Paris 2002</ref> the play was Anouilh's first major hit with critics and audiences alike. According to biographer Edward Owen Marsh, the playwright enjoyed \"his first financial success in the theatre, when perhaps the poorest theatre-director in Paris, [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]], produced what is generally considered to be one of Anouilh's finest plays, ''Le Voyageur sans bagage''. This production put the seal on his reputation and marked him as one of the most interesting younger dramatists.\"<ref>Edward Owen Marsh, ''Jean Anouilh: Poet of Pierrot and Pantaloon'', WH Allen, London 1953</ref> The play was first presented in the UK at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre on 3 September 1951, in a translation by Lewis Galantiere.<ref>'London Theatres: Bristol Premiere', ''The Stage'' 1 September 1951</ref> Subsequent translators of the play included the dramatist [[John Whiting]] and actress [[Lucienne Hill]].\n\n==Original productions==\n\n'''Paris''' \u2013 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Mathurins, 16 February 1937<ref>Jean Anouilh, ''Le Voyageur sans bagage'': Edition de Bernard Beugnot, Gallimard, Paris 2007</ref>\n\n*Gaston \u2013 [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]]\n*Georges Renaud \u2013 [[Louis Salou]]\n*Mme Renaud \u2013 [[Marthe Mellot]]\n*Valentine Renaud \u2013 Nadine Picard\n*La duchesse Dupont-Dufort \u2013 Nora Sylv\u00e8re\n*Ma\u00eetre Huspar \u2013 Raymond Dagand\n*Le petit gar\u00e7on \u2013 Ludmilla Pito\u00ebff\n*Ma\u00eetre Picwick \u2013 Henri Grall\n*Le ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel \u2013 Henri Gaultier\n*Le chauffeur \u2013 [[L\u00e9on Larive]]\n*Le valet de chambre \u2013 [[Gabriel Gobin]]\n* La cuisini\u00e8re \u2013 [[Andr\u00e9e Tainsy]]\n*Juliette \u2013 [[Madeleine Milhaud]]\n\nDirected by [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]]\n\n'''London''' \u2013 ''Traveller Without Luggage'' \u2013 Arts Theatre, 29 January 1959<ref>Jean Anouilh, translator: John Whiting, ''Traveller Without Luggage'', Methuen, London 1959</ref>\n\n*Gaston \u2013 [[Denholm Elliott]]\n*Georges Renaud \u2013 [[Geoffrey Keen]]\n*Mme Renaud \u2013 [[Irene Browne]]\n*Valentine Renaud \u2013 [[Elizabeth Sellars]]\n*The Duchesse Dupont-Dufort \u2013 [[Joyce Carey]]\n*Ma\u00eetre Huspar \u2013 [[Douglas Wilmer]]\n*a small boy \u2013 Hugh James\n*Ma\u00eetre Picwick \u2013 Norman Pitt\n*A butler \u2013 Anthony Blake\n*A chauffeur \u2013 James Wellman\n*A valet \u2013 John Warner\n*A cook \u2013 [[Peggy Ann Clifford]]\n*Juliette \u2013 Violetta\n\nDirected by [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]]\n\nTranslated by [[John Whiting]]\n\n'''New York''' \u2013 ''Traveller Without Luggage'' \u2013 ANTA Playhouse, 17 September 1964<ref>https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/traveller-without-luggage-3210</ref>\n\n*Gaston \u2013 [[Ben Gazzara]]\n*Georges Renaud \u2013 [[Stephen Elliott (actor)|Stephen Elliott]]\n*Mme Renaud \u2013 [[Mildred Dunnock]]\n*Valentine Renaud \u2013 [[Nancy Wickwire]]\n*The Duchesse Dupont-Dufort \u2013 Margaret Braidwood\n*Ma\u00eetre Huspar \u2013 Boris Tumarin\n*A small boy \u2013 Jeffrey Neal\n*Mr Truggle [ie, Ma\u00eetre Picwick] \u2013 Ronald Dawson\n*A butler \u2013 William Cottrell\n*A valet \u2013 Anthony Palmer\n*Juliette \u2013 [[Rae Allen]]\n\nDirected by [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]]\n\nTranslated by [[Lucienne Hill]]\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe play has been adapted frequently, firstly as [[Traveling Light (1944 film)|a film in 1944]], directed by Anouilh himself, and then several times on television - in Great Britain (October 1959 and February 1965), Australia (August 1961), Canada (January 1962), Spain (February 1964 and February 1968), and France (September 2004, directed by [[Pierre Boutron]]).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0030478/</ref>\n\nThe play has twice been presented on BBC Radio, first on 22 March 1953<ref>''Radio Times'' # 1532, 20 March 1953</ref> and subsequently on 23 June 1980.<ref>''Radio Times'' # 2954, 19 June 1980</ref> A new stage adaptation by Anthony Weigh, transposed to 1950s America and titled ''Welcome Home, Captain Fox!'', was produced at London's [[Donmar Warehouse]] in March 2016.<ref>https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/welcome-home-captain-fox-review-at-the-donmar-warehouse-london-sweet-strange-and-stylish/</ref>\n\nIn India, on Mumbai (Bombay) Doordarshan TV the play was directed in Marathi by celebrated Marathi director Chandrakant Kulkarni and performed by Bhakti Barve Inamdar, Tushar Dalvi (title role), Aardra Athalye (small boy), Prasad Athalye and others.
