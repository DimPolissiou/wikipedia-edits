In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4149765|title=Movies to go|work=The Economist|date=July 7, 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206232113/http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4149765|archivedate=December 6, 2008}}</ref>\n\nRandolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/marc-randolph|title=Marc Randolph {{!}} Speaker Profile and Speaking Topics|website=www.apbspeakers.com|accessdate=November 13, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016131415/http://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/marc-randolph|archivedate=October 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nNetflix was sued in 2004 for false advertising in relation to claims of \"unlimited rentals\" with \"one-day delivery\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/11/5515-2/|title=Netflix settles class action lawsuit|work=Ars Technica|access-date=June 4, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117002751/https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/11/5515-2/|archivedate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion ===\n\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical |width=185\n|image1=NFOrg.png |caption1 =First logo, used from 1997 to 2000\n|image2=Netflix logo.svg |caption2=Netflix logo used from 2000 to 2014\n}}\n\nFor some time, the company had considered offering movies online, but it was only in the mid-2000s that data speeds and bandwidth costs had improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the net. The original idea was a \"Netflix box\" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now.

According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Android_app_stores#References NetFlix APk]\nNetflix upgrades to HD video streaming in India for basic plans & Mobile [https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEDpIGcQGXD7-o6I7UMAqxSQqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowsruUCzDxgKoDMKPExQY?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen]\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=2018-12-11}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the media service}}\n{{short description|Internet video streaming and DVD-by-mail service with original and licensed content}}\n{{Use American English|date=May 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox dot-com company\n| name = Netflix, Inc.\n| logo = [[File:Netflix 2015 logo.svg|frameless|upright]]\n| screenshot =Netflix -

By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300&nbsp;million and $400&nbsp;million, which makes Netflix's deal for ''House of Cards'' extremely cost effective, according to Spacey.<ref>{{cite web|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703195214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|archivedate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they do not need to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.\n\nThe Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\nNetflix upgrades to HD video streaming in India for basic plans & Mobile [https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEDpIGcQGXD7-o6I7UMAqxSQqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowsruUCzDxgKoDMKPExQY?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen]\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=2018-12-11}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Waqas1090", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix"}

By 1923, a distinct Woodstock style<ref>{{Cite book|last=Evers|first=Alf|title=Woodstock, History of An American Town|publisher=The Overlook Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=513, 514}}</ref> had emerged, depicting the local landscape, people, and flowers in heavy brushstrokes and earthy tones. Despite these influences, Rohland's watercolors remained bright and fluid. He often used as subjects the flowers he grew in his Woodstock garden. A contemporary art critic, John Slusser, wrote of Rohland's floral oils and watercolors, \"only a temperament as native to the sun and the soil as the flowers themselves could have produced them.\"<ref>Jean Paul Slusser, Essay on Paul Rohland published in ''The Arts'' June 1928, p.357.</ref> Printmaking was also one of Woodstock's signature art forms. Rohland is known for his colorful monotypes, engravings, and strong black and white woodcuts.\n\n== Later career and legacy ==\nRohland exhibited regularly with the [[Society of Independent Artists]], Salons of America, the Carnegie Institute, and the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]]. He also had one-man shows, notably in 1939 at the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|Virginia Museum of Fine Art]]. When Rohland traveled for his work, [[Juliana R. Force|Juliana Force]], the director of the new [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], handled many of his exhibitions and sales as well as those of his wife. Rohland first exhibited in the Whitney Club and Whitney Gallery exhibitions starting in 1927 and exhibited in the Whitney Museum's first Biennial in 1932. He continued to participate in Whitney Museum exhibitions<ref>Peter Hastings Falk, ''Annual and Biennial Exhibition Record of the Whitney Museum of American Art, 1918 \u2013 1989,'' Sound View Press, Madison, CT 1991 p. 339, and Whitney Museum of American Art digital archives.</ref> through 1942.\n\n[[Great Depression|The Great Depression]] severely affected art sales, but Rohland managed to secure three commissions for post office murals from the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture|Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts]], as did his wife. He executed the following US Post Office murals:<ref>Marlene Park and Gerald Markowitz, ''Democratic Vistas, PO and Public Art in the New Deal,'' Temple University Press, 1984, pp. 206, 212, 226.</ref> [http://statemuseumpa.org/common-canvas/post-office-full-study.pdf ''The Union of the Mountains''], [[Mount Union, Pennsylvania|Mount Union, PA]], (1937); [https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/richard-russell-federal-building-mural-atlanta-ga/ ''Dogwood and Azalea'',] [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur, GA]] (1938); and [https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/post-office-mural-ville-platte-la/ ''Louisiana Bayou''], [[Ville Platte, Louisiana|Ville Platte, LA]] (1939).\n\nIn 1942, Rohland's chronic [[asthma]] worsened, and the couple packed up their [[Ford Model T]] and left Woodstock, traveling south to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], with their final destination [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], where other Woodstock friends, among them, [[Andrew Dasburg]] and [[John Sloan]], painted during the winter.

His work is in the permanent collections of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Barnes Foundation]], National Museum of American Art-[[Smithsonian American Art Museum|Smithsonian]], the [[New Mexico Museum of Art|New Mexico Museum of Fine Arts]], and the [https://www.woodstockart.org/ Woodstock Artists Association Museum].

Roland [sic]</ref> At the age of 14 he went to work as a photo engraver for the Christopher Engraving Company in Richmond and studied in evening art classes at the Virginia Mechanics Institute under sculptor and illustrator Wm. L. Sheppard. In 1900 his family moved to [[Philadelphia]] where he worked as a copper etcher for Beck\u2019s Engraving. In January 1902 he went to New York and continued his evening art studies at the Art Students League under [[Robert Henri]]. Then, with the help of a paternal aunt, he was able to complete several years of formal art studies in France.<ref>''Virginia Artists Series No. 5 PAUL ROHLAND, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, January 21-February 4, 1939''.

They lived in New York City for short periods, but Woodstock remained their permanent residence for many years. There, [[Peter A. Juley|Peter]] and [https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/portrait-paul-p-juley-6818 Paul Juley] included both of them in their photographic documentation of early 20th-century American painters.<ref>Peter A.

Juley and Son Collection, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC</ref>\n\n== Style ==\nLike other art colonies, Woodstock fostered artistic collaboration. Throughout Rohland\u2019s life, the colony\u2019s artists and artist couples, [[Andrew Dasburg]] and his wife, [[Grace Mott Johnson]], Florence and Konrad Cramer, [[Henry Lee McFee]], Emil Ganso, [[Peggy Bacon|Peggy Baco]]<nowiki/>n, [[Eugene Speicher]], and many others remained close and instructive friends. By 1923, a distinct Woodstock style<ref>{{Cite book|last=Evers|first=Alf|title=Woodstock, History of An American Town|publisher=The Overlook Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=513, 514}}</ref> had emerged, depicting the local landscape, people, and flowers in heavy brushstrokes and earthy tones. Despite these influences, Rohland\u2019s watercolors remained bright and fluid. He often used as subjects the flowers he grew in his Woodstock garden. A contemporary art critic, John Slusser, wrote of Rohland\u2019s floral oils and watercolors, \u201conly a temperament as native to the sun and the soil as the flowers themselves could have produced them.\u201d<ref>Jean Paul Slusser, Essay on Paul Rohland published in ''The Arts'' June 1928, p.357.</ref> Printmaking was also one of Woodstock\u2019s signature art forms. Rohland is known for his colorful monotypes, engravings, and strong black and white woodcuts.\n\n== Later career and legacy ==\nRohland exhibited regularly with the [[Society of Independent Artists]], Salons of America, the Carnegie Institute, and the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]]. He also had one-man shows, notably in 1939 at the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|Virginia Museum of Fine Art]]. When Rohland traveled for his work, [[Juliana R. Force|Juliana Force]], the director of the new [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], handled many of his exhibitions and sales as well as those of his wife. Rohland first exhibited in the Whitney Club and Whitney Gallery exhibitions starting in 1927 and exhibited in the Whitney Museum\u2019s first Biennial in 1932. He continued to participate in Whitney Museum exhibitions<ref>Peter Hastings Falk, ''Annual and Biennial Exhibition Record of the Whitney Museum of American Art, 1918 \u2013 1989,'' Sound View Press, Madison, CT 1991 p. 339, and Whitney Museum of American Art digital archives.</ref> through 1942.\n\n[[Great Depression|The Great Depression]] severely affected art sales, but Rohland managed to secure three commissions for post office murals from the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture|Treasury Department\u2019s Section of Fine Arts]], as did his wife. He executed the following US Post Office murals:<ref>Marlene Park and Gerald Markowitz, ''Democratic Vistas, PO and Public Art in the New Deal,'' Temple University Press, 1984, pp. 206, 212, 226.</ref> [http://statemuseumpa.org/common-canvas/post-office-full-study.pdf ''The Union of the Mountains''], [[Mount Union, Pennsylvania|Mount Union, PA]], (1937); [https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/richard-russell-federal-building-mural-atlanta-ga/ ''Dogwood and Azalea'',] [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur, GA]] (1938); and [https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/post-office-mural-ville-platte-la/ ''Louisiana Bayou''], [[Ville Platte, Louisiana|Ville Platte, LA]] (1939).\n\nIn 1942, Rohland\u2019s chronic [[asthma]] worsened, and the couple packed up their [[Ford Model T]] and left Woodstock, traveling south to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], with their final destination [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], where other Woodstock friends, among them, [[Andrew Dasburg]] and [[John Sloan]], painted during the winter. From 1942 to 1945, Rohland exhibited yearly in the Annual Exhibition of Painters and Sculptors of the Southwest;<ref>''El Palacio'' catalogues 1942-1945.</ref> hence, he is often labeled as a \u201cwestern\u201d artist. In ''El Palacio'', August 1943, [[Edgar Lee Hewett]] said of Rohland\u2019s watercolor, ''[https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/paul-rohland-wpa-muralist-listed-1836259952 Southern Mansion]'', that it \u201cpossesses solidity beneath the flickering splashes of color.

He beat Jim Crawford there by getting a knockout in three rounds. Fitzsimmons had his first 28 definite professional fights in Australia, where he lost the [[List of Australian middleweight boxing champions|Australian Middleweight title]] to Mick Dooley (rumours spoke of a fixed bout) and where he also won a fight by [[knockout]] while on the floor: when Edward Starlight Robins dropped Fitzsimmons to the canvas in round nine of their fight, he also broke his hand and could not continue, therefore the referee declared Fitzsimmons the winner by a knockout.\n\nBy this stage, Fitzsimmons had established his own style. He developed a certain movement and caginess from one of the greatest bare-knuckle fighters, [[Jem Mace]]. Mace encouraged Fitzsimmons to develop his punching technique, drawing on the enormous power he had gained from blacksmithing. Fitzsimmons delivered short, accurate and occasionally conclusive punches. He soon built up a reputation as by far the hardest puncher in boxing.\n\n=== Winning the Middleweight title ===\nMoving on to the United States, Fitzsimmons fought four more times in 1890, winning three and drawing one.\n\n[[File:FitzsimmonsDempseyNOLAJan1891FB1.JPG|right|thumb|Fitzsimmons knocks down Dempsey in New Orleans, 1891]]\nThen, on 14 January 1891, in [[New Orleans]], he won his first world title from [[Jack (Nonpareil) Dempsey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/middle.htm|title=The Lineal Middlleweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name=AFP/> Fitzsimmons knocked out Dempsey (from whom the later [[Jack Dempsey]] took his name) in the 13th round to become the World Middleweight Champion. Fitzsimmons knocked Dempsey down at least 13 times and by the finish left him in such a pitiable condition that he begged him to quit. Since Dempsey would not do so, Fitzsimmons knocked him out and then carried him to his corner. On 22 July, police broke off his fight with [[Jim Hall (boxer)|Jim Hall]] after he had knocked Hall down several times.\n\nFitzsimmons spent the next two years fighting non-title bouts and exhibitions until giving Hall a chance at the title in 1893. He retained the crown by a knockout in round four. He spent the rest of that year doing exhibitions, and on 2 June, he had scheduled a two-way exhibition where he would demonstrate in public how to hit the boxing bag and then how to box against a real opponent. Reportedly, two freak accidents happened that day: Fitzsimmons hit the bag so hard that it broke, and then his opponent of that day allegedly slipped, getting hit in the head and the boxing exhibition was cancelled.\n\nAt a public sparring performance on 16 November 1894 at Jacob's Opera House, Syracuse, New York, Fitzsimmons knocked out sparring partner Con Riordan, who was carried off unconscious and died several hours later. Two months later Fitzsimmons was charged with manslaughter but was acquitted.<ref>Toronto Star, 19 January 1895.</ref>\n\n===Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey===\n{{main|Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey}}\nAfter vacating the Middleweight title, Fitzsimmons began campaigning at [[heavyweight]] (the [[light heavyweight]] division did not exist at that time). On 2 December 1896, the [[San Francisco Athletic Club]] sponsored a fight at the Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco between Fitzsimmons and [[Tom Sharkey]]. Unable to find a referee, they called on former lawman [[Wyatt Earp]]. He had officiated 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]].<ref name=reilly>{{cite web|last=Reilly |first=Joe |title=Born To Uphold The Law: Frank Sulloway\u2019s Principles Applied to the Earp-Clanton Feud of 1879\u20131882 |url=http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/1208/1/2006175044.pdf |publisher=Drexel E-Repository and Archive |accessdate=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712215527/http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/1208/1/2006175044.pdf |archivedate=12 July 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was favoured to win, and bets flowed heavily his way. Earp entered the ring still armed with his customary Colt .45 and drew a lot of attention when he had to be disarmed. He later said he forgot he was wearing it. Fitzsimmons was taller and quicker than Sharkey and dominated the fight from the opening bell. In the eighth round, Fitzsimmons hit Sharkey with his famed \"solar plexus punch,\" an uppercut under the heart that could render a man temporarily helpless. The punch caught Sharkey, Earp, and most of the crowd by surprise, and Sharkey dropped, clutched his groin, and rolled on the canvas, screamed foul.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barra|first=Alan|title=BACKTALK;When Referee Wyatt Earp Laid Down the Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/26/sports/backtalk-when-referee-wyatt-earp-laid-down-the-law.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 November 1995}}</ref>\n\nEarp stopped the bout, ruling that Fitzsimmons had hit Sharkey when he was down.

He out-boxed Fitzsimmons for several rounds, knocked him down in the sixth round and badly damaged his face with his jab, left hook and right hand, but Fitzsimmons kept coming and Corbett began to tire. In the 14th round, Fitzsimmons won the title with his \"solar plexus\" punch. Corbett collapsed in agony. Fitzsimmons' \"solar plexus\" punch became legendary, although he himself may never have used the phrase. The entire fight was filmed by [[Enoch J. Rector]] and released to cinemas as ''[[The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight]]'', the longest film ever released at the time. Using her maiden name, it was covered by [[Nellie Verrill Mighels Davis]], the first woman to report a prize fight.<ref name=\"unr.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unr.edu/nwhp/bios/women/davis.htm|title=Nellie Mighels Davis|work=Nevada Women's History Project|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nFitzsimmons spent the rest of 1897 and 1898 doing stage tours.{{clarify|date=October 2014}} In 1899, Fitzsimmons fought [[James J. Jeffries]] at the Coney Island Athletic Club near Brooklyn, New York. Most people gave Jeffries little chance, even though at over 15 stones (95&nbsp;kg) he massively outweighed his opponent and was far younger, but Jeffries lifted the World Heavyweight Championship from Fitzsimmons with an 11th-round knockout.\n\nIn June 1901 Fitzsimmons took part in a [[wrestling]] match against Gus Ruhlin. He lost and went back to boxing. He then enjoyed legitimate boxing knockouts of leading contenders Ruhlin and [[Tom Sharkey]].\n\nIn 1901 he published a book ''Physical Culture and Self-Defense'' (Philadelphia: D. Biddle). In 1902, he and Jeffries had a rematch, once again with the World Heavyweight Champion at stake. Fitzsimmons battered Jeffries, who suffered horrible punishment. With his nose and cheek bones broken, most would have sympathized with Jeffries had he quit, but he kept going until his enormous strength and youth wore down Bob and he knocked him out cold in round eight.\n\n=== Winning the Light Heavyweight title ===\nIn November 1903, Fitzsimmons made history by defeating World Light Heavyweight Champion [[George Gardiner (boxer)|George Gardiner]] (also known as Gardner) by a decision in 20 rounds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/lheavy.htm|title=The Lineal Light Heavyweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name=AFP/> becoming the first boxer to win titles in three weight-divisions.<ref name=ADP/>\n\nSoon afterward, he went back to the Heavyweights, where he kept fighting until 1914, with mixed results. In 1907 at age 44, Fitzsimmons fought much younger [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], during the time period in which reigning champion [[James J. Jeffries]] refused to fight Johnson. The bout between Johnson and Fitzsimmons ended in victory for Johnson with a second round [[knockout]].<ref name=Burns>Ken Burns, ''Unforgivable Blackness''</ref>\n\n=== Retirement ===\nAlthough Fitzsimmons became a world champion in each of the Middleweight, Light Heavyweight and Heavyweight divisions, historians do ''not'' consider him the first world Light Heavyweight Champion to become World Heavyweight Champion, because he won the Heavyweight title before winning the Light Heavyweight belt. [[Michael Spinks]] counts as the first Light Heavyweight World Champion to win the Heavyweight belt as well. However, Fitzsimmons was the first Middleweight Champion to win the Heavyweight title and the only Heavyweight Champion to drop down and win the Light Heavyweight title. Fitzsimmons and later [[Henry Armstrong]] were the only men to win undisputed world championships in three different weight classes.\n\nFitzsimmons had a final professional record of 66 wins with 59 by knockout, 8 losses, 4 draws, 19 no contests and 2 no decisions (Newspaper Decisions: 2\u20130\u20130).\n\nFitzsimmons's exact record remains unknown, as the boxing world often kept records poorly during his era, but Fitzsimmons said he had had more than 350 fights (which could have involved exaggeration on his part).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}) It's also possible that Bob may have included his many exhibition bouts in his total.\n\n==Death and Legacy==\nFitzsimmons died of [[pneumonia]] on 22 October 1917 in Chicago, survived by his fourth wife. His grave lies in the [[Graceland Cemetery]], [[Uptown, Chicago|Uptown]]. Having four wives, a gambling habit and a susceptibility to confidence tricksters, he did not hold on to the money he made.\n\nThe statue ''Peace'' on the [[Dewey Arch]] was modelled on Fitzsimmons by the sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A statue of Fitzsimmons has also stood in the city centre of Timaru, New Zealand, since 1987. It was commissioned by New Zealand millionaire boxing fan [[Bob Jones (businessman)|Bob Jones]] and sculpted by [[Margriet Windhausen]].<ref>Romanos, J. \"[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/37951/statue-of-bob-fitzsimmons-timaru Statue of Bob Fitzsimmons, Timaru]\", ''[[Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]'', 27 January 2015.

He wanted to join the crew of the ''Isabella Ridley'', and do some service as a sailor, hoping that it would toughen him up for a career in boxing, but the ship was badly damaged in storms while still docked in Timaru.<ref>Nicholson 2011, p. 45.</ref> Instead, he took on a range of jobs; as a butcher's delivery boy, a carriage painter, striker at an iron foundry, and a decorator, before becoming an apprentice at his family's blacksmith's forge with his brother Jarrett. His time working in the blacksmith's forge helped to develop his upper body, particularly his arms and shoulders.<ref name=\"odnb\"/><ref name=\"teara\"/> During his time working in the blacksmith's forge, there are stories that Fitzsimmons was not averse to fighting quarrelsome, often drunk, customers, and it was suggested that this even boosted business, as customers returned to the forge, hoping to see a fight.<ref>Nicholson 2011, p. 46.</ref>\n\n== Amateur career ==\nIn the early 1880s [[Jem Mace]], an English bare-knuckle boxer, travelled to New Zealand, and Timaru hosted both his boxing school, and the first boxing championships held in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/boxing-and-wrestling/page-1 |title=Boxing and wrestling \u2013 Professional boxing |last=Romanos |first=Joseph |website=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> Fitzsimmons entered the tournament, and knocked out four opponents on his way to winning the competition.

He beat Jim Crawford there by getting a knockout in three rounds. Fitzsimmons had his first 28 definite professional fights in Australia, where he lost the [[List of Australian middleweight boxing champions|Australian Middleweight title]] to Mick Dooley (rumours spoke of a fixed bout) and where he also won a fight by [[knockout]] while on the floor: when Edward Starlight Robins dropped Fitzsimmons to the canvas in round nine of their fight, he also broke his hand and could not continue, therefore the referee declared Fitzsimmons the winner by a knockout.\n\nBy this stage, Fitzsimmons had established his own style. He developed a certain movement and caginess from one of the greatest bare-knuckle fighters, [[Jem Mace]]. Mace encouraged Fitzsimmons to develop his punching technique, drawing on the enormous power he had gained from blacksmithing. Fitzsimmons delivered short, accurate and occasionally conclusive punches. He soon built up a reputation as by far the hardest puncher in boxing.\n\n=== Winning the Middleweight title ===\nMoving on to the United States, Fitzsimmons fought four more times in 1890, winning three and drawing one.\n\n[[File:FitzsimmonsDempseyNOLAJan1891FB1.JPG|right|thumb|Fitzsimmons knocks down Dempsey in New Orleans, 1891]]\nThen, on 14 January 1891, in [[New Orleans]], he won his first world title from [[Jack (Nonpareil) Dempsey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/middle.htm|title=The Lineal Middlleweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name=AFP/> Fitzsimmons knocked out Dempsey (from whom the later [[Jack Dempsey]] took his name) in the 13th round to become the World Middleweight Champion. Fitzsimmons knocked Dempsey down at least 13 times and by the finish left him in such a pitiable condition that he begged him to quit. Since Dempsey would not do so, Fitzsimmons knocked him out and then carried him to his corner. On 22 July, police broke off his fight with [[Jim Hall (boxer)|Jim Hall]] after he had knocked Hall down several times.\n\nFitzsimmons spent the next two years fighting non-title bouts and exhibitions until giving Hall a chance at the title in 1893. He retained the crown by a knockout in round four. He spent the rest of that year doing exhibitions, and on 2 June, he had scheduled a two-way exhibition where he would demonstrate in public how to hit the boxing bag and then how to box against a real opponent. Reportedly, two freak accidents happened that day: Fitzsimmons hit the bag so hard that it broke, and then his opponent of that day allegedly slipped, getting hit in the head and the boxing exhibition was cancelled.\n\nAt a public sparring performance on 16 November 1894 at Jacob's Opera House, Syracuse, New York, Fitzsimmons knocked out sparring partner Con Riordan, who was carried off unconscious and died several hours later. Two months later Fitzsimmons was charged with manslaughter but was acquitted.<ref>Toronto Star, 19 January 1895.</ref>\n\n===Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey===\n{{main|Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey}}\nAfter vacating the Middleweight title, Fitzsimmons began campaigning at [[heavyweight]] (the [[light heavyweight]] division did not exist at that time). On 2 December 1896, the [[San Francisco Athletic Club]] sponsored a fight at the Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco between Fitzsimmons and [[Tom Sharkey]]. Unable to find a referee, they called on former lawman [[Wyatt Earp]]. He had officiated 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]].<ref name=reilly>{{cite web|last=Reilly |first=Joe |title=Born To Uphold The Law: Frank Sulloway\u2019s Principles Applied to the Earp-Clanton Feud of 1879\u20131882 |url=http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/1208/1/2006175044.pdf |publisher=Drexel E-Repository and Archive |accessdate=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712215527/http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/1208/1/2006175044.pdf |archivedate=12 July 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was favoured to win, and bets flowed heavily his way. Earp entered the ring still armed with his customary Colt .45 and drew a lot of attention when he had to be disarmed. He later said he forgot he was wearing it. Fitzsimmons was taller and quicker than Sharkey and dominated the fight from the opening bell. In the eighth round, Fitzsimmons hit Sharkey with his famed \"solar plexus punch,\" an uppercut under the heart that could render a man temporarily helpless. The punch caught Sharkey, Earp, and most of the crowd by surprise, and Sharkey dropped, clutched his groin, and rolled on the canvas, screamed foul.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barra|first=Alan|title=BACKTALK;When Referee Wyatt Earp Laid Down the Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/26/sports/backtalk-when-referee-wyatt-earp-laid-down-the-law.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 November 1995}}</ref>\n\nEarp stopped the bout, ruling that Fitzsimmons had hit Sharkey when he was down.

He out-boxed Fitzsimmons for several rounds, knocked him down in the sixth round and badly damaged his face with his jab, left hook and right hand, but Fitzsimmons kept coming and Corbett began to tire. In the 14th round, Fitzsimmons won the title with his \"solar plexus\" punch. Corbett collapsed in agony. Fitzsimmons' \"solar plexus\" punch became legendary, although he himself may never have used the phrase. The entire fight was filmed by [[Enoch J. Rector]] and released to cinemas as ''[[The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight]]'', the longest film ever released at the time. Using her maiden name, it was covered by [[Nellie Verrill Mighels Davis]], the first woman to report a prize fight.<ref name=\"unr.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unr.edu/nwhp/bios/women/davis.htm|title=Nellie Mighels Davis|work=Nevada Women's History Project|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nFitzsimmons spent the rest of 1897 and 1898 doing stage tours.{{clarify|date=October 2014}} In 1899, Fitzsimmons fought [[James J. Jeffries]] at the Coney Island Athletic Club near Brooklyn, New York. Most people gave Jeffries little chance, even though at over 15 stones (95&nbsp;kg) he massively outweighed his opponent and was far younger, but Jeffries lifted the World Heavyweight Championship from Fitzsimmons with an 11th-round knockout.\n\nIn June 1901 Fitzsimmons took part in a [[wrestling]] match against Gus Ruhlin. He lost and went back to boxing. He then enjoyed legitimate boxing knockouts of leading contenders Ruhlin and [[Tom Sharkey]].\n\nIn 1901 he published a book ''Physical Culture and Self-Defense'' (Philadelphia: D. Biddle). In 1902, he and Jeffries had a rematch, once again with the World Heavyweight Champion at stake. Fitzsimmons battered Jeffries, who suffered horrible punishment. With his nose and cheek bones broken, most would have sympathized with Jeffries had he quit, but he kept going until his enormous strength and youth wore down Bob and he knocked him out cold in round eight.\n\n=== Winning the Light Heavyweight title ===\nIn November 1903, Fitzsimmons made history by defeating World Light Heavyweight Champion [[George Gardiner (boxer)|George Gardiner]] (also known as Gardner) by a decision in 20 rounds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/lheavy.htm|title=The Lineal Light Heavyweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name=AFP/> becoming the first boxer to win titles in three weight-divisions.<ref name=ADP/>\n\nSoon afterward, he went back to the Heavyweights, where he kept fighting until 1914, with mixed results. In 1907 at age 44, Fitzsimmons fought much younger [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], during the time period in which reigning champion [[James J. Jeffries]] refused to fight Johnson. The bout between Johnson and Fitzsimmons ended in victory for Johnson with a second round [[knockout]].<ref name=Burns>Ken Burns, ''Unforgivable Blackness''</ref>\n\n=== Retirement ===\nAlthough Fitzsimmons became a world champion in each of the Middleweight, Light Heavyweight and Heavyweight divisions, historians do ''not'' consider him the first world Light Heavyweight Champion to become World Heavyweight Champion, because he won the Heavyweight title before winning the Light Heavyweight belt. [[Michael Spinks]] counts as the first Light Heavyweight World Champion to win the Heavyweight belt as well. However, Fitzsimmons was the first Middleweight Champion to win the Heavyweight title and the only Heavyweight Champion to drop down and win the Light Heavyweight title. Fitzsimmons and later [[Henry Armstrong]] were the only men to win undisputed world championships in three different weight classes.\n\nFitzsimmons had a final professional record of 66 wins with 59 by knockout, 8 losses, 4 draws, 19 no contests and 2 no decisions (Newspaper Decisions: 2\u20130\u20130).\n\nFitzsimmons's exact record remains unknown, as the boxing world often kept records poorly during his era, but Fitzsimmons said he had had more than 350 fights (which could have involved exaggeration on his part).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}) It's also possible that Bob may have included his many exhibition bouts in his total.\n\n==Death and Legacy==\nFitzsimmons died of [[pneumonia]] on 22 October 1917 in Chicago, survived by his fourth wife. His grave lies in the [[Graceland Cemetery]], [[Uptown, Chicago|Uptown]]. Having four wives, a gambling habit and a susceptibility to confidence tricksters, he did not hold on to the money he made.\n\nThe statue ''Peace'' on the [[Dewey Arch]] was modelled on Fitzsimmons by the sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A statue of Fitzsimmons has also stood in the city centre of Timaru, New Zealand, since 1987. It was commissioned by New Zealand millionaire boxing fan [[Bob Jones (businessman)|Bob Jones]] and sculpted by [[Margriet Windhausen]].<ref>Romanos, J. \"[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/37951/statue-of-bob-fitzsimmons-timaru Statue of Bob Fitzsimmons, Timaru]\", ''[[Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]'', 27 January 2015.

Founded in 1950, it is on a working farm which dates back to 1759 and has significant brewing history. In the 1990s, a bread bakery and cheese-making facility were added.\n\nHistorically, their best-selling beer was the Moinette Blonde.

Square, flat-bottomed fermentation tanks of stainless steel are utilized to provide specific flavor characteristics that are evident in the finished beer. Primary fermentation lasts about 5 days, followed by a 1-2 week secondary fermentation. After this, the beer is packaged and warm-aged at the brewery for 6\u20138 weeks at 73&nbsp;\u00b0F(23&nbsp;\u00b0C).

The complexity of flavors it generates has caused some to suggest that in fact a combination of multiple strains are used, and its good performance at high temperatures and signature spiciness have led some to conjecture that it was originally a red wine strain that has been adapted to beer fermentation.
