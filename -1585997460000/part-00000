{"title_page": "Simon Commission", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date = April 2019}}\n  \nThe '''Indian Statutory Commission''', commonly referred to as the '''Simon Commission''', was a group of seven English, male British Members of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] under the chairmanship of [[John_Simon,_1st_Viscount_Simon|Sir John Simon]] (later, 1st [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Viscount Simon]]). The commission arrived in [[British India]] in 1928 to study constitutional reform in Britain's largest and the  most important possession.\n\nOne of its members was [[Clement Attlee]], of the Labour Party, who became committed to Indian independence by 1934 and achieved that goal as [[Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 1947 in the .[[Indian_Independence_Act_1947|granting of independence to India and Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Bew|title=Clement Attlee: The Man Who Made Modern Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1jODQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187|year=2017|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=978-0-19-020340-5|pages=186\u201387}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of introducing the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]] in 1919, the [[British Government]] declared that a commission would be sent to India after ten years to examine the effects and operations of the constitutional reforms and to suggest more reforms for India.<ref>{{cite book|author=C.F. Andrews|title=India and the Simon Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMZRDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT11|year=2017|publisher=Routledge reprint of 1930 first edition|page=11|isbn=9781315444987}}</ref> \n\nIn November 1927, the British government appointed [[Simon Commission|the Simon Commission]] to report on India's constitutional progress for introducing constitutional reforms, as promised.\n\nThe Commission was strongly opposed by many Indians. It was opposed by [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Jinnah]], the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Indian National Congress]] because it contained seven members of the [[British parliament|British Parliament]] but no Indians. Indians saw it as a violation to their right of self determination and insult to their self respect. \n\nProminent Indian nationalist [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] led a protest in [[Lahore]]. He suffered a police beating during the protest, and died of his injuries on 17 November around 1928.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Government of India Act 1919]] had introduced the system of [[Diarchy#India|diarchy]] to govern the provinces of [[British India]]. Indian opinion clamoured for revision of this form of government, and the Government of India Act 1919 itself stated that a commission would be appointed after ten years to investigate the progress of the governance scheme and suggest new steps for reform. In the late 1920s, the ruling [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government feared imminent electoral defeat at the hands of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and also feared the effects of the consequent transference of control of India to such an \"inexperienced\" body. Hence, it appointed seven MPs to constitute the promised commission to examine the state of Indian constitutional affairs.\n\nSome people in India were outraged and insulted that the Simon Commission, which was to determine the future of India, did not include a single Indian member.

The commission arrived in [[British India]] in 1928 to study constitutional reform in Britain's largest and the  most important possession.\n\nOne of its members was [[Clement Attlee]], of the Labour Party, who became committed to Indian independence by 1934 and achieved that goal as [[Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 1947 in the .[[Indian_Independence_Act_1947|granting of independence to India and Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Bew|title=Clement Attlee: The Man Who Made Modern Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1jODQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187|year=2017|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=978-0-19-020340-5|pages=186\u201387}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of introducing the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]] in 1919, the [[British Government]] declared that a commission would be sent to India after ten years to examine the effects and operations of the constitutional reforms and to suggest more reforms for India.<ref>{{cite book|author=C.F.

It was opposed by [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Jinnah]], the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Indian National Congress]] because it contained seven members of the [[British parliament|British Parliament]] but no Indians. Indians saw it as a violation to their right of self determination and insult to their self respect. \n\nProminent Indian nationalist [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] led a protest in [[Lahore]]. He suffered a police beating during the protest, and died of his injuries on 17 November around 1928.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Government of India Act 1919]] had introduced the system of [[Diarchy#India|diarchy]] to govern the provinces of [[British India]]. Indian opinion clamoured for revision of this form of government, and the Government of India Act 1919 itself stated that a commission would be appointed after ten years to investigate the progress of the governance scheme and suggest new steps for reform. In the late 1920s, the ruling [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government feared imminent electoral defeat at the hands of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and also feared the effects of the consequent transference of control of India to such an \"inexperienced\" body. Hence, it appointed seven MPs to constitute the promised commission to examine the state of Indian constitutional affairs.\n\nSome people in India were outraged and insulted that the Simon Commission, which was to determine the future of India, did not include a single Indian member. The [[Indian National Congress]], at its December 1927 meeting in [[Madras]] (now [[Chennai]]), resolved to boycott the Commission and challenged [[F. E.

While many Christians believe in the virgin birth of Jesus, it is principally Roman Catholics who believe in the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.\n\n==Doctrine==\n\nThe Immaculate Conception of Mary is one of the four [[Mariology|Marian]] dogmas of the Catholic Church, meaning that it is held to be a truth divinely revealed, the denial of which is [[heresy]].{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=133}} The doctrine was defined by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1854, and states that Mary, through God's grace, was conceived free from the stain of [[original sin]]:{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=209}}\n\n<blockquote>\nWe declare, pronounce, and define that the doctrine which holds that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin, is a doctrine revealed by God and therefore to be believed firmly and constantly by all the faithful.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen defining the dogma in ''Ineffabilis Deus'', [[Pope Pius IX]] explicitly affirmed that Mary, rather than being cleansed after sin, was completely prevented from contracting sin in view of her role as the mother of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race.{{sfn|Sheed|1958|p=134-138}} While the doctrine asserts only Mary's freedom from original sin, the [[Council of Trent]], held between 1545 and 1563, affirmed in addition her freedom from personal sin.{{sfn|Fastiggi|2019|p=455}} \n\nThe doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is not to be confused with the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], more properly termed a virginal conception.{{sfn|Bromiley|1995|p=272}}\n\n==History==\n===Original sin and the veneration of Mary===\n\n[[Original sin]] is not found in the [[Genesis creation narrative|Book of Genesis]] (Judaism does not see human nature as irrevocably tainted,{{sfn|Pies|2000|p=xviii}}), nor in the New Testament,{{sfn|Wiley|2002|pp=171}} and although the [[Apostle Paul]] mentions the \"sin of Adam\", he does not use the term and regards sin and death as the lot of mankind and not a punishment visited on mankind for Adam's fault.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=301}} Christianity had no doctrine on the subject before the 4th century,{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} when [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430 AD) created a theology that eventually became accepted as the official position of the Church, inserting original sin and the Fall into the story of the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Letter to the Romans|Romans 5:12]] although neither use those terms.{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} Locating sin in male semen, he made it heritable, for only Jesus Christ, conceived without human semen, was free of the original sin passed down from Adam.{{sfn|Stortz|2001|pp=93\u201494}} This sentiment was echoed as late as 1930 by Pope [[Pius XI]] in his ''Casti Conubii'': \"The natural generation of life has become the path of death by which original sin is communicated to the children.\"{{sfn|Obach|2008|pp=43}} \n\nWhile for some early theologians original sin was the consequence of Adam's act, for others it was [[Eve]] who was to blame,{{sfn|Wiley|2002|pp=37}} [[Irenaeus]] (born c.130) writing that \"disobedient Eve\" became \"the cause of death, both for herself and the entire human race\", and [[Ambrose]] (c.340-397) that Eve deceived Adam, while [[Origen]] (184-235) drew the lesson for all womankind: \"God does not stoop to look upon what is feminine and of the flesh.\"{{sfn|Wiley|2002|pp=171}} \n\nMary's mother, [[Saint Anne]], is not mentioned in the New Testament: she first appears in a late 2nd century work called the [[Protevangelium of James]], the author taking her name from [[Hannah]], the mother of the prophet [[Samuel]];Anne and her husband Joachim are each told by an angel that God has heard their prayers for a child, and Mary is conceived and born.{{sfn|Nixon|2004|p=11-12}} The Protevangelium was immensely influential, and the developed Mariological doctrines can be traced to this book.{{sfn|Elliott|1993|p=48}}\n\n===Medieval dispute about the doctrine===\n{{Catholic marian prayers sidebar}}\n\nMary's immaculate conception, along with her bodily [[assumption]] into heaven, were new doctrines in the late medieval period.{{sfn|Cameron|1996|p=336}} [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] in the 12th century raised the question of the Immaculate Conception. A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West. St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of [[Lyon]] for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See. In doing so, he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless, calling it a \"novelty\". Some doubt, however, whether he was using the term \"conception\" in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX. Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother's cooperation, for in his argument he says: \"How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence (''libido'')?\" and stronger expressions follow, which could be interpreted to indicate that he was speaking of the mother and not of the child. Yet, Bernard also decries those who support the feast for trying to \"add to the glories of Mary\", which proves he was indeed talking about Mary.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Immaculate Conception, The |volume=14 |pages=334\u2013335 |first=John |last=Hedley |authorlink=John Hedley (bishop)}}</ref>\n\nSaint [[Thomas Aquinas]] rejected the Immaculate Conception, saying if the Virgin Mary had been sanctified before her conception, she would not have needed the redemption of Christ concluding that \"Blessed Virgin was sanctified after animation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeP7kg-blnIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=summa+theologica+volume&hl=en&ei=RmgsTs_jOou3hAfL8cWqCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22stain%20of%20original%20sin%22&f=false|title=Summa Theologica, Volume 4 (Part III, First Section)|publisher=}}</ref> Aquinas distinguished between first time of conception, animation and birth: with the word \"conception\" is meant the first time of life of the human body, caused by the parents' union (except for the [[Virgin birth of Jesus]]), whereas the term \"[[ensoulment|animation]]\" indicates the following time where a [[soul#Christianity|soul]] is believed to be [[Creationism (soul)|created by God]], and then by Him unified together with the human body. The [[person#person identity|person]] exists only when the body has received its own soul.

Consequently, after Christ, who, as the universal Saviour of all, needed not to be saved, the purity of the Blessed Virgin holds the highest place. For Christ did not contract the original sin in any way whatever, but was holy in His very Conception, according to Luke 1:35: \"The Holy which be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God\".

In 1439, the [[Council of Basel]], which is not reckoned an [[ecumenical council]], stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith. By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties, but such was the influence of the Dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323 and declared \"Doctor Angelicus\" of the Church in 1567) that the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563)\u2014which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine\u2014instead declined to take a position.<ref name=Holweck/><ref name=Schroedel/>\n\n===Definition of the dogma===\n[[File:Lusenberg-Immaculata-1876.jpg|thumb|220px|''Altar of the Immaculata'' by [[Josef Moroder-Lusenberg|Joseph Lusenberg]], 1876.

To some medieval viewers, the kiss was a literal representation of the moment of Mary's conception, while for others it was a symbolic representation. The 14th and 15th centuries were the highpoint of these depictions.  Gradually more allegorical depictions of the Immaculate Conception, featuring an adult Mary, replaced this scene in representing the doctrine.<ref>Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}, p. 171</ref>\n\nThe 1476 extension of the [[feast of the Immaculate Conception]] to the entire Latin Church reduced the likelihood of controversy for the artist or patron in depicting an image, so that [[emblem]]s depicting ''The Immaculate Conception'' began to appear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/immac_con_images.html|title=The Immaculate Conception in Images|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMany artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\nThe definitive [[iconography]] for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been finally established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]]. Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.<ref>''\u00c9sot\u00e9risme, gnoses & imaginaire symbolique: m\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} page 676</ref><ref>''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R.

The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1\u20132. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]]. In some paintings the putti are holding [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.<ref>''Our Lady in Art'' by Katherine Lee Rawlings Jenner 2009 {{ISBN|1-103-32689-9}} pages 3\u20139</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Giotto - Scrovegni - -06- - Meeting at the Golden Gate.jpg|Giotto, ''Meeting at the Golden Gate'', 1304\u20131306\nFile:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|[[Piero di Cosimo|di Cosimo]], ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505\nFile:La Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n vista por San Juan Evangelista (Museo de Santa Cruz de Toledo).jpg|[[El Greco]], ''The Immaculate Conception with St John the Evangelist'', {{circa}} 1585\nFile:0 L'Immacul\u00e9e Conception - P.P.

While many Christians believe in the virgin birth of Jesus, it is principally Roman Catholics who believe in the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.\n\n==Doctrine==\n\nThe Immaculate Conception of Mary is one of the four [[Mariology|Marian]] dogmas of the Catholic Church, meaning that it is held to be a truth divinely revealed, the denial of which is [[heresy]].{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=133}} The doctrine was defined by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1854, and states that Mary, through God's grace, was conceived free from the stain of [[original sin]]:{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=209}}\n\n<blockquote>\nWe declare, pronounce, and define that the doctrine which holds that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin, is a doctrine revealed by God and therefore to be believed firmly and constantly by all the faithful.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen defining the dogma in ''Ineffabilis Deus'', [[Pope Pius IX]] explicitly affirmed that Mary, rather than being cleansed after sin, was completely prevented from contracting sin in view of her role as the mother of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race.{{sfn|Sheed|1958|p=134-138}} While the doctrine asserts only Mary's freedom from original sin, the [[Council of Trent]], held between 1545 and 1563, affirmed in addition her freedom from personal sin.{{sfn|Fastiggi|2019|p=455}} \n\nThe doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is not to be confused with the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], more properly termed a virginal conception.{{sfn|Bromiley|1995|p=272}}\n\n==History==\n===Original sin and the veneration of Mary===\n\n[[Original sin]] is not found in the [[Genesis creation narrative|Book of Genesis]] (Judaism does not see human nature as irrevocably tainted,{{sfn|Pies|2000|p=xviii}}), nor in the New Testament,{{sfn|Wiley|2002|pp=171}} and although the [[Apostle Paul]] mentions the \"sin of Adam\", he does not use the term and regards sin and death as the lot of mankind and not a punishment visited on mankind for Adam's fault.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=301}} Christianity had no doctrine on the subject before the 4th century,{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} when [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430 AD) created a theology that eventually became accepted as the official position of the Church, inserting original sin and the Fall into the story of the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Letter to the Romans|Romans 5:12]] although neither use those terms.{{sfn|Obach|2008|pp=41}} Locating sin in male semen, he made it heritable, for only Jesus Christ, conceived without human semen, was free of the original sin passed down from Adam.{{sfn|Stortz|2001|pp=93\u201494}} This sentiment was echoed as late as 1930 by Pope [[Pius XI]] in his ''Casti Conubii'': \"The natural generation of life has become the path of death by which original sin is communicated to the children.\"{{sfn|Obach|2008|pp=43}} \n\nWhile for some early theologians original sin was the consequence of Adam's act, for others it was [[Eve]] who was to blame,{{sfn|Wiley|2002|pp=37}} [[Irenaeus]] (born c.130) writing that \"disobedient Eve\" became \"the cause of death, both for herself and the entire human race\", and [[Ambrose]] (c.340-397) that Eve deceived Adam, while [[Origen]] (184-235) drew the lesson for all womankind: \"God does not stoop to look upon what is feminine and of the flesh.\"{{sfn|Wiley|2002|pp=171}} \n\nMary's mother, [[Saint Anne]], is not mentioned in the New Testament: she first appears in a late 2nd century work called the [[Protevangelium of James]], the author taking her name from [[Hannah]], the mother of the prophet [[Samuel]];Anne and her husband Joachim are each told by an angel that God has heard their prayers for a child, and Mary is conceived and born.{{sfn|Nixon|2004|p=11-12}} The Protevangelium was immensely influential, and the developed Mariological doctrines can be traced to this book.{{sfn|Elliott|1993|p=48}}\n\n===Medieval dispute about the doctrine===\n{{Catholic marian prayers sidebar}}\n\nMary's immaculate conception, along with her bodily [[assumption]] into heaven, were new doctrines in the late medieval period.{{sfn|Cameron|1996|p=336}} [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] in the 12th century raised the question of the Immaculate Conception. A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West. St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of [[Lyon]] for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See. In doing so, he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless, calling it a \"novelty\". Some doubt, however, whether he was using the term \"conception\" in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX. Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother's cooperation, for in his argument he says: \"How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence (''libido'')?\" and stronger expressions follow, which could be interpreted to indicate that he was speaking of the mother and not of the child. Yet, Bernard also decries those who support the feast for trying to \"add to the glories of Mary\", which proves he was indeed talking about Mary.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Immaculate Conception, The |volume=14 |pages=334\u2013335 |first=John |last=Hedley |authorlink=John Hedley (bishop)}}</ref>\n\nSaint [[Thomas Aquinas]] rejected the Immaculate Conception, saying if the Virgin Mary had been sanctified before her conception, she would not have needed the redemption of Christ concluding that \"Blessed Virgin was sanctified after animation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeP7kg-blnIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=summa+theologica+volume&hl=en&ei=RmgsTs_jOou3hAfL8cWqCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22stain%20of%20original%20sin%22&f=false|title=Summa Theologica, Volume 4 (Part III, First Section)|publisher=}}</ref> Aquinas distinguished between first time of conception, animation and birth: with the word \"conception\" is meant the first time of life of the human body, caused by the parents' union (except for the [[Virgin birth of Jesus]]), whereas the term \"[[ensoulment|animation]]\" indicates the following time where a [[soul#Christianity|soul]] is believed to be [[Creationism (soul)|created by God]], and then by Him unified together with the human body. The [[person#person identity|person]] exists only when the body has received its own soul.

Consequently, after Christ, who, as the universal Saviour of all, needed not to be saved, the purity of the Blessed Virgin holds the highest place. For Christ did not contract the original sin in any way whatever, but was holy in His very Conception, according to Luke 1:35: \"The Holy which be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God\".

In 1387 the university of Paris strongly condemned the opposite view.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nScotus's arguments remained controversial, however, particularly among the Dominicans, who were willing enough to celebrate Mary's ''sanctificatio'' (being made free from sin) but, following the Dominican Thomas Aquinas' arguments, continued to insist that her sanctification could not have occurred until after her conception.<ref name=Holweck/>\n\nPopular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary's conception. In 1439, the [[Council of Basel]], which is not reckoned an [[ecumenical council]], stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith. By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties, but such was the influence of the Dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323 and declared \"Doctor Angelicus\" of the Church in 1567) that the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563)\u2014which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine\u2014instead declined to take a position.<ref name=Holweck/><ref name=Schroedel/>\n\n===Definition of the dogma===\n[[File:Lusenberg-Immaculata-1876.jpg|thumb|220px|''Altar of the Immaculata'' by [[Josef Moroder-Lusenberg|Joseph Lusenberg]], 1876.

[[Pope Sixtus IV]], a Franciscan, had tried to pacify the situation by forbidding either side to criticize the other, and placed the feast of the Immaculate Conception on the [[Calendarium Romanum|Roman Calendar]] in 1477, but [[Pope Pius V]], a Dominican, changed it to the feast of the Conception of Mary.

To some medieval viewers, the kiss was a literal representation of the moment of Mary's conception, while for others it was a symbolic representation. The 14th and 15th centuries were the highpoint of these depictions.  Gradually more allegorical depictions of the Immaculate Conception, featuring an adult Mary, replaced this scene in representing the doctrine.<ref>Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}, p. 171</ref>\n\nThe 1476 extension of the [[feast of the Immaculate Conception]] to the entire Latin Church reduced the likelihood of controversy for the artist or patron in depicting an image, so that [[emblem]]s depicting ''The Immaculate Conception'' began to appear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/immac_con_images.html|title=The Immaculate Conception in Images|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMany artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\nThe definitive [[iconography]] for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been finally established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]]. Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.<ref>''\u00c9sot\u00e9risme, gnoses & imaginaire symbolique: m\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} page 676</ref><ref>''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R.

The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1\u20132. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]]. In some paintings the putti are holding [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.<ref>''Our Lady in Art'' by Katherine Lee Rawlings Jenner 2009 {{ISBN|1-103-32689-9}} pages 3\u20139</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Giotto - Scrovegni - -06- - Meeting at the Golden Gate.jpg|Giotto, ''Meeting at the Golden Gate'', 1304\u20131306\nFile:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|[[Piero di Cosimo|di Cosimo]], ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505\nFile:La Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n vista por San Juan Evangelista (Museo de Santa Cruz de Toledo).jpg|[[El Greco]], ''The Immaculate Conception with St John the Evangelist'', {{circa}} 1585\nFile:0 L'Immacul\u00e9e Conception - P.P.
