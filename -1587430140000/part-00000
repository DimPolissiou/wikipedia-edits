The title, based on the comics of ''[[The Walking Dead (comic book)|The Walking Dead]]'', has a strong emphasis on [[cooperative gameplay]]. The game was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 2018 and the console version has been delayed indefinitely. In February 2019, [[Sony]] emailed all pre-order customers to communicate that the [[PlayStation 4]] port had been cancelled. However, shortly after, 505 Games confirmed that the game had not been cancelled for consoles, just postponed. On 26 February, 2019, [[Skybound Entertainment]] terminated their contract with Starbreeze Studio, leading to the discontinuation of all efforts on the game.<ref name=\"cancelled\">{{cite web|url=https://www.skybound.com/games/overkill-the-walking-dead-update/|title=An Update on Overkill\u2019s The Walking Dead|first=Sally|last=Jacka|date=February 26, 2019|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Overkill\u2019s The Walking Dead'' is a [[first-person shooter]] with an emphasis on [[cooperative gameplay]]. The game features four characters, namely Maya, Aidan, Grant, and Heather. Each has their own unique skills and abilities, and players must work together in order to complete their objectives. Set in [[Washington D.C.]], a post-apocalyptic environment which was overran by [[zombie]]s, the game is said to also feature [[Stealth game|stealth]], [[survival horror]] and [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements.<ref name=\"announce\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-14-payday-developer-is-making-a-co-op-the-walking-dead-fps|title=Payday developer Overkill is making a co-op The Walking Dead FPS|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=August 14, 2014|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=February 2020}}\nIn post-apocalypse [[Washington, D.C.]], Anderson Banks loses his wife and daughter. Unable to cope, Anderson becomes suicidal, wanting the walkers to find him. Instead, he is found by Heather Campbell, a former kindergarten teacher. Together, they form a bond and bring more survivors together, eventually setting up Camp Anderson in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]]. The camp survives by scavenging food and supplies from the city and avoiding any dangerous locals, walkers and humans alike. Eventually, they are met by another group called \"The Family,\" who makes Camp Anderson an offer: they can take half of the camp's food and supplies. Anderson gives them a counteroffer: they can leave the way they came. After threats are exchanged, the Family eventually leaves, but not long after, walkers appear and attack the camp. While the camp is successfully defended and barricades are rebuilt, the group learns that the walkers were a distraction, allowing the Family to raid the storehouse, kill some of the group, and steal the water purifier. Unwilling to accept defeat, Anderson orders Heather to lead a group to the Family's hideout and retrieve the purifier.\n\nIn Central Georgetown, Heather goes on a reconnaissance mission with Grant Moore, a seasoned hunter, and they infiltrate an apartment building. Inside an apartment with a good vantage point, Heather kills a walker with her pickax, while Grant uses his silenced sniper rifle to scout the Family's hideout. Through his scope, he sees walkers at the gates, a lot of the Family inside, and the purifier, which has already been installed. Heather then contacts Maya Evans, a former surgeon, via radio. Maya, along with Aidan Hunt, a former architect, infiltrates the hideout on its south side, where they regroup with Heather and Grant. Once inside, Aidan and Maya sneak up on two men and kill them with knives, and Heather quickly kills a third with her scoped crossbow. Maya quickly unhooks the installed purifier while Aidan keeps watch, getting his nailed baseball bat ready. When an armored guard with a riot shield and a revolver notices the dead bodies, spotlights are switched on and Maya is discovered. Heather tosses a smoke grenade at the guard, and Grant shoots the lock at the gates with his rifle, allowing the walkers to enter. With the water purifier retrieved, Maya shoots at the armored guard with her silenced submachine gun, but the guard blocks all shots with the shield. When Aidan attempts to kill him with his bat, he is simply knocked to the ground. Facing Maya again, he is shot at some more, but then Aidan shoots him in the back with a silenced shotgun. Maya helps Aidan up, and the group escapes into the streets with the horde coming after them. Heather fires a flare into the sky for Caleb Bernard, their getaway driver, to find them in his truck.\n\nLater, Camp Anderson is attacked by the Family, attempting to steal supplies. Fortunately, the Family is driven back, but Anderson knows they will not stop coming. Heather suggests they steal a radio from the Family in order to listen in on their plans and prevent anymore surprise attacks. After finding and scouting another outpost in the [[West End, Washington, D.C.|West End]], Heather, Grant, Maya, and Aidan infiltrate it and steal radio parts. With the radio built and working, the information Camp Anderson gains shows suspicious activity at the Family's main base, a former shopping mall in [[Foggy Bottom]]. When the group finds a way into the mall and makes their way to the roof, they instead find hostile soldiers from another group, called \"The Brigade.\" Fighting their way through, the group makes their way inside the mall to find and rescue Reina, the leader of the Family.\n\nBack at Camp Anderson, Reina reveals that the Brigade offered the Family to join them or die. When Reina agreed to join, the Brigade ordered the Family to supply them with a portion of their goods, thus being the reason why the Family continued to attack and raid Camp Anderson. The next morning, the Brigade finds and surrounds the camp. Hurst, their lieutenant, tells Anderson to \"join or die.\" When Heather shows defiance, Hurst shoots her in the eye, killing her. This only angers Anderson and the rest of the camp, so they fight back, aided by Reina. However, the Brigade continues their onslaught, killing and wounding members of the camp and planting bombs, so Anderson decides to evacuate via Caleb's truck with some survivors, while others escape with Reina. After regrouping, Reina says she can radio Sarah Bridger, the leader of a camp in [[Eckington (Washington, D.C.)|Eckington]] who has no love for the Brigade. Bridger agrees to guide the group via radio through the subway underneath [[Dupont Circle]] to make it to Eckington safely.\n\nAt the camp, with limited supplies, Maya can only help so many that were wounded during the attack. However, Reina reveals that the Family had retrieved drugs and antibiotics before the Brigade attacked them, but this supply of medicine is still at the shopping mall in Foggy Bottom, which is now controlled by the Brigade. With Reina, the group infiltrates the shopping mall once again, fighting through Brigade soldiers and hordes of walkers, eventually finding the medical supplies and escaping safely. Once back at the Eckington camp, the group places defenses in preparation for the Brigade's retaliation. When the Brigade attacks, the camp is successfully defended.\n\nNow, Anderson decides to take the fight to the Brigade. Unbeknownst to the Brigade, there is a maintenance tunnel that leads close to their camp at the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Once the camp is infiltrated, the group fights their way through to the Memorial, where they discover Heather's body hung upside down in front of one of the pillars. Continuing on, they find Hurst hiding in a panic room. Once unlocked, the group enters the panic room and kills Hurst. In the aftermath, the Brigade becomes scattered, and Anderson learns that Hurst was only taking orders from a superior named Patterson. But this does not deter Anderson, and he is prepared to fight any enemy that comes against him and his family.\n\n== Development ==\n''Overkill's The Walking Dead'' is developed by [[Overkill Software]]. According to brand director Almir Listo, although the game is a licensed title, Overkill was free to have their own interpretation on the source material and create the game with their own vision. [[Robert Kirkman]], the creator of the comics, was involved in the game's production, providing advice and feedback. Listo added that the game was designed for \"adults\", and the story will explore \"different things emotionally that aren't investigated much by the [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|TV show]]\".<ref name=\"GRadarPreview\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/youre-going-to-own-the-apocalypse-how-overkills-the-walking-dead-will-make-you-excited-about-zombie-games-again/ |title=\"You\u2019re going to own the apocalypse\": How Overkill's The Walking Dead will make you excited about zombie games again|first=Alex|last=Avard|date=April 24, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018|work=[[GamesRadar]]}}</ref> Despite being set in the comic series' universe, the game's four playable characters are original.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/overkills-the-walking-dead-is-a-co-op-first-person-shooter-set-in-the-comic-series-universe/|title=Overkill's The Walking Dead is a co-op first person shooter set in the comic series' universe|first=Shaun|last=Prescott|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=August 21, 2014|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> According to Kirkman, the gameplay will be similar to ''[[Payday: The Heist]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2015/4/29/8518489/overkill-the-walking-dead-505-games-platforms|title=Payday 2 publisher teams up with Overkill for The Walking Dead shooter|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=April 25, 2015|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> Listo noted that the game's gameplay will be similar to the [[raid (gaming)|raids]] featured in ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]''.<ref name=\"GRadarPreview\"/>\n\nThe game was announced on August 14, 2014 by Overkill Software.

The title, based on the comics of ''[[The Walking Dead (comic book)|The Walking Dead]]'', has a strong emphasis on [[cooperative gameplay]]. The game was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 2018 and the console version has been delayed indefinitely. In February 2019, [[Sony]] emailed all pre-order customers to communicate that the [[PlayStation 4]] port had been cancelled. However, shortly after, 505 Games confirmed that the game had not been cancelled for consoles, just postponed. On 26 February, 2019, [[Skybound Entertainment]] terminated their contract with Starbreeze Studio, leading to the discontinuation of all efforts on the game.<ref name=\"cancelled\">{{cite web|url=https://www.skybound.com/games/overkill-the-walking-dead-update/|title=An Update on Overkill\u2019s The Walking Dead|first=Sally|last=Jacka|date=February 26, 2019|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Overkill\u2019s The Walking Dead'' is a [[first-person shooter]] with an emphasis on [[cooperative gameplay]]. The game features four characters, namely Maya, Aidan, Grant, and Heather. Each has their own unique skills and abilities, and players must work together in order to complete their objectives. Set in [[Washington D.C.]], a post-apocalyptic environment which was overran by [[zombie]]s, the game is said to also feature [[Stealth game|stealth]], [[survival horror]] and [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements.<ref name=\"announce\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-14-payday-developer-is-making-a-co-op-the-walking-dead-fps|title=Payday developer Overkill is making a co-op The Walking Dead FPS|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=August 14, 2014|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=February 2020}}\nIn post-apocalypse [[Washington, D.C.]], Anderson Banks loses his wife and daughter. Unable to cope, Anderson becomes suicidal, wanting the walkers to find him. Instead, he is found by Heather Campbell, a former kindergarten teacher. Together, they form a bond and bring more survivors together, eventually setting up Camp Anderson in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]]. The camp survives by scavenging food and supplies from the city and avoiding any dangerous locals, walkers and humans alike. Eventually, they are met by another group called \"The Family,\" who makes Camp Anderson an offer: they can take half of the camp's food and supplies. Anderson gives them a counteroffer: they can leave the way they came. After threats are exchanged, the Family eventually leaves, but not long after, walkers appear and attack the camp. While the camp is successfully defended and barricades are rebuilt, the group learns that the walkers were a distraction, allowing the Family to raid the storehouse, kill some of the group, and steal the water purifier. Unwilling to accept defeat, Anderson orders Heather to lead a group to the Family's hideout and retrieve the purifier.\n\nIn Central Georgetown, Heather goes on a reconnaissance mission with Grant Moore, a seasoned hunter, and they infiltrate an apartment building. Inside an apartment with a good vantage point, Heather kills a walker with her pickax, while Grant uses his silenced sniper rifle to scout the Family's hideout. Through his scope, he sees walkers at the gates, a lot of the Family inside, and the purifier, which has already been installed. Heather then contacts Maya Evans, a former surgeon, via radio. Maya, along with Aidan Hunt, a former architect, infiltrates the hideout on its south side, where they regroup with Heather and Grant. Once inside, Aidan and Maya sneak up on two men and kill them with knives, and Heather quickly kills a third with her scoped crossbow. Maya quickly unhooks the installed purifier while Aidan keeps watch, getting his nailed baseball bat ready. When an armored guard with a riot shield and a revolver notices the dead bodies, spotlights are switched on and Maya is discovered. Heather tosses a smoke grenade at the guard, and Grant shoots the lock at the gates with his rifle, allowing the walkers to enter. With the water purifier retrieved, Maya shoots at the armored guard with her silenced submachine gun, but the guard blocks all shots with the shield. When Aidan attempts to kill him with his bat, he is simply knocked to the ground. Facing Maya again, he is shot at some more, but then Aidan shoots him in the back with a silenced shotgun. Maya helps Aidan up, and the group escapes into the streets with the horde coming after them. Heather fires a flare into the sky for Caleb Bernard, their getaway driver, to find them in his truck.\n\nLater, Camp Anderson is attacked by the Family, attempting to steal supplies. Fortunately, the Family is driven back, but Anderson knows they will not stop coming. Heather suggests they steal a radio from the Family in order to listen in on their plans and prevent anymore surprise attacks. After finding and scouting another outpost in the [[West End, Washington, D.C.|West End]], Heather, Grant, Maya, and Aidan infiltrate it and steal radio parts. With the radio built and working, the information Camp Anderson gains shows suspicious activity at the Family's main base, a former shopping mall in [[Foggy Bottom]]. When the group finds a way into the mall and makes their way to the roof, they instead find hostile soldiers from another group, called \"The Brigade.\" Fighting their way through, the group makes their way inside the mall to find and rescue Reina, the leader of the Family.\n\nBack at Camp Anderson, Reina reveals that the Brigade offered the Family to join them or die. When Reina agreed to join, the Brigade ordered the Family to supply them with a portion of their goods, thus being the reason why the Family continued to attack and raid Camp Anderson. The next morning, the Brigade finds and surrounds the camp. Hurst, their lieutenant, tells Anderson to \"join or die.\" When Heather shows defiance, Hurst shoots her in the eye, killing her. This only angers Anderson and the rest of the camp, so they fight back, aided by Reina. However, the Brigade continues their onslaught, killing and wounding members of the camp and planting bombs, so Anderson decides to evacuate via Caleb's truck with some survivors, while others escape with Reina. After regrouping, Reina says she can radio Sarah Bridger, the leader of a camp in [[Eckington (Washington, D.C.)|Eckington]] who has no love for the Brigade. Bridger agrees to guide the group via radio through the subway underneath [[Dupont Circle]] to make it to Eckington safely.\n\nAt the camp, with limited supplies, Maya can only help so many that were wounded during the attack. However, Reina reveals that the Family had retrieved drugs and antibiotics before the Brigade attacked them, but this supply of medicine is still at the shopping mall in Foggy Bottom, which is now controlled by the Brigade. With Reina, the group infiltrates the shopping mall once again, fighting through Brigade soldiers and hordes of walkers, eventually finding the medical supplies and escaping safely. Once back at the Eckington camp, the group places defenses in preparation for the Brigade's retaliation. When the Brigade attacks, the camp is successfully defended.\n\nNow, Anderson decides to take the fight to the Brigade. Unbeknownst to the Brigade, there is a maintenance tunnel that leads close to their camp at the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Once the camp is infiltrated, the group fights their way through to the Memorial, where they discover Heather's body hung upside down in front of one of the pillars. Continuing on, they find Hurst hiding in a panic room. Once unlocked, the group enters the panic room and kills Hurst. In the aftermath, the Brigade becomes scattered, and Anderson learns that Hurst was only taking orders from a superior named Patterson. But this does not deter Anderson, and he is prepared to fight any enemy that comes against him and his family.\n\n== Development ==\n''Overkill's The Walking Dead'' is developed by [[Overkill Software]]. According to brand director Almir Listo, although the game is a licensed title, Overkill was free to have their own interpretation on the source material and create the game with their own vision. [[Robert Kirkman]], the creator of the comics, was involved in the game's production, providing advice and feedback.

Normal vaginal tissue stains brown due to its high glycogen content, while tissue suspicious for cancer does not stain, and thus appears pale compared to the surrounding tissue.  [[Biopsy]] of suspicious tissue can then be performed. This is called a [[Schiller's test]].\n*Lugol's iodine may also be used to better visualize the [[mucogingival junction]] in the mouth.  Similar to the method of staining mentioned above regarding a colposcopy, [[alveolar mucosa]] has a high glycogen content that gives a positive iodine reaction vs. the [[gingiva|keratinized gingiva]].<ref>Han, J. <u>Changes in Gingival Dimensions Following Connective Tissue Grafts for Root Coverage: Comparison of Two Procedures</u>. ''J Perio'' 2008;79:1346-1354.</ref>\n*Lugol's iodine may also be used as an oxidizing [[germicide]], however it is somewhat undesirable in that it may lead to scarring and discolors the skin temporarily. One way to avoid this problem is by using a solution of 70% ethanol to wash off the iodine later.\n*Lugol's iodine was distributed in [[Polish People's Republic]] after [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl catastrophe]], due to government not being informed of how severe the event was and overestimating radiation, and unavailbility of iodine tablets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archiwum.wiz.pl/1996/96052000.asp|title=JAK TO Z CZARNOBYLEM BY\u0141O - ZBIGNIEW JAWORSKI - Wiedza i \u017bycie - 5/1996|website=archiwum.wiz.pl|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>\n\n===Science===\n*As a [[mordant]] when performing a [[Gram stain]]. It is applied for 1 minute after staining with [[crystal violet]], but before ethanol to ensure that gram positive organisms' peptidoglycan remains stained, easily identifying it as a gram positive in microscopy.\n*This solution is used as an indicator test for the presence of [[starch]]es in [[organic compounds]], with which it reacts by turning a dark-blue/black.  Elemental iodine solutions like Lugol's will stain starches due to iodine's interaction with the coil structure of the [[polysaccharide]].  Starches include the plant starches amylose and amylopectin and glycogen in animal cells.  Lugol's solution will not detect simple sugars such as [[glucose]] or [[fructose]]. In the pathologic condition [[amyloidosis]], amyloid deposits (i.e., deposits that stain like starch, but are not) can be so abundant that affected organs will also stain grossly positive for the Lugol reaction for starch.\n*It can be used as a cell [[staining (biology)|stain]], making the [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]] more visible and for preserving phytoplankton samples.\n*Lugol's solution can also be used in various experiments to observe how a [[cell membrane]] uses [[osmosis]] and diffusion.\n*Lugol's solution is also used in the marine aquarium industry. Lugol's solution provides a strong source of free iodine and iodide to reef inhabitants and macroalgae. Although the solution is thought to be effective when used with stony [[coral]]s, systems containing xenia and soft corals are assumed to be particularly benefited by the use of Lugol's solution. Used as a dip for stony and soft or leather corals, Lugol's may help rid the animals of unwanted parasites and harmful bacteria. The solution is thought to foster improved coloration and possibly prevent bleaching of corals due to changes in light intensity, and to enhance coral [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]] expansion. The blue colors of ''Acropora'' spp. are thought to be intensified by the use of potassium iodide. Specially packaged supplements of the product intended for aquarium use can be purchased at specialty stores and online.\n\n== Side effects ==\nBecause it contains free iodine, Lugol's solution at 2% or 5% concentration without dilution is irritating and destructive to mucosa, such as the lining of the esophagus and stomach. Doses of 10 mL of undiluted 5% solution have been reported to cause gastric lesions when used in endoscopy.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Sreedharan|date=June 2005 |title=Acute toxic gastric mucosal damage induced by Lugol's iodine spray during chromoendoscopy |journal=Gut |volume= 54 |issue=6 |pages=886\u2013887 |doi=10.1136/gut.2004.061739|display-authors=etal |pmid=15888800 |pmc=1774547}}</ref> The LD50 for 5% Iodine is 14,000&nbsp;mg/kg (14 g/kg) [rat] and 22,000&nbsp;mg/kg (22 g/kg) [mouse].<ref>{{cite web |title= Material Safety Data Sheet Iodine Solution, 5% MSDS |url= http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9924378 |accessdate= 2016-09-29 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161206074306/http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9924378 |archivedate= 2016-12-06 }}</ref>\n\nThe World Health Organization classifies substances taken orally with an LD50 of 5\u201350&nbsp;mg/kg as the second highest toxicity class, Class Ib (Highly Hazardous).<ref>{{citation |title= The WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard |author= International Programme on Chemical Safety |publisher= World Health Organization |url= http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/pesticides_hazard_2009.pdf?ua=1 |year= 2009 |accessdate= 2016-09-28 |page= 5 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170510071955/http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/pesticides_hazard_2009.pdf?ua=1 |archivedate= 2017-05-10 }}</ref> The Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals categorizes this as Category 2 with a hazard statement \"Fatal if swallowed\".<ref>{{citation |title= A Guide to The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) |publisher= US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) |url= https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghsguideoct05.pdf |accessdate= 2016-09-28 |page= 42 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161203012935/https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghsguideoct05.pdf |archivedate= 2016-12-03 }}</ref> Potassium iodide is not considered hazardous.<ref>[http://www.esciencelabs.com/files/andrea.rex/Iodine_Potassium_Iodide.pdf Esciencelabs.com ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214220/http://www.esciencelabs.com/files/andrea.rex/Iodine_Potassium_Iodide.pdf |date=March 3, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nThese uses are possible since the solution is a source of effectively free elemental iodine, which is readily generated from the equilibrium between elemental iodine molecules and [[polyiodide]] ions in the solution.\n\n==History==\nIt was historically used as a first-line treatment for [[hyperthyroidism]], as the administration of pharmacologic amounts of iodine leads to temporary inhibition of iodine organification in the thyroid gland, a phenomenon called the [[Wolff\u2013Chaikoff effect]]. However it is not used to treat certain autoimmune causes of thyroid disease as iodine-induced blockade of iodine [[organification]] may result in [[hypothyroidism]]. They are not considered as a first line therapy because of possible induction of resistant hyperthyroidism but may be considered as an adjuvant therapy when used together with other hyperthyroidism medications.\n\nLugol's iodine has been used traditionally to replenish iodine deficiency. Because of its wide availability as a drinking-water decontaminant, and high content of potassium iodide, emergency use of it was at first recommended to the Polish government in 1986, after the [[Chernobyl disaster]] to replace and block any intake of radioactive {{chem|link=Iodine-131|131|I}}, even though it was known to be a non-optimal agent, due to its somewhat toxic free-iodine content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wonuc.org/xfiles/chern_02.html  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050302210725/http://www.wonuc.org/xfiles/chern_02.html |url-status=dead  |archive-date=2 March 2005  |title=Chernobyl: the Biggest BLUFF of the 20th Century |last=Rotkiewicz  |first=Marcin |author2=Henryk Suchar |author3=Ryszard Kami\u00f1ski |date=14 January 2001 |publisher=Polish weekly Wprost |pages=no&nbsp;2 |accessdate=2008-06-18  }}</ref> Other sources state that pure [[potassium iodide]] solution in water ([[SSKI]]) was eventually used for most of the thyroid protection after this accident.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdflumanual.com/resources/Self_Defense/files/Guidance%20for%20use%20of%20KI%20for%20nuclear%20emergency%20USG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910170031/http://www.birdflumanual.com/resources/Self_Defense/files/Guidance%20for%20use%20of%20KI%20for%20nuclear%20emergency%20USG.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-10 }} US FDA, \"Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies,\" U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER); December, 2001.</ref>  There is \"strong scientific evidence\" for potassium iodide thyroid protection to help prevent [[thyroid cancer]].

Normal vaginal tissue stains brown due to its high glycogen content, while tissue suspicious for cancer does not stain, and thus appears pale compared to the surrounding tissue.  [[Biopsy]] of suspicious tissue can then be performed. This is called a [[Schiller's test]].\n*Lugol's iodine may also be used to better visualize the [[mucogingival junction]] in the mouth.  Similar to the method of staining mentioned above regarding a colposcopy, [[alveolar mucosa]] has a high glycogen content that gives a positive iodine reaction vs. the [[gingiva|keratinized gingiva]].<ref>Han, J. <u>Changes in Gingival Dimensions Following Connective Tissue Grafts for Root Coverage: Comparison of Two Procedures</u>. ''J Perio'' 2008;79:1346-1354.</ref>\n*Lugol's iodine may also be used as an oxidizing [[germicide]], however it is somewhat undesirable in that it may lead to scarring and discolors the skin temporarily. One way to avoid this problem is by using a solution of 70% ethanol to wash off the iodine later.\n*Lugol's iodine was distributed in [[Polish People's Republic]] after [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl catastrophe]], due to government not being informed of how severe the event was and overestimating radiation, and unavailbility of iodine tablets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archiwum.wiz.pl/1996/96052000.asp|title=JAK TO Z CZARNOBYLEM BY\u0141O - ZBIGNIEW JAWORSKI - Wiedza i \u017bycie - 5/1996|website=archiwum.wiz.pl|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>\n\n===Science===\n*As a [[mordant]] when performing a [[Gram stain]]. It is applied for 1 minute after staining with [[crystal violet]], but before ethanol to ensure that gram positive organisms' peptidoglycan remains stained, easily identifying it as a gram positive in microscopy.\n*This solution is used as an indicator test for the presence of [[starch]]es in [[organic compounds]], with which it reacts by turning a dark-blue/black.  Elemental iodine solutions like Lugol's will stain starches due to iodine's interaction with the coil structure of the [[polysaccharide]].  Starches include the plant starches amylose and amylopectin and glycogen in animal cells.  Lugol's solution will not detect simple sugars such as [[glucose]] or [[fructose]]. In the pathologic condition [[amyloidosis]], amyloid deposits (i.e., deposits that stain like starch, but are not) can be so abundant that affected organs will also stain grossly positive for the Lugol reaction for starch.\n*It can be used as a cell [[staining (biology)|stain]], making the [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]] more visible and for preserving phytoplankton samples.\n*Lugol's solution can also be used in various experiments to observe how a [[cell membrane]] uses [[osmosis]] and diffusion.\n*Lugol's solution is also used in the marine aquarium industry. Lugol's solution provides a strong source of free iodine and iodide to reef inhabitants and macroalgae. Although the solution is thought to be effective when used with stony [[coral]]s, systems containing xenia and soft corals are assumed to be particularly benefited by the use of Lugol's solution. Used as a dip for stony and soft or leather corals, Lugol's may help rid the animals of unwanted parasites and harmful bacteria. The solution is thought to foster improved coloration and possibly prevent bleaching of corals due to changes in light intensity, and to enhance coral [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]] expansion. The blue colors of ''Acropora'' spp. are thought to be intensified by the use of potassium iodide. Specially packaged supplements of the product intended for aquarium use can be purchased at specialty stores and online.\n\n== Side effects ==\nBecause it contains free iodine, Lugol's solution at 2% or 5% concentration without dilution is irritating and destructive to mucosa, such as the lining of the esophagus and stomach. Doses of 10 mL of undiluted 5% solution have been reported to cause gastric lesions when used in endoscopy.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Sreedharan|date=June 2005 |title=Acute toxic gastric mucosal damage induced by Lugol's iodine spray during chromoendoscopy |journal=Gut |volume= 54 |issue=6 |pages=886\u2013887 |doi=10.1136/gut.2004.061739|display-authors=etal |pmid=15888800 |pmc=1774547}}</ref> The LD50 for 5% Iodine is 14,000&nbsp;mg/kg (14 g/kg) [rat] and 22,000&nbsp;mg/kg (22 g/kg) [mouse].<ref>{{cite web |title= Material Safety Data Sheet Iodine Solution, 5% MSDS |url= http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9924378 |accessdate= 2016-09-29 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161206074306/http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9924378 |archivedate= 2016-12-06 }}</ref>\n\nThe World Health Organization classifies substances taken orally with an LD50 of 5\u201350&nbsp;mg/kg as the second highest toxicity class, Class Ib (Highly Hazardous).<ref>{{citation |title= The WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard |author= International Programme on Chemical Safety |publisher= World Health Organization |url= http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/pesticides_hazard_2009.pdf?ua=1 |year= 2009 |accessdate= 2016-09-28 |page= 5 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170510071955/http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/pesticides_hazard_2009.pdf?ua=1 |archivedate= 2017-05-10 }}</ref> The Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals categorizes this as Category 2 with a hazard statement \"Fatal if swallowed\".<ref>{{citation |title= A Guide to The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) |publisher= US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) |url= https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghsguideoct05.pdf |accessdate= 2016-09-28 |page= 42 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161203012935/https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghsguideoct05.pdf |archivedate= 2016-12-03 }}</ref> Potassium iodide is not considered hazardous.<ref>[http://www.esciencelabs.com/files/andrea.rex/Iodine_Potassium_Iodide.pdf Esciencelabs.com ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214220/http://www.esciencelabs.com/files/andrea.rex/Iodine_Potassium_Iodide.pdf |date=March 3, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nThese uses are possible since the solution is a source of effectively free elemental iodine, which is readily generated from the equilibrium between elemental iodine molecules and [[polyiodide]] ions in the solution.\n\n==History==\nIt was historically used as a first-line treatment for [[hyperthyroidism]], as the administration of pharmacologic amounts of iodine leads to temporary inhibition of iodine organification in the thyroid gland, a phenomenon called the [[Wolff\u2013Chaikoff effect]]. However it is not used to treat certain autoimmune causes of thyroid disease as iodine-induced blockade of iodine [[organification]] may result in [[hypothyroidism]]. They are not considered as a first line therapy because of possible induction of resistant hyperthyroidism but may be considered as an adjuvant therapy when used together with other hyperthyroidism medications.\n\nLugol's iodine has been used traditionally to replenish iodine deficiency. Because of its wide availability as a drinking-water decontaminant, and high content of potassium iodide, emergency use of it was at first recommended to the Polish government in 1986, after the [[Chernobyl disaster]] to replace and block any intake of radioactive {{chem|link=Iodine-131|131|I}}, even though it was known to be a non-optimal agent, due to its somewhat toxic free-iodine content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wonuc.org/xfiles/chern_02.html  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050302210725/http://www.wonuc.org/xfiles/chern_02.html |url-status=dead  |archive-date=2 March 2005  |title=Chernobyl: the Biggest BLUFF of the 20th Century |last=Rotkiewicz  |first=Marcin |author2=Henryk Suchar |author3=Ryszard Kami\u00f1ski |date=14 January 2001 |publisher=Polish weekly Wprost |pages=no&nbsp;2 |accessdate=2008-06-18  }}</ref> Other sources state that pure [[potassium iodide]] solution in water ([[SSKI]]) was eventually used for most of the thyroid protection after this accident.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdflumanual.com/resources/Self_Defense/files/Guidance%20for%20use%20of%20KI%20for%20nuclear%20emergency%20USG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910170031/http://www.birdflumanual.com/resources/Self_Defense/files/Guidance%20for%20use%20of%20KI%20for%20nuclear%20emergency%20USG.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-10 }} US FDA, \"Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies,\" U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER); December, 2001.</ref>  There is \"strong scientific evidence\" for potassium iodide thyroid protection to help prevent [[thyroid cancer]].
