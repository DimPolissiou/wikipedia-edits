Until then the Finnish icebreakers had been designed solely for escort operations in ice-infested waters and their specialized hull form was not suitable for open water. As a result the existing icebreakers had an effective operational time of only three to five months per year and spent the summer season moored at [[Katajanokka]] in [[Helsinki]]. A multipurpose application of the new icebreakers would thus result in a better utilization of the vessels and, assuming they were chartered by a commercial third party during the summer, improve the economics of the state-owned fleet.<ref name=\"tellefsen\">Tellefsen, T.P.

Until then the Finnish icebreakers had been designed solely for escort operations in ice-infested waters and their specialized hull form was not suitable for open water. As a result the existing icebreakers had an effective operational time of only three to five months per year and spent the summer season moored at [[Katajanokka]] in [[Helsinki]]. A multipurpose application of the new icebreakers would thus result in a better utilization of the vessels and, assuming they were chartered by a commercial third party during the summer, improve the economics of the state-owned fleet.<ref name=\"tellefsen\">Tellefsen, T.P.

An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980, with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nOn February 26, 1980, Fiat presented the Panda to President [[Sandro Pertini]], in the gardens of Rome's [[Quirinal Palace]], and the car officially debuted in Geneva on March 5th \u2014 carrying the ''Panda'' name. \n\nIn the two months following the Geneva motor show, Fiat received over 70,000 orders for the Panda.\n\n===Design===\nItaldesign's work highlighted utilitarian practicality throughout the design. Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The Active model also received new darker seat fabrics of better quality and the addition of a CD player as standard. The new dark red Fiat badge replaced the blue roundel on the Panda in Summer 2007.\n\n===2009 revisions===\nThe Panda range was mildly rearranged again in 2009, with the addition of Active Eco and Dynamic Eco models. These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel. Fiat did not say which country it was headed to.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fiat builds 2,000,000 Panda in Polish plant|url=http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019113456/http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-builds-2000000-panda-in-polish-plant/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-10-19|publisher=European Car News}}</ref>\n\n===Panda Classic===\nThe Panda Classic<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |title=Fiat panda Classic |language=it |publisher=Quattroruote.it |accessdate=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723012958/http://www.quattroruote.it/notizie/auto-novita/fiat-panda-classic-prezzo-di-lancio-da-7900-euro |archivedate=23 July 2012  }}</ref> was a second series Fiat Panda renamed and with a reduced list price to distinguish it from the new generation introduced in late 2011. The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto).

The new architecture is based on the [[Fiat Mini platform]]. The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda. Unlike the previous generation - which adopted a 70 PS 1.4 ''[[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]]'' inline four - it is powered by the turbocharged, 0.9 liter, two-cylinder ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine.

Due to the cylinders being both located under the [[floorpan]], the boot's volume is reduced only by 25 liters - 200 L instead of the monofuel's 225. On the other hand, this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.

The ELD works automatically by braking the wheel(s) where the ESC sensors detect excessive wheel slip, thus making the differentials more torque to the wheels in better traction conditions; this functionality is useful on low-grip surfaces, and is activated by the driver via a console switch.<ref name=\"fiatpress 4x4\" />\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda Cross\n}}\n\n====Panda Cross====\nLaunched at the 2014 [[Geneva Motor Show]], it is the range topping, offroad-styled Panda.

On response cards distributed by FIAT's sales department, participants gauged the design's exterior and interior appearance and finish, spaciousness, instruments and controls, engine size, price, and its provisional name: ''Rustica''.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nIn January 1979, production was delayed by protracted union negotiations, specifically over Fiat's plans to move production from plants in Cassino, Sulmona and Termini Imerese to Turin and Desio. An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980, with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nOn February 26, 1980, Fiat presented the Panda to President [[Sandro Pertini]], in the gardens of Rome's [[Quirinal Palace]], and the car officially debuted in Geneva on March 5th \u2014 carrying the ''Panda'' name. \n\nIn the two months following the Geneva motor show, Fiat received over 70,000 orders for the Panda.\n\n===Design===\nItaldesign's work highlighted utilitarian practicality throughout the design. Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Seat covers, door trim could be removed and washed. Likewise, the dashboard used a padded, washable fabric supported by a simple tube, creating a long, flexible storage pocket. \n\nLuigi Maglione, Fiat's marketing strategist, was perplexed when first seeing the interior design, suggesting the interior mock=up was missing. Fiat's new CEO, Nicola Tufarelli clarified that the rustic interiors were in fact the final design, ready for launch.<ref name=\"stampa01\">{{cite web\n |title        = Forty years of Panda: the secret stories of the Fiat city car\n |publisher    = La Stampa\n |author       =\n |date         = October 12, 2019\n |url          = https://translate.google.it/translate?hl=it&sl=it&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastampa.it%2Fmotori%2Fattualita%2F2020%2F02%2F25%2Fnews%2Fl-alfa-romeo-torna-a-pomigliano-d-arco-produrra-la-tonale-dal-2021-1.38516408}}</ref>\n\nWith an overall aerodynamic coefficient, despite the blocky shape, better than the [[Fiat 127]]'s,<ref name=\"stampa01\"/> the first Pandas featured a recess in the adjacent bodywork rather than door handles;<ref name=\"tribe1\"/> and completely flat glass in all windows \u2014 weighing less and making them inexpensive to manufacture, as well as easy to replace and interchangeable left to right.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]].

The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

Built in 1890 by [[Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads|Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads AB]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, she was the first state-owned icebreaker of Finland and one of the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world.<ref name=\"history\">Jones, S. A history of icebreaking ships. Ocean Sovereignty, Vol. 3, No. 1, 2008. Page 55.</ref> ''Murtaja'' remained in service for 68 years until she was decommissioned and broken up in 1958 after having been replaced by the [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] ''[[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|Karhu]]''.\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe history of winter navigation in Finland dates back to the 17th century when mail was carried year-round between [[Turku]], Finland and [[Grisslehamn]], Sweden, over the [[Sea of \u00c5land]]. During the winter season, the postmen used ice boats, strengthened sleigh-boats that were pushed over the ice until it gave in under the weight of the boat. Once in water, the men began rocking the boat back and forth until it slowly began to break the ice and proceed towards open water. The mail route was often called the most dangerous in Europe.<ref name=\"laurell14\">Laurell 1992, p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s there were plans to start year-round traffic from the [[Hanko]], the southernmost tip of the continental Finland, but even people in the [[Finnish Pilot and Lighthouse Authority]] were doubtful about the project \u2013 the director's aide was quoted saying that this close to the [[60th parallel north]] winter traffic to Hanko would forever be a distant dream. Despite the opposition, a harbour and railway connection were built in 1872\u201373. Several domestic and foreign shipping companies attempted year-round traffic with varying commercial success, but the port of Hanko remained closed for several months nearly every year.<ref name=\"laurell17-19\">Laurell 1992, p. 17-19.</ref>\n\nIn 1889, the Finnish factory owners encouraged the [[Denmark|Danish]] shipping company [[Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab]] to send their icebreaker, ''[[Bryderen]]'', to the northern [[Baltic Sea]] and try to open a path to the icebound port of Hanko. ''Bryderen'', the most powerful icebreaker in Europe at that time, had {{convert|1000|ihp|kW|abbr=on|adj=on}} steam engine and could easily break ice up to {{convert|45|cm|in|0}} thick. As word got around, people in the [[Senate of Finland]] became interested in the experiment as its result would affect the general opinions regarding icebreakers and winter navigation.<ref name=\"laurell23-24\">Laurell 1992, p. 23-24.</ref>\n\nOn 16 April 1889, two steamships were spotted approaching the lighthouse of [[Russar\u00f6]] from the south and news about unidentified vessels coming through the ice field began spreading immediately. The ships were the icebreaker ''Bryderen'' and a 912-ton cargo steamer ''Vesuv'',<ref name=\"ramsay142\">Ramsay 1949, p. 142.</ref> owned by the Danish shipping company, that was following on the channel broken by the icebreaker. During the following night, the icebreaker lost all four propeller blades, but once the replacement blades had been installed, the convoy arrived at the port of Hanko on 20 April 1889 at 13:00. Large headlines in the major Finnish newspapers reported how the ice blockade had finally been broken \u2014 a foreign icebreaker had come through the ice and was now moored at a Finnish port.<ref name=\"laurell24-26\">Laurell 1992, p. 24-26.</ref> The successful arrival of ''Bryderen'' was seen as the definite answer to the question whether or not an icebreaker would be needed in Finland.<ref name=\"ramsay144\">Ramsay 1949, p. 144.</ref>\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nShortly after the visit of ''Bryderen'', the Senate sent a call for bids for several Finnish and foreign shipyards for the construction of a steam-powered icebreaker capable of breaking a {{convert|32|ft|m|1|adj=on}} channel. Bids for a single-screw \"European-type\" icebreaker similar to the German icebreaker ''[[Eisbrecher I]]'' were received from German shipbuilder [[AG Vulcan Stettin]], Danish [[Burmeister & Wain]] and Swedish shipyards [[Kockums|Kockums AB]] and Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads AB. An expert committee appointed by the Senate recommended the second Swedish design, which was the second cheapest at 445,000 [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]], and the contract was signed with Bergsundet on 25 May 1889.<ref name=\"laurell29-33\" />\n\nThe construction of the icebreaker began on 18 August 1889 and she was launched on 23 December. On the same day she was given the name ''Murtaja'' after her German, Swedish and Danish counterparts \u2013 each country had named their first icebreaker simply ''Icebreaker'' in their own language.<ref name=\"laurell29-33\" /><ref name=\"ramsay147-148\">Ramsay 1949, p. 147-148.</ref>\n\n[[File:Icebreaker Murtaja on Trials.jpg|thumb|left|''Murtaja'' on sea trials in late March 1890.]]\n\nThe [[sea trials]] on 23\u201326 March 1890 were witnessed by a group of experts, among them the Finnish-Swedish [[arctic explorer]] [[Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld]], the first person to complete a voyage through the [[Northern Sea Route]]. During these trials ''Murtaja'' passed all but one of the tests for performance and general [[seaworthiness]]. Her draught at full load exceeded the contract specification by {{convert|1|ft|6|in|m}}, meaning that either her specialized hull form could not be fully utilized in icebreaking or the coal capacity would have to be reduced, affecting her range and endurance.<ref name=\"ramsay150\">Ramsay 1949, p. 150.</ref> However, the shipyard promised to do everything it could to reduce the draught of the vessel to an acceptable level and ''Murtaja'', the largest and most powerful European icebreaker at that time, was delivered to the owner on 30 March 1890. She left the shipyard on the following day and headed to Helsinki, where she was welcomed by a large cheering crowd on 2 April 1890.<ref name=\"laurell36\" /><ref name=\"ramsay152-153\">Ramsay 1949, p. 152-153.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Murtaja in Land och Stad.JPG|thumb|right|Drawing of ''Murtaja'' published in the Finnish newspaper [[Land och Stad]] on 16 April 1890, two weeks after she arrived to Finland.]]\n[[File:MECHELIN(1894) p033 The Ice-Breaker MURTAJA.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of ''Murtaja'' published in 1894.]]\n\n''Murtaja'' was given the task of assisting ships to the port of Hanko. In the temporary directive, given on 5 February 1890, she was to maintain an open channel between the harbour and open water, and assist inbound and outbound ships by towing if necessary. The directive also gave some of the first guidelines for icebreakers regarding for example the qualifications required from the crew.<ref name=\"laurell34\">Laurell 1992, p. 34.</ref> When ''Murtaja'' arrived in Helsinki in early April, most of the ice had already melted and the new icebreaker was not taken into service. She returned to Finnboda for repairs under warranty in May and remained in the shipyard until mid-August.<ref name=\"laurell39-41\">Laurell 1992, p. 39-41.</ref>\n\nThe winter of 1890\u20131891 was mild, so ''Murtaja'' could not demonstrate her icebreaking capabilities to their full extent. However, she lost a large number of cast iron propeller blades and while the replacement blades could be installed at sea by trimming the vessel so that the propeller shaft was near the water surface, the heavy task took several days. For this reason the [[Helsinki Polytechnics]] later developed more durable steel blades that were also used in the subsequent icebreakers.<ref name=\"laurell42-43\">Laurell 1992, p. 42-43.</ref>\n\nDuring the first normal winters the icebreaking capability of ''Murtaja'' could be determined. She could break level ice up to {{convert|47|cm|in|0}} thick in continuous motion as long as there was no snow, in which case even {{convert|25|cm|in|0|adj=on}} ice required backing and ramming. In this method the ship was reversed two to four ship lengths before ordering full ahead, after which the ship could break new channel up to six ship lengths, almost {{convert|150|m|ft|0}}. However, in more difficult ice conditions each ramming would move the ship forwards only {{convert|10|m|ft|0|}}. In snow-covered ice and drift ice ''Murtaja'' could not operate efficiently due to her inefficient hull form. Sometimes the crew had to rely on hacking and sawing the ice or even explosives to release the ship from compressive ice fields.<ref name=\"laurell44-46\">Laurell 1992, p. 44-46.</ref>\n\nDespite her efforts the 930-ton single-screw ''Murtaja'' was not deemed powerful enough to keep the southernmost port of Finland open every winter, and the winter navigation committee appointed by the Senate came to a conclusion that a second icebreaker would be needed.<ref name=\"laurell52\">Laurell 1992, p. 52.</ref> The new icebreaker, equipped with propellers in both bow and stern, was built in 1898 and given the name [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']].<ref name=\"laurell58-59\">Laurell 1992, p. 58-59.</ref>\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nIn August 1914 [[Russian Empire|Russia]] joined the [[First World War]] and navigating in the Baltic Sea became dangerous due to [[naval mine]]s and [[Kaiserliche Marine|German]] [[U-boat]]s. The Finnish icebreakers were placed under the command of the [[Baltic Fleet]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and given the task of assisting naval ships and troop transportations in the Gulf of Finland. ''Murtaja'' was stationed with ''Sampo'' in the southern parts of the Archipelago Sea and between Turku and [[Mariehamn]]. Icebreaker assistance to merchant ships was largely neglected and the icebreakers often carried supplies for the Russian troops.<ref name=\"laurell91-93\">Laurell 1992, p. 91-93.</ref>\n\nOn 6 December 1917 the [[Parliament of Finland]] accepted the declaration of independence given by the Senate and on 29 December the icebreakers ''Murtaja'' and ''Sampo'' raised the [[flag of Finland|state flag of the independent Finland]] for the first time. However, already in early January 1918 the ship was seized by the Russian revolutionary fleet and ordered to assist the Russian troops stationed in Finland. From the beginning the Finnish officials attempted to negotiate the return of the icebreaker, but it wasn't until 5 April 1918 before ''Murtaja'' was handed back to Finland.<ref name=\"laurell99-102\">Laurell 1991, p. 99-102.</ref>\n\n''Murtaja'' survived the war without major damage and continued in service through the [[interwar period]]. As new icebreakers entered service in the 1920s, she was stationed in Turku, the second official winter port.<ref name=\"laurell158\">Laurell 1992, p. 158.</ref>\n\n=== Second World War ===\n[[File:Murtaja during Continuation War.jpg|thumb|left|Camouflage painting of ''Murtaja'' during the [[Continuation War]].]]\n\nDue to the worsening relations with the [[Soviet Union]], ''Murtaja'' and other state-owned icebreakers were armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker fleet shortly before the [[Winter War]] began on 30 November 1939. The Finnish icebreakers had been equipped with gun mounts already in the 1920s and were armed with light artillery. ''Murtaja'' spent the early stages of the war in [[Viipuri]] and assisted supply ships to the port of [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Koivisto]].<ref name=\"laurell259-260\">Laurell 1992, p. 259-260.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] began on 25 June 1941, the Finnish icebreakers were re-armed and their anti-aircraft armament was improved. On 20 July, while guarding a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets#Motti|motti]] in the [[Battle of Hanko (1941)|Hanko Front]], the camouflaged ''Murtaja'' was attacked by a group of Soviet [[fighter-bomber]]s. None of the planes scored a direct hit, but the nearby explosions caused severe damage to the engine and fittings. On the following day ''Murtaja'' was towed to [[Crichton-Vulcan]] shipyard in [[Turku]] for repairs.<ref name=\"laurell282-284\">Laurell 1992, p. 282-284.</ref> Later the front moved east and the icebreaker fleet was disbanded in December 1941, after which some of the armament was removed and the icebreakers resumed their normal peacetime duties.<ref name=\"laurell286\">Laurell 1992, p. 286.</ref> For the remainder of the war ''Murtaja'' assisted ships without major incidents.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Decommissioning ===\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Murtaja 1850s.jpg|thumb|''Murtaja'' photographed shortly before retiring in the late 1950s.]]\n\n''Murtaja'' was often criticized for her poor performance in difficult ice conditions and she was deemed old and obsolete already in 1906.<ref name=\"ramsay175-176\" /> Selling her was set as a prerequisite for ordering a new icebreaker, but while several foreign ports were interested in purchasing ''Murtaja'', in September 1906 the Senate decided to order the third state-owned icebreaker, [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']], without selling the old one.<ref name=\"laurell72\">Laurell 1992, p. 72.</ref> As more modern icebreakers entered service in the 1920s, ''Murtaja'' was again deemed obsolete and worn-out, and she was criticized for her high operating costs. She was said to be in need of complete overhaul and rebuilding in 1926, but the Finnish Board of Navigation did not agree to this until almost ten years later, although it noted that decommissioning her would probably be a better solution.<ref name=\"ramsay175-176\">Ramsay 1949, p. 175-176.</ref>\n\nDespite the criticism, ''Murtaja'' remained in service through the First and Second World Wars until the late 1950s, although during her last years in service her assistance in the [[Archipelago Sea]] was described being \"more of a moral nature\".<ref name=\"laurell330\">Laurell 1992, p. 330.</ref> The renewal of the Finnish icebreaker fleet began in 1952 after the [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union]] had been paid, and the first post-war icebreaker, [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|''Voima'']], was commissioned in 1953. When the harsh winters of the 1950s showed that modern icebreakers were needed, a series of smaller diesel-electric icebreakers were built for operations within the archipelago. The first steam-powered icebreaker to be decommissioned was the old ''Murtaja'', which was decommissioned on 3 May 1958 after almost 70 years of service. She was replaced by the new diesel-electric [[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|''Karhu'']] and broken up shortly afterwards.

Built in 1890 by [[Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads|Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads AB]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, she was the first state-owned icebreaker of Finland and one of the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world.<ref name=\"history\">Jones, S. A history of icebreaking ships. Ocean Sovereignty, Vol. 3, No. 1, 2008. Page 55.</ref> ''Murtaja'' remained in service for 68 years until she was decommissioned and broken up in 1958 after having been replaced by the [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] ''[[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|Karhu]]''.\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe history of winter navigation in Finland dates back to the 17th century when mail was carried year-round between [[Turku]], Finland and [[Grisslehamn]], Sweden, over the [[Sea of \u00c5land]]. During the winter season, the postmen used ice boats, strengthened sleigh-boats that were pushed over the ice until it gave in under the weight of the boat. Once in water, the men began rocking the boat back and forth until it slowly began to break the ice and proceed towards open water. The mail route was often called the most dangerous in Europe.<ref name=\"laurell14\">Laurell 1992, p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s there were plans to start year-round traffic from the [[Hanko]], the southernmost tip of the continental Finland, but even people in the [[Finnish Pilot and Lighthouse Authority]] were doubtful about the project \u2013 the director's aide was quoted saying that this close to the [[60th parallel north]] winter traffic to Hanko would forever be a distant dream. Despite the opposition, a harbour and railway connection were built in 1872\u201373. Several domestic and foreign shipping companies attempted year-round traffic with varying commercial success, but the port of Hanko remained closed for several months nearly every year.<ref name=\"laurell17-19\">Laurell 1992, p. 17-19.</ref>\n\nIn 1889, the Finnish factory owners encouraged the [[Denmark|Danish]] shipping company [[Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab]] to send their icebreaker, ''[[Bryderen]]'', to the northern [[Baltic Sea]] and try to open a path to the icebound port of Hanko. ''Bryderen'', the most powerful icebreaker in Europe at that time, had {{convert|1000|ihp|kW|abbr=on|adj=on}} steam engine and could easily break ice up to {{convert|45|cm|in|0}} thick. As word got around, people in the [[Senate of Finland]] became interested in the experiment as its result would affect the general opinions regarding icebreakers and winter navigation.<ref name=\"laurell23-24\">Laurell 1992, p. 23-24.</ref>\n\nOn 16 April 1889, two steamships were spotted approaching the lighthouse of [[Russar\u00f6]] from the south and news about unidentified vessels coming through the ice field began spreading immediately. The ships were the icebreaker ''Bryderen'' and a 912-ton cargo steamer ''Vesuv'',<ref name=\"ramsay142\">Ramsay 1949, p. 142.</ref> owned by the Danish shipping company, that was following on the channel broken by the icebreaker. During the following night, the icebreaker lost all four propeller blades, but once the replacement blades had been installed, the convoy arrived at the port of Hanko on 20 April 1889 at 13:00. Large headlines in the major Finnish newspapers reported how the ice blockade had finally been broken \u2014 a foreign icebreaker had come through the ice and was now moored at a Finnish port.<ref name=\"laurell24-26\">Laurell 1992, p. 24-26.</ref> The successful arrival of ''Bryderen'' was seen as the definite answer to the question whether or not an icebreaker would be needed in Finland.<ref name=\"ramsay144\">Ramsay 1949, p. 144.</ref>\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nShortly after the visit of ''Bryderen'', the Senate sent a call for bids for several Finnish and foreign shipyards for the construction of a steam-powered icebreaker capable of breaking a {{convert|32|ft|m|1|adj=on}} channel. Bids for a single-screw \"European-type\" icebreaker similar to the German icebreaker ''[[Eisbrecher I]]'' were received from German shipbuilder [[AG Vulcan Stettin]], Danish [[Burmeister & Wain]] and Swedish shipyards [[Kockums|Kockums AB]] and Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads AB. An expert committee appointed by the Senate recommended the second Swedish design, which was the second cheapest at 445,000 [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]], and the contract was signed with Bergsundet on 25 May 1889.<ref name=\"laurell29-33\" />\n\nThe construction of the icebreaker began on 18 August 1889 and she was launched on 23 December. On the same day she was given the name ''Murtaja'' after her German, Swedish and Danish counterparts \u2013 each country had named their first icebreaker simply ''Icebreaker'' in their own language.<ref name=\"laurell29-33\" /><ref name=\"ramsay147-148\">Ramsay 1949, p. 147-148.</ref>\n\n[[File:Icebreaker Murtaja on Trials.jpg|thumb|left|''Murtaja'' on sea trials in late March 1890.]]\n\nThe [[sea trials]] on 23\u201326 March 1890 were witnessed by a group of experts, among them the Finnish-Swedish [[arctic explorer]] [[Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld]], the first person to complete a voyage through the [[Northern Sea Route]]. During these trials ''Murtaja'' passed all but one of the tests for performance and general [[seaworthiness]]. Her draught at full load exceeded the contract specification by {{convert|1|ft|6|in|m}}, meaning that either her specialized hull form could not be fully utilized in icebreaking or the coal capacity would have to be reduced, affecting her range and endurance.<ref name=\"ramsay150\">Ramsay 1949, p. 150.</ref> However, the shipyard promised to do everything it could to reduce the draught of the vessel to an acceptable level and ''Murtaja'', the largest and most powerful European icebreaker at that time, was delivered to the owner on 30 March 1890. She left the shipyard on the following day and headed to Helsinki, where she was welcomed by a large cheering crowd on 2 April 1890.<ref name=\"laurell36\" /><ref name=\"ramsay152-153\">Ramsay 1949, p. 152-153.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Murtaja in Land och Stad.JPG|thumb|right|Drawing of ''Murtaja'' published in the Finnish newspaper [[Land och Stad]] on 16 April 1890, two weeks after she arrived to Finland.]]\n[[File:MECHELIN(1894) p033 The Ice-Breaker MURTAJA.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of ''Murtaja'' published in 1894.]]\n\n''Murtaja'' was given the task of assisting ships to the port of Hanko. In the temporary directive, given on 5 February 1890, she was to maintain an open channel between the harbour and open water, and assist inbound and outbound ships by towing if necessary. The directive also gave some of the first guidelines for icebreakers regarding for example the qualifications required from the crew.<ref name=\"laurell34\">Laurell 1992, p. 34.</ref> When ''Murtaja'' arrived in Helsinki in early April, most of the ice had already melted and the new icebreaker was not taken into service. She returned to Finnboda for repairs under warranty in May and remained in the shipyard until mid-August.<ref name=\"laurell39-41\">Laurell 1992, p. 39-41.</ref>\n\nThe winter of 1890\u20131891 was mild, so ''Murtaja'' could not demonstrate her icebreaking capabilities to their full extent. However, she lost a large number of cast iron propeller blades and while the replacement blades could be installed at sea by trimming the vessel so that the propeller shaft was near the water surface, the heavy task took several days. For this reason the [[Helsinki Polytechnics]] later developed more durable steel blades that were also used in the subsequent icebreakers.<ref name=\"laurell42-43\">Laurell 1992, p. 42-43.</ref>\n\nDuring the first normal winters the icebreaking capability of ''Murtaja'' could be determined. She could break level ice up to {{convert|47|cm|in|0}} thick in continuous motion as long as there was no snow, in which case even {{convert|25|cm|in|0|adj=on}} ice required backing and ramming. In this method the ship was reversed two to four ship lengths before ordering full ahead, after which the ship could break new channel up to six ship lengths, almost {{convert|150|m|ft|0}}. However, in more difficult ice conditions each ramming would move the ship forwards only {{convert|10|m|ft|0|}}. In snow-covered ice and drift ice ''Murtaja'' could not operate efficiently due to her inefficient hull form. Sometimes the crew had to rely on hacking and sawing the ice or even explosives to release the ship from compressive ice fields.<ref name=\"laurell44-46\">Laurell 1992, p. 44-46.</ref>\n\nDespite her efforts the 930-ton single-screw ''Murtaja'' was not deemed powerful enough to keep the southernmost port of Finland open every winter, and the winter navigation committee appointed by the Senate came to a conclusion that a second icebreaker would be needed.<ref name=\"laurell52\">Laurell 1992, p. 52.</ref> The new icebreaker, equipped with propellers in both bow and stern, was built in 1898 and given the name [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']].<ref name=\"laurell58-59\">Laurell 1992, p. 58-59.</ref>\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nIn August 1914 [[Russian Empire|Russia]] joined the [[First World War]] and navigating in the Baltic Sea became dangerous due to [[naval mine]]s and [[Kaiserliche Marine|German]] [[U-boat]]s. The Finnish icebreakers were placed under the command of the [[Baltic Fleet]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and given the task of assisting naval ships and troop transportations in the Gulf of Finland. ''Murtaja'' was stationed with ''Sampo'' in the southern parts of the Archipelago Sea and between Turku and [[Mariehamn]]. Icebreaker assistance to merchant ships was largely neglected and the icebreakers often carried supplies for the Russian troops.<ref name=\"laurell91-93\">Laurell 1992, p. 91-93.</ref>\n\nOn 6 December 1917 the [[Parliament of Finland]] accepted the declaration of independence given by the Senate and on 29 December the icebreakers ''Murtaja'' and ''Sampo'' raised the [[flag of Finland|state flag of the independent Finland]] for the first time. However, already in early January 1918 the ship was seized by the Russian revolutionary fleet and ordered to assist the Russian troops stationed in Finland. From the beginning the Finnish officials attempted to negotiate the return of the icebreaker, but it wasn't until 5 April 1918 before ''Murtaja'' was handed back to Finland.<ref name=\"laurell99-102\">Laurell 1991, p. 99-102.</ref>\n\n''Murtaja'' survived the war without major damage and continued in service through the [[interwar period]]. As new icebreakers entered service in the 1920s, she was stationed in Turku, the second official winter port.<ref name=\"laurell158\">Laurell 1992, p. 158.</ref>\n\n=== Second World War ===\n[[File:Murtaja during Continuation War.jpg|thumb|left|Camouflage painting of ''Murtaja'' during the [[Continuation War]].]]\n\nDue to the worsening relations with the [[Soviet Union]], ''Murtaja'' and other state-owned icebreakers were armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker fleet shortly before the [[Winter War]] began on 30 November 1939. The Finnish icebreakers had been equipped with gun mounts already in the 1920s and were armed with light artillery. ''Murtaja'' spent the early stages of the war in [[Viipuri]] and assisted supply ships to the port of [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Koivisto]].<ref name=\"laurell259-260\">Laurell 1992, p. 259-260.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] began on 25 June 1941, the Finnish icebreakers were re-armed and their anti-aircraft armament was improved. On 20 July, while guarding a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets#Motti|motti]] in the [[Battle of Hanko (1941)|Hanko Front]], the camouflaged ''Murtaja'' was attacked by a group of Soviet [[fighter-bomber]]s. None of the planes scored a direct hit, but the nearby explosions caused severe damage to the engine and fittings. On the following day ''Murtaja'' was towed to [[Crichton-Vulcan]] shipyard in [[Turku]] for repairs.<ref name=\"laurell282-284\">Laurell 1992, p. 282-284.</ref> Later the front moved east and the icebreaker fleet was disbanded in December 1941, after which some of the armament was removed and the icebreakers resumed their normal peacetime duties.<ref name=\"laurell286\">Laurell 1992, p. 286.</ref> For the remainder of the war ''Murtaja'' assisted ships without major incidents.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Decommissioning ===\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Murtaja 1850s.jpg|thumb|''Murtaja'' photographed shortly before retiring in the late 1950s.]]\n\n''Murtaja'' was often criticized for her poor performance in difficult ice conditions and she was deemed old and obsolete already in 1906.<ref name=\"ramsay175-176\" /> Selling her was set as a prerequisite for ordering a new icebreaker, but while several foreign ports were interested in purchasing ''Murtaja'', in September 1906 the Senate decided to order the third state-owned icebreaker, [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']], without selling the old one.<ref name=\"laurell72\">Laurell 1992, p. 72.</ref> As more modern icebreakers entered service in the 1920s, ''Murtaja'' was again deemed obsolete and worn-out, and she was criticized for her high operating costs. She was said to be in need of complete overhaul and rebuilding in 1926, but the Finnish Board of Navigation did not agree to this until almost ten years later, although it noted that decommissioning her would probably be a better solution.<ref name=\"ramsay175-176\">Ramsay 1949, p. 175-176.</ref>\n\nDespite the criticism, ''Murtaja'' remained in service through the First and Second World Wars until the late 1950s, although during her last years in service her assistance in the [[Archipelago Sea]] was described being \"more of a moral nature\".<ref name=\"laurell330\">Laurell 1992, p. 330.</ref> The renewal of the Finnish icebreaker fleet began in 1952 after the [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union]] had been paid, and the first post-war icebreaker, [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|''Voima'']], was commissioned in 1953. When the harsh winters of the 1950s showed that modern icebreakers were needed, a series of smaller diesel-electric icebreakers were built for operations within the archipelago. The first steam-powered icebreaker to be decommissioned was the old ''Murtaja'', which was decommissioned on 3 May 1958 after almost 70 years of service. She was replaced by the new diesel-electric [[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|''Karhu'']] and broken up shortly afterwards. The second ''Karhu'' class icebreaker was named [[Finnish icebreaker Murtaja (1959)|''Murtaja'']] in 1959 to honor the first state-owned icebreaker of Finland.<ref name=\"laurell332\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen231\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 231.</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n[[File:Icebreaker Murtaja docked.jpg|thumb|left|160px|''Murtaja'' showing her spoon-shaped bow during docking.]]\n\n''Murtaja'' was {{convert|47.55|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[length overall|long overall]] and {{convert|42.50|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[waterline length|at the waterline]].

Initially owned by a private shipping company founded by shipowners from the Finnish city of [[Turku]] and known as '''''Avance''''', she was later purchased by the [[Finnish Board of Navigation]] and her name was translated into [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. ''Apu'' remained in service until 1959, when she was replaced by the new [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[Murtaja (1959 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']].\n\n== Construction ==\n\nWhen the winter navigation committee appointed by the [[Senate of Finland]] in 1895 decided that the state-owned icebreakers would assist merchant ships only to the port of [[Hanko]] during the winter, the shipowners from Turku did not lose their faith in year-round traffic to their hometown. In 1898 they founded a joint shipping company, [[Isbrytare Aktiebolaget Avance]] (Icebreaker Company Avance), to order and maintain an icebreaker that would be used to maintain year-round traffic to the port of Turku. The new company was partially funded by the city and also received a long-term interest-free loan from the state. With total assets of 650,000 [[Finnish markka]]s (FIM) the company ordered a new icebreaker, designed by Swedish engineer C. Bagge, from the Howaldtswerke shipyard in Kiel, Germany.

Initially owned by a private shipping company founded by shipowners from the Finnish city of [[Turku]] and known as '''''Avance''''', she was later purchased by the [[Finnish Board of Navigation]] and her name was translated into [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. ''Apu'' remained in service until 1959, when she was replaced by the new [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[Murtaja (1959 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']].\n\n== Construction ==\n\nWhen the winter navigation committee appointed by the [[Senate of Finland]] in 1895 decided that the state-owned icebreakers would assist merchant ships only to the port of [[Hanko]] during the winter, the shipowners from Turku did not lose their faith in year-round traffic to their hometown. In 1898 they founded a joint shipping company, [[Isbrytare Aktiebolaget Avance]] (Icebreaker Company Avance), to order and maintain an icebreaker that would be used to maintain year-round traffic to the port of Turku. The new company was partially funded by the city and also received a long-term interest-free loan from the state. With total assets of 650,000 [[Finnish markka]]s (FIM) the company ordered a new icebreaker, designed by Swedish engineer C. Bagge, from the Howaldtswerke shipyard in Kiel, Germany. The total cost of the new vessel, christened ''Avance'', was FIM 616,000 and in many respects she resembled the first state-owned icebreaker, [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']]. She was completed and delivered to owners in February 1899.<ref name=\"laurell68-71\">Laurell 1992, p. 68-71.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\nThe main task of ''Avance'' was to assist ships between Turku and [[Stockholm]] although scheduled year-round shipping service to the German city of [[L\u00fcbeck]] was launched during her first year in operation and she was often needed also in the southern shipping lane passing the island of [[Ut\u00f6, Finland|Ut\u00f6]]. She was found out to be suitable for icebreaking in the sheltered waters within the archipelago, but her wheelhouse had to be made higher shortly after entering service to improve visibility astern.<ref name=\"laurell68-71\" />\n\n''Avance'' was offered to the city of Stockholm in 1907, but the Swedish buyers decided that she was too expensive and broke off the deal.<ref name=\"turkusteamers\" /> Maintaining the icebreaker turned out to be more expensive than what was anticipated, and in 1909 the city of Turku purchased the majority of the shipping company's shares.<ref name=\"laurell132\">Laurell 1992, p. 132.</ref>\n\nIn August 1914 [[Russian Empire|Russia]] joined the [[First World War]] and the Finnish icebreakers were placed under the command of the [[Baltic Fleet]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]].

Planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American colonization]] when they envisioned a well-designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan, a former town which is now the Rizal Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to [[Daniel Burnham]] to create a master plan for the city patterned after [[Washington, D.C.]] These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of [[Manuel L. Quezon]].\n\nA new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila. However, many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations.\n\nThe city, as the capital, still hosts the Office of the President, as well as the president's official residence.

Manila also hosts important national institutions such as the National Library, National Archives, National Museum and the Philippine General Hospital.\n\nCongress previously held office at the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Congress Building]]. In 1972, due to declaration of martial law, Congress was dissolved; its successor, the [[unicameral]] [[Batasang Pambansa]], held office at the new [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. When a new [[constitution of the Philippines|constitution]] restored the [[bicameral]] Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building.

Americans have to deal with the problem of sanitation and concentration of settlers around business areas. Business codes and sanitation laws were implemented in the 1930s. During this period until the 1950s, new communities were opened for relocation. Among these were Projects 1\u20138 in Diliman, [[Quezon City]] and the Vitas tenement houses in Tondo. The government implemented the Public Housing Policy in 1947 that established the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC). A few years later, it put up the Slum Clearance Committee which, with the help of the PHHC, relocated thousands of families from Tondo and Quezon City to Sapang Palay in [[San Jose del Monte, Bulacan]] in the 1960s.\n\nIn 2016, the national government completed several medium-rise houses for 300 Manila residents whose slum community was destroyed by a fire in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/793247/aquino-admin-winds-down-with-manila-housing-project |title=Aquino admin winds down with Manila housing project |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer|Inquirer.net]] |date=June 30, 2016 |accessdate=July 11, 2019 }}</ref> Meanwhile, the city government plans to retrofit dilapidated tenements within the city,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/metro/700518/mayor-isko-wants-to-improve-manila-s-old-tenements-relocate-residents/story/ |title=Mayor Isko wants to improve Manila's old tenements, relocate residents |publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News Online]] |date=July 10, 2019 |accessdate=July 11, 2019 }}</ref> and will construct new housing buildings for the city's informal settlers such as the 14-storey Tondominium 1 and Tondomium 2 buildings, containing 42-square meter, two-bedroom units.

The date is regarded as the city's official founding date; however, a  [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] fortified [[Bayan (settlement)|polity]] called [[Maynila (historical polity)|Maynil\u00e0]] had already existed on the site, dating back as far as [[1258 CE|1258]], from which the Spanish and English name of 'Manila' was derived.

Astorga]] (then Vice Mayor of Manila) on June 24, 1962. It has been annually commemorated under the [[patron saint|patronage]] of [[John the Baptist]], and has always been declared by the national government as a special non-working holiday through Presidential Proclamations. Each of the city's 896 barangays also have their own festivities guided by their own [[patron saint]].\n\nThe city is also the host to the [[Black Nazarene|Procession of the Feast of the Black Nazarene]] (''Traslac\u00edon''), held every January 9, which draws millions of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] devotees. Other religious festivities held in Manila are the Feast of Santo Ni\u00f1o in Tondo and Pandacan held on the third Sunday of January, the Feast of the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Desamparados de Manila (Our Lady of the Abandoned), the patron saint of [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]] which was held every May 12, and the ''[[Flores de Mayo]]''.

The historic Walled City is administered by the [[Intramuros Administration]], while the Manila North Harbor is managed by the Philippine Ports Authority. Both are national government agencies. The barangays that have jurisdictions over these places only oversee the welfare of the city's constituents and cannot exercise their executive powers. Manila has a total of 15,489 personnel complement by the end of 2018.<ref name=\"2018audit\" />\n\nThe current [[Mayor of Manila|mayor]] is Francisco \"[[Isko Moreno]]\" Domagoso, who previously served as the city's vice mayor. The current vice mayor is Dr. Maria Shielah \"Honey\" Lacuna-Pangan, daughter of former Manila Vice Mayor Danny Lacuna. The mayor and the vice mayor are term-limited by up to 3 terms, with each term lasting for 3 years.\n\n[[File:Palacio Del Gobernador.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palacio del Gobernador]] in Intramuros is home to the Philippine [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] and Intramuros Administration.]]\nManila, being the seat of political power of the Philippines, has several national government offices headquartered at the city. Planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American colonization]] when they envisioned a well-designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan, a former town which is now the Rizal Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to [[Daniel Burnham]] to create a master plan for the city patterned after [[Washington, D.C.]] These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of [[Manuel L. Quezon]].\n\nA new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila. However, many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations.\n\nThe city, as the capital, still hosts the Office of the President, as well as the president's official residence. Aside from these, important government agencies and institutions such as the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|Departments]] of [[Department of Budget and Management (Philippines)|Budget and Management]], [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Finance]], [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Health]], [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Justice]], [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Labor and Employment]] and [[Department of Public Works and Highways|Public Works and Highways]] still call the city home. Manila also hosts important national institutions such as the National Library, National Archives, National Museum and the Philippine General Hospital.\n\nCongress previously held office at the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Congress Building]]. In 1972, due to declaration of martial law, Congress was dissolved; its successor, the [[unicameral]] [[Batasang Pambansa]], held office at the new [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. When a new [[constitution of the Philippines|constitution]] restored the [[bicameral]] Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the [[Government Service Insurance System]] at reclaimed land at [[Pasay]].
