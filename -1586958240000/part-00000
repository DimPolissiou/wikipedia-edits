The landmark report, ''Status of the Tigers, Co-predators, and  Prey in India'',  published  by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, estimates only 1411 adult tigers in existence in India (plus uncensused tigers in the Sundarbans).<ref name=\"Jhala\">{{cite book|author=Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun.|title=Status of the Tigers, Co-predators, and  Prey in India|editor=Y.V.Jhala|editor2=R.Gopal|editor3=Q.Qureshi|publisher=National Tiger Conservation Authority, Govt. of India|location=New Delhi|year=2008|series=TR 08/001|pages=-151|url=http://projecttiger.nic.in/whtsnew/status_of_tigers_in_india_2008.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602124630/http://projecttiger.nic.in/whtsnew/status_of_tigers_in_india_2008.pdf|archive-date=2 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFor example, in the 16 reserves of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Chhattisgarh]] there may be only 490 [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]s \u2013 a 60% reduction from the 1,233 tigers previously estimated for these areas in 2002. Indeed, the same 2002 survey had claimed that in total, India had 3,500 tigers, whilst the new survey claims that just 1,400 remain.\n\nTranslocating villagers out of tiger reserves can be effective too, if sensitively done. The villagers get access to schools and health care and can farm without risk of attack, the tigers\u2019 prey flourishes in the absence of disturbance, and poachers\u2019 activities are harder to disguise. In China, the domestic trade in tiger body parts was banned 14 years ago. However, there are at least 5,000 tigers in tiny cages in China, reportedly just for display. A path breaking new investigation by EIA with assistance from WPSI, has found out that the trade in Tiger skins and bones are still flourishing across the border in Tibet and China. It seems that with so many inbred Tigers in captivity, their owners are hoping to take a monopoly on this clandestine business as soon as the Tigers are declared extinct in the wild. These captive Tigers are unfit to fend for themselves in the wilderness and would effectively mean the end of the species in their natural habitat.\n\nNevertheless, farmers seem quite open about the fact that tigers are killed so their body parts can be used for Traditional Medicine. At the [[CITES]]\u00b9 conference in June, there was a proposal from China to amend the Convention text governing the trade in tiger parts. This would have effectively given China the go-ahead to trade in \u2018parts and derivatives\u2019 from captive bred tigers. This proposal was rejected by the CITES Parties, and instead a landmark decision taken, which states that \u2018tigers should not be bred for trade in their parts and derivatives\u2019.\n\nThe most recent audit of wild [[Bengal tiger|tigers]] by the Authority (in early 2008) has estimated the number at 1411 wild tigers - 1165 - 1657 allowing for [[statistical error]] -  a drop of 60% in the past decade.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Wade | first=Matt | author-link= | title=Threat to a national symbol as India's wild tigers vanish | newspaper=The Age (Melbourne) | page=9 | date=15 February 2008 | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\nThe [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]] was amended in 2006 to provide for constituting the National Tiger Conservation Authority responsible for implementation of the [[Project Tiger]] plan to protect endangered tigers. The National Tiger Conservation Authority is set up under the Chairmanship of the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Minister for Environment and Forests]]. The Authority will have eight experts or professionals having qualifications and experience in wildlife conservation and welfare of people including tribals, apart from three Members of Parliament of whom two will be elected by the House of the People and one by the Council of States. The Inspector General of Forests, in charge of project Tiger, will be ex-officio Member Secretary.\n\nThe Authority, interalia, would lay down normative standards, guidelines for tiger conservation in the Tiger Reserves, apart from [[Protected areas of India|National Parks and Sanctuaries]]. It would provide information on protection measures including future conservation plan, tiger estimation, disease surveillance, mortality survey, patrolling, report on untoward happenings and such other management aspects as it may deem fit, including future plan for conservation.\n\nThe Authority would also facilitate and support tiger reserve management in the States through eco-development and people's participation as per approved management plans, and support similar initiatives in adjoining areas consistent with the Central and state laws.\n\nThe Tiger Conservation Authority would be required to prepare an Annual Report, which would be laid in the Parliament along with the Audit Report.\n\nState level Steering Committees will be set up in the Tiger States under the Chairmanship of respective Chief Ministers. As recommended by the Tiger Task Force constituted by the Prime Minister, this has been done with a view for ensuring coordination, monitoring and protection of tigers in the States.\n\nA provision has been made for the State Governments to prepare a Tiger Conservation Plan, which would include staff development, their deployment to ensure protection of tiger reserves and its development, while ensuring compatible forestry operations in adjoining areas. Further, safeguards have been provided for ensuring the agricultural, livelihood, developmental and other interests of the people living inside a forest or in and around a tiger reserve. The core as well as buffer areas have been explicitly explained to avoid ambiguity.\n\nProvision will be made for the States to establish a Tiger Conservation Foundation, based on the good practices emanating from some tiger reserves. The proposed Foundation is a Trust, which would be constituted as per the appropriate statutory provisions in vogue in the State. It will have administrative autonomy as delegated by the State Government for fund generation to foster eco-tourism, eco-development and related activities involving the local people.\n\n==The Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2006==\n\nThe Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2006 (No. 39 of 2006) has come into force on 4 September 2006. The Act provides for creating the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Tiger and Other Endangered Species Crime Control Bureau (Wildlife Crime Control Bureau).\n\nThe implementation over the years has highlighted the need for a [[statutory authority]] with legal backing to ensure tiger conservation. On the basis of the recommendations of [[National Board for Wildlife]], a Task Force was set up to look into the problems of tiger conservation in the country. The recommendations of the Task Force, inter alia include strengthening of Project Tiger by giving it statutory and administrative powers, apart from creating the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau. It has also recommended that an annual report should be submitted to the Central Government for laying in Parliament, so that commitment to Project Tiger is reviewed from time to time, in addition to addressing the concerns of local people.\n\nThe National Tiger Conservation Authority would facilitate MoU with States within our federal set up for tiger conservation. It will provide for an oversight by Parliament as well. Further, it will address livelihood interests of local people in areas surrounding Tiger Reserves, apart from ensuring that the rights of Scheduled Tribes and such other people living nearby are not interfered or adversely affected.

The landmark report, ''Status of the Tigers, Co-predators, and  Prey in India'',  published  by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, estimates only 1411 adult tigers in existence in India (plus uncensused tigers in the Sundarbans).<ref name=\"Jhala\">{{cite book|author=Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun.|title=Status of the Tigers, Co-predators, and  Prey in India|editor=Y.V.Jhala|editor2=R.Gopal|editor3=Q.Qureshi|publisher=National Tiger Conservation Authority, Govt. of India|location=New Delhi|year=2008|series=TR 08/001|pages=-151|url=http://projecttiger.nic.in/whtsnew/status_of_tigers_in_india_2008.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602124630/http://projecttiger.nic.in/whtsnew/status_of_tigers_in_india_2008.pdf|archive-date=2 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFor example, in the 16 reserves of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Chhattisgarh]] there may be only 490 [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]s \u2013 a 60% reduction from the 1,233 tigers previously estimated for these areas in 2002. Indeed, the same 2002 survey had claimed that in total, India had 3,500 tigers, whilst the new survey claims that just 1,400 remain.\n\nTranslocating villagers out of tiger reserves can be effective too, if sensitively done. The villagers get access to schools and health care and can farm without risk of attack, the tigers\u2019 prey flourishes in the absence of disturbance, and poachers\u2019 activities are harder to disguise. In China, the domestic trade in tiger body parts was banned 14 years ago. However, there are at least 5,000 tigers in tiny cages in China, reportedly just for display. A path breaking new investigation by EIA with assistance from WPSI, has found out that the trade in Tiger skins and bones are still flourishing across the border in Tibet and China. It seems that with so many inbred Tigers in captivity, their owners are hoping to take a monopoly on this clandestine business as soon as the Tigers are declared extinct in the wild. These captive Tigers are unfit to fend for themselves in the wilderness and would effectively mean the end of the species in their natural habitat.\n\nNevertheless, farmers seem quite open about the fact that tigers are killed so their body parts can be used for Traditional Medicine. At the [[CITES]]\u00b9 conference in June, there was a proposal from China to amend the Convention text governing the trade in tiger parts. This would have effectively given China the go-ahead to trade in \u2018parts and derivatives\u2019 from captive bred tigers. This proposal was rejected by the CITES Parties, and instead a landmark decision taken, which states that \u2018tigers should not be bred for trade in their parts and derivatives\u2019.\n\nThe most recent audit of wild [[Bengal tiger|tigers]] by the Authority (in early 2008) has estimated the number at 1411 wild tigers - 1165 - 1657 allowing for [[statistical error]] -  a drop of 60% in the past decade.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Wade | first=Matt | author-link= | title=Threat to a national symbol as India's wild tigers vanish | newspaper=The Age (Melbourne) | page=9 | date=15 February 2008 | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\nThe [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]] was amended in 2006 to provide for constituting the National Tiger Conservation Authority responsible for implementation of the [[Project Tiger]] plan to protect endangered tigers. The National Tiger Conservation Authority is set up under the Chairmanship of the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Minister for Environment and Forests]]. The Authority will have eight experts or professionals having qualifications and experience in wildlife conservation and welfare of people including tribals, apart from three Members of Parliament of whom two will be elected by the House of the People and one by the Council of States. The Inspector General of Forests, in charge of project Tiger, will be ex-officio Member Secretary.\n\nThe Authority, interalia, would lay down normative standards, guidelines for tiger conservation in the Tiger Reserves, apart from [[Protected areas of India|National Parks and Sanctuaries]]. It would provide information on protection measures including future conservation plan, tiger estimation, disease surveillance, mortality survey, patrolling, report on untoward happenings and such other management aspects as it may deem fit, including future plan for conservation.\n\nThe Authority would also facilitate and support tiger reserve management in the States through eco-development and people's participation as per approved management plans, and support similar initiatives in adjoining areas consistent with the Central and state laws.\n\nThe Tiger Conservation Authority would be required to prepare an Annual Report, which would be laid in the Parliament along with the Audit Report.\n\nState level Steering Committees will be set up in the Tiger States under the Chairmanship of respective Chief Ministers. As recommended by the Tiger Task Force constituted by the Prime Minister, this has been done with a view for ensuring coordination, monitoring and protection of tigers in the States.\n\nA provision has been made for the State Governments to prepare a Tiger Conservation Plan, which would include staff development, their deployment to ensure protection of tiger reserves and its development, while ensuring compatible forestry operations in adjoining areas. Further, safeguards have been provided for ensuring the agricultural, livelihood, developmental and other interests of the people living inside a forest or in and around a tiger reserve. The core as well as buffer areas have been explicitly explained to avoid ambiguity.\n\nProvision will be made for the States to establish a Tiger Conservation Foundation, based on the good practices emanating from some tiger reserves. The proposed Foundation is a Trust, which would be constituted as per the appropriate statutory provisions in vogue in the State. It will have administrative autonomy as delegated by the State Government for fund generation to foster eco-tourism, eco-development and related activities involving the local people.\n\n==The Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2006==\n\nThe Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2006 (No. 39 of 2006) has come into force on 4 September 2006. The Act provides for creating the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Tiger and Other Endangered Species Crime Control Bureau (Wildlife Crime Control Bureau).\n\nThe implementation over the years has highlighted the need for a statutory authority with legal backing to ensure tiger conservation. On the basis of the recommendations of [[National Board for Wildlife]], a Task Force was set up to look into the problems of tiger conservation in the country. The recommendations of the Task Force, inter alia include strengthening of Project Tiger by giving it statutory and administrative powers, apart from creating the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau. It has also recommended that an annual report should be submitted to the Central Government for laying in Parliament, so that commitment to Project Tiger is reviewed from time to time, in addition to addressing the concerns of local people.\n\nThe National Tiger Conservation Authority would facilitate MoU with States within our federal set up for tiger conservation. It will provide for an oversight by Parliament as well. Further, it will address livelihood interests of local people in areas surrounding Tiger Reserves, apart from ensuring that the rights of Scheduled Tribes and such other people living nearby are not interfered or adversely affected. The core (critical) and buffer (peripheral) areas have been defined, while safeguarding the interests of Scheduled Tribes and such other forest dwellers.\n\nThe functions and powers of the Authority, inter alia include : approval of Tiger Conservation Plan prepared by States, laying down normative standards for tiger conservation, providing information on several aspects which include protection, tiger estimation, patrolling, etc., ensuring measures for addressing man-wild animal conflicts and fostering co-existence with local people, preparing annual report for laying before Parliament, constitution of Steering Committee by States, preparation of tiger protection and conservation plans by States, ensuring agricultural, livelihood interests of people living in and around Tiger Reserves, establishing the tiger conservation foundation by States for supporting their development.\n\nThe Notification of the National Tiger Conservation Authority has been issued on 4 September 2006, for a period of three years, with the Minister for Environment and Forests as its Chairperson and the Minister of State for Environment and Forests as the Vice-chairperson.

The concert sold out in half an hour. The concert at the O2 Academy Brixton in London sold-out in a couple days.\n\n== Concert synopsis ==\nThe stage consists of a large flat black [[pallet]] with a smaller one on top of the principal one and a huge [[Projection screen|screen]] in the back which is used for visual support and interludes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldo.es/noticias/ocio-y-cultura/2019/03/29/rosalia-consciente-de-su-altura-en-el-inicio-de-su-primera-gira-mundial-1306381.html|title=Rosal\u00eda, consciente de su altura en el inicio de su primera gira mundial|last=Arag\u00f3n|first=Heraldo de|website=heraldo.es|language=es|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> For the December shows, the top pallet was removed and a runway was added to the stage design. Rosal\u00eda and her backup dancers perform in the middle of the stage while the background singers are positioned on the left side of the stage meanwhile producer and friend Pablo D\u00edaz Reixa aka \"[[El Guincho]]\" plays the drums and creates musical effects live on the right side of the stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elnacional.cat/es/cultura/barcelona-los-pies-de-rosalia_449253_102.html|title=Barcelona, a los pies de Rosal\u00eda|website=ElNacional.cat|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\nThe concert starts with a video introduction showing Rosal\u00eda's name in different [[font]]s which increases its velocity to the point that it collapses and shows a white image. Then Rosal\u00eda emerges from the stage to dance with her backup dancers popularly known as \"Las 8 Rosas\" (Spanish for \"''The 8 Roses''\") for over a minute and a half. After this, the singer is left alone on stage to shout the name of the city she is performing in and to sing the first notes of \"[[Pienso en tu mir\u00e1|Pienso en tu Mir\u00e1]]\". After half-a-minute, the dancers come on stage again and they all dance together to the song, Rosal\u00eda included. After this song, Rosal\u00eda is left on stage alone for a second time to perform \"[[A Pal\u00e9]]\". The setlist transits to \"De Madrug\u00e1\", the first unreleased song of the concert. Rosal\u00eda performs for another time with Las 8 Rosas before leaving her alone again to perform James Blake's \"[[Barefoot in the Park (song)|Barefoot in the Park]]\". During this song, the singer asks the crowd to turn on their phones' lantern.\n\nThe next act starts with Rosal\u00eda singing the fan-favorite track \"Que No Salga La Luna\". She performs it without her dance crew. Her four background singers (2 men and 2 women) support Rosal\u00eda during the part where the song consists of a dialogue. \"Que No Salga La Luna\" is followed by \"Maldici\u00f3n\" where, instead of a falling diamonds background video, a solid light pink image is shown to the public. After the song, Rosal\u00eda introduces her 2016 track \"Catalina\", which she wrote alongside Catalan guitarist [[Ra\u00fcl Refree]]. She sings it \"a capella\" before transitioning to \"Aunque es de noche\". The act ends with a video interlude that consists of Rosal\u00eda writing a text to contact \">3\" on [[iMessage]]. The message consists of the lyrics of the 1974 track \"Te Estoy Amando Locamente\" originally sung by [[Las Grecas]]. The video ends right after the singer sends the second text message which says \"t estoy amando lokamente\" followed by 232 red broken heart emojis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/radioguguu/status/1203988253856161792|title=joder barcelona, JODER @PalauSantJordipic.twitter.com/f4KehhaBYF|last=LIVE|first=Pep VEnTuurA HAS SEEN ROSALIA|date=2019-12-09|website=@radioguguu|language=ht|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> The track is sung by the background singers and is supported by a pre-taped version sung by Rosal\u00eda.\nThe next act starts with Rosal\u00eda's first-ever number one single \"[[Di mi nombre|Di Mi Nombre]]\" which smoothly transits to \"De Aqu\u00ed No Sales\". In both of the songs, the singer is joined by her dancers. Another interlude is shown to the public. This one consists of Rosal\u00eda singing an unreleased rap song with sunglasses on and without her long [[acrylic nails]].<ref>{{Citation|title=ROSAL\u00cdA - EL MAL QUERER TOUR (INTERLUDE) [EMQ TOUR]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR9UMwUaKDg|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> The song is believed to be \"Kelok\u00e9\" by Venezuelan musician [[Arca (musician)|Arca]] featuring Rosal\u00eda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://los40.com/los40/2019/10/01/musica/1569917125_264720.html|title=Rosal\u00eda desvela cuando saldr\u00e1 su pr\u00f3ximo disco|last=LOS40|date=2019-10-01|website=LOS40|language=es|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EMQTourStage.jpg|thumb|left|Rosal\u00eda during an interude in Barcelona.|alt=|244x244px]]\n\nRight after the interlude, Rosal\u00eda performs her by now only track in Catalan \"[[Milion\u00e0ria]]\". The song is followed by its B-side \"Dios Nos Libre del Dinero\". The next song is \"[[Bagdad (song)|Bagdad]]\" where she performs alongside \"Las 8 Rosas\", who \"wrap\" Rosal\u00eda in fuchsia strings while she sings. In some parts of the song, the singer changes her microphone to one that has an electronic effect that allows her to sing higher notes that may seem as autotune. She proceeds to perform J Balvin's \"Brillo\" where she puts on sunglasses and plays around with her hair alone. The unreleased track \"Como Ali\" is the following song. Her dancing crew accompanies her during this song. The act ends with a remix by El Guincho of Rodolfo Parrita's 2012 track \"Cositas del Ayer\" (also known as \"No Me Llames M\u00e1s Que Ya No Voy) which is choreographed by \"Las 8 Rosas\" and the singer herself.<ref>{{Citation|title=ROSAL\u00cdA PARRITA REMIX , SANTERIA Y LO PRESIENTO LOLLAPALOOZA ARGENTINA 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQRrSCfsAqY|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> During the shows in festivals, the song was followed by \"Santer\u00eda\" which was sung by the background singers.\n\nThe final act opens with the dancers entering a light blue hologram triangle to dance to [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]]'s 2010 track \"[[Es Un Secreto]]\". The song transitions right after Rosal\u00eda appears on stage to another unreleased track \"Lo Presiento\", which is rumored to be a discard of her 2018 album \"[[El mal querer|El Mal Querer]]\". After it, Rosal\u00eda interacts with the public and performs her collaboration with [[Ozuna (singer)|Ozuna]] \"[[Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi]]\". The choreography, created by Charm La'Donna, is the same one used for the music video and for the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards performance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elcorreodeburgos.com/noticias/cultura/charm-la-donna-arma-secreta-rosalia-escenario-videos_202615.html|title=Charm La'Donna, el arma secreta de Rosal\u00eda en el escenario y los v\u00eddeos|last=Burgos|first=El Correo de|website=El Correo de Burgos|language=es|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> The 2019 hit single \"[[Con altura|Con Altura]]\" follows \"Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi\". In some concerts, Rosal\u00eda throws signed merchandising of her collection to the public after singing \"Con Altura\". Another fan-favorite \"A Ning\u00fan Hombre\" is performed right after the hit single. After this intimate and emotional song Rosal\u00eda proceeds to dance an almost-one-minute choreography before transitioning into another fan-favorite song: \"Aute Cuture\".\n\nFor the encore, Rosal\u00eda and her backup dancers dance to a [[March (music)|march]] before transitioning to the singer's 2018 hit single \"[[Malamente]]\". A remix of the song created by El Guincho starts playing while Rosal\u00eda introduces her on-stage collaborators to the public and thanks the audience before leaving shortly after.<ref>{{Citation|title=Rosalia -Full show - Live at O2 Brixton Academy London. 05 December 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azlg-hnSdA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nThe concert lasts for 45\u201355 minutes for festivals and for 75\u201390 minutes for theatre and arena shows.<ref>{{Citation|title=Rosalia en Holanda concierto completo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P1-XOdC48o|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Set list==\n{{hidden begin\n| titlestyle = background: #ccccff; font-size: 100%; width: 65%; text-align:center;\n| bodystyle = text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 75%;\n| title = Festival Setlist\n}}\n{{div col}}\n#\"[[Pienso en tu mir\u00e1]]\"\n#\"Como Al\u00ed\"\n#\"[[Barefoot in the Park (song)|Barefoot in the Park]]\"\n#\"De madrug\u00e1\"\n#\"Catalina\"\n#\"Que no salga la luna\"\n#\"Maldici\u00f3n\"\n#\"Te estoy amando locamente\" ([[Las Grecas]] cover)\n#\"A ning\u00fan hombre\"\n#\"De aqu\u00ed no sales\"\n#\"[[Di mi nombre]]\"\n#\"[[Bagdad (song)|Bagdad]]\"\n#\"Brillo\"\n#\"No me llames m\u00e1s que ya no voy\" (Rodolfo Parrita cover)\n#\"Lo presiento\"\n#\"[[Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi]]\"\n#\"[[Con altura]]\"\n#\"[[Aute Cuture]]\"\n#\"[[Malamente]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n{{hidden end}}\n{{hidden begin\n| titlestyle = background: #ccccff; font-size: 100%; width: 65%; text-align:center;\n| bodystyle = text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 75%;\n| title = North American solo concerts\n}}\n{{div col}}\n#\"[[Pienso en tu mir\u00e1]]\"\n#\"Como Al\u00ed\"\n#\"[[Barefoot in the Park (song)|Barefoot in the Park]]\"\n#\"De madrug\u00e1\"\n#\"Catalina\"\n#\"Que no salga la luna\"\n#\"Maldici\u00f3n\"\n#\"Te estoy amando locamente\" ([[Las Grecas]] cover)\n#\"A ning\u00fan hombre\"\n#\"De aqu\u00ed no sales\"\n#\"[[Di mi nombre]]\"\n#\"[[Bagdad (song)|Bagdad]]\"\n#\"Brillo\"\n#\"No me llames m\u00e1s que ya no voy\" (Rodolfo Parrita cover)\n#\"Lo presiento\"\n#\"[[Con altura]]\"\n#\"[[Aute Cuture]]\"\n#\"[[Malamente]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n{{hidden end}}\n{{hidden begin\n| titlestyle = background: #ccccff; font-size: 100%; width: 65%; text-align:center;\n| bodystyle = text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 75%;\n| title = December shows\n}}\n{{div col}}\n#\"[[Pienso en tu mir\u00e1]]\"\n#\"[[A Pal\u00e9]]\"\n#\"De madrug\u00e1\"\n#\"[[Barefoot in the Park (song)|Barefoot in the Park]]\"\n#\"Que no salga la luna\"\n#\"Maldici\u00f3n\"\n#\"Catalina\"\n#\"Aunque es de noche\"\n#\"Te estoy amando locamente\" ([[Las Grecas]] cover)\n#\"[[Di mi nombre]]\"\n#\"De aqu\u00ed no sales\"\n#\"[[Milion\u00e0ria]]\"\n#\"Dios nos libre del dinero\"\n#\"[[Bagdad (song)|Bagdad]]\"\n#\"Brillo\"\n#\"Como Al\u00ed\"\n#\"No me llames m\u00e1s que ya no voy\" (Rodolfo Parrita cover)\n#\"Lo presiento\" (includes elements of \"Es un secreto\" by Plan B)\n#\"[[Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi]]\"\n#\"[[Con altura]]\"\n#\"A ning\u00fan hombre\"\n#\"[[Aute Cuture]]\"\n#\"[[Malamente]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n{{hidden end}}\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n* During the shows in San Francisco, Virginia Beach and C\u00f3rdoba, Rosal\u00eda performed \"Volver\" by Carlos Gardel.\n* During the July shows in Madrid and London and the December encore shows Rosal\u00eda performed \"[[Milion\u00e0ria]]\".\n* During the shows in Bilbao, London, Bern, Ostrava and Austin (night two), Rosal\u00eda performed \"Dio$ No$ Libre del Dinero\".

Then Rosal\u00eda emerges from the stage to dance with her backup dancers popularly known as \"Las 8 Rosas\" (Spanish for \"''The 8 Roses''\") for over a minute and a half. After this, the singer is left alone on stage to shout the name of the city she is performing in and to sing the first notes of \"[[Pienso en tu mir\u00e1|Pienso en tu Mir\u00e1]]\". After half-a-minute, the dancers come on stage again and they all dance together to the song, Rosal\u00eda included. After this song, Rosal\u00eda is left on stage alone for a second time to perform \"[[A Pal\u00e9]]\". The setlist transits to \"De Madrug\u00e1\", the first unreleased song of the concert. Rosal\u00eda performs for another time with Las 8 Rosas before leaving her alone again to perform James Blake's \"[[Barefoot in the Park (song)|Barefoot in the Park]]\". During this song the singer asks the crowd to turn on their phones' lantern.\n\nThe next act starts with Rosal\u00eda singing the fan-favorite track \"Que No Salga La Luna\". She performs it without her dance crew. Her four background singers (2 men and 2 women) support Rosal\u00eda during the part where the song consists of a dialogue. \"Que No Salga La Luna\" is followed by \"Maldici\u00f3n\" where, instead of a falling diamonds background video, a solid light pink image is shown to the public. After the song, Rosal\u00eda introduces her 2016 track \"Catalina\", which she wrote alongside Catalan guitarist [[Ra\u00fcl Refree]]. She sings it \"a capella\" before transitioning to \"Aunque es de noche\". The act ends with a video interlude that consists of Rosal\u00eda writing a text to contact \">3\" on [[iMessage]]. The message consists of the lyrics of the 1974 track \"Te Estoy Amando Locamente\" originally sung by [[Las Grecas]].

The next song is \"[[Bagdad (song)|Bagdad]]\" where she performs alongside \"Las 8 Rosas\", who \"wrap\" Rosal\u00eda in fuchsia strings while she sings. In some parts of the song, the singer changes her microphone to one that has an electronic effect that allows her to sing higher notes that may seem as autotune. She proceeds to perform J Balvin's \"Brillo\" where she puts on sunglasses and plays around with her hair alone. The unreleased track \"Como Ali\" is the following song. Her dancing crew accompanies her during this song. The act ends with a remix by El Guincho of Rodolfo Parrita's 2012 track \"Cositas del Ayer\" (also known as \"No Me Llames M\u00e1s Que Ya No Voy) which is choreographed by \"Las 8 Rosas\" and the singer herself.<ref>{{Citation|title=ROSAL\u00cdA PARRITA REMIX , SANTERIA Y LO PRESIENTO LOLLAPALOOZA ARGENTINA 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQRrSCfsAqY|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> During the shows in festivals, the song was followed by \"Santer\u00eda\" which was sung by the background singers.\n\nThe final act opens with the dancers entering a light blue hologram triangle to dance to [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]]'s 2010 track \"[[Es Un Secreto]]\".

After it, Rosal\u00eda interacts with the public and performs her collaboration with [[Ozuna (singer)|Ozuna]] \"[[Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi]]\".

Another fan-favorite \"A Ning\u00fan Hombre\" is performed right after the hit single. After this intimate and emocional song Rosal\u00eda proceeds to dance a almost-one-minute choreography before transitioning into another fan-favorite song: \"Aute Cuture\".\n\nFor the encore, Rosal\u00eda and her backup dancers dance to a [[March (music)|march]] before transitioning to the singer's 2018 hit single \"[[Malamente]]\". A remix of the song cerated by El Guincho starts playing while Rosal\u00eda introduces her on-stage collaborators to the public and thanks the audience before leaving shortly after.<ref>{{Citation|title=Rosalia -Full show - Live at O2 Brixton Academy London. 05 December 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1azlg-hnSdA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nThe concert lasts for 45\u201355 minutes for festivals and for 75\u201390 minutes for theatre and arena shows.<ref>{{Citation|title=Rosalia en Holanda concierto completo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P1-XOdC48o|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Set list==\n{{hidden begin\n| titlestyle = background: #ccccff; font-size: 100%; width: 65%; text-align:center;\n| bodystyle = text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 75%;\n| title = Festival Setlist\n}}\n{{div col}}\n#\"[[Pienso en tu mir\u00e1]]\"\n#\"Como Al\u00ed\"\n#\"[[Barefoot in the Park (song)|Barefoot in the Park]]\"\n#\"De madrug\u00e1\"\n#\"Catalina\"\n#\"Que no salga la luna\"\n#\"Maldici\u00f3n\"\n#\"Te estoy amando locamente\" ([[Las Grecas]] cover)\n#\"A ning\u00fan hombre\"\n#\"De aqu\u00ed no sales\"\n#\"[[Di mi nombre]]\"\n#\"[[Bagdad (song)|Bagdad]]\"\n#\"Brillo\"\n#\"No me llames m\u00e1s que ya no voy\" (Rodolfo Parrita cover)\n#\"Lo presiento\"\n#\"[[Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi]]\"\n#\"[[Con altura]]\"\n#\"[[Aute Cuture]]\"\n#\"[[Malamente]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n{{hidden end}}\n{{hidden begin\n| titlestyle = background: #ccccff; font-size: 100%; width: 65%; text-align:center;\n| bodystyle = text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 75%;\n| title = North American solo concerts\n}}\n{{div col}}\n#\"[[Pienso en tu mir\u00e1]]\"\n#\"Como Al\u00ed\"\n#\"[[Barefoot in the Park (song)|Barefoot in the Park]]\"\n#\"De madrug\u00e1\"\n#\"Catalina\"\n#\"Que no salga la luna\"\n#\"Maldici\u00f3n\"\n#\"Te estoy amando locamente\" ([[Las Grecas]] cover)\n#\"A ning\u00fan hombre\"\n#\"De aqu\u00ed no sales\"\n#\"[[Di mi nombre]]\"\n#\"[[Bagdad (song)|Bagdad]]\"\n#\"Brillo\"\n#\"No me llames m\u00e1s que ya no voy\" (Rodolfo Parrita cover)\n#\"Lo presiento\"\n#\"[[Con altura]]\"\n#\"[[Aute Cuture]]\"\n#\"[[Malamente]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n{{hidden end}}\n{{hidden begin\n| titlestyle = background: #ccccff; font-size: 100%; width: 65%; text-align:center;\n| bodystyle = text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 75%;\n| title = December shows\n}}\n{{div col}}\n#\"[[Pienso en tu mir\u00e1]]\"\n#\"[[A Pal\u00e9]]\"\n#\"De madrug\u00e1\"\n#\"[[Barefoot in the Park (song)|Barefoot in the Park]]\"\n#\"Que no salga la luna\"\n#\"Maldici\u00f3n\"\n#\"Catalina\"\n#\"Aunque es de noche\"\n#\"Te estoy amando locamente\" ([[Las Grecas]] cover)\n#\"[[Di mi nombre]]\"\n#\"De aqu\u00ed no sales\"\n#\"[[Milion\u00e0ria]]\"\n#\"Dios nos libre del dinero\"\n#\"[[Bagdad (song)|Bagdad]]\"\n#\"Brillo\"\n#\"Como Al\u00ed\"\n#\"No me llames m\u00e1s que ya no voy\" (Rodolfo Parrita cover)\n#\"Lo presiento\" (includes elements of \"Es un secreto\" by Plan B)\n#\"[[Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi]]\"\n#\"[[Con altura]]\"\n#\"A ning\u00fan hombre\"\n#\"[[Aute Cuture]]\"\n#\"[[Malamente]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n{{hidden end}}\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n* During the shows in San Francisco, Virginia Beach and C\u00f3rdoba, Rosal\u00eda performed \"Volver\" by Carlos Gardel.\n* During the July shows in Madrid and London and the December encore shows Rosal\u00eda performed \"[[Milion\u00e0ria]]\".\n* During the shows in Bilbao, London, Bern, Ostrava and Austin (night two), Rosal\u00eda performed \"Dio$ No$ Libre del Dinero\".

QIMR was established in 1945 by the [[Government of Queensland]] through the enactment of the ''Queensland Institute of Medical Research Act 1945'' (Qld). Previously known as the '''Queensland Institute of Medical Research''' ('''QIMR'''), the original purpose of the Institute was to further the study of [[tropical diseases]] in [[North Queensland]]. The current Director is Professor Frank Gannon. The institute is a registered charity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/fa6ad08bdddfc6d393b0f34f1f98191f|title=The Council of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research|publisher=[[Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829093718/https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/fa6ad08bdddfc6d393b0f34f1f98191f|archive-date=29 August 2019|url-status=live|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute at Herston Road.JPG|thumb|QIMR Berghofer Central at {{QLDcity|Herston}}, [[Brisbane]].]]\nQIMR Berghofer aims to improve the health and well-being of all people by developing new methods of detection, better treatments and prevention strategies. This is achieved through fundamental research, drug development and clinical trials.\n\nQIMR Berghofer has over 600 scientists and staff and more than 150 research students across four research programs, four departments and a support division.\n\n==History==\nQIMR Berghofer was created by an Act of Queensland State Parliament in 1945 from a report by Edward Derrick that recommended a permanent research facility to be set up to investigate diseases unique to the climate of Queensland. QIMR Berghofer began operations in 1947 with a staff of seven in a disused World War II US Army hut in [[Victoria Park, Queensland|Victoria Park, Brisbane]]. This temporary accommodation housed the Institute for the next 30 years.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1965, at a field station in [[North Queensland]], QIMR Berghofer researchers investigated outbreaks of [[leptospirosis]], scrub typhus, [[dengue]] and other tropical fevers. Researchers also studied viruses in Queensland\u2019s animals.\n\nIn 1960, QIMR Berghofer scientists isolated ''[[Murray Valley encephalitis virus]]'' from mosquitoes, which paved the way for discovery of other arboviruses like [[Ross River virus]] in 1963. During the 1960s, QIMR Berghofer established an oncology section to investigate cancer-causing viruses. One project researched cancer cells taken from [[Burkitt's lymphoma]] patients in Papua New Guinea, and found they were infected with [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV). EBV is now known to cause many types of leukaemias and lymphomas. Eight years later, this same virus was found to immortalise white blood cells; a discovery that revolutionised research of these immune cells and their DNA.\n\nIn 1977, QIMR Berghofer relocated to new laboratories in the grounds of the [[Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital]] at [[Herston, Queensland|Herston]].\n\nIn 1988, the Queensland Government amended the QIMR Act to make the institute a [[statutory authority]]. The Queensland Premier at the time, [[Mike Ahern (Australian politician)|Mike Ahern]], secured $30&nbsp;million to fund a new building for QIMR Berghofer\u2019s increasing staff. The new building was officially opened in 1991, and was named the Bancroft Centre, as a memorial to the family who contributed to QIMR Berghofer\u2019s early history.\n\nIn 1997, a philanthropic donation of $20&nbsp;million was matched by both the federal and state governments, which has used to build the Cancer Research Centre, named after contributor [[Clive Berghofer]].\n\nIn 2002, Q-Pharm Pty Limited became operational at the QIMR Berghofer Cancer Research Centre. Q-Pharm Pty Ltd is owned by QIMR Berghofer, and is a Phase I clinical trials facility to test potential new therapeutic products on humans. The same year, a new Indigenous Health Research Program was initiated to focus on improving health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and work in collaboration with Indigenous communities.\n\nIn August 2013, QIMR was renamed QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute after [[Clive Berghofer]] AM donated $50.1 million to the Institute.\n\n==Logo==\nThe QIMR Berghofer logo is composed of three superimposed hexagons, which represent interlocking benzene rings. Benzene rings are a molecular structure of carbon, the basis for all life on earth.\n\nQIMR Berghofer came together with Children\u2019s Health Queensland, [[Mater Health Services]], Metro North Hospital and Health Service, Metro South Health, [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[The University of Queensland]] and the [[Translational Research Institute (Australia)|Translational Research Institute]] to form [[Brisbane Diamantina Health Partners]], Queensland's first [[Academic health science centre|academic health science system]].\n\n==Research==\nThe Institute\u2019s research includes:\n* Cancers, including leukaemia, skin, breast, prostate, pancreatic, oesophageal and colorectal cancers\n* Infectious diseases such as [[HIV]], [[malaria]], group A streptococcus, [[Epstein-Barr virus]], [[Ross River virus]], [[scabies]], [[dengue fever]] and [[schistosomiasis]] (blood flukes)\n* Mental health, including [[schizophrenia]], [[dementia]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]\n* Chronic disorders such as liver disease, [[asthma]] and [[haemochromatosis]]\n\n==Location==\nThe Institute is located at 300 Herston Rd, Herston, [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]].\n\nQIMR Berghofer is housed in three buildings (the Bancroft Centre, the Clive Berghofer Cancer Research Centre and QIMR Berghofer Central at Herston, [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] adjacent to the [[Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital]] and The [[University of Queensland]] Medical School.\n\n==Key people==\n===Directors===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

QIMR was established in 1945 by the [[Government of Queensland]] through the enactment of the ''Queensland Institute of Medical Research Act 1945'' (Qld). Previously known as the '''Queensland Institute of Medical Research''' ('''QIMR'''), the original purpose of the Institute was to further the study of [[tropical diseases]] in [[North Queensland]]. The current Director is Professor Frank Gannon. The institute is a registered charity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/fa6ad08bdddfc6d393b0f34f1f98191f|title=The Council of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research|publisher=[[Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829093718/https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/fa6ad08bdddfc6d393b0f34f1f98191f|archive-date=29 August 2019|url-status=live|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute at Herston Road.JPG|thumb|QIMR Berghofer Central at {{QLDcity|Herston}}, [[Brisbane]].]]\nQIMR Berghofer aims to improve the health and well-being of all people by developing new methods of detection, better treatments and prevention strategies. This is achieved through fundamental research, drug development and clinical trials.\n\nQIMR Berghofer has over 600 scientists and staff and more than 150 research students across four research programs, four departments and a support division.\n\n==History==\nQIMR Berghofer was created by an Act of Queensland State Parliament in 1945 from a report by Edward Derrick that recommended a permanent research facility to be set up to investigate diseases unique to the climate of Queensland. QIMR Berghofer began operations in 1947 with a staff of seven in a disused World War II US Army hut in [[Victoria Park, Queensland|Victoria Park, Brisbane]]. This temporary accommodation housed the Institute for the next 30 years.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1965, at a field station in [[North Queensland]], QIMR Berghofer researchers investigated outbreaks of [[leptospirosis]], scrub typhus, [[dengue]] and other tropical fevers. Researchers also studied viruses in Queensland\u2019s animals.\n\nIn 1960, QIMR Berghofer scientists isolated ''[[Murray Valley encephalitis virus]]'' from mosquitoes, which paved the way for discovery of other arboviruses like [[Ross River virus]] in 1963. During the 1960s, QIMR Berghofer established an oncology section to investigate cancer-causing viruses. One project researched cancer cells taken from [[Burkitt's lymphoma]] patients in Papua New Guinea, and found they were infected with [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV). EBV is now known to cause many types of leukaemias and lymphomas. Eight years later, this same virus was found to immortalise white blood cells; a discovery that revolutionised research of these immune cells and their DNA.\n\nIn 1977, QIMR Berghofer relocated to new laboratories in the grounds of the [[Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital]] at [[Herston, Queensland|Herston]].\n\nIn 1988, the Queensland Government amended the QIMR Act to make the institute a statutory authority. The Queensland Premier at the time, [[Mike Ahern (Australian politician)|Mike Ahern]], secured $30&nbsp;million to fund a new building for QIMR Berghofer\u2019s increasing staff. The new building was officially opened in 1991, and was named the Bancroft Centre, as a memorial to the family who contributed to QIMR Berghofer\u2019s early history.\n\nIn 1997, a philanthropic donation of $20&nbsp;million was matched by both the federal and state governments, which has used to build the Cancer Research Centre, named after contributor [[Clive Berghofer]].\n\nIn 2002, Q-Pharm Pty Limited became operational at the QIMR Berghofer Cancer Research Centre. Q-Pharm Pty Ltd is owned by QIMR Berghofer, and is a Phase I clinical trials facility to test potential new therapeutic products on humans. The same year, a new Indigenous Health Research Program was initiated to focus on improving health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and work in collaboration with Indigenous communities.\n\nIn August 2013, QIMR was renamed QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute after [[Clive Berghofer]] AM donated $50.1 million to the Institute.\n\n==Logo==\nThe QIMR Berghofer logo is composed of three superimposed hexagons, which represent interlocking benzene rings. Benzene rings are a molecular structure of carbon, the basis for all life on earth.\n\nQIMR Berghofer came together with Children\u2019s Health Queensland, [[Mater Health Services]], Metro North Hospital and Health Service, Metro South Health, [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[The University of Queensland]] and the [[Translational Research Institute (Australia)|Translational Research Institute]] to form [[Brisbane Diamantina Health Partners]], Queensland's first [[Academic health science centre|academic health science system]].\n\n==Research==\nThe Institute\u2019s research includes:\n* Cancers, including leukaemia, skin, breast, prostate, pancreatic, oesophageal and colorectal cancers\n* Infectious diseases such as [[HIV]], [[malaria]], group A streptococcus, [[Epstein-Barr virus]], [[Ross River virus]], [[scabies]], [[dengue fever]] and [[schistosomiasis]] (blood flukes)\n* Mental health, including [[schizophrenia]], [[dementia]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]\n* Chronic disorders such as liver disease, [[asthma]] and [[haemochromatosis]]\n\n==Location==\nThe Institute is located at 300 Herston Rd, Herston, [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]].\n\nQIMR Berghofer is housed in three buildings (the Bancroft Centre, the Clive Berghofer Cancer Research Centre and QIMR Berghofer Central at Herston, [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] adjacent to the [[Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital]] and The [[University of Queensland]] Medical School.\n\n==Key people==\n===Directors===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In his Policy Speech in November, 1972, the Federal Labor leader said that ''...one overriding objective of a Labor Government would be 'to preserve and enhance the quality of the National Estate''.<ref name=Sullivan/> When the Labor Government came to office in December 1972 a Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate was set up, with terms of reference ''...to report on: the nature and state of the National Estate; the measures presently being adopted; the measures which should be adopted; the role which the Australian Government should play in the preservation and enhancement of the National Estate; the manner in which the National Trusts of Australia and other appropriate conservation groups could be supported by public funds and the amount required in order that these bodies can immediately increase their effectiveness, in arguing and working for the preservation and enhancement of the Nation1 Estate.''<ref name=Sullivan/>\n\nThe AHC had a wide gamut, covering natural, indigenous and historical heritage. It was first proposed in the  Government-appointed ''Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate'', chaired by Mr Justice R.M. Hope, in April 1973. The Committee reported to Federal Parliament in August 1974 that ''...uncontrolled development, economic growth and 'progress' to that time had had a very detrimental effect on Australia's national estate...'' and called for ''...prompt action and public education to prevent further neglect and destruction''.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/1301.0Feature%20Article121988?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=1301.0&issue=1988&num=&view= 1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 1988]</ref>\n\nAn Interim Committee on the National Estate was formed in August 1974 to continue the work of the Inquiry and begin to develop a national policy for the\nNational Estate, based on UNESCO\u2019s Committee for the Protection of World Cultural and National Heritage, which spoke of an \u2018International Estate\u2019.<ref name=Ashton>[http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/research/bitstream/handle/10453/1557/2005004535.pdf?sequence=1 Ashton, Paul & Jennifer Cornwall, 2006, Corralling Conflict: The Politics Of Australian Federal Heritage Legislation Since The 1970s, ''Public History Review'', Vol 13, 2006, Pp53-65]</ref> The ''Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975'' was assented to on 19 June 1975. The Commission was a [[statutory authority]], responsible to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Commissioners meet four to six times a year, and with the part-time Chairman and six part-time Commissioners being chosen for their skills and interest in the natural and cultural environment.<ref name=Sullivan/>\n\n==Standards and criteria==\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s the AHC developed a number of policy documents which became standard heritage practice.

[[Ravi Shankar Prasad]] is the current Minister of Law and Justice.\n\n== History ==\nMinistry of law and justice is the oldest limb of the government of India dating back to 1833 when the Charter Act 1833 was enacted by the British Parliament when India was under [[British Raj|British control]]. The said Act vested for the first time legislative power in a single authority, namely the [[Governor-General of India|Governor General in Council]]. By virtue of this authority and the authority vested under him under section 22 of the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]] the Governor General in Council enacted laws for the country from 1834 to 1920. After the commencement of the [[Government of India Act 1919]] the legislative power was exercised by the Indian Legislature constituted thereunder. The Government of India Act 1919 was followed by the [[Government of India Act 1935]]. With the passing of the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] India became a 'dominion' and the 'dominion legislature' made laws from 1947 to 1949 under the provisions of section 100 of the Government of India Act 1935 as adapted by the [[Interim Government of India|India (Provisional Constitution) Order 1947]]. When the [[Constitution of India]] came into force on 26 January 1950, the legislative power thereafter got vested in the [[Parliament of India]].<ref name=\"About Us\" />\n\n==Organisation==\nThe Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules of 1961 entail the various departments working under the Ministry of Law and Justice of [[Government of India]].

[[Ravi Shankar Prasad]] is the current Minister of Law and Justice.\n\n== History ==\nMinistry of law and justice is the oldest limb of the government of India dating back to 1833 when the Charter Act 1833 was enacted by the British Parliament when India was under [[British Raj|British control]]. The said Act vested for the first time legislative power in a single authority, namely the [[Governor-General of India|Governor General in Council]]. By virtue of this authority and the authority vested under him under section 22 of the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]] the Governor General in Council enacted laws for the country from 1834 to 1920. After the commencement of the [[Government of India Act 1919]] the legislative power was exercised by the Indian Legislature constituted thereunder. The Government of India Act 1919 was followed by the [[Government of India Act 1935]]. With the passing of the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] India became a 'dominion' and the 'dominion legislature' made laws from 1947 to 1949 under the provisions of section 100 of the Government of India Act 1935 as adapted by the [[Interim Government of India|India (Provisional Constitution) Order 1947]]. When the [[Constitution of India]] came into force on 26 January 1950, the legislative power thereafter got vested in the [[Parliament of India]].<ref name=\"About Us\" />\n\n==Organisation==\nThe Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules of 1961 entail the various departments working under the Ministry of Law and Justice of [[Government of India]].

Much like [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS TV]], SBS radio receives funding from a mix of government grants, paid-for government information campaigns and commercial advertising.<ref name=\"aboutradio\">[http://www.radio.sbs.com.au/index.php?page=ab About SBS Radio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509224811/http://www.radio.sbs.com.au/index.php?page=ab |date=9 May 2007 }}\n</ref> SBS Radio broadcast the [[Euro 2008]] in Austria and Switzerland.\n\nFollowing \"extensive community consultation\" in 2003, SBS introduced a range of new programs, including services in [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Amharic language|Amharic]] \u2013 in addition to the expansion of many existing programs.<ref name=\"aboutradio\" />\n\nIn April 2013, SBS rolled out a major overhaul of its radio [[broadcast programming|schedule]]. The last major review of the SBS Radio schedule had taken place in 1994, and since then Australia's demographics had changed significantly.

With the addition of six new languages: [[Malayalam]], [[Dinka language|Dinka]], [[Hmong language|Hmong]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], SBS has brought the total number of languages from 68 to 74.<ref name=\"New SBS Radio Schedule has launched\">\n[http://www.sbs.com.au/radio/schedule2013 New SBS Radio Schedule has launched] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926053842/http://www.sbs.com.au/radio/schedule2013 |date=26 September 2013 }}, accessed 14 September 2013\n</ref><ref name=\"SBS Announces New Radio Schedule For 2013\">\n[http://www.sbs.com.au/aboutus/news-media-releases/view/id/685/h/SBS-Announces-New-Radio-Schedule-For-2013 SBS Announces New Radio Schedule For 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831145314/http://www.sbs.com.au/aboutus/news-media-releases/view/id/685/h/SBS-Announces-New-Radio-Schedule-For-2013 |date=31 August 2013 }}, accessed 14 September 2013</ref>\n\nSBS rolled out a trial of RDS (Radio Data Services) in the Melbourne and Sydney broadcast areas in November 2012.
