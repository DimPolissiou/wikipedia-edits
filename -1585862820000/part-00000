Directed by [[Marc Forster]] and written by [[Paul Haggis]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]], it is a direct sequel to [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], and the second film to star [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]]. The film also stars [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Judi Dench]].  In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd]], and is assisted by [[Camille Montes]], who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family.  The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman [[Dominic Greene]], a member of the [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] organisation<!-- \"Organisation\" is British spelling, and the article uses British spelling -->, which intends to stage a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in Bolivia to [[Water privatization in Bolivia|seize control of their water supply]]. \n\nProducer [[Michael G. Wilson]] developed the film's plot while the previous film in the series, [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], was being shot.  Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script.  Although Craig and Forster wrote some sections themselves during the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|screenwriter strike]],<ref name=Goldberg /> they received no such credits in the final cut.  The title was chosen from a 1959<!-- The story was first published in November 1959 in ''Modern Woman's Magazine'', q.v. For Your Eyes Only (short story collection) for the citation --> short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', though the film does not contain any elements of that story.  Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]].  Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage [[Douglas DC-3]] was used for a flight sequence, and [[Dennis Gassner]]'s set designs are reminiscent of [[Ken Adam]]'s work on several early ''Bond'' films.  Taking a course away from the usual [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]], Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.\n\nThe film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise.  Whereas ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' featured 109 \"trivial or severely violent\" acts, ''Quantum of Solace'' had a count of 250\u2014the most depictions of violence in any ''Bond'' film\u2014even more prominent since it was also the shortest film in the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|title=Sean Connery was the girliest Bond|publisher=Meeja|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2011|location=Australia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108212058/http://meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|archivedate=8 January 2013}}</ref>  ''Quantum of Solace'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, garnering generally polarized reviews, which mainly praised Craig's performance, the darker, grittier and realistic tone and the film's action sequences, but felt that the film was less impressive than the predecessor ''Casino Royale''.  {{As of|2016|September}}, it is the fourth-highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film, without adjusting for inflation, earning $589&nbsp;million worldwide, and becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2008]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler. -->\nMoments after the end of the previous film, James Bond is driving from [[Lake Como]] to [[Siena]], Italy, with the captured [[List of James Bond villains#Casino Royale 2006|Mr. White]] in the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] of his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]]. After evading pursuers Bond delivers White to [[M (James Bond)|M]], who interrogates him regarding the then unknown organisation, [[SPECTRE#Rebooted continuity|Quantum]]. M's [[bodyguard]], Craig Mitchell, is a double agent and attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in [[Haiti]], Edmund Slate. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]]. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\nAfter rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Bregenz]], Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s South American section, Gregg Beam, strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene's interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and she has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally [[List of James Bond allies#Ren\u00e9 Mathis|Ren\u00e9 Mathis]] to accompany him to [[Bolivia]]. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police, paid off by Greene and Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put his body in Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the policemen are killed.\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They skydive into a sinkhole and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a [[monopoly]]. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in [[Petroleum|crude oil]]. Bond meets CIA Agent [[Felix Leiter]], who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the [[Atacama Desert]] to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] when they attempt to kill him.\n\nAt an [[eco hotel]] in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that he now controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, and Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Bolivia's sole provider of water at significantly higher rates; if Medrano refuses, Greene will deprive the country of water until it [[societal collapse|collapses]]. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum. Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil. \n\nBond travels to [[Kazan]], Russia, where he finds [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections and is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau, a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|Canadian Intelligence]] agent, of Kabira's true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach.

Directed by [[Marc Forster]] and written by [[Paul Haggis]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]], it is a direct sequel to [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], and the second film to star [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]]. The film also stars [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Judi Dench]].  In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd]], and is assisted by [[Camille Montes]], who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family.  The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman [[Dominic Greene]], a member of the [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] organisation<!-- \"Organisation\" is British spelling, and the article uses British spelling -->, which intends to stage a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in Bolivia to [[Water privatization in Bolivia|seize control of their water supply]]. \n\nProducer [[Michael G. Wilson]] developed the film's plot while the previous film in the series, [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], was being shot.  Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script.  Although Craig and Forster wrote some sections themselves during the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|screenwriter strike]],<ref name=Goldberg /> they received no such credits in the final cut.  The title was chosen from a 1959<!-- The story was first published in November 1959 in ''Modern Woman's Magazine'', q.v. For Your Eyes Only (short story collection) for the citation --> short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', though the film does not contain any elements of that story.  Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]].  Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage [[Douglas DC-3]] was used for a flight sequence, and [[Dennis Gassner]]'s set designs are reminiscent of [[Ken Adam]]'s work on several early ''Bond'' films.  Taking a course away from the usual [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]], Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.\n\nThe film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise.  Whereas ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' featured 109 \"trivial or severely violent\" acts, ''Quantum of Solace'' had a count of 250\u2014the most depictions of violence in any ''Bond'' film\u2014even more prominent since it was also the shortest film in the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|title=Sean Connery was the girliest Bond|publisher=Meeja|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2011|location=Australia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108212058/http://meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|archivedate=8 January 2013}}</ref>  ''Quantum of Solace'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, garnering generally polarized reviews, which mainly praised Craig's performance, the darker, grittier and realistic tone and the film's action sequences, but felt that the film was less impressive than the predecessor ''Casino Royale''.  {{As of|2016|September}}, it is the fourth-highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film, without adjusting for inflation, earning $589&nbsp;million worldwide, and becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2008]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler. -->\nMoments after the end of the previous film, James Bond is driving from [[Lake Como]] to [[Siena]], Italy, with the captured [[List of James Bond villains#Casino Royale 2006|Mr. White]] in the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] of his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]]. After evading pursuers Bond delivers White to [[M (James Bond)|M]], who interrogates him regarding the then unknown organisation, [[SPECTRE#Rebooted continuity|Quantum]]. M's [[bodyguard]], Craig Mitchell, is a double agent and attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in [[Haiti]], Edmund Slate. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]]. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\nAfter rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Bregenz]], Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s South American section, Gregg Beam, strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene\u2019s interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and she has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally [[List of James Bond allies#Ren\u00e9 Mathis|Ren\u00e9 Mathis]] to accompany him to [[Bolivia]]. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police, paid off by Greene and Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put his body in Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the policemen are killed.\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They skydive into a sinkhole and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a [[monopoly]]. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in [[Petroleum|crude oil]]. Bond meets CIA Agent [[Felix Leiter]], who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the [[Atacama Desert]] to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] when they attempt to kill him.\n\nAt an [[eco hotel]] in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that he now controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, and Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Bolivia's sole provider of water at significantly higher rates; if Medrano refuses, Greene will deprive the country of water until it [[societal collapse|collapses]]. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum. Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil. \n\nBond travels to [[Kazan]], Russia, where he finds [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections and is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau, a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|Canadian Intelligence]] agent, of Kabira's true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]].

UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, [[Fujisan Hong\u016b Sengen Taisha]], as well as the Buddhist [[Taisekiji|Taisekiji Head Temple]] founded in 1290, later depicted by Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist Katsushika [[Hokusai]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe current ''[[kanji]]'' for Mount Fuji, {{lang|ja|\u5bcc}} and {{lang|ja|\u58eb}}, mean \"wealth\" or \"abundant\" and \"a man of status\" respectively. However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.\n\nThe origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|\"immortal\"|\u4e0d\u6b7b|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|\u5bcc|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|\u58eb|shi, ji}}<ref>Although the word {{lang|ja|\u58eb}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|\u5175\u58eb|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|\u6b66\u58eb|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.</ref> ascending the slopes of the mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}{{non-primary source|date=December 2017}}</ref> An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u4e8c}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u5c3d}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''neverending''.\n\nA Japanese classical scholar in the Edo era, [[Hirata Atsutane]], speculated that the name is from a word meaning, \"a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|\u7a42|ho}} of a rice plant\". A British missionary Bob Chiggleson (1854\u20131944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for \"fire\" (''fuchi'') of the [[fire deity]] ([[Kamui Fuchi]]), which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Ky\u014dsuke Kindaichi]] (1882\u20131971) on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]). It is also pointed out that ''huchi'' means an \"old woman\" and ''ape'' is the word for \"fire\", ''ape huchi kamuy'' being the fire deity. Research on the distribution of place names that include ''fuji'' as a part also suggest the origin of the word ''fuji'' is in the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] language rather than Ainu. A Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued that the name has the same root as {{Nihongo|[[wisteria]]|\u85e4|fuji}} and {{Nihongo|rainbow|\u8679|niji|but with an alternative reading, ''fuji''}}, and came from its \"long well-shaped slope\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306e\u7531\u6765 |date=May 31, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531001107/http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tisen.jp/tisenwiki/index.php?%C9%D9%BB%CE%BB%B3 |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71 \u2013 \u77e5\u6cc9Wiki |publisher=Tisen.jp |date=October 25, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |title=\u5730\u540d\u30fb\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u610f\u5473 |date=June 3, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080603055732/http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |archivedate = June 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hi5k-stu/aynu/huji.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8a9e\u6e90\u8aac\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 |publisher=Asahi-net.or.jp |date= |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nModern linguist [[Alexander Vovin]] proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading /pu\u207fzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese \u706b\u4e3b meaning 'fire master', see [[wikt:\u5bcc\u58eb#Etymology 2]].\n\n===Variations===\nIn English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji.

After a relatively short pause, eruptions began again which formed Komitake Volcano in the same location. These eruptions ended 100,000 years ago. Ashitake Volcano was active from 400,000 to 100,000 years ago, and is located 20&nbsp;km southeast of Mount Fuji. Mount Fuji started erupting 100,000 years ago, with Ko-Fuji (old-Fuji) forming 100,000 to 17,000 years ago, but which is now almost completely buried. A large landslide on the southwest flank occurred about 18,000 years ago. Shin-Fuji (new-Fuji) eruptions in the form of [[lava]], [[lapilli]] and [[volcanic ash]], have occurred between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago, between 7,000 and 3,500 years ago, and between 4,000 and 2,000 years ago. Flank eruptions, mostly in the form of parasitic [[cinder cone]]s, ceased in 1707. The largest cone, Omuro-Yama, is one of more than 100 cones aligned NW-SE and NE-SW through the summit. Mt. Fuji also has more than 70 [[lava tunnel]]s and extensive lava tree molds. Two large [[landslide]]s are at the head of the Yoshida-Osawa and Osawa-Kuzure valleys.<ref name=Piotr/>\n\n{{As of|2002|12}}, the volcano is classified as active with a low risk of eruption. The last recorded eruption was the [[H\u014dei eruption of Mount Fuji|H\u014dei eruption]] which started on December 16, 1707 (''[[H\u014dei]] 4, 23rd day of the 11th month''), and ended about January 1, 1708 (''H\u014dei 4, 9th day of the 12th month''), during the [[Edo period]].<ref name=\"ShizuokaUni\">{{cite web | url=http://sk01.ed.shizuoka.ac.jp/koyama/public_html/Fuji/fujid/1707.html | title=\u5b9d\u6c38\u56db\u5e74\uff081707\uff09\u5674\u706b (1707 Eruption) | publisher=Shizuoka University | work=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u6b74\u53f2\u5674\u706b\u7dcf\u89e3\u8aac (Database of eruptions and other activities of Fuji Volcano, Japan, based on historical records since AD 781) | date=March 2007 | accessdate=25 September 2008 | author=Masato Oyama | language=Japanese}}</ref> The eruption formed a new [[Volcanic crater|crater]] and a second peak, named '''[[Mount H\u014dei]]''' (after the [[H\u014dei]] era), halfway down its southeastern side.

The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.<!-- 2400, 2305, 2000 and 1440 metres from sea level--> There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.{{Citation needed|reason=Where do these start? Do they lead to the summit or just the 5th station trailheads? Are they documented somewhere?|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven though it has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.<ref name=MountainTrails />\n\nEven though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.\nBesides these routes, there are tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.\n\nThe four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, [[Asiatic black bear|bears]] have been sighted along the Yoshida route.\n\nHuts at and above the fifth stations are usually manned during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually manned for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers\u2014Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.\n[[File:\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u9802\u5fa1\u6765\u5149 Go-raikou(The sunrise) at summit of Mt.Fuji HDR-CX560V.webm|thumb|The sunrise seen from the summit of Mount Fuji]]\nThere are eight peaks around the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is where the [[Mount Fuji Radar System]] used to be (it was replaced by an automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these peaks.\n\n===Paragliding===\n[[Paraglider]]s take off in the vicinity of the fifth station Gotemba parking lot, between Subashiri and H\u014dei-zan peak on the south side of the mountain, in addition to several other locations, depending on wind direction. Several paragliding schools use the wide sandy/grassy slope between Gotemba and Subashiri parking lots as a training hill.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nAs a national symbol of the country, the mountain has been depicted in various art media such as paintings, woodblock prints (such as the ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]''), poetry, music, theater, film, [[manga]], [[anime]], [[pottery]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunritz-hattori-museum.or.jp/masterpieces/index.html|title=\u53ce\u8535\u54c1\u306e\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb &#124; \u30b5\u30f3\u30ea\u30c4\u670d\u90e8\u7f8e\u8853\u9928|website=www.sunritz-hattori-museum.or.jp}}</ref> and even [[Kawaii]] subculture.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"145\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:New and Old Rokuman-T\u014d of Taiseki-ji.jpg|Mount Fuji in the background of [[Taisekiji]] temple\nFile:Lake Motosu04.jpg|Mt.

UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, [[Fujisan Hong\u016b Sengen Taisha]], as well as the Buddhist [[Taisekiji|Taisekiji Head Temple]] founded in 1290, later depicted by Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist Katsushika [[Hokusai]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe current ''[[kanji]]'' for Mount Fuji, {{lang|ja|\u5bcc}} and {{lang|ja|\u58eb}}, mean \"wealth\" or \"abundant\" and \"a man of status\" respectively. However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.\n\nThe origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|\"immortal\"|\u4e0d\u6b7b|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|\u5bcc|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|\u58eb|shi, ji}}<ref>Although the word {{lang|ja|\u58eb}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|\u5175\u58eb|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|\u6b66\u58eb|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.</ref> ascending the slopes of the mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}{{non-primary source|date=December 2017}}</ref> An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u4e8c}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u5c3d}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''neverending''.\n\nA Japanese classical scholar in the Edo era, [[Hirata Atsutane]], speculated that the name is from a word meaning, \"a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|\u7a42|ho}} of a rice plant\". A British missionary Bob Chiggleson (1854\u20131944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for \"fire\" (''fuchi'') of the [[fire deity]] ([[Kamui Fuchi]]), which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Ky\u014dsuke Kindaichi]] (1882\u20131971) on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]). It is also pointed out that ''huchi'' means an \"old woman\" and ''ape'' is the word for \"fire\", ''ape huchi kamuy'' being the fire deity. Research on the distribution of place names that include ''fuji'' as a part also suggest the origin of the word ''fuji'' is in the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] language rather than Ainu. A Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued that the name has the same root as {{Nihongo|[[wisteria]]|\u85e4|fuji}} and {{Nihongo|rainbow|\u8679|niji|but with an alternative reading, ''fuji''}}, and came from its \"long well-shaped slope\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306e\u7531\u6765 |date=May 31, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531001107/http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tisen.jp/tisenwiki/index.php?%C9%D9%BB%CE%BB%B3 |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71 \u2013 \u77e5\u6cc9Wiki |publisher=Tisen.jp |date=October 25, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |title=\u5730\u540d\u30fb\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u610f\u5473 |date=June 3, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080603055732/http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |archivedate = June 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hi5k-stu/aynu/huji.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8a9e\u6e90\u8aac\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 |publisher=Asahi-net.or.jp |date= |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nModern linguist [[Alexander Vovin]] proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading /pu\u207fzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese \u706b\u4e3b meaning 'fire master', see [[wikt:\u5bcc\u58eb#Etymology 2]].\n\n===Variations===\nIn English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji.

They are (clockwise, starting North): Yoshida, Subashiri,<!-- A very long hike, because this name (if linked) redirects to an asteroid. --> [[Gotemba]], and [[Fujinomiya]] routes.<ref name=MountainTrails>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/trails/index.html |title=Mountain Trails |publisher= Official Website for Mt. Fuji Climbing |language=English}}</ref> Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.<!-- 2400, 2305, 2000 and 1440 metres from sea level--> There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.{{Citation needed|reason=Where do these start? Do they lead to the summit or just the 5th station trailheads? Are they documented somewhere?|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven though it has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.<ref name=MountainTrails />\n\nEven though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.\nBesides these routes, there are tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.\n\nThe four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, [[Asiatic black bear|bears]] have been sighted along the Yoshida route.\n\nHuts at and above the fifth stations are usually manned during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually manned for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers\u2014Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.\n[[File:\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u9802\u5fa1\u6765\u5149 Go-raikou(The sunrise) at summit of Mt.Fuji HDR-CX560V.webm|thumb|The sunrise seen from the summit of Mount Fuji]]\nThere are eight peaks around the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is where the [[Mount Fuji Radar System]] used to be (it was replaced by an automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these peaks.\n\n===Paragliding===\n[[Paraglider]]s take off in the vicinity of the fifth station Gotemba parking lot, between Subashiri and H\u014dei-zan peak on the south side of the mountain, in addition to several other locations, depending on wind direction. Several paragliding schools use the wide sandy/grassy slope between Gotemba and Subashiri parking lots as a training hill.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nAs a national symbol of the country, the mountain has been depicted in various art media such as paintings, woodblock prints (such as the ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]''), poetry, music, theater, film, [[manga]], [[anime]], [[pottery]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunritz-hattori-museum.or.jp/masterpieces/index.html|title=\u53ce\u8535\u54c1\u306e\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb &#124; \u30b5\u30f3\u30ea\u30c4\u670d\u90e8\u7f8e\u8853\u9928|website=www.sunritz-hattori-museum.or.jp}}</ref> and even [[Kawaii]] subculture.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"145\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:New and Old Rokuman-T\u014d of Taiseki-ji.jpg|Mount Fuji in the background of [[Taisekiji]] temple\nFile:Lake Motosu04.jpg|Mt.

The presence of this script makes it easy to understand why an unrequited lover persists in the face of rejection.<ref>B. H. Spitzberg/W. R. Cupach, ''The Dark Side of Close Relationships'' (1998) p. 251</ref>  In the traditional [[Wales|Welsh]] folk song [[Cariad Cywir]], the protagonist persists in unrequited love happily despite being continuously ignored.  However, there have been other depictions in which the unrequited lover commits suicide, as in Goethe's early novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' or in the traditional [[British Isles]] folk ballad ''[[I Once Loved a Lass]]''.\n\nIn [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s 1936 novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' the main character [[Scarlett O'Hara]] feels unrequited love towards [[Ashley Wilkes]].\n\nIn [[Billy Bragg]]'s song ''The Saturday Boy'', the young protagonist looks up the word \"unrequited\" in the dictionary whilst in the state of unrequited love. \n\nOne of the better examples of unrequited love is [[Frank Ocean]]'s \"Bad Religion\".\n\n\"[[Johnny Angel (song)|Johnny Angel]]\", a number one hit song by singer and actress [[Shelley Fabares]], has a relatively notable example of unrequited love. According to the lyrics of this song, a girl falls in love with a boy who doesn't even know that she exists. She even declines countless dates with other boys, just to fully concentrate on the boy she loves. And she has dreams about what the world would be like if the boy loves her. In its sequel, \"Johnny Loves Me\", also by Fabares, the girl later wins the boy's heart, convincing him to believe that the girl does exist.\n\nThe comics strip ''[[Peanuts]]'' features multiple different characters engaged in unrequited love relationships. Commenting on the abundance of unrequited love in the series, author [[Charles Schulz]] said that he did not know why there is so much unrequited love, but it is something everyone can relate to.<ref>{{citebook|title=Celebrating Peanuts: 60 Years|author=Charles M. Schulz|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=2009}}</ref>\n\nUnrequited Love is a pop album by actress singer songwriter ''[[Hillary Hawkins]]'' with songs such as \"Missing You\".<ref>https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Missing-You-is-2-Nickelodeon-Stars-1-Music-Video-20190903</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\n[[Image:Dante and beatrice.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] looks longingly at [[Beatrice Portinari]] (in yellow) as she passes by him with Lady [[Vanna]] (in red) in ''Dante and Beatrice'', by [[Henry Holiday]]]] \nUnrequited love has long been depicted as noble, an unselfish and stoic willingness to accept suffering. Literary and artistic depictions of unrequited love may depend on assumptions of social distance that have less relevance in western, democratic societies with relatively high social mobility and less rigid codes of sexual fidelity. Nonetheless, the literary record suggests a degree of euphoria in the feelings associated with unrequited love, which has the advantage as well of carrying none of the responsibilities of mutual relationships: certainly, \"rejection, apparent or real, may be the catalyst for inspired literary creation... 'the poetry of frustration'.\"<ref>Mary Ward, ''The Literature of Love'' (2009) p. 45-6</ref>\n\n[[Eric Berne]] considered that \"the man who is loved by a woman is lucky indeed, but the one to be envied is he who loves, however little he gets in return. How much greater is [[Dante]] gazing at [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] than Beatrice walking by him in apparent disdain\".<ref>Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (Penguin 1970) p. 238</ref>\n\n==\"Remedies\"==\nRoman poet [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Remedia Amoris]]'' \"provides advice on how to overcome inappropriate or unrequited love. The solutions offered include [[travel]], [[teetotalism]], [[bucolic]] pursuits, and ironically, avoidance of love poets\".<ref>A. Grafton et al, ''The Classical Tradition'' (2010) p. 664</ref>\n\n==Cultural analogues==\n\nIn the wake of his real-life experiences with [[Maud Gonne]], in a further twist, [[W. B. Yeats]] wrote of those who 'had read/All I had rhymed of that monstrous thing/Returned and yet unrequited love'.<ref>Y. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (London 1983) p. 155</ref> According to [[Robert B. Pippin]], [[Proust]] claimed that 'the only successful (sustainable) love is unrequited love'.<ref>Pippin, p. 326</ref> According to Pippin, sometimes 'unrequited love...has been invoked as a figure for the condition of [[modernity]] itself'.<ref>Pippin, p. 326n</ref> Examples of unrequited love include [[W.

However, there have been other depictions in which the unrequited lover commits suicide, as in Goethe's early novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' or in the traditional [[British Isles]] folk ballad ''[[I Once Loved a Lass]]''.\n\nIn [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s 1936 novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' the main character [[Scarlett O'Hara]] feels unrequited love towards [[Ashley Wilkes]].\n\nIn [[Billy Bragg]]'s song ''The Saturday Boy'', the young protagonist looks up the word \"unrequited\" in the dictionary whilst in the state of unrequited love. \n\nOne of the better examples of unrequited love is [[Frank Ocean]]'s \"Bad Religion\".\n\n\"[[Johnny Angel (song)|Johnny Angel]]\", a number one hit song by singer and actress [[Shelley Fabares]], has a relatively notable example of unrequited love. According to the lyrics of this song, a girl falls in love with a boy who doesn't even know that she exists. She even declines countless dates with other boys, just to fully concentrate on the boy she loves. And she has dreams about what the world would be like if the boy loves her. In its sequel, \"Johnny Loves Me\", also by Fabares, the girl later wins the boy's heart, convincing him to believe that the girl does exist.\n\nThe comics strip ''[[Peanuts]]'' features multiple different characters engaged in unrequited love relationships. Commenting on the abundance of unrequited love in the series, author [[Charles Schulz]] said that he did not know why there is so much unrequited love, but it is something everyone can relate to.<ref>{{citebook|title=Celebrating Peanuts: 60 Years|author=Charles M. Schulz|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=2009}}</ref>\n\nUnrequited Love is a pop album by actress singer songwriter ''[[Hillary Hawkins]]'' with songs such as \"Missing You\".<ref>https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Missing-You-is-2-Nickelodeon-Stars-1-Music-Video-20190903</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\n[[Image:Dante and beatrice.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] looks longingly at [[Beatrice Portinari]] (in yellow) as she passes by him with Lady [[Vanna]] (in red) in ''Dante and Beatrice'', by [[Henry Holiday]]]] \nUnrequited love has long been depicted as noble, an unselfish and stoic willingness to accept suffering. Literary and artistic depictions of unrequited love may depend on assumptions of social distance that have less relevance in western, democratic societies with relatively high social mobility and less rigid codes of sexual fidelity. Nonetheless, the literary record suggests a degree of euphoria in the feelings associated with unrequited love, which has the advantage as well of carrying none of the responsibilities of mutual relationships: certainly, \"rejection, apparent or real, may be the catalyst for inspired literary creation... 'the poetry of frustration'.\"<ref>Mary Ward, ''The Literature of Love'' (2009) p. 45-6</ref>\n\n[[Eric Berne]] considered that \"the man who is loved by a woman is lucky indeed, but the one to be envied is he who loves, however little he gets in return. How much greater is [[Dante]] gazing at [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] than Beatrice walking by him in apparent disdain\".<ref>Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (Penguin 1970) p. 238</ref>\n\n==\"Remedies\"==\nRoman poet [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Remedia Amoris]]'' \"provides advice on how to overcome inappropriate or unrequited love. The solutions offered include [[travel]], [[teetotalism]], [[bucolic]] pursuits, and ironically, avoidance of love poets\".<ref>A. Grafton et al, ''The Classical Tradition'' (2010) p. 664</ref>\n\n==Cultural analogues==\n\nIn the wake of his real-life experiences with [[Maud Gonne]], in a further twist, [[W. B. Yeats]] wrote of those who 'had read/All I had rhymed of that monstrous thing/Returned and yet unrequited love'.<ref>Y. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (London 1983) p. 155</ref> According to [[Robert B. Pippin]], [[Proust]] claimed that 'the only successful (sustainable) love is unrequited love'.<ref>Pippin, p. 326</ref> According to Pippin, sometimes 'unrequited love...has been invoked as a figure for the condition of [[modernity]] itself'.<ref>Pippin, p. 326n</ref> Examples of unrequited love include [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Stendhal]], [[Dante]], [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and [[Goethe]].\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Lovesickness]]\n*[[Broken heart]]\n*[[Tsundere]]\n*[[Erotomania]]\n*[[Existential crisis]]\n*[[Friend zone]]\n*[[Obsessive love]]\n*[[Romantic friendship]]\n*[[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]]\n*[[Waifu]]\n*[[Limerence]]\n*[[Romance (love)]]\n*[[Anteros]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2|}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Robert Burton, ''The Anatomy of Melancholy'' (New York 1951) THE THIRD PARTITION: LOVE-MELANCHOLY\n*J.
