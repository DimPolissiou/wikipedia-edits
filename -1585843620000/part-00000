Due to much expansion, the village became a part of Sheffield city during the 1950s. During much of the late 19th and 20th centuries the village was noted for its [[steelmaking]], with the [[Thomas Staniforth & Co]] [[Sickle]] works being based at Main Street. Another prominent feature of the village is the 17th century [[Hackenthorpe Hall]], built by John Newbould for the Hounsfield family, with [[James Hounsfield]] being a prominent land owner. The building is today used as a nursery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022302/B3161E49EEF3B23576A8CC75AD47716019A6B303.html|title=James Hounsfield, Hackenthorpe Hall|website=Europeana Collections}}</ref>\n\nThe Hackenthorpe Infant School provided education to the local children in the village during the 20th century, this was demolished in 1999 and today local children attend the Rainbow Forge school.\n\nToday the village has seen much development in terms of housing, however the former sickle works, estates and post office still remain in the village and are a reminder of its industrial past. Hackenthope was once a part of Derbyshire in the parish of Beighton but is now part of South Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cchackenthorpe.org.uk/about-us/history/|title=History - Christ Church Hackenthorpe|website=www.cchackenthorpe.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Early history==\nThe first mention of the village comes from 9th century [[Anglo Saxon]] records of [[Derbyshire]] land owners. The village was then known as Eckingthorp, meaning 'The hamlet of Eck's people'. The then hamlet stood on the edges of the 'Great Forest' which stood in the area where the [[Rother Valley Country Park]] stands today and extended to areas of Derbyshire, [[Nottinghamshire]], [[West Yorkshire]] and [[Lincolnshire]]. Today the only remnants of the 'Great Forest' is [[Sherwood Forest]].<ref>Hackenthorpe community history v1-0 - Sheffield City Council</ref>\n\nEckingthorp was settled by the British invaders known as the [[Angles]]. The invasions took place at the end of the Romanic period around 500AD. Prior to these invasions the area was part of the [[Kingdom of Mercia]], the local [[Shire Brook]] formed the border with the neighbouring kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. Being so close to the border meant the hamlet was prone to invasions.\n\nThe Sheffield Museum contains a number of bones and flint tools unearthed in the area during the 19th century, dating back to the [[Neolithic period]], this shows the area was inhabited long before the Angles settled.\n\n[[File:Greenside, Hackenthorpe.jpg|thumb|[[Greenside House]], built in the 18th Century]]\n\nIn later centuries the hamlet consisted of farmlands, with the [[serfs]] spending time cultivating plots while also spending time working on the local lordships domains. As well as farming the area was found to be rich in [[coal]] and [[iron ore]] which provided income to many residents.\n\nIn 1653, John and Alice Newbould, wealthy landowners from [[Woodhouse, South Yorkshire|Woodhouse]] built the Hackenthorpe Hall on Main Street, a sign of increasing wealth in the hamlet.\n\nBy the turn of the 18th century Hackenthorpe began to develop into an industrial site, with coal mines, quarries and mills found throughout the area between Hackenthorpe and [[Birley]].\n\nA remnant of this time period can still be found on Main Street, the Staniforth Works dating from 1743, originally built for scythe making can still be found on the street, complete with the smithy pond in the yard. Some of the old forge dams used for smithing during this time period can also be found throughout the local [[Shire Brook Valley Local Nature Reserve]], most notably Carr Forge.\n\nThe 19th century saw significant growth in the area, and the small hamlet was now a village. A chapel was built in 1813 across from Hackenthorpe Hall, this would later be replaced by a new church in 1899 known as [[Christ Church, Hackenthorpe|Christ church]] at the end of Sheffield road. In 1820 steam power began to be used by the local scythe makers and by 1840 the [[Sheffield Coal Company]] had several mines throughout the area. At this time the [[Beighton railway station]] was in use by people entering and exiting the area on the Midland line from [[Rotherham]] to [[Derby]]. 1855 saw the opening of the National school in the Beighton parish which served the area until 1880, when Lord Manvers allowed for a second school to be built serving the Hackenthorpe village.\n\nBy 1877 the first of the [[Birley Collieries]] was opened, and saw a daily output of 500 tons of coal. Throughout the remainder of the 19th and 20th centuries the collieries were a large source of employment for residents of the village.\n\n==20th century==\nWith coal mining playing a large role on the village, the colliery owners began building terraced housing for local workers. It was around this time that development began on the [[Frecheville]] estates, which had until this time been known as Birley Moor, a mostly rural region. Following the [[Second World War]], housing was in short supply in [[Sheffield]] and the land between the city and Hackenthorpe saw prolific development causing the village to be incorporated into the city limits on 1 April 1967. This also saw the village leave the county of [[Derbyshire]] for [[Yorkshire]].\n\nDevelopment continued into the 1970s, with the areas around [[Mosborough]] village being developed and incorporated into the city. By this stage the coal mining industry had ceased, with the closure of the [[Birley Collieries]] the area saw a drastic change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/88/a4082988.shtml|title=BBC - WW2 People's War - The Home Guard at Birley East Colliery|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Sheffield_Coal_Co|title=Sheffield Coal Co|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==21st century==\nToday the village is a shadow of its former self, with many of the old terraced housing demolished and replaced with modern housing. The Staniforth Works remain, now used to house small businesses, as a reminder of the villages industrial past. The Hackenthorpe Hall can still be found on Main Street and is now used as a nursery. Other older buildings include the post office, and the blacksmiths now used as a veterinary office.\n[[File:Shops at Hackenthorpe. - geograph.org.uk - 305136.jpg|thumb|Modern Hackenthorpe shops, 2007]]\nDevelopment has been focused along the Birley Moor region, with a shopping district now found at the junction between Main Street and Birley Spa Lane, new housing estates were also built in this area with much of the rural farmland now gone.\n[[File:Hackenthorpe Post Office - geograph.org.uk - 305119.jpg|thumb|Hackenthorpe Post Office, 2007]]\n\n==Name origin==\nAs is the case with a number of towns and settlements in the [[British Isles]], Hackenthorpe gets its name from the [[Old Norse]], meaning 'Hachen\u2019s outlying farmstead'. For many years the village was simply split between the parishes of [[Beighton, Sheffield|Beighton]] and [[Birley]], however during the 14th century the modern spelling of Hackenthorpe emerged when local dialects began to have an influence on placenames.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffieldindexers.com/Memories/CherishedMemories_OldPlaceNamesProbablyMeanings.htm|title=The Sheffield Indexers - Probably Meantings of Old Place Names In And Around Sheffield|first=Elaine|last=Pickard|website=www.sheffieldindexers.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160312131549/https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/libraries/archives-and-local-studies/community-histories/hackenthorpe.html Hackenthorpe local history - Sheffield City Council]\n*[http://www.cchackenthorpe.org.uk/about-us/history/ Hackenthorpe History on the Christchurch website]\n*[http://staniforthfamily.com/Hackenthorpe.html Hackenthorpe History]\n\n[[Category:Villages of the metropolitan borough of Sheffield]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n|country = England\n|coordinates = {{coord|53.3435900|-1.3810500|display=inline,title}}\n|label_position = left\n|official_name = Hackenthorpe\n|civil_parish = \n|population = \n|population_ref = \n|metropolitan_borough = [[Metropolitan Borough of Sheffield|Sheffield]]\n|metropolitan_county = [[South Yorkshire]]\n|region = Yorkshire and the Humber\n|constituency_westminster = [[Sheffield Attercliffe (UK Parliament constituency)|Attercliffe]]\n|post_town = SHEFFIELD\n|postcode_district = S12\n|postcode_area = S\n|dial_code = \n|os_grid_reference = SK408838\n}}\n\n'''Hackenthorpe''' is a village 5 miles south east of [[Sheffield]]\u2019s city centre, now classed as a historic township of the city.

It is easy to come up with, easy to understand, and easy to apply, and these three things are the hallmarks of a strong and healthy moral system. The idea behind it is readily graspable: before performing an action which might harm another person, try to imagine yourself in their position, and consider whether you would want to be the recipient of that action. If you would not want to be in such a position, the other person probably would not either, and so you should not do it.

Paden, the Golden Rule is arguably the most essential basis for the modern concept of [[human rights]], in which each individual has a right to just treatment, and a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others.<ref>Defined another way, it \"''refers to the balance in an interactive system such that each party has both rights and duties, and the subordinate norm of complementarity states that one's rights are the other's obligation.''\"{{cite book|last=Bornstein |first=Marc H.|title=Handbook of Parenting|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=2002|page=5|isbn=978-0-8058-3782-7}} See also: {{cite book|last=Paden |first=William E.|title=Interpreting the Sacred: Ways of Viewing Religion|publisher=Beacon Press|year=2003|pages=131\u2013132|isbn=978-0-8070-7705-4}}</ref>\n\nHowever [[Leo Damrosch]] argued that the notion that the Golden Rule pertains to \"rights\" per se is a contemporary interpretation and has nothing to do with its origin. The development of human \"rights\" is a modern political ideal that began as a philosophical concept promulgated through the philosophy of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] in 18th century France, among others. His writings influenced [[Thomas Jefferson]], who then incorporated Rousseau's reference to \"inalienable rights\" into the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776.

Psychologically, it involves a person [[Empathy|empathizing]] with others. Philosophically, it involves a person perceiving their neighbor also as \"I\" or \"self\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Golden Rule |last1=Wattles | first1=Jeffrey | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 }}</ref> Sociologically, \"love your neighbor as yourself\" is applicable between individuals, between groups, and also between individuals and groups.  In evolution, \"[[reciprocal altruism]]\" is seen as a distinctive advance in the capacity of human groups to survive and reproduce, as their exceptional brains demanded exceptionally long childhoods and ongoing provision and protection even beyond that of the immediate family.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vogel| first1=Gretchen|title=The Evolution of the Golden Rule|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=Feb 2004}}</ref> In [[Golden Rule#Economics|economics]], Richard Swift, referring to ideas from [[David Graeber]], suggests that \"without some kind of reciprocity society would no longer be able to exist.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Swift|first1=Richard|title=Pathways & possibilites|journal=New Internationalist|volume=484|issue=July/August 2015|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nPhilosophers, such as [[Immanuel Kant]]<ref name=\"Kant\" /> and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/05/the_golden_rule.html |title=Only a Game: The Golden Rule |publisher=Onlyagame.typepad.com |date=24 May 2007 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref> have objected to the rule on a variety of grounds. The most serious among these is its application. How does one know how others want to be treated? The obvious way is to ask them, but this cannot be done if one assumes they have not reached a particular and relevant understanding.\n\n=== Differences in values or interests ===\n[[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote, \"Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you.

But it seems to overlook the fact that \"doing as you would be done by\" includes taking into account your neighbour's tastes as you would that he should take yours into account.

G. Singer, The Ideal of a Rational Morality, p. 270</ref> Counter-examples to the golden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second.\n\nIn his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation that such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain general ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste, in situation, and so forth). But if we apply the golden rule to our own method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to apply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since it is quite predictable that others' ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It follows that we should not do so ourselves\u2014according to the golden rule. In this way, the golden rule may be self-correcting.<ref>Wattles, p. 6</ref> An article by Jouni Reinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail.<ref>Jouni Reinikainen, \"The Golden Rule and the Requirement of Universalizability.\" Journal of Value Inquiry. 39(2): 155\u2013168, 2005.</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|platinum rule description}} <!-- Do not delete this code as it is used to link here from elsewhere.

We would often want other people to ignore any prejudice against our [[Race (human categorization)|race]] or nationality when deciding how to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing preferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on.

It is easy to come up with, easy to understand, and easy to apply, and these three things are the hallmarks of a strong and healthy moral system. The idea behind it is readily graspable: before performing an action which might harm another person, try to imagine yourself in their position, and consider whether you would want to be the recipient of that action. If you would not want to be in such a position, the other person probably would not either, and so you should not do it.

The development of human \"rights\" is a modern political ideal that began as a philosophical concept promulgated through the philosophy of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] in 18th century France, among others. His writings influenced [[Thomas Jefferson]], who then incorporated Rousseau's reference to \"inalienable rights\" into the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776.

Psychologically, it involves a person [[Empathy|empathizing]] with others. Philosophically, it involves a person perceiving their neighbor also as \"I\" or \"self\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Golden Rule |last1=Wattles | first1=Jeffrey | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 }}</ref> Sociologically, \"love your neighbor as yourself\" is applicable between individuals, between groups, and also between individuals and groups.

But it seems to overlook the fact that \"doing as you would be done by\" includes taking into account your neighbour's tastes as you would that he should take yours into account.

G. Singer, The Ideal of a Rational Morality, p. 270</ref> Counter-examples to the golden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second.\n\nIn his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation that such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain general ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste, in situation, and so forth). But if we apply the golden rule to our own method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to apply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since it is quite predictable that others' ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It follows that we should not do so ourselves\u2014according to the golden rule. In this way, the golden rule may be self-correcting.<ref>Wattles, p. 6</ref> An article by Jouni Reinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail.<ref>Jouni Reinikainen, \"The Golden Rule and the Requirement of Universalizability.\" Journal of Value Inquiry. 39(2): 155\u2013168, 2005.</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|platinum rule description}} <!-- Do not delete this code as it is used to link here from elsewhere.

We would often want other people to ignore any prejudice against our [[Race (human categorization)|race]] or nationality when deciding how to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing preferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on.

He was born in Manitoba, Canada, and died at the age of 82.\n\n==Early life==\nStefansson, born William Stephenson, was born at [[Rural Municipality of Gimli|Arnes, Manitoba]], Canada, in 1879. His parents had emigrated from [[Iceland]] to Manitoba two years earlier. After losing two children during a period of devastating flooding, the family moved to [[North Dakota]] in 1880.\n\nHe was educated at the universities [[University of North Dakota|of North Dakota]] and [[University of Iowa|of Iowa]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]], 1903). During his college years, in 1899, he changed his name to Vilhjalmur Stefansson. He studied [[anthropology]] at the graduate school of [[Harvard University]], where for two years he was an instructor.\n\n==Early explorations==\nIn 1904 and 1905, Stefansson did archaeological research in [[Iceland]]. Recruited by [[Ejnar Mikkelsen]] and [[Ernest de Koven Leffingwell]] for their Anglo-American Polar Expedition, he lived with the [[Inuit]] of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] during the winter of 1906\u20131907, returning alone across country via the [[Porcupine River|Porcupine]] and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] Rivers. Under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City|New York]], he and Dr. [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R. M. Anderson]] undertook the ethnological survey of the Central Arctic coasts of the shores of [[North America]] from 1908 to 1912.\n\nIn 1908, Stefansson made a decision that would affect the rest of his time in Alaska: he hired the [[Inuk]] guide [[Natkusiak]], who would remain with him as his primary guide for the rest of his Alaska expeditions.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic45-1-90.pdf Natkusiak (ca. 1885\u20131947)], ''Arctic'' magazine, Vol. 45, No. 1 (March 1992), pp. 90\u201392.</ref> At the time he met Natkusiak, the Inuk guide was working for Capt. [[George Baker Leavitt, Sr.|George B. Leavitt]], a Massachusetts [[whaler|whaling ship]] captain and friend of Stefansson's who sometimes brought the Arctic explorer replenishments of supplies from the American Museum of Natural History.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AE_P_XngIi0C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22george+leavitt%22+narwhal&source=bl&ots=RulYvQQUSn&sig=VkQqCn5gK9RK6Rb4yRswvfvBCqA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result ''My Life with the Eskimo''], Vilhjalmur Stefansson, Reissued by Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-2395-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Christian Klengenberg]] is first credited to have introduced the term \"[[Blond Eskimos|Blonde Eskimo]]\" to Stefansson just before Stefansson's visit to the Inuit inhabiting southwestern [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], Canada, in 1910.

H.}}</ref> [[Adolphus Greely]] in 1912 first compiled the sightings recorded in earlier literature of blonde or fair haired Arctic natives and in 1912 published them in the ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' entitled \"The Origin of Stefansson's Blonde Eskimo\". Newspapers subsequently popularised the term \"Blonde Eskimo\", which caught more readers' attention despite Stefansson's preference for the term Copper Inuit. Stefansson later referenced Greely's work in his writings and the term \"Blonde Eskimo\" became applied to sightings of light haired [[Eskimo]]s from as early as the 17th century.<ref>''My Life with the Eskimo'', 1922, p. 199 (reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Loss of the ''Karluk'' and rescue of survivors==\n{{Further|Voyage of the Karluk}}\nStefansson organized and directed the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916]] to explore the regions west of [[Queen Elizabeth Islands|Parry Archipelago]] for the [[Government of Canada]]. Three ships, the ''[[HMCS Karluk|Karluk]]'', the ''Mary Sachs'', and the ''Alaska'' were employed.\n\nStefansson left the main ship, the ''Karluk'', when it became stuck in the ice in August/September 1913. Stefansson's explanation was that he and five other expedition members left to go hunting to provide fresh meat for the crew. However, William Laird McKinley and others left on the ship suspected that he left deliberately, anticipating that the ship would be carried off by moving ice, as indeed happened. The ship, with Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]] of Newfoundland and 24 other expedition members aboard, drifted westward with the ice and was eventually crushed. It sank on January 11, 1914. Four men made their way to [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]], but died there, possibly from carbon monoxide poisoning, before they could be rescued. Four other men, including [[Alistair Mackay]] who had been part of the Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907\u201309|British Antarctic Expedition]], tried reaching [[Wrangel Island]] on their own but perished. The remaining members of the expedition, under command of Captain Bartlett, made their way to Wrangel Island where three died. Bartlett and his Inuk hunter Kataktovik made their way across sea ice to Siberia to get help. Remaining survivors were picked up by the American fishing [[schooner]] [[King & Winge (fishing schooner)|''King & Winge'']] and the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] [[Revenue cutter|cutter]] {{USRC|Bear}}.<ref>Newell, Gordon R., ed., ''H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest'', at 242, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington, 1966.</ref>\n\nStefansson resumed his explorations by [[sledge]] over the [[Arctic Ocean]], here known as the [[Beaufort Sea]], leaving [[Collinson Point, Alaska|Collinson Point]], [[Alaska]] in April, 1914. A supporting sledge turned back {{convert|75|mi|abbr=on}} offshore, but he and two men continued onward on one sledge, living largely by his rifle on polar game for 96 days until his party reached the ''Mary Sachs'' in the autumn. Stefansson continued exploring until 1918.\n\n==Wrangel Island fiasco==\nIn 1921, he encouraged and planned an expedition for four young men to colonise [[Wrangel Island]] north of [[Siberia]], where the eleven survivors of the 22 men on the ''Karluk'' had lived from March to September 1914. Stefansson had designs for forming an exploration company that would be geared towards individuals interested in touring the Arctic island.\n\nStefansson originally wanted to claim Wrangel Island for the Canadian government. However, due to the dangerous outcome from his initial trip to the island, the government refused to assist with the expedition. He then wanted to claim the land for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] but the British government rejected this claim when it was made by the young men. The raising of the British flag on Wrangel Island, an acknowledged [[Russia]]n territory, caused an international incident.\n\nThe four young men, Frederick Maurer, E. Lorne Knight, and Milton Galle from the US, and Allan Crawford of Canada, were inexperienced and ill-equipped for the trip. All perished on the island or in an attempt to get help from Siberia across the frozen [[Chukchi Sea]]. The only survivors were an Inuk woman, [[Ada Blackjack]], whom the men had hired as a seamstress in [[Nome, Alaska]], and taken with them, and the expedition's cat, Vic. Ada Blackjack had taught herself survival skills and cared for the last man on the island, E. Lorne Knight, until he died of [[scurvy]]. Blackjack was rescued in 1923 after two years on Wrangel Island. Stefansson drew the ire of the public and the families for having sent such ill-equipped young men to Wrangel. His reputation was severely tainted by this disaster and that of the ''Karluk''.\n\n==Discoveries==\nStefansson's discoveries included new land (such as [[Brock Island|Brock]], [[Mackenzie King Island|Mackenzie King]], [[Borden Island|Borden]], [[Meighen Island|Meighen]], and [[Lougheed Island]]s)<ref name=Stefansson>{{cite book\n  | last = Stefansson\n  | first = Vilhjalmur\n  | title = The Friendly Arctic: The Story of Five Years in Polar Regions\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | year = 1922\n  | location = New York\n| url =https://archive.org/details/friendlyarctics01stefgoog}}</ref> and the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. His journeys and successes are among the marvels of [[Arctic exploration]]. He extended the discoveries of [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]. From April 1914 to June 1915 he lived on the [[Drift ice|ice pack]]. Stefansson continued his explorations leaving from [[Herschel Island]] on August 23, 1915.\n\nOn January 30, 1920, ''The Pioche Record'' reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the [[McClintock Arctic expedition|1853 McClintock expedition]] on [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh arctic conditions.{{sfn|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920|p=3}}\n\nIn 1921, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for his explorations of the Arctic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nStefansson remained a well-known explorer for the rest of his life. Late in life, through his affiliation with [[Dartmouth College]] (he was Director of Polar Studies), he became a major figure in the establishment of the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] (CRREL) in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]]. CRREL-supported research, often conducted in winter on the forbidding summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], has been key to developing mat\u00e9riel and doctrine to support alpine conflict.\n\nStefansson joined [[the Explorers Club]] in 1908, four years after its founding. He later served as Club President twice: 1919\u20131922 and 1937\u20131939. In the all-male Club, the Board drew attention under Stefansson's reign when it put forth an amendment to its bylaws that read in 1938, \"A Woman's Roll of Honor shall be instituted to which the Board of Directors may name women of the United States and Canada in recognition of the noteworthy achievements and writings in the field of the Club's interests, primarily exploration.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\">Minutes, Explorer's Club, 4 January 1938.</ref> Perhaps to comfort fellow members, the article added, \"This Woman's Roll of Honor shall be quite outside the Club's organisation but shall correspond in dignity to the Honorary Class of (male) members within it.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\" /> His continued support of women in anthropology is demonstrated in his 1939\u20131941 mentorship of [[Gitel Steed]] as she undertook research on diet and subsistence for his two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', from which she began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Stefansson was one of the regulars at [[Romany Marie]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] [[caf\u00e9]]s.<ref name=\"Biography\">Robert Shulman.

One of the organisations prominent in this campaign was the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan]], or Ambijan, formed in 1934. A tireless proponent of settlement in Birobidzhan, Stefansson appeared at countless Ambijan meetings, dinners, and rallies, and proved an invaluable resource. Ambijan produced a 50-page Year Book at the end of 1936, full of testimonials and letters of support. Among these was one from Stefansson, who was now also listed as a member of Ambijan's Board of Directors and Governors: \"The Birobidjan project seems to me to offer a most statesmanlike contribution to the problem of the rehabilitation of eastern and central European Jewry,\" he wrote.\n\nAmbijan's national conference in New York, November 25\u201326, 1944, pledged to raise $1 million to support refugees in [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and Birobidzhan. Prominent guests and speakers included New York Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]], Senator [[Elbert D. Thomas]] of [[Utah]], and Soviet ambassador [[Andrei Gromyko]]. A public dinner, attended by the delegates and their guests, was hosted by Vilhjalmur and spouse Evelyn Stefansson. Vilhjalmur was selected as one of two vice-presidents of the organisation.\n\nBut with the growing anti-Russian feeling in the country after [[World War II]], \"expos\u00e9s\" of Stefansson began to appear in the press. In August 1951, he was denounced as a [[Communism|Communist]] before a [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security subcommittee]] by [[Louis F. Budenz]], a Communist-turned-Catholic. Perhaps Stefansson himself had by then some second thoughts about Ambijan, for his posthumously published autobiography made no mention of his work on its behalf. Nor, for that matter, did his otherwise very complete obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of August 27, 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Srebrnik | first1 = Henry | year = 1998 | title = The Radical 'Second Life' of Vilhjalmur Stefansson | url = | journal = Arctic | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 58\u201360 | doi=10.14430/arctic1046}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy of an exclusively meat diet==\nStefansson is also a figure of considerable interest in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary circles, especially those with an interest in very [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s. Stefansson documented the fact that the [[Inuit diet]] consisted of about 90% meat and fish; Inuit would often go 6 to 9 months a year eating nothing but meat and fish\u2014what might nowadays be perceived to be a 'zerocarb' / [[no-carbohydrate diet]]. (The diet technically contains a very low amount of carbohydates as the fresh fish that the Inuit ate would have contained a small amount of glycogen.) He found that he and his fellow explorers of European, Negro, and South Sea Islands descent were also perfectly healthy on such a diet. \n\nSome years after his first experience with the Inuit (known as Eskimos in Stefansson's time), Dr. Stefansson returned to the Arctic with a colleague, Dr. Karsten Anderson, to carry out research for the American Museum of Natural History. They were supplied with every necessity including a year's supply of 'civilised' food. This they declined, electing instead to live off the land. In the end, the one-year project stretched to four years, during which time the two men ate only the meat they could kill and the fish they could catch in the Canadian Arctic. Neither of the two men suffered any adverse after-effects from their four-year experiment. It was evident to Stefansson, as it had been to [[William Banting]], that the body could function perfectly well, remain healthy, vigorous and slender if it used a diet in which as much food was eaten as the body required, only carbohydrate was restricted and the total number of calories was ignored.<ref name=\"Groves\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/banting.html|title=WILLIAM BANTING: The Father of the Low-Carbohydrate Diet|last=Groves, PhD|first=Barry|year=2002|publisher=Second Opinions|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was considerable skepticism when Stefansson reported his findings about the viability of an exclusively meat diet, his claims have been borne out in later studies and analyses.<ref>Fediuk, Karen. 2000 [http://members.shaw.ca/karen.fediuk/VitaminCintheInuitdiet.pdf Vitamin C in the Inuit diet: past and present].

The book ''The Unseen Power: Public Relations'' states that [[Pendleton Dudley|Pendelton Dudley]], once considered the \"dean of public relations\", convinced the [[American Meat Institute]] to fund this study.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations|last=Cutlip|first=Scott|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0805814655|location=London|pages=101|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe results were published, and Anderson had developed [[glycosuria]] during this time, which is normally associated with untreated diabetes.

Stefansson noted that in the North, very lean meat sometimes produced \"digestive disturbances\".

Stefansson attributes the fast onset of illness due to the usually lean meat that he was served versus the fattier caribou meat he consumed previously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblelife.org/stefansson2.htm|title=Adventures in Diet Part 2 (Harper's Monthly Magazine)|last=Stefansson|first=Vilhjalmur|date=December 1935}}</ref>  After eating fatty meat, he fully recovered in two days.

He was born in Manitoba, Canada, and died at the age of 82.\n\n==Early life==\nStefansson, born William Stephenson, was born at [[Rural Municipality of Gimli|Arnes, Manitoba]], Canada, in 1879. His parents had emigrated from [[Iceland]] to Manitoba two years earlier. After losing two children during a period of devastating flooding, the family moved to [[North Dakota]] in 1880.\n\nHe was educated at the universities [[University of North Dakota|of North Dakota]] and [[University of Iowa|of Iowa]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]], 1903). During his college years, in 1899, he changed his name to Vilhjalmur Stefansson. He studied [[anthropology]] at the graduate school of [[Harvard University]], where for two years he was an instructor.\n\n==Early explorations==\nIn 1904 and 1905, Stefansson did archaeological research in [[Iceland]]. Recruited by [[Ejnar Mikkelsen]] and [[Ernest de Koven Leffingwell]] for their Anglo-American Polar Expedition, he lived with the [[Inuit]] of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] during the winter of 1906\u20131907, returning alone across country via the [[Porcupine River|Porcupine]] and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] Rivers. Under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City|New York]], he and Dr. [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R. M. Anderson]] undertook the ethnological survey of the Central Arctic coasts of the shores of [[North America]] from 1908 to 1912.\n\nIn 1908, Stefansson made a decision that would affect the rest of his time in Alaska: he hired the [[Inuk]] guide [[Natkusiak]], who would remain with him as his primary guide for the rest of his Alaska expeditions.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic45-1-90.pdf Natkusiak (ca. 1885\u20131947)], ''Arctic'' magazine, Vol. 45, No. 1 (March 1992), pp. 90\u201392.</ref> At the time he met Natkusiak, the Inuk guide was working for Capt. [[George Baker Leavitt, Sr.|George B. Leavitt]], a Massachusetts [[whaler|whaling ship]] captain and friend of Stefansson's who sometimes brought the Arctic explorer replenishments of supplies from the American Museum of Natural History.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AE_P_XngIi0C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22george+leavitt%22+narwhal&source=bl&ots=RulYvQQUSn&sig=VkQqCn5gK9RK6Rb4yRswvfvBCqA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result ''My Life with the Eskimo''], Vilhjalmur Stefansson, Reissued by Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-2395-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Christian Klengenberg]] is first credited to have introduced the term \"[[Blond Eskimos|Blonde Eskimo]]\" to Stefansson just before Stefansson's visit to the Inuit inhabiting southwestern [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], Canada, in 1910.

H.}}</ref> [[Adolphus Greely]] in 1912 first compiled the sightings recorded in earlier literature of blonde or fair haired Arctic natives and in 1912 published them in the ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' entitled \"The Origin of Stefansson's Blonde Eskimo\". Newspapers subsequently popularised the term \"Blonde Eskimo\", which caught more readers' attention despite Stefansson's preference for the term Copper Inuit. Stefansson later referenced Greely's work in his writings and the term \"Blonde Eskimo\" became applied to sightings of light haired [[Eskimo]]s from as early as the 17th century.<ref>''My Life with the Eskimo'', 1922, p. 199 (reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Loss of the ''Karluk'' and rescue of survivors==\n{{Further|Voyage of the Karluk}}\nStefansson organized and directed the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916]] to explore the regions west of [[Queen Elizabeth Islands|Parry Archipelago]] for the [[Government of Canada]]. Three ships, the ''[[HMCS Karluk|Karluk]]'', the ''Mary Sachs'', and the ''Alaska'' were employed.\n\nStefansson left the main ship, the ''Karluk'', when it became stuck in the ice in August/September 1913. Stefansson's explanation was that he and five other expedition members left to go hunting to provide fresh meat for the crew. However, William Laird McKinley and others left on the ship suspected that he left deliberately, anticipating that the ship would be carried off by moving ice, as indeed happened. The ship, with Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]] of Newfoundland and 24 other expedition members aboard, drifted westward with the ice and was eventually crushed. It sank on January 11, 1914. Four men made their way to [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]], but died there, possibly from carbon monoxide poisoning, before they could be rescued. Four other men, including [[Alistair Mackay]] who had been part of the Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907\u201309|British Antarctic Expedition]], tried reaching [[Wrangel Island]] on their own but perished. The remaining members of the expedition, under command of Captain Bartlett, made their way to Wrangel Island where three died. Bartlett and his Inuk hunter Kataktovik made their way across sea ice to Siberia to get help. Remaining survivors were picked up by the American fishing [[schooner]] [[King & Winge (fishing schooner)|''King & Winge'']] and the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] [[Revenue cutter|cutter]] {{USRC|Bear}}.<ref>Newell, Gordon R., ed., ''H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest'', at 242, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington, 1966.</ref>\n\nStefansson resumed his explorations by [[sledge]] over the [[Arctic Ocean]], here known as the [[Beaufort Sea]], leaving [[Collinson Point, Alaska|Collinson Point]], [[Alaska]] in April, 1914. A supporting sledge turned back {{convert|75|mi|abbr=on}} offshore, but he and two men continued onward on one sledge, living largely by his rifle on polar game for 96 days until his party reached the ''Mary Sachs'' in the autumn. Stefansson continued exploring until 1918.\n\n==Wrangel Island fiasco==\nIn 1921, he encouraged and planned an expedition for four young men to colonise [[Wrangel Island]] north of [[Siberia]], where the eleven survivors of the 22 men on the ''Karluk'' had lived from March to September 1914. Stefansson had designs for forming an exploration company that would be geared towards individuals interested in touring the Arctic island.\n\nStefansson originally wanted to claim Wrangel Island for the Canadian government. However, due to the dangerous outcome from his initial trip to the island, the government refused to assist with the expedition. He then wanted to claim the land for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] but the British government rejected this claim when it was made by the young men. The raising of the British flag on Wrangel Island, an acknowledged [[Russia]]n territory, caused an international incident.\n\nThe four young men, Frederick Maurer, E. Lorne Knight, and Milton Galle from the US, and Allan Crawford of Canada, were inexperienced and ill-equipped for the trip. All perished on the island or in an attempt to get help from Siberia across the frozen [[Chukchi Sea]]. The only survivors were an Inuk woman, [[Ada Blackjack]], whom the men had hired as a seamstress in [[Nome, Alaska]], and taken with them, and the expedition's cat, Vic. Ada Blackjack had taught herself survival skills and cared for the last man on the island, E. Lorne Knight, until he died of [[scurvy]]. Blackjack was rescued in 1923 after two years on Wrangel Island. Stefansson drew the ire of the public and the families for having sent such ill-equipped young men to Wrangel. His reputation was severely tainted by this disaster and that of the ''Karluk''.\n\n==Discoveries==\nStefansson's discoveries included new land (such as [[Brock Island|Brock]], [[Mackenzie King Island|Mackenzie King]], [[Borden Island|Borden]], [[Meighen Island|Meighen]], and [[Lougheed Island]]s)<ref name=Stefansson>{{cite book\n  | last = Stefansson\n  | first = Vilhjalmur\n  | title = The Friendly Arctic: The Story of Five Years in Polar Regions\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | year = 1922\n  | location = New York\n| url =https://archive.org/details/friendlyarctics01stefgoog}}</ref> and the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. His journeys and successes are among the marvels of [[Arctic exploration]]. He extended the discoveries of [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]. From April 1914 to June 1915 he lived on the [[Drift ice|ice pack]]. Stefansson continued his explorations leaving from [[Herschel Island]] on August 23, 1915.\n\nOn January 30, 1920, ''The Pioche Record'' reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the [[McClintock Arctic expedition|1853 McClintock expedition]] on [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh arctic conditions.{{sfn|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920|p=3}}\n\nIn 1921, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for his explorations of the Arctic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nStefansson remained a well-known explorer for the rest of his life. Late in life, through his affiliation with [[Dartmouth College]] (he was Director of Polar Studies), he became a major figure in the establishment of the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] (CRREL) in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]]. CRREL-supported research, often conducted in winter on the forbidding summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], has been key to developing mat\u00e9riel and doctrine to support alpine conflict.\n\nStefansson joined [[the Explorers Club]] in 1908, four years after its founding. He later served as Club President twice: 1919\u20131922 and 1937\u20131939. In the all-male Club, the Board drew attention under Stefansson's reign when it put forth an amendment to its bylaws that read in 1938, \"A Woman's Roll of Honor shall be instituted to which the Board of Directors may name women of the United States and Canada in recognition of the noteworthy achievements and writings in the field of the Club's interests, primarily exploration.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\">Minutes, Explorer's Club, 4 January 1938.</ref> Perhaps to comfort fellow members, the article added, \"This Woman's Roll of Honor shall be quite outside the Club's organisation but shall correspond in dignity to the Honorary Class of (male) members within it.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\" /> His continued support of women in anthropology is demonstrated in his 1939\u20131941 mentorship of [[Gitel Steed]] as she undertook research on diet and subsistence for his two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', from which she began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Stefansson was one of the regulars at [[Romany Marie]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] [[caf\u00e9]]s.<ref name=\"Biography\">Robert Shulman.

One of the organisations prominent in this campaign was the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan]], or Ambijan, formed in 1934. A tireless proponent of settlement in Birobidzhan, Stefansson appeared at countless Ambijan meetings, dinners, and rallies, and proved an invaluable resource. Ambijan produced a 50-page Year Book at the end of 1936, full of testimonials and letters of support. Among these was one from Stefansson, who was now also listed as a member of Ambijan's Board of Directors and Governors: \"The Birobidjan project seems to me to offer a most statesmanlike contribution to the problem of the rehabilitation of eastern and central European Jewry,\" he wrote.\n\nAmbijan's national conference in New York, November 25\u201326, 1944, pledged to raise $1 million to support refugees in [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and Birobidzhan. Prominent guests and speakers included New York Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]], Senator [[Elbert D. Thomas]] of [[Utah]], and Soviet ambassador [[Andrei Gromyko]]. A public dinner, attended by the delegates and their guests, was hosted by Vilhjalmur and spouse Evelyn Stefansson. Vilhjalmur was selected as one of two vice-presidents of the organisation.\n\nBut with the growing anti-Russian feeling in the country after [[World War II]], \"expos\u00e9s\" of Stefansson began to appear in the press. In August 1951, he was denounced as a [[Communism|Communist]] before a [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security subcommittee]] by [[Louis F. Budenz]], a Communist-turned-Catholic. Perhaps Stefansson himself had by then some second thoughts about Ambijan, for his posthumously published autobiography made no mention of his work on its behalf. Nor, for that matter, did his otherwise very complete obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of August 27, 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Srebrnik | first1 = Henry | year = 1998 | title = The Radical 'Second Life' of Vilhjalmur Stefansson | url = | journal = Arctic | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 58\u201360 | doi=10.14430/arctic1046}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy of an exclusively meat diet==\nStefansson is also a figure of considerable interest in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary circles, especially those with an interest in very [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s. Stefansson documented the fact that the [[Inuit diet]] consisted of about 90% meat and fish; Inuit would often go 6 to 9 months a year eating nothing but meat and fish\u2014what might nowadays be perceived to be a 'zerocarb' / [[no-carbohydrate diet]]. (The diet technically contains a very low amount of carbohydates as the fresh fish that the Inuit ate would have contained a small amount of glycogen.) He found that he and his fellow explorers of European, Negro, and South Sea Islands descent were also perfectly healthy on such a diet. \n\nSome years after his first experience with the Inuit (known as Eskimos in Stefansson's time), Dr. Stefansson returned to the Arctic with a colleague, Dr. Karsten Anderson, to carry out research for the American Museum of Natural History. They were supplied with every necessity including a year's supply of 'civilised' food. This they declined, electing instead to live off the land. In the end, the one-year project stretched to four years, during which time the two men ate only the meat they could kill and the fish they could catch in the Canadian Arctic. Neither of the two men suffered any adverse after-effects from their four-year experiment. It was evident to Stefansson, as it had been to [[William Banting]], that the body could function perfectly well, remain healthy, vigorous and slender if it used a diet in which as much food was eaten as the body required, only carbohydrate was restricted and the total number of calories was ignored.<ref name=\"Groves\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/banting.html|title=WILLIAM BANTING: The Father of the Low-Carbohydrate Diet|last=Groves, PhD|first=Barry|year=2002|publisher=Second Opinions|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was considerable skepticism when Stefansson reported his findings about the viability of an exclusively meat diet, his claims have been borne out in later studies and analyses.<ref>Fediuk, Karen. 2000 [http://members.shaw.ca/karen.fediuk/VitaminCintheInuitdiet.pdf Vitamin C in the Inuit diet: past and present].

Retrieved on: December 8, 2007.</ref> In multiple studies, it was shown that the [[Inuit diet]] was a [[ketogenic diet]].  While the Inuit diet derived a percentage of its calories from the [[glycogen]] found in the [[raw meat]]s, the native Inuit ate a diet of primarily stewed (boiled) fish and meats while occasionally eating raw fish.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Peter Heinbecker | year = 1928 | title = Studies on the Metabolism of Eskimos | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/80/2/461 | format = PDF | journal = J.

For the rest of an entire year, paid observers followed them to ensure dietary compliance.  The book ''The Unseen Power: Public Relations'' states that [[Pendleton Dudley|Pendelton Dudley]], once considered the \"dean of public relations\", convinced the [[American Meat Institute]] to fund this study.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations|last=Cutlip|first=Scott|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0805814655|location=London|pages=101|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe results were published, and Anderson had developed [[glycosuria]] during this time, which is normally associated with untreated diabetes.  But unlike the pathology of diabetes, in this particular study, glucosuria was present in Anderson for 4 days and coincided only with the giving of a 100 gm of glucose for a tolerance test and with the first 3 days of his pneumonia, where he received fluids and a diet rich in carbohydrate. Once that situation resolved, the glucosuria disappeared.<ref name=\"McClellanDuBois1930\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/83/3/747.full.pdf|title=THE EFFECT OF AN EXCLUSIVE MEAT DIET LASTING ONE YEAR ON THE CARBOHYDRATE TOLERANCE OF TWO NORMAL MEN.|last=Tolstoi|first=Edward|date=June 20, 1929|pages=747\u2013752|accessdate=2015-12-16|journal=J.

Stefansson noted that in the North, very lean meat sometimes produced \"digestive disturbances\".  Whereas Stefansson's prior experience was that lean meat would lead to illness after the second or third fatless week, Stefansson developed nausea and diarrhea on the third day at Bellevue.  Stefansson attributes the fast onset of illness due to the usually lean meat that he was served versus the fattier caribou meat he consumed previously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblelife.org/stefansson2.htm|title=Adventures in Diet Part 2 (Harper's Monthly Magazine)|last=Stefansson|first=Vilhjalmur|date=December 1935}}</ref>  After eating fatty meat, he fully recovered in two days.

During the next 2 days he took much less protein and more fat so that he received about 20 percent of his calories from protein and 80 percent from fat. In these two days his intestinal condition became normal without medication. Thereafter the protein calories did not exceed 25 per cent of the total for more than 1 day at a time.\u201d}}</ref>\n\nThere were no deficiency problems; the two men remained perfectly healthy; their bowels remained normal, except that their stools were smaller and did not smell. Stefansson's [[gingivitis]] disappeared by the end of the experiment although there was an increase in the deposit of tartar on his teeth.  During this experiment his intake had varied between 2,000 and 3,100 calories per day and he derived, by choice, an average of almost eighty percent of his energy from animal fat and almost twenty percent from protein.<ref name=\"Groves\" />  Daily intake varied from 100-140 grams of protein, 200-300 grams of fat, and 7-12 grams of carbohydrates.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*{{cite news |ref={{SfnRef|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920}}|date= January 30, 1920|title= 50 Year Old Cache Found|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86091349/1920-01-30/ed-1/seq-3/|newspaper=The Pioche Record|publisher=L.H.

Bush was seen as the early favorite for the Republican nomination and, despite a contentious primary battle with Senator [[John McCain]] and others, secured the nomination by [[Super Tuesday]]. Bush chose former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] as his running mate, while Gore chose Senator [[Joe Lieberman]]. The left-wing [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] nominated political activists [[Ralph Nader]] and [[Winona LaDuke]].\n\nBoth major-party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal [[social insurance]] programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Due to President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal|sex scandal]] with [[Monica Lewinsky]] and subsequent [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]], Gore avoided campaigning with Clinton. Republicans denounced Clinton's indiscretions, while Gore criticized Bush's lack of experience. On election night, it was unclear who had won, with the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] of the state of [[Florida]] still undecided. The returns showed that Bush had won Florida by such a close margin that state law required a [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|recount]]. A month-long series of legal battles led to the highly controversial 5\u20134 [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', which ended the recount.\n\nWith the end of the recount, Bush won Florida by a margin of 0.009%, or 537 votes. The Florida recount and subsequent litigation resulted in major post-election controversy, and various people and organizations have speculated about who would have won the election in various scenarios.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The American Statistician|date=February 2003|volume=57|number=1|pages=1\u201314|publisher=American Statistical Association|doi=10.1198/0003130031144|title=Statistical Practice: Reliability of the Uncertified Ballots in the 2000 Presidential Election in Florida|first1=Kirk|last1=Wolter|first2=Diana|last2=Jergovic|first3=Whitney|last3=Moore|first4=Joe|last4=Murphy|first5=Colm|last5=O'Muircheartaigh|url=http://www.amstat.org/misc/PresidentialElectionBallots.pdf|jstor=3087271|accessdate=June 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318154912/http://www.amstat.org/misc/PresidentialElectionBallots.pdf|archive-date=March 18, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"battle\"/> Ultimately, Bush won 271 electoral votes, one more than a majority, despite Gore receiving 543,895 more votes (a margin of 0.51% of all votes cast).<ref name=el2000>{{cite web|title=Federal Elections 2000: 2000 Presidential Electoral and Popular Vote Table|url=https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/elecpop.htm|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|accessdate=March 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709174557/https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/elecpop.htm|archive-date=July 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Bush flipped 11 states that went Democratic in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] election: [[2000 United States presidential election in Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Arizona|Arizona]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Kentucky|Kentucky]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Louisiana|Louisiana]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Missouri|Missouri]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Nevada|Nevada]], [[2000 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Ohio|Ohio]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[2000 United States presidential election in West Virginia|West Virginia]].

His second term expired at noon on January 20, 2001.]]\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] provides that the President and Vice President of the United States must be [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizens]] of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for a period of at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties, in which case each party devises a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Traditionally, the primary elections are [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president.\n\nPresident [[Bill Clinton]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and former [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] of [[Arkansas]], was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]]; in accordance with Section{{nbsp}}1 of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], his term expired at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|eastern standard time]] on January 20, 2001.\n\n==Republican Party nomination==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}\n{{Main|2000 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Republicanlogo.svg|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''2000 Republican Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[George W.

Former cabinet member [[George Shultz]] played an important early role in securing establishment Republican support for Bush. In April 1998, he invited Bush to discuss policy issues with experts including [[Michael Boskin]], [[John B. Taylor|John Taylor]], and [[Condoleezza Rice]]. The group, which was \"looking for a candidate for 2000 with good political instincts, someone they could work with\", was impressed, and Shultz encouraged him to enter the race.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Frontline|serieslink=Frontline (U.S. TV series)|network=PBS|station=[[WGBH-TV]] |location=Boston|airdate=October 12, 2004|transcript=The Choice|transcripturl= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/choice2004/etc/script.html }}</ref>\n\nSeveral aspirants withdrew before the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2000|Iowa Caucus]] because they did not secure funding and endorsements sufficient to remain competitive with Bush. These included [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[Dan Quayle]], [[Lamar Alexander]], and [[Bob Smith (New Hampshire politician)|Bob Smith]]. [[Pat Buchanan]] dropped out to run for the Reform Party nomination. That left Bush, [[John McCain]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Steve Forbes]], [[Gary Bauer]], and [[Orrin Hatch]] as the only candidates still in the race.\n\nOn January 24, Bush won the Iowa caucus with 41% of the vote. Forbes came in second with 30% of the vote. Keyes received 14%, Bauer 9%, McCain 5%, and Hatch 1%. Hatch dropped out. The national media portrayed Bush as the establishment candidate. McCain, with the support of many moderate Republicans and Independents, portrayed himself as a crusading insurgent who focused on [[Electoral reform|campaign reform]].\n\nOn February 1, McCain won a 49\u201330% victory over Bush in the [[New Hampshire Presidential primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Bauer dropped out. After coming in third in Delaware, Forbes dropped out, leaving three candidates. In the [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2000|South Carolina primary]], Bush soundly defeated McCain.

On February 28, McCain also referred to [[Jerry Falwell]] and televangelist [[Pat Robertson]] as \"agents of intolerance\", a term he distanced himself from during his [[John McCain 2008 presidential campaign|2008 bid]]. He lost Virginia to Bush on February 29. On [[Super Tuesday]], March 7, Bush won New York, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri, California, Maryland, and Maine. McCain won Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, but dropped out of the race. McCain became the Republican presidential nominee [[2008 United States presidential election|8 years later]], but lost the general election to [[Barack Obama]]. On March 10, Keyes got 21% of the vote in Utah. Bush took the majority of the remaining contests and won the Republican nomination on March 14, winning his home state of Texas and his brother [[Jeb Bush|Jeb's]] home state of Florida, among others. At the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Bush accepted the nomination.\n\nBush asked former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] to head up a team to help select a running mate for him, but ultimately chose Cheney himself as the vice presidential nominee. While the U.S. Constitution does not specifically disallow a president and a vice president from the same state, it does prohibit electors from casting both of his or her votes for persons from his or her own state. Accordingly, Cheney\u2014who had been a resident of [[Texas]] for nearly 10 years\u2014changed his voting registration back to Wyoming. Had Cheney not done this, either he or Bush would have forfeited his electoral votes from Texas.\n\n;Delegate totals\n*Governor George W.

While former basketball star [[Michael Jordan]] campaigned for him in the early primary states, Bradley announced his intention to campaign \"in a different way\" by conducting a positive campaign of \"big ideas\". His campaign's focus was a plan to spend the record-breaking budget surplus on a variety of social welfare programs to help the poor and the middle class, along with campaign finance reform and [[gun control]].\n\nGore easily defeated Bradley in the primaries, largely because of support from the Democratic Party establishment and Bradley's poor showing in the Iowa caucus, where Gore successfully painted Bradley as aloof and indifferent to the plight of farmers. The closest Bradley came to a victory was his 50\u201346 loss to Gore in the New Hampshire primary.

Gore balanced Bush by sweeping the [[Northeastern United States]] (with the exception of [[New Hampshire]], which Bush won narrowly), the Pacific Coast states, [[Hawaii]], [[New Mexico]], and most of the [[Upper Midwest]].\n\nAs the night wore on, the returns in a handful of small-to-medium-sized states, including [[Wisconsin]], [[Iowa]], Oregon and New Mexico (Gore by 355 votes) were extremely close, but the election came down to Florida.

Two smaller states\u2014[[Wisconsin]] (11 electoral votes) and Oregon (7)\u2014were still too close to call, but Florida's 25 electoral votes would be decisive regardless of their results.

They based this prediction substantially on [[exit poll]]s. But in the actual vote tally Bush began to take a wide lead early in Florida, and by 10 p.m. EST the networks had retracted their predictions and placed Florida back in the \"undecided\" column. At approximately 2:30&nbsp;a.m., with 85% of the vote counted in Florida and Bush leading Gore by more than 100,000 votes, the networks declared that Bush had carried Florida and therefore been elected president. But most of the remaining votes to be counted in Florida were in three heavily Democratic counties\u2014[[Broward County, Florida|Broward]], [[Miami-Dade County|Miami-Dade]], and [[Palm Beach County|Palm Beach]]\u2014and as their votes were reported Gore began to gain on Bush. By 4:30&nbsp;a.m., after all votes were counted, Gore had narrowed Bush's margin to under 2,000 votes, and the networks retracted their declarations that Bush had won Florida and the presidency. Gore, who had privately conceded the election to Bush, withdrew his concession. The final result in Florida was slim enough to require a mandatory recount (by machine) under state law; Bush's lead dwindled to just over 300 votes when it was completed the day after the election. On November 8, Florida Division of Elections staff prepared a press release for [[Florida Secretary of State]] [[Katherine Harris]] that said overseas ballots must be \"postmarked or signed and dated\" by Election Day. It was never released.<ref name=\"battle\"/>{{rp|16}} A count of the overseas ballots later boosted Bush's margin to 930 votes. (According to a report by ''The New York Times'', 680 of the accepted overseas ballots were received after the legal deadline, lacked required postmarks or a witness signature or address, or were unsigned or undated, cast after election day, from unregistered voters or voters not requesting ballots, or double-counted.<ref name=\"NYT07152001\">{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html|title=Examining the Vote; How Bush Took Florida: Mining the Overseas Absentee Vote|first1=David|last1=Barstow|first2=Don, Jr.|last2=Van Natta|date=July 15, 2001|accessdate=November 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115173828/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html|archive-date=November 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>)\n[[File:1116c6 (5124003635).jpg|thumb|right|Florida Supreme Court during the recount]]\nMost of the post-electoral controversy revolved around Gore's request for hand recounts in four counties (Broward, Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia]]), as provided under Florida state law. Harris, who also co-chaired Bush's Florida campaign, announced she would reject any revised totals from those counties if they were not turned in by 5&nbsp;p.m. on November 14, the statutory deadline for amended returns. The [[Florida Supreme Court]] extended the deadline to November 26, a decision later [[vacated]] by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. Miami-Dade eventually halted its recount and resubmitted its original total to the state canvassing board, while Palm Beach County failed to meet the extended deadline, turning in its completed recount results at 7&nbsp;p.m., which Harris rejected. On November 26, the state canvassing board certified Bush as the winner of Florida's electors by 537 votes. Gore formally contested the certified results. A state court decision overruling Gore was reversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered a recount of over 70,000 ballots previously rejected as undervotes by machine counters. The U.S. Supreme Court halted that order the next day, with Justice Scalia issuing a concurring opinion that \"the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner\" (Bush).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://election2000.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/00-949x.pdf\n|title=SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.

The 2000 election was also the last time a Republican won a number of populous urban counties that have since turned into Democratic strongholds. These include [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina]] (Charlotte); [[Marion County, Indiana]] (Indianapolis), [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] (DC suburbs), and [[Travis County, Texas]] (Austin). In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], the most recent presidential election, Republican [[Donald Trump]] lost Mecklenburg by 30%, Marion by 23%, Fairfax by 36%, and Travis by 38%. Conversely, as of 2017 Gore is the last Democrat to have won any counties at all in Oklahoma.<ref name=\"NewsOK\">{{cite web|last1=Casteel|first1=Chris|title=Oklahoma's 28th presidential election will be first with GOP voters in majority|url=http://newsok.com/article/5525574|website=NewsOK|accessdate=March 18, 2017|date=November 6, 2016}}</ref>\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[George W.

Many of Florida's year 2000 election night problems stemmed from [[usability]] and ballot design factors with voting systems, including the potentially confusing \"[[butterfly ballot]]\". Many voters had difficulties with the paper-based [[voting machine#Punch card|punch card]] voting machines and were either unable to understand the required process for voting or unable to perform the process. This resulted in an unusual amount of [[overvote]] (voting for more candidates than is allowed) and [[undervote]]s (voting for fewer than the minimum candidates, including none at all). Many undervotes were caused by voter error, unmaintained punch card voting booths, or errors having to do merely with the characteristics of punch card ballots (resulting in hanging, dimpled, or pregnant [[Chad (paper)|chads]]).\n\nA proposed solution to these problems was the installation of modern [[electronic voting]] machines. The United States presidential election of 2000 spurred the debate about election and voting reform, but it did not end it.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA) was passed to help states upgrade their election technology in the hopes of preventing similar problems in future elections. Unfortunately, the electronic voting systems that many states purchased to comply with HAVA actually caused problems in the presidential election of 2004.<ref>Freeman, Steven & Bleifuss, Joel. Was the 2004 election stolen?: exit polls, election fraud, and the official count. Seven Stories Press, 2006, p. 68-83.</ref>\n\n===Exit polling and declaration of vote winners===\nThe [[Voter News Service]]'s reputation was damaged by its treatment of Florida's presidential vote in 2000. Breaking its own guidelines,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} VNS called the state as a win for Gore 12 minutes before polls closed in the [[Florida Panhandle|Florida panhandle]]. Although most of the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, counties in the Florida panhandle, located in the Central Time Zone, had not yet closed their polls. Discrepancies between the results of exit polls and the actual vote count caused the VNS to change its call twice, first from Gore to Bush and then to \"too close to call\". Due in part to this (and other polling inaccuracies){{citation needed|date=February 2017}} the VNS was disbanded in 2003.\n\nAccording to Bush adviser [[Karl Rove]], exit polls early in the afternoon on election day showed Gore winning by three percentage points, but when the networks called the state for Gore, Bush led by about 75,000 votes in raw tallies from the [[Florida Secretary of State]].\n\nAlso, charges of media bias were leveled against the networks by Republicans. They claimed that the networks called states more quickly for Al Gore than for George W. Bush. Congress held hearings on this matter,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and the networks claimed to have no intentional bias in their election night reporting. However, a study of the calls made on election night 2000 indicated that states carried by Gore were called more quickly than states won by Bush{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}; however, notable Bush states, like New Hampshire and Florida, were very close, and close Gore states like Iowa, Oregon, New Mexico and Wisconsin were called late as well.<ref>[[Joseph Uscinski]]. 2007. \"Too Close Too Call? Uncertainty and Bias in Election Night Reporting\" Social Science Quarterly vol. 88,(1).</ref>\n\nThe early call of Florida for Gore has been alleged to have cost Bush several close states, including Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wisconsin.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} In each of these states, Gore won by less than 10,000 votes, and the polls closed after the networks called Florida for Gore. Because the Florida call was widely seen as an indicator that Gore had won the election, it is possible that it depressed Republican turnout in these states during the final hours of voting, giving Gore the slim margin by which he carried each of them.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Had Bush carried all four of these states, he would have won the electoral vote, even with a loss in Florida. Likewise, the call may have affected the outcome of the [[United States Senate election in Washington, 2000|Senate election in Washington state]], where incumbent Republican [[Slade Gorton]] was defeated by approximately 2,000 votes statewide.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Ralph Nader spoiler controversy===\n{{Further|Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000#The \"spoiler\" controversy}}\nMany Gore supporters claimed that third-party candidate Nader acted as a [[spoiler effect|spoiler]] in the election since Nader votes could have been cast for Gore, and for instance, Nader allegedly threw the election outcome to Bush.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/tweedledee-indeed/|title=Tweedledee, Indeed|journal=The Nation|first=Eric|last=Alterman|date=March 22, 2001|access-date=December 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210111434/https://www.thenation.com/article/tweedledee-indeed/|archive-date=February 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Nader received 2.74 percent of the popular vote nationwide, getting 97,000 votes in Florida (by comparison, there were 111,251 [[overvotes]])<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2001-05-10-overvotetable.htm |work=USA Today |title=Overvote county summary |date=May 10, 2001 |access-date=September 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154726/http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2001-05-10-overvotetable.htm |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Herron |first1= Michael C. |last2= Lewis |first2= Jeffrey B. |title= Did Ralph Nader spoil Al Gore's Presidential bid?

Wrote Hightower:<blockquote>Even when Gore went skittering across the country in August on a widely ballyhooed \"Working Families Tour\", he had the Clinton administration's favorite Wall Streeter, [[Robert Rubin]], by his side, sending a stage wink to the corporate powers, assuring them that all his [Gore's] quasi-populist posturing was only rhetoric \u2013 not to worry, Rubin still has a grip on policy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2000/11/28/hightower/ |title=How Florida Democrats torpedoed Gore - Salon.com |access-date=November 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111183522/https://www.salon.com/2000/11/28/hightower/ |archive-date=November 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Press influence on race===\nIn their 2007 book ''The Nightly News Nightmare: Network Television's Coverage of US Presidential Elections, 1988\u20132004'', professors Stephen J.

''[[The New York Times]]'' used these colors on their full-color election maps. Senior graphics editor Archie Tse, decided that as Republican started with an ''R'' then red \"was a more natural association\". Prior to that color coding choices were inconsistent across the media. In 1976, in its first election map on air, NBC used bulbs that turned red for Carter-won states (Democratic), and blue for Ford (Republican). This original color scheme was based on the British political system, where blue is used to denote the centre-right Conservative Party and red for the centre-left Labour Party (gold or yellow is used for the 'third party' Liberal Democrats). However the NBC format did not catch on long term, the media did not follow suit. The unusually long 2000 election helped to cement red and blue as colors in the collective mind.<ref name=\"Verge 2012\">{{cite web |last1=Streams |first1=Kimber |title=Why are Republicans red and Democrats blue? |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/6/3609534/republicans-red-democrats-blue-why-election |website=The Verge |accessdate=11 August 2018 |date=November 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811195016/https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/6/3609534/republicans-red-democrats-blue-why-election |archive-date=August 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Effects on future elections and Supreme Court===\nA number of subsequent articles have characterized the election in 2000, and the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v Gore, as damaging the reputation of the Supreme Court, increasing the view of judges as partisan, and decreasing Americans' trust in the integrity of elections.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/ct-xpm-2012-07-02-ct-oped-0702-krauthammer-20120702-17-story.html | title=Why Roberts did it | access-date=July 4, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703052113/https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/ct-xpm-2012-07-02-ct-oped-0702-krauthammer-20120702-17-story.html | archive-date=July 3, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=4557&context=ylj</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&context=facpub |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531023521/https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&context=facpub |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=https://theweek.com/articles/488658/legacy-bush-v-gore| title=The legacy of Bush v.

The left-wing [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] nominated political activists [[Ralph Nader]] and [[Winona LaDuke]].\n\nBoth major-party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal [[social insurance]] programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Due to President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal|sex scandal]] with [[Monica Lewinsky]] and subsequent [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]], Gore avoided campaigning with Clinton. Republicans denounced Clinton's indiscretions, while Gore criticized Bush's lack of experience. On election night, it was unclear who had won, with the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] of the state of [[Florida]] still undecided. The returns showed that Bush had won Florida by such a close margin that state law required a [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|recount]]. A month-long series of legal battles led to the highly controversial 5\u20134 [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', which ended the recount.\n\nWith the end of the recount, Bush won Florida by a margin of 0.009%, or 537 votes. The Florida recount and subsequent litigation resulted in major post-election controversy, and various people and organizations have speculated about who would have won the election in various scenarios.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The American Statistician|date=February 2003|volume=57|number=1|pages=1\u201314|publisher=American Statistical Association|doi=10.1198/0003130031144|title=Statistical Practice: Reliability of the Uncertified Ballots in the 2000 Presidential Election in Florida|first1=Kirk|last1=Wolter|first2=Diana|last2=Jergovic|first3=Whitney|last3=Moore|first4=Joe|last4=Murphy|first5=Colm|last5=O'Muircheartaigh|url=http://www.amstat.org/misc/PresidentialElectionBallots.pdf|jstor=3087271|accessdate=June 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318154912/http://www.amstat.org/misc/PresidentialElectionBallots.pdf|archive-date=March 18, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"battle\"/> Ultimately, Bush won 271 electoral votes, one more than a majority, despite Gore receiving 543,895 more votes (a margin of 0.51% of all votes cast).<ref name=el2000>{{cite web|title=Federal Elections 2000: 2000 Presidential Electoral and Popular Vote Table|url=https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/elecpop.htm|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|accessdate=March 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709174557/https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/elecpop.htm|archive-date=July 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Bush flipped 11 states that went Democratic in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] election: [[2000 United States presidential election in Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Arizona|Arizona]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Kentucky|Kentucky]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Louisiana|Louisiana]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Missouri|Missouri]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Nevada|Nevada]], [[2000 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Ohio|Ohio]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[2000 United States presidential election in West Virginia|West Virginia]].

His second term expired at noon on January 20, 2001.]]\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] provides that the President and Vice President of the United States must be [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizens]] of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for a period of at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties, in which case each party devises a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Traditionally, the primary elections are [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president.\n\nPresident [[Bill Clinton]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and former [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] of [[Arkansas]], was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]]; in accordance with Section{{nbsp}}1 of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], his term expired at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|eastern standard time]] on January 20, 2001.\n\n==Republican Party nomination==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}\n{{Main|2000 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Republicanlogo.svg|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''2000 Republican Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[George W.

Former cabinet member [[George Shultz]] played an important early role in securing establishment Republican support for Bush. In April 1998, he invited Bush to discuss policy issues with experts including [[Michael Boskin]], [[John B. Taylor|John Taylor]], and [[Condoleezza Rice]]. The group, which was \"looking for a candidate for 2000 with good political instincts, someone they could work with\", was impressed, and Shultz encouraged him to enter the race.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Frontline|serieslink=Frontline (U.S. TV series)|network=PBS|station=[[WGBH-TV]] |location=Boston|airdate=October 12, 2004|transcript=The Choice|transcripturl= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/choice2004/etc/script.html }}</ref>\n\nSeveral aspirants withdrew before the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2000|Iowa Caucus]] because they did not secure funding and endorsements sufficient to remain competitive with Bush. These included [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[Dan Quayle]], [[Lamar Alexander]], and [[Bob Smith (New Hampshire politician)|Bob Smith]]. [[Pat Buchanan]] dropped out to run for the Reform Party nomination. That left Bush, [[John McCain]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Steve Forbes]], [[Gary Bauer]], and [[Orrin Hatch]] as the only candidates still in the race.\n\nOn January 24, Bush won the Iowa caucus with 41% of the vote. Forbes came in second with 30% of the vote. Keyes received 14%, Bauer 9%, McCain 5%, and Hatch 1%. Hatch dropped out. The national media portrayed Bush as the establishment candidate. McCain, with the support of many moderate Republicans and Independents, portrayed himself as a crusading insurgent who focused on [[Electoral reform|campaign reform]].\n\nOn February 1, McCain won a 49\u201330% victory over Bush in the [[New Hampshire Presidential primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Bauer dropped out. After coming in third in Delaware, Forbes dropped out, leaving three candidates. In the [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2000|South Carolina primary]], Bush soundly defeated McCain.

On February 28, McCain also referred to [[Jerry Falwell]] and televangelist [[Pat Robertson]] as \"agents of intolerance\", a term he distanced himself from during his [[John McCain 2008 presidential campaign|2008 bid]]. He lost Virginia to Bush on February 29. On [[Super Tuesday]], March 7, Bush won New York, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri, California, Maryland, and Maine. McCain won Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, but dropped out of the race. McCain became the Republican presidential nominee [[2008 United States presidential election|8 years later]], but lost the general election to [[Barack Obama]]. On March 10, Keyes got 21% of the vote in Utah. Bush took the majority of the remaining contests and won the Republican nomination on March 14, winning his home state of Texas and his brother [[Jeb Bush|Jeb's]] home state of Florida, among others. At the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Bush accepted the nomination.\n\nBush asked former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] to head up a team to help select a running mate for him, but ultimately chose Cheney himself as the vice presidential nominee. While the U.S. Constitution does not specifically disallow a president and a vice president from the same state, it does prohibit electors from casting both of his or her votes for persons from his or her own state. Accordingly, Cheney\u2014who had been a resident of [[Texas]] for nearly 10 years\u2014changed his voting registration back to Wyoming. Had Cheney not done this, either he or Bush would have forfeited his electoral votes from Texas.\n\n;Delegate totals\n*Governor George W.

While former basketball star [[Michael Jordan]] campaigned for him in the early primary states, Bradley announced his intention to campaign \"in a different way\" by conducting a positive campaign of \"big ideas\". His campaign's focus was a plan to spend the record-breaking budget surplus on a variety of social welfare programs to help the poor and the middle class, along with campaign finance reform and [[gun control]].\n\nGore easily defeated Bradley in the primaries, largely because of support from the Democratic Party establishment and Bradley's poor showing in the Iowa caucus, where Gore successfully painted Bradley as aloof and indifferent to the plight of farmers.

They based this prediction substantially on [[exit poll]]s. But in the actual vote tally Bush began to take a wide lead early in Florida, and by 10 p.m. EST the networks had retracted their predictions and placed Florida back in the \"undecided\" column. At approximately 2:30&nbsp;a.m., with 85% of the vote counted in Florida and Bush leading Gore by more than 100,000 votes, the networks declared that Bush had carried Florida and therefore been elected president. But most of the remaining votes to be counted in Florida were in three heavily Democratic counties\u2014[[Broward County, Florida|Broward]], [[Miami-Dade County|Miami-Dade]], and [[Palm Beach County|Palm Beach]]\u2014and as their votes were reported Gore began to gain on Bush. By 4:30&nbsp;a.m., after all votes were counted, Gore had narrowed Bush's margin to under 2,000 votes, and the networks retracted their declarations that Bush had won Florida and the presidency. Gore, who had privately conceded the election to Bush, withdrew his concession. The final result in Florida was slim enough to require a mandatory recount (by machine) under state law; Bush's lead dwindled to just over 300 votes when it was completed the day after the election. On November 8, Florida Division of Elections staff prepared a press release for [[Florida Secretary of State]] [[Katherine Harris]] that said overseas ballots must be \"postmarked or signed and dated\" by Election Day. It was never released.<ref name=\"battle\"/>{{rp|16}} A count of the overseas ballots later boosted Bush's margin to 930 votes. (According to a report by ''The New York Times'', 680 of the accepted overseas ballots were received after the legal deadline, lacked required postmarks or a witness signature or address, or were unsigned or undated, cast after election day, from unregistered voters or voters not requesting ballots, or double-counted.<ref name=\"NYT07152001\">{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html|title=Examining the Vote; How Bush Took Florida: Mining the Overseas Absentee Vote|first1=David|last1=Barstow|first2=Don, Jr.|last2=Van Natta|date=July 15, 2001|accessdate=November 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115173828/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html|archive-date=November 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>)\n[[File:1116c6 (5124003635).jpg|thumb|right|Florida Supreme Court during the recount]]\nMost of the post-electoral controversy revolved around Gore's request for hand recounts in four counties (Broward, Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia]]), as provided under Florida state law. Harris, who also co-chaired Bush's Florida campaign, announced she would reject any revised totals from those counties if they were not turned in by 5&nbsp;p.m. on November 14, the statutory deadline for amended returns. The [[Florida Supreme Court]] extended the deadline to November 26, a decision later [[vacated]] by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. Miami-Dade eventually halted its recount and resubmitted its original total to the state canvassing board, while Palm Beach County failed to meet the extended deadline, turning in its completed recount results at 7&nbsp;p.m., which Harris rejected. On November 26, the state canvassing board certified Bush as the winner of Florida's electors by 537 votes. Gore formally contested the certified results. A state court decision overruling Gore was reversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered a recount of over 70,000 ballots previously rejected as undervotes by machine counters. The U.S. Supreme Court halted that order the next day, with Justice Scalia issuing a concurring opinion that \"the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner\" (Bush).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://election2000.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/00-949x.pdf\n|title=SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.

Gore|ruled]] in a per curiam decision (asserted as a 7\u20132 vote) that the Florida Supreme Court's ruling requiring a statewide recount of ballots was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds, and in a 5\u20134 vote reversed and remanded the case to the Florida Supreme Court for modification prior to the optional \"safe harbor\" deadline, which the Supreme Court argued that Florida court had said the state intended to meet. With only two hours remaining until the December 12 deadline, the Supreme Court's order effectively ended the recount, and the previously certified total held.\n\nEven if the Supreme Court had decided differently in ''Bush v.

Gore's 266 electoral votes is the highest for a losing nominee.\n\nBush was the first Republican in American history to win the presidency without winning Vermont or Illinois, the second Republican to win the presidency without winning California ([[James A. Garfield]] in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]] was the first) or Pennsylvania ([[Richard Nixon]] in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] was the first), and the first winning Republican not to receive any electoral votes from California (Garfield received one vote in 1880). Bush also lost in Connecticut, the state of his birth. As of 2016, Bush is the last Republican nominee to win New Hampshire.\n\nThis marked the first time since Iowa entered the union in 1846 in which the state voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in four elections in a row (1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000), and the last time Iowa did not vote for the overall winner. There were two counties in the nation that had voted Republican in [[United States Presidential Election, 1996|1996]] and voted Democratic in 2000: [[Charles County, Maryland]] and [[Orange County, Florida]], both rapidly diversifying counties. The 2000 election was also the last time a Republican won a number of populous urban counties that have since turned into Democratic strongholds. These include [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina]] (Charlotte); [[Marion County, Indiana]] (Indianapolis), [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] (DC suburbs), and [[Travis County, Texas]] (Austin). In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], the most recent presidential election, Republican [[Donald Trump]] lost Mecklenburg by 30%, Marion by 23%, Fairfax by 36%, and Travis by 38%.

Their goal was to determine the reliability and accuracy of the systems used for the voting process. Based on the NORC review, the media group concluded that if the disputes over all the ballots in question had been resolved by applying statewide any of five standards that would have met Florida's legal standard for recounts, the electoral result would have been reversed and Gore would have won by 60 to 171 votes.

In their 2002 ''American Sociological Review'' article, Uggen and Manza found that the released felon vote could have altered the outcome of seven senatorial races between 1978 and 2000, and the 2000 presidential election.<ref>{{cite web|title= Florida's ex-convicts seek right to vote|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-07-20/news/0407200186_1_felons-civil-rights-re-elect|website= tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date= February 23, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304181347/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-07-20/news/0407200186_1_felons-civil-rights-re-elect|archive-date= March 4, 2016|url-status= live}}</ref> Matt Ford noted their study concluded \"if the state's 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted at the same rate as other Floridians, Democratic candidate Al Gore would have won Florida\u2014and the presidency \u2014 by more than 80,000 votes.\"<ref name=\"restore\">[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/maryland-felon-voting/462000/ Matt Ford, \"Restoring Voting Rights for Felons in Maryland\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421090255/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/maryland-felon-voting/462000/ |date=April 21, 2017 }}, ''The Atlantic,'' February 9, 2016, accessed March 23, 2016</ref> The effect of Florida's law is such that in 2014, purportedly \"[m]ore than one in ten Floridians \u2013 and nearly one in four African-American Floridians \u2013 are shut out of the polls because of felony convictions.\"<ref>Brent Staples, \"Florida Leads the Pack \u2013 in Felon Disenfranchisement\", ''New York Times'', November 7, 2014, accessed March 23, 2016</ref>\n\n===Voting machines===\nBecause the 2000 presidential election was so close in Florida, the United States government and state governments pushed for [[election reform]] to be prepared by the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]]. Many of Florida's year 2000 election night problems stemmed from [[usability]] and ballot design factors with voting systems, including the potentially confusing \"[[butterfly ballot]]\". Many voters had difficulties with the paper-based [[voting machine#Punch card|punch card]] voting machines and were either unable to understand the required process for voting or unable to perform the process. This resulted in an unusual amount of [[overvote]] (voting for more candidates than is allowed) and [[undervote]]s (voting for fewer than the minimum candidates, including none at all). Many undervotes were caused by voter error, unmaintained punch card voting booths, or errors having to do merely with the characteristics of punch card ballots (resulting in hanging, dimpled, or pregnant [[Chad (paper)|chads]]).\n\nA proposed solution to these problems was the installation of modern [[electronic voting]] machines. The United States presidential election of 2000 spurred the debate about election and voting reform, but it did not end it.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA) was passed to help states upgrade their election technology in the hopes of preventing similar problems in future elections. Unfortunately, the electronic voting systems that many states purchased to comply with HAVA actually caused problems in the presidential election of 2004.<ref>Freeman, Steven & Bleifuss, Joel. Was the 2004 election stolen?: exit polls, election fraud, and the official count. Seven Stories Press, 2006, p. 68-83.</ref>\n\n===Exit polling and declaration of vote winners===\nThe [[Voter News Service]]'s reputation was damaged by its treatment of Florida's presidential vote in 2000. Breaking its own guidelines,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} VNS called the state as a win for Gore 12 minutes before polls closed in the [[Florida Panhandle|Florida panhandle]]. Although most of the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, counties in the Florida panhandle, located in the Central Time Zone, had not yet closed their polls. Discrepancies between the results of exit polls and the actual vote count caused the VNS to change its call twice, first from Gore to Bush and then to \"too close to call\". Due in part to this (and other polling inaccuracies){{citation needed|date=February 2017}} the VNS was disbanded in 2003.\n\nAccording to Bush adviser [[Karl Rove]], exit polls early in the afternoon on election day showed Gore winning by three percentage points, but when the networks called the state for Gore, Bush led by about 75,000 votes in raw tallies from the [[Florida Secretary of State]].\n\nAlso, charges of media bias were leveled against the networks by Republicans. They claimed that the networks called states more quickly for Al Gore than for George W. Bush. Congress held hearings on this matter,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and the networks claimed to have no intentional bias in their election night reporting. However, a study of the calls made on election night 2000 indicated that states carried by Gore were called more quickly than states won by Bush{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}; however, notable Bush states, like New Hampshire and Florida, were very close, and close Gore states like Iowa, Oregon, New Mexico and Wisconsin were called late as well.<ref>[[Joseph Uscinski]]. 2007. \"Too Close Too Call? Uncertainty and Bias in Election Night Reporting\" Social Science Quarterly vol. 88,(1).</ref>\n\nThe early call of Florida for Gore has been alleged to have cost Bush several close states, including Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wisconsin.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} In each of these states, Gore won by less than 10,000 votes, and the polls closed after the networks called Florida for Gore. Because the Florida call was widely seen as an indicator that Gore had won the election, it is possible that it depressed Republican turnout in these states during the final hours of voting, giving Gore the slim margin by which he carried each of them.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Had Bush carried all four of these states, he would have won the electoral vote, even with a loss in Florida. Likewise, the call may have affected the outcome of the [[United States Senate election in Washington, 2000|Senate election in Washington state]], where incumbent Republican [[Slade Gorton]] was defeated by approximately 2,000 votes statewide.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Ralph Nader spoiler controversy===\n{{Further|Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000#The \"spoiler\" controversy}}\nMany Gore supporters claimed that third-party candidate Nader acted as a [[spoiler effect|spoiler]] in the election since Nader votes could have been cast for Gore, and for instance, Nader allegedly threw the election outcome to Bush.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/tweedledee-indeed/|title=Tweedledee, Indeed|journal=The Nation|first=Eric|last=Alterman|date=March 22, 2001|access-date=December 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210111434/https://www.thenation.com/article/tweedledee-indeed/|archive-date=February 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Nader received 2.74 percent of the popular vote nationwide, getting 97,000 votes in Florida (by comparison, there were 111,251 [[overvotes]])<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2001-05-10-overvotetable.htm |work=USA Today |title=Overvote county summary |date=May 10, 2001 |access-date=September 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154726/http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2001-05-10-overvotetable.htm |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Herron |first1= Michael C. |last2= Lewis |first2= Jeffrey B. |title= Did Ralph Nader spoil Al Gore's Presidential bid?

Winning either state would have won the general election for Gore. Defenders of Nader, including [[Tom Tomorrow|Dan Perkins]], argued that the margin in Florida was small enough that Democrats could blame any number of third-party candidates for the defeat, including [[Workers World Party]] candidate [[Monica Moorehead]], who received 1,500 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/comics/tomo/2000/11/13/tomo/index.html|title=This Modern World|work=Salon.com Comics|access-date=May 23, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315015827/http://archive.salon.com/comics/tomo/2000/11/13/tomo/index.html|archive-date=March 15, 2006|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> But the controversy with Nader also drained energy from the Democratic party as divisive debate went on in the months leading up to the election.\n\nNader's reputation was hurt by this perception, which may have hindered his goals as an activist. For example, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' wrote about the so-called \"rank-and-file liberals\" who saw Nader negatively after the election and pointed out that [[Public Citizen]], the organization Nader founded in 1971, had a new fundraising problem in its own founder, citing a drop in contributions. ''Mother Jones'' also cited a Public Citizen's letter sent out to people interested in Nader's relation with the organization at that time, with the disclaimer: \"Although Ralph Nader was our founder, he has not held an official position in the organization since 1980 and does not serve on the board.

According to Hightower, 191,000 self-described liberals in Florida voted for Bush, while fewer than 34,000 voted for Nader. Wrote Hightower:<blockquote>Even when Gore went skittering across the country in August on a widely ballyhooed \"Working Families Tour\", he had the Clinton administration's favorite Wall Streeter, [[Robert Rubin]], by his side, sending a stage wink to the corporate powers, assuring them that all his [Gore's] quasi-populist posturing was only rhetoric \u2013 not to worry, Rubin still has a grip on policy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2000/11/28/hightower/ |title=How Florida Democrats torpedoed Gore - Salon.com |access-date=November 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111183522/https://www.salon.com/2000/11/28/hightower/ |archive-date=November 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Press influence on race===\nIn their 2007 book ''The Nightly News Nightmare: Network Television's Coverage of US Presidential Elections, 1988\u20132004'', professors Stephen J.

''[[The New York Times]]'' used these colors on their full-color election maps. Senior graphics editor Archie Tse, decided that as Republican started with an ''R'' then red \"was a more natural association\". Prior to that color coding choices were inconsistent across the media. In 1976, in its first election map on air, NBC used bulbs that turned red for Carter-won states (Democratic), and blue for Ford (Republican). This original color scheme was based on the British political system, where blue is used to denote the centre-right Conservative Party and red for the centre-left Labour Party (gold or yellow is used for the 'third party' Liberal Democrats). However the NBC format did not catch on long term, the media did not follow suit. The unusually long 2000 election helped to cement red and blue as colors in the collective mind.<ref name=\"Verge 2012\">{{cite web |last1=Streams |first1=Kimber |title=Why are Republicans red and Democrats blue? |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/6/3609534/republicans-red-democrats-blue-why-election |website=The Verge |accessdate=11 August 2018 |date=November 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811195016/https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/6/3609534/republicans-red-democrats-blue-why-election |archive-date=August 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Effects on future elections and Supreme Court===\nA number of subsequent articles have characterized the election in 2000, and the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v Gore, as damaging the reputation of the Supreme Court, increasing the view of judges as partisan, and decreasing Americans' trust in the integrity of elections.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/ct-xpm-2012-07-02-ct-oped-0702-krauthammer-20120702-17-story.html | title=Why Roberts did it | access-date=July 4, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703052113/https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/ct-xpm-2012-07-02-ct-oped-0702-krauthammer-20120702-17-story.html | archive-date=July 3, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=4557&context=ylj</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&context=facpub |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531023521/https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&context=facpub |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=https://theweek.com/articles/488658/legacy-bush-v-gore| title=The legacy of Bush v.

The character made his debut in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening]]'' as a human mage pursued by members of the Templar Order, the military arm of the Chantry, which is the dominant religious organization in the ''Dragon Age'' series. He joins the player character as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He appears again as a companion character in 2011's ''[[Dragon Age II]]''.\n\nAlthough the character is initially depicted in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' to be only concerned about his own personal freedom, by ''Dragon Age II'' he has developed a zealous passion to help other mages who are oppressed by the Chantry. He later reveals to Hawke, the player character of the second game, that he has allowed himself to be possessed by a spirit prior to his relocation to Kirkwall, whose rigid belief in moral absolutes influenced his predominantly lighthearted and carefree disposition. Anders later orchestrates the destruction of the Kirkwall Chantry; with his actions, the Circles of Magi across Thedas began to rebel against the Templar Order and the Chantry, leading to all-out conflict across the regions of Thedas which later led to the Mage-Templar War in ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]''. \n\nAnders' depiction in ''Dragon Age II'' has proven divisive among [[video game journalists]] and fans. Some found merit and nuance in his changed personality and antagonism against the templars, while others have disapproved of his darker characterization and suggested that his fanaticism lacked depth.\n\n==Character Overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote =  \"What they hadn\u2019t reckoned with by the time of 2011\u2019s ''Dragon Age II'' is that, historically, when you repress a minority, you give them resolve. Often that repression will turn to oppression because of paranoia or sadism. When that happens, that resolve that\u2019s been burning away will often literally explode (see: Anders\u2019 master \u2018plan\u2019). Living things are built with a prime directive: Survive. It\u2019s a powerful instinct, and when it\u2019s all that\u2019s left, a creature a quarter of its assailant\u2019s size will fight to the death.\"\n| source = \u2014Cam Shea, on the Templar Order's treatment of mages in ''Dragon Age''. ''IGN''<ref name=\"Bomb\"/>\n}}\n\nAnders is a wise-cracking human apostate mage who has escaped the Circle of Magi multiple times, only to be captured and brought back by the templars.<ref name=\"World\"/> Born and raised in Ferelden, his father was originally from the Anderfels, a kingdom in northwestern Thedas. He was brought to the Circle of Magi at Ferelden's Kinloch Hold after his magical powers manifested when he turned twelve. Anders initially refused to speak when he arrived there, not even to tell other apprentices his name. They began calling him \"the Ander\", referring to his Anders heritage; \"Anders\" would become the only name he\u2019d use for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"World\"/> Having known friends, a loving family, and a life free of constant supervision during his childhood, the young mage was keenly aware of what he\u2019d lost and constantly rebelled against the Circle\u2019s rules and restrictions, and eventually the very structure of the Circle itself.<ref name=\"World\"/> In ''Dragon Age II'', Anders is depicted as very compassionate and eager to help the downtrodden, and he detests Kirkwall's Templar Order for their treatment of the local mages. Anders has an affinity for [[cat]]s, and kept a stray kitten he found in the Vigil's Keep whom he named \"Ser Pounce-a-lot\". \n\nAnders is a potential romance option for Hawke of either gender, whom he will usually develop feelings for even if the player do not flirt with him first.<ref name=\"Xtra\"/> Unlike other companions in ''Dragon Age II''<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/>, Anders is noted for being aggressive and proactive in his romantic pursuit for Hawke, who may respond by allowing or firmly rejecting any further flirtation.<ref name=\"Game Love\"/><ref name=\"Women\"/> Rejecting his advances will yield rivalry points, which may be interpreted by some players as a measurable consequence on the avatar-NPC relationship<ref name=\"Women\"/>, even though high rivalry scores unlock bonuses that can't be obtained through a friendship path and inspire companion loyalty just as effectively as high friendship scores.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> Jessica Hylton, author of the essay ''LGBTQIA Inclusion in Dragon Age: Inquisition: Burning Down Stereotypes and Modding for Represention'', identified Anders as the most notable example of a character providing gendered responses in the ''Dragon Age'' series. In ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'', Anders presents himself as heterosexual.<ref name=\"Girl\"/> If Hawke is male, Anders will reveal that he and Karl were once lovers; if Hawke is female, Anders will omit any mention of his romantic past with Karl. Hylton interprets this as Bioware's attempt to allow players to \"use Anders' bisexuality to include LGBTQIA content or to eliminate it from their gameplay entirely\".<ref name=\"Women\"/>\n\n==Creation and development==\nJennifer Hepler, the writer for Anders in ''Dragon Age II'', had intentionally written the character to be a polarizing figure, who would be deeply loved by some players and righteously despised by others. She drew inspiration from the \"cursed romance\" between [[Buffy Summers]] and [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' when writing the romance subplot for Anders and Hawke, noting that it was something Bioware had not done up until ''Dragon Age II''.<ref name=\"Hepler\"/>\n\nAnders is voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'', and by [[Adam Howden]] in ''Dragon Age II''. Howden used his natural speaking voice for the role, with a slight \"[[angst|angsty]]\" inflection.<ref name=\"Red\"/> He did his voice recordings with Caroline Livingstone as the voice director.<ref name=\"Spotlight\"/> She guided Howden by advising him on Anders' progression, as actors do not receive a complete script for secrecy reasons, and checked over his voice tone so that it didn't derail.<ref name=\"MCMBuzz2011podcast\"/> In preparation for the role, Adam also listened to Ellis' performance from ''Origins \u2013 Awakening''.<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/> Noting that Anders had evolved from the previous installment where he was more carefree and easygoing, Howden explained that he followed his instincts with the character, as he \"is written quite differently. He maintains a sense of humor but you learn so much more about him in DA2 and you see a much darker side to him.\"<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/> Concerning the severe nature of Anders' actions later in the game's narrative, Howden stated that based on what he learned from his acting lessons, actors must not judge their characters and must deal with their actions.<ref name=\"MCMBuzz2011podcast\"/>\n\nMatt Rhodes, who is employed at Bioware as Art Director, uploaded unused concept art he completed during the development cycle of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' on his personal website, which depicts a disheveled Anders living in a cave as a hermit.<ref name=\"Tellurion\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\nAnders is first encountered in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' fending off darkspawn on his own when the Warden-Commander arrives in the midst of an assault on Vigil's Keep, with several templars lying dead around him.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> Anders denies his culpability in the templars' demise, and revealed that he was in the midst of being taken back to the Ferelden Circle when darkspawn attacked Vigil's Keep, but offers to help repel the darkspawn attack. At the conclusion of the siege, the Warden-Commander has the option of conscripting him into the Grey Wardens in order to save him from the templars, who has accused him of murder. During this time he met Justice, a spirit from the metaphysical realm known as the Fade, who is stranded in the decomposing body of a dead Warden named Kristoff. The spirit struggled to understand the real world and its inhabitants, leading him to engage Anders in some in-depth discussions about the world's problems, and eventually about the plight of mages throughout Thedas. For his personal quest, he asks the Warden-Commander to help him find his phylactery, which allows the templars to trace his whereabouts, and destroy it.\n\n''Dragon Age II'' reveals that Anders becomes a Grey Warden and survives the events of ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' regardless of the player's choices, but he deserted from the order soon after the ending of ''Origins \u2013 Awakening''. He also agreed to host Justice as his new vessel, transferring the spirit from Kristoff's corpse into his own body, and relocated to the city of Kirwall in order to help mages fight for freedom from the Chantry.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> Hawke first meets Anders after Varric directs them to seek out a Grey Warden who possesses knowledge of the Deep Roads. He is found at his clinic in Kirkwall's Darktown giving aid to refugees, healing them free of charge. He convinces Hawke to help rescue his friend Karl from the templars in return for maps of the Deep Roads, but finds that he has been rendered Tranquil, effectively a form of lobotomy which renders the victim unable to feel any emotions. It is then revealed that the spirit of Justice now manifests itself as a spirit of Vengeance, an unintentional side effect of Anders' anger and hatred towards the templars.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> As a result, Anders struggles to maintain control of his own body and mind, and is eventually driven to become a terrorist in the name of mage rights.<ref name=\"Hepler\"/> During the climax of Act III, Anders destroys the Kirkwall Chantry, killing the Grand Cleric and several others.<ref name=\"Six\"/> This in turn gives Knight Commander Meredith the opportunity to invoke the Rite of Annulment, an order to kill all the mages in the Kirkwall Circle, without official sanction from a Grand Cleric or the Divine. Her action sparked the Kirkwall Rebellion. Hawke has the option of executing Anders for his crime, banishing him, or ordering him to fight and make amends. Each companion will react to how Hawke chooses to deal with Anders' fate in their own way, positive or negative.<ref name=\"Six\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nAnders is a divisive character.<ref name=\"GameCrate\"/><ref name=\"TheGamer\"/> Writing for ''Kotaku'', Hayley Williams placed the character last on her 2015 list ranking 51 companions from the ''Mass Effect'' and ''Dragon Age'' games. She complained that his \"terrible characterization in ''Dragon Age II'' was only made worse by the fact that he was genuinely likable and interesting in his first appearance in ''Awakening''\", and insisted that there was no resemblance between the two incarnations of the Anders character \"aside from his odd feathery shoulders\".<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> John Walker from ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' contrasted the character's different characterization in ''Dragon Age II'' from his original appearance as \"the formerly fantastically grumpy character from ''Awakenings''\", claiming \"they emasculated him to become such a weedy drip\".<ref name=\"RPS Analysis\"/> On the other hand, Kris Ligman from ''Pop Matters'' opined that ''Dragon Age II'' delivered \"some of the strongest character-driven storytelling that we've seen out of a Bioware title\" in spite of its limitations, noting that she would accept \"poorer production values as a more than acceptable trade off\" if she gets characters \"even half as dynamic as Anders\".<ref name=\"Quality\"/> Ligman noted that Anders \"makes multiple references to the freeness of sexuality that he was used to in his youth, but in pursuing a romance with him, the player becomes keenly aware how closely the game's writing is in linking the gift of magical powers and sexuality\".<ref name=\"Quality\"/> ''PC Gamer's'' Chris Thursten empathized with Anders, appreciating the moments when his sense of humor \"surfaces above the broody spirit of vengeance that inhabits him\"; by contrast, \"the final, tragic, explosive expression of his frustration at the treatment of mages\" is considered a highlight by Thursten of Hawke's decade-long exploration of relationships with their companions in Kirkwall.<ref name=\"Reinstall\"/> \n\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote = \"The whole situation bothered me not because of what happened but because I condoned it. I was staring at Dragon Age\u2019s universe\u2019s equivalent of [[Osama bin Laden]], and I could have killed him. There\u2019s a point where he puts himself under my sword, but instead, I helped his cause out. To be quite frank, I didn\u2019t see Anders as a terrorist, I saw him as a liberator.\" \n| source = \u2014 Gieson Cacho, \"Terrorism and Dragon Age II\"<ref name=\"Mercury\"/>\n}}\n\nGieson Cacho, in a 2011 post for ''[[Mercury News]]'s'' arts and entertainment blog, was of the view that Anders is the most fascinating aspect of ''Dragon Age II'' with regards to \"how he sets up the conflict that\u2019s central to the game\". Cacho drew a comparison to [[Quentin Tarantino]]\u2019s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', drawing attention to the similarity between both works where the narrative \"turns the table on our perceptions of moral and immoral acts\" over the notion that \"protagonists can act like terrorists in certain circumstances and be justified\". Cacho concluded that while BioWare's approach is flawed as they glossed over the results of the player's actions if they choose to sympathize with Anders, their attempt is considered brave as they \"broach the subject better than [[Infinity Ward]] did with ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''\".<ref name=\"Mercury\"/> [[Mattie Brice]], writing for ''Pop Matters'', provided an in-depth analysis of Anders blowing up the Chantry and by extension, BioWare\u2019s statement on contemporary social issues. Brice observed that Anders' actions intertwines anger and sympathy \"in an uncomfortable knot\", and that \"general reception of his actions has been negative\". She suggests that a gut reaction shared by most players would be to \"reprimand Anders in some way, that pushing against violent oppressors is okay -- until you get violent yourself\". To compare him to a contemporary social minority, Brice suggested, would lend \"a perspective that complicates our thinking of both Anders and social change\". Brice concluded that what the game really compels the player to consider is whether \"blowing up the Chantry is what\u2019s necessary for the oppression to end\", and that it is \"a testament to the social relevance that games can have by its blurring of the players\u2019 sense of right and wrong and by its translation of that new understanding into actual activism for issues that exist in reality\".<ref name=\"How\"/>\n\nHylton suggested that BioWare attempted to overcompensate for the perceived discomfort with male-male romance in ''Origins'' by having Anders not only pursuing the player character aggressively, but also offering different versions of Anders' past relationship with Karl depending on the player character's gender. Evaluating that the relationship between Anders and Karl is not conditional but the revelation of its nature is  contingent on the player character being female, Hylton called this approach \"a strange way to hide homosexuality\".<ref name=\"Women\"/> Heather Alexandra, writing for ''Kotaku'', notes that there is a clear parallel between real world queer experiences and the narrative of ''Dragon Age II'', which illustrates how mainstream society of Thedas treats individuals born with magical talent, which led to the Anders' path to violent revolution. Alexandra stressed that \"it speaks volumes that Anders\u2019 struggle, which borrows heavily from real world queer suffering to pack its emotional punch, requires that his gay lover die \u2014 perhaps even by Anders\u2019 own hand\".<ref name=\"Happy\"/>\n\nDuring an interview with ''Red Carpet News TV'' in October 2012, Howden noted that Anders was the role he was most recognized for at the time.<ref name=\"Red\"/> He noticed an increase in the number of fans following his [[Twitter]] account following the release of ''Dragon Age II'', and that Anders was the most frequent character fans would ask him to make an impression of when meeting him in person.<ref name=\"MCMBuzz2012\"/><ref name=\"MCMBuzz2011podcast\"/>\n===Controversy=== \nSome players have made open objections towards Anders' unsolicited expression of romantic interest in a male player character. In early 2011, shortly after the release of ''Dragon Age II'', one player made a forum post on Bioware's then-active social forums expressing their distaste for unwanted homosexual advances. One player made a forum post about how he felt Bioware \"neglected their main demographic: The Straight Male Gamer.\" The post, which is now inaccessible after EA shut down Bioware's forums, criticized the game's diversity in romances, and asked for a much bigger focus on straight male gamers as well as an option to remove [[homosexuality|homosexual]] content.<ref name=\"Escapist\">{{cite web |url=https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/108722-Dragon-Age-2-Lead-Writer-Blasts-Homophobic-Fan|title=Dragon Age 2 Lead Writer Blasts Homophobic Fan|author=Logan Westbrook|date=March 24, 2011 |publisher=[[Escapist Magazine]]|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> Gaider responded to the forum post by saying the game is designed for everyone, ending his note with saying that \"the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is, if you ask me, the one who deserves it least.\"<ref name=\"Bisexuality\"/> Other notable examples include a [[Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic)|''Ctrl+Alt+Del'' comic strip]] which lampoons Anders' alleged seduction of an unaware Hawke, and an open petition from a self-described gay player which called for Gaider's dismissal from Bioware over what they perceived to be negative representations of openly gay individuals.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/><ref name=\"Queerty\"/> \n\nGreg Armstrong-Morris from [[Daily Xtra|Xtra]] was annoyed by what he perceived to be overreaction by some gamers due to their inability to cope with Anders' flirting, and sarcastically proposed that a [[Kinsey scale]] which allows players to determine their in-game avatars' sexual orientation should be introduced to keep everyone happy.<ref name=\"Xtra\"/> Ligman quoted Denis Farr from his article written for the GayGamer website to conclude her article \"Take Your Damn Rivalry Points Like a Man: The Non-Dialectic of ''Dragon Age II''\", which read, \"Anders does not call you a \"whore,\" \"slut,\" or any other colorful epithets women in our society can expect from turning down an advance. Even rivals in the game respect Hawke\".<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> Conversely, Hylton stated that as a result of the writers' approach towards male to male flirtation in ''Dragon Age II'', Anders is an example of a \"problematic bisexual character\" and that the game's presentation \"inadvertently played into the [[LGBT_stereotypes#Pedophilia_and_predation|predatory gay trope]]\".<ref name=\"Women\"/>\n\nHowden denounced and condemned the [[homophobia|homophobic behavior]] some [[YouTube]] and Twitter users have exhibited in backlash over the homosexual romance storyline between Anders and a male player character during a podcast episode of the MCMBuzz Podcast.<ref name=\"MCMBuzz2011podcast\"/> Howden noted that he has played other gay characters before, such as Hanschen Rilow in [[Frank Wedekind]]'s ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Spring Awakening]]'', and that assuming the role of a non-heterosexual character does not bother him at all.<ref name=\"Spotlight\"/><ref name=\"Spring\">{{cite web |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2242 |title=Spring Awakening at the Union Theatre |website=London SE1 Community Website |author= Mary Couzens |date=8 July 2006 |accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nReflecting on her writing work for Anders in her autobiography, Hepler expressed bemusement that some players objected more fervently to Anders proactively flirting with a male player character compared to him \"murdering a nun in order to start a religious war\", noting that the character \"has probably succeeded in being the most controversial character in BioWare history\" from her perspective.<ref name=\"Hepler\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Girl\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening |developer=BioWare |level=City of Amaranthine |quote='''Anders''': All I want is a pretty girl, a decent meal, and the right to shoot lightning at fools.}}</ref>\n\n<!--Printed media-->\n<ref name=\"Game Love\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=M9IdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=dragon+age+2+homophobic&source=bl&ots=S6TGDYD11e&sig=ACfU3U1ZSIEcKXpt6u7cEiWYSBqZiqwzBA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHrpyhspDoAhVZILcAHWHKASYQ6AEwDnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=L-word&f=false|title=Game Love: Essays on Play and Affection|editors= Jessica Enevold, Esther MacCallum-Stewart|date=January 9, 2015|publisher=CRC Press, 2019|isbn=97814-7661-878-4|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hepler\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=fyGVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=jennifer+hepler&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLhuaP6Y_oAhXYTX0KHQ0hAE4Q6AEITzAE#v=onepage&q=anders&f=false|title= Women in Game Development: Breaking the Glass Level-Cap|editor= Jennifer Brandes Hepler|date=April 24, 2019 |publisher=CRC Press, 2019|isbn=97810-0000-777-0|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Women\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=39nKDwAAQBAJ&dq=anders+flirt+controversy&q=anders#v=onepage&q=anders&f=false|title=Women and Video Game Modding: Essays on Gender and the Digital Community|editors= Bridget Whelan, Matthew Wilhelm Kapell|date=January 24, 2020|publisher=McFarland, 2020|isbn=97814-7661-878-4|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"World\">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=''Dragon Age: The World of Thedas'', Volume 2 |location=[[Milwaukie, Oregon]] |publisher=[[Dark Horse Books]] |date=May 2015|isbn=978-161655-501-6}}</ref>\n\n<!--Web sources-->\n<ref name=\"Bisexuality\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/25/dragon-age-writer-on-characters-bisexuality/|title=Dragon Age Writer On Characters' Bisexuality|author=John Walker |date=March 25, 2011 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bomb\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/21/a-question-of-people-born-as-walking-bombs|title=A Question of People Born As Walking Bombs|author=Cam Shea |date=December 22, 2014 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GameCrate\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/definitive-ranking-dragon-age-and-mass-effect-companions-second-opinion/10972|author= Lucy K.

The character made his debut in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening]]'' as a human mage pursued by members of the Templar Order, the military arm of the Chantry, which is the dominant religious organization in the ''Dragon Age'' series. He joins the player character as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He appears again as a companion character in 2011's ''[[Dragon Age II]]''.\n\nAlthough the character is initially depicted in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' to be only concerned about his own personal freedom, by ''Dragon Age II'' he has developed a zealous passion to help other mages who are oppressed by the Chantry. He later reveals to Hawke, the player character of the second game, that he has allowed himself to be possessed by a spirit prior to his relocation to Kirkwall, whose rigid belief in moral absolutes influenced his predominantly lighthearted and carefree disposition. Anders later orchestrates the destruction of the Kirkwall Chantry; with his actions, the Circles of Magi across Thedas began to rebel against the Templar Order and the Chantry, leading to all-out conflict across the regions of Thedas which later led to the Mage-Templar War in ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]''. \n\nAnders' depiction in ''Dragon Age II'' has proven divisive among [[video game journalists]] and fans. Some found merit and nuance in his changed personality and antagonism against the templars, while others have disapproved of his darker characterization and suggested that his fanaticism lacked depth.\n\n==Character Overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote =  \"What they hadn\u2019t reckoned with by the time of 2011\u2019s ''Dragon Age II'' is that, historically, when you repress a minority, you give them resolve. Often that repression will turn to oppression because of paranoia or sadism. When that happens, that resolve that\u2019s been burning away will often literally explode (see: Anders\u2019 master \u2018plan\u2019). Living things are built with a prime directive: Survive. It\u2019s a powerful instinct, and when it\u2019s all that\u2019s left, a creature a quarter of its assailant\u2019s size will fight to the death.\"\n| source = \u2014Cam Shea, on the Templar Order's treatment of mages in ''Dragon Age''. ''IGN''<ref name=\"Bomb\"/>\n}}\n\nAnders is a wise-cracking human apostate mage who has escaped the Circle of Magi multiple times, only to be captured and brought back by the templars.<ref name=\"World\"/> Born and raised in Ferelden, his father was originally from the Anderfels, a kingdom in northwestern Thedas. He was brought to the Circle of Magi at Ferelden's Kinloch Hold after his magical powers manifested when he turned twelve. Anders initially refused to speak when he arrived there, not even to tell other apprentices his name. They began calling him \"the Ander\", referring to his Anders heritage; \"Anders\" would become the only name he\u2019d use for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"World\"/> Having known friends, a loving family, and a life free of constant supervision during his childhood, the young mage was keenly aware of what he\u2019d lost and constantly rebelled against the Circle\u2019s rules and restrictions, and eventually the very structure of the Circle itself.<ref name=\"World\"/> In ''Dragon Age II'', Anders is depicted as very compassionate and eager to help the downtrodden, and he detests Kirkwall's Templar Order for their treatment of the local mages. Anders has an affinity for [[cat]]s, and kept a stray kitten he found in the Vigil's Keep whom he named \"Ser Pounce-a-lot\". \n\nAnders is a potential romance option for Hawke of either gender, whom he will usually develop feelings for even if the player do not flirt with him first.<ref name=\"Xtra\"/> Unlike other companions in ''Dragon Age II''<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/>, Anders is noted for being aggressive and proactive in his romantic pursuit for Hawke, who may respond by allowing or firmly rejecting any further flirtation.<ref name=\"Game Love\"/><ref name=\"Women\"/> Rejecting his advances will yield rivalry points, which may be interpreted by some players as a measurable consequence on the avatar-NPC relationship<ref name=\"Women\"/>, even though high rivalry scores unlock bonuses that can't be obtained through a friendship path and inspire companion loyalty just as effectively as high friendship scores.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> Jessica Hylton, author of the essay ''LGBTQIA Inclusion in Dragon Age: Inquisition: Burning Down Stereotypes and Modding for Represention'', identified Anders as the most notable example of a character providing gendered responses in the ''Dragon Age'' series. In ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'', Anders presents himself as heterosexual.<ref name=\"Girl\"/> If Hawke is male, Anders will reveal that he and Karl were once lovers; if Hawke is female, Anders will omit any mention of his romantic past with Karl. Hylton interprets this as Bioware's attempt to allow players to \"use Anders' bisexuality to include LGBTQIA content or to eliminate it from their gameplay entirely\".<ref name=\"Women\"/>\n\n==Creation and development==\nJennifer Hepler, the writer for Anders in ''Dragon Age II'', had intentionally written the character to be a polarizing figure, who would be deeply loved by some players and righteously despised by others. She drew inspiration from the \"cursed romance\" between [[Buffy Summers]] and [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' when writing the romance subplot for Anders and Hawke, noting that it was something Bioware had not done up until ''Dragon Age II''.<ref name=\"Hepler\"/>\n\nAnders is voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'', and by [[Adam Howden]] in ''Dragon Age II''. Howden used his natural speaking voice for the role, with a slight \"[[angst|angsty]]\" inflection.<ref name=\"Red\"/> He did his voice recordings with Caroline Livingstone as the voice director.<ref name=\"Spotlight\"/> She guided Howden by advising him on Anders' progression, as actors do not receive a complete script for secrecy reasons, and checked over his voice tone so that it didn't derail.<ref name=\"MCMBuzz2011podcast\"/> In preparation for the role, Adam also listened to Ellis' performance from ''Origins \u2013 Awakening''.<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/> Noting that Anders had evolved from the previous installment where he was more carefree and easygoing, Howden explained that he followed his instincts with the character, as he \"is written quite differently. He maintains a sense of humor but you learn so much more about him in DA2 and you see a much darker side to him.\"<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/> Concerning the severe nature of Anders' actions later in the game's narrative, Howden stated that based on what he learned from his acting lessons, actors must not judge their characters and must deal with their actions.<ref name=\"MCMBuzz2011podcast\"/>\n\nMatt Rhodes, who is employed at Bioware as Art Director, uploaded unused concept art he completed during the development cycle of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' on his personal website, which depicts a disheveled Anders living in a cave as a hermit.<ref name=\"Tellurion\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\nAnders is first encountered in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' fending off darkspawn on his own when the Warden-Commander arrives in the midst of an assault on Vigil's Keep, with several templars lying dead around him.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> Anders denies his culpability in the templars' demise, and revealed that he was in the midst of being taken back to the Ferelden Circle when darkspawn attacked Vigil's Keep, but offers to help repel the darkspawn attack. At the conclusion of the siege, the Warden-Commander has the option of conscripting him into the Grey Wardens in order to save him from the templars, who has accused him of murder. During this time he met Justice, a spirit from the metaphysical realm known as the Fade, who is stranded in the decomposing body of a dead Warden named Kristoff. The spirit struggled to understand the real world and its inhabitants, leading him to engage Anders in some in-depth discussions about the world's problems, and eventually about the plight of mages throughout Thedas. For his personal quest, he asks the Warden-Commander to help him find his phylactery, which allows the templars to trace his whereabouts, and destroy it.\n\n''Dragon Age II'' reveals that Anders becomes a Grey Warden and survives the events of ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' regardless of the player's choices, but he deserted from the order soon after the ending of ''Origins \u2013 Awakening''. He also agreed to host Justice as his new vessel, transferring the spirit from Kristoff's corpse into his own body, and relocated to the city of Kirwall in order to help mages fight for freedom from the Chantry.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> Hawke first meets Anders after Varric directs them to seek out a Grey Warden who possesses knowledge of the Deep Roads. He is found at his clinic in Kirkwall's Darktown giving aid to refugees, healing them free of charge. He convinces Hawke to help rescue his friend Karl from the templars in return for maps of the Deep Roads, but finds that he has been rendered Tranquil, effectively a form of lobotomy which renders the victim unable to feel any emotions. It is then revealed that the spirit of Justice now manifests itself as a spirit of Vengeance, an unintentional side effect of Anders' anger and hatred towards the templars.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> As a result, Anders struggles to maintain control of his own body and mind, and is eventually driven to become a terrorist in the name of mage rights.<ref name=\"Hepler\"/> During the climax of Act III, Anders destroys the Kirkwall Chantry, killing the Grand Cleric and several others.<ref name=\"Six\"/> This in turn gives Knight Commander Meredith the opportunity to invoke the Rite of Annulment, an order to kill all the mages in the Kirkwall Circle, without official sanction from a Grand Cleric or the Divine. Her action sparked the Kirkwall Rebellion. Hawke has the option of executing Anders for his crime, banishing him, or ordering him to fight and make amends. Each companion will react to how Hawke chooses to deal with Anders' fate in their own way, positive or negative.<ref name=\"Six\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nAnders is a divisive character.<ref name=\"GameCrate\"/><ref name=\"TheGamer\"/> Writing for ''Kotaku'', Hayley Williams placed the character last on her 2015 list ranking 51 companions from the ''Mass Effect'' and ''Dragon Age'' games. She complained that his \"terrible characterization in ''Dragon Age II'' was only made worse by the fact that he was genuinely likable and interesting in his first appearance in ''Awakening''\", and insisted that there was no resemblance between the two incarnations of the Anders character \"aside from his odd feathery shoulders\".<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> John Walker from ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' contrasted the character's different characterization in ''Dragon Age II'' from his original appearance as \"the formerly fantastically grumpy character from ''Awakenings''\", claiming \"they emasculated him to become such a weedy drip\".<ref name=\"RPS Analysis\"/> On the other hand, Kris Ligman from ''Pop Matters'' opined that ''Dragon Age II'' delivered \"some of the strongest character-driven storytelling that we've seen out of a Bioware title\" in spite of its limitations, noting that she would accept \"poorer production values as a more than acceptable trade off\" if she gets characters \"even half as dynamic as Anders\".<ref name=\"Quality\"/> Ligman noted that Anders \"makes multiple references to the freeness of sexuality that he was used to in his youth, but in pursuing a romance with him, the player becomes keenly aware how closely the game's writing is in linking the gift of magical powers and sexuality\".<ref name=\"Quality\"/> ''PC Gamer's'' Chris Thursten empathized with Anders, appreciating the moments when his sense of humor \"surfaces above the broody spirit of vengeance that inhabits him\"; by contrast, \"the final, tragic, explosive expression of his frustration at the treatment of mages\" is considered a highlight by Thursten of Hawke's decade-long exploration of relationships with their companions in Kirkwall.<ref name=\"Reinstall\"/> \n\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote = \"The whole situation bothered me not because of what happened but because I condoned it. I was staring at Dragon Age\u2019s universe\u2019s equivalent of [[Osama bin Laden]], and I could have killed him. There\u2019s a point where he puts himself under my sword, but instead, I helped his cause out. To be quite frank, I didn\u2019t see Anders as a terrorist, I saw him as a liberator.\" \n| source = \u2014 Gieson Cacho, \"Terrorism and Dragon Age II\"<ref name=\"Mercury\"/>\n}}\n\nGieson Cacho, in a 2011 post for ''[[Mercury News]]'s'' arts and entertainment blog, was of the view that Anders is the most fascinating aspect of ''Dragon Age II'' with regards to \"how he sets up the conflict that\u2019s central to the game\". Cacho drew a comparison to [[Quentin Tarantino]]\u2019s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', drawing attention to the similarity between both works where the narrative \"turns the table on our perceptions of moral and immoral acts\" over the notion that \"protagonists can act like terrorists in certain circumstances and be justified\". Cacho concluded that while BioWare's approach is flawed as they glossed over the results of the player's actions if they choose to sympathize with Anders, their attempt is considered brave as they \"broach the subject better than [[Infinity Ward]] did with ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''\".<ref name=\"Mercury\"/> Mattie Brice, writing for ''Pop Matters'', provided an in-depth analysis of Anders blowing up the Chantry and by extension, BioWare\u2019s statement on contemporary social issues. Brice observed that Anders' actions intertwines anger and sympathy \"in an uncomfortable knot\", and that \"general reception of his actions has been negative\". She suggests that a gut reaction shared by most players would be to \"reprimand Anders in some way, that pushing against violent oppressors is okay -- until you get violent yourself\". To compare him to a contemporary social minority, Brice suggested, would lend \"a perspective that complicates our thinking of both Anders and social change\". Brice concluded that what the game really compels the player to consider is whether \"blowing up the Chantry is what\u2019s necessary for the oppression to end\", and that it is \"a testament to the social relevance that games can have by its blurring of the players\u2019 sense of right and wrong and by its translation of that new understanding into actual activism for issues that exist in reality\".<ref name=\"How\"/>\n\nHylton suggested that BioWare attempted to overcompensate for the perceived discomfort with male-male romance in ''Origins'' by having Anders not only pursuing the player character aggressively, but also offering different versions of Anders' past relationship with Karl depending on the player character's gender. Evaluating that the relationship between Anders and Karl is not conditional but the revelation of its nature is  contingent on the player character being female, Hylton called this approach \"a strange way to hide homosexuality\".<ref name=\"Women\"/> Heather Alexandra, writing for ''Kotaku'', notes that there is a clear parallel between real world queer experiences and the narrative of ''Dragon Age II'', which illustrates how mainstream society of Thedas treats individuals born with magical talent, which led to the Anders' path to violent revolution. Alexandra stressed that \"it speaks volumes that Anders\u2019 struggle, which borrows heavily from real world queer suffering to pack its emotional punch, requires that his gay lover die \u2014 perhaps even by Anders\u2019 own hand\".<ref name=\"Happy\"/>\n\nDuring an interview with ''Red Carpet News TV'' in October 2012, Howden noted that Anders was the role he was most recognized for at the time.<ref name=\"Red\"/> He noticed an increase in the number of fans following his [[Twitter]] account following the release of ''Dragon Age II'', and that Anders was the most frequent character fans would ask him to make an impression of when meeting him in person.<ref name=\"MCMBuzz2012\"/><ref name=\"MCMBuzz2011podcast\"/>\n===Controversy=== \nSome players have made open objections towards Anders' unsolicited expression of romantic interest in a male player character. In early 2011, shortly after the release of ''Dragon Age II'', one player made a forum post on Bioware's then-active social forums expressing their distaste for unwanted homosexual advances. One player made a forum post about how he felt Bioware \"neglected their main demographic: The Straight Male Gamer.\" The post, which is now inaccessible after EA shut down Bioware's forums, criticized the game's diversity in romances, and asked for a much bigger focus on straight male gamers as well as an option to remove [[homosexuality|homosexual]] content.<ref name=\"Escapist\">{{cite web |url=https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/108722-Dragon-Age-2-Lead-Writer-Blasts-Homophobic-Fan|title=Dragon Age 2 Lead Writer Blasts Homophobic Fan|author=Logan Westbrook|date=March 24, 2011 |publisher=[[Escapist Magazine]]|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> Gaider responded to the forum post by saying the game is designed for everyone, ending his note with saying that \"the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is, if you ask me, the one who deserves it least.\"<ref name=\"Bisexuality\"/> Other notable examples include a [[Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic)|''Ctrl+Alt+Del'' comic strip]] which lampoons Anders' alleged seduction of an unaware Hawke, and an open petition from a self-described gay player which called for Gaider's dismissal from Bioware over what they perceived to be negative representations of openly gay individuals.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/><ref name=\"Queerty\"/> \n\nGreg Armstrong-Morris from [[Daily Xtra|Xtra]] was annoyed by what he perceived to be overreaction by some gamers due to their inability to cope with Anders' flirting, and sarcastically proposed that a [[Kinsey scale]] which allows players to determine their in-game avatars' sexual orientation should be introduced to keep everyone happy.<ref name=\"Xtra\"/> Ligman quoted Denis Farr from his article written for the GayGamer website to conclude her article \"Take Your Damn Rivalry Points Like a Man: The Non-Dialectic of ''Dragon Age II''\", which read, \"Anders does not call you a \"whore,\" \"slut,\" or any other colorful epithets women in our society can expect from turning down an advance. Even rivals in the game respect Hawke\".<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> Conversely, Hylton stated that as a result of the writers' approach towards male to male flirtation in ''Dragon Age II'', Anders is an example of a \"problematic bisexual character\" and that the game's presentation \"inadvertently played into the [[LGBT_stereotypes#Pedophilia_and_predation|predatory gay trope]]\".<ref name=\"Women\"/>\n\nHowden denounced and condemned the [[homophobia|homophobic behavior]] some [[YouTube]] and Twitter users have exhibited in backlash over the homosexual romance storyline between Anders and a male player character during a podcast episode of the MCMBuzz Podcast.<ref name=\"MCMBuzz2011podcast\"/> Howden noted that he has played other gay characters before, such as Hanschen Rilow in [[Frank Wedekind]]'s ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Spring Awakening]]'', and that assuming the role of a non-heterosexual character does not bother him at all.<ref name=\"Spotlight\"/><ref name=\"Spring\">{{cite web |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2242 |title=Spring Awakening at the Union Theatre |website=London SE1 Community Website |author= Mary Couzens |date=8 July 2006 |accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nReflecting on her writing work for Anders in her autobiography, Hepler expressed bemusement that some players objected more fervently to Anders proactively flirting with a male player character compared to him \"murdering a nun in order to start a religious war\", noting that the character \"has probably succeeded in being the most controversial character in BioWare history\" from her perspective.<ref name=\"Hepler\"/> \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Girl\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening |developer=BioWare |level=City of Amaranthine |quote='''Anders''': All I want is a pretty girl, a decent meal, and the right to shoot lightning at fools.}}</ref>\n\n<!--Printed media-->\n<ref name=\"Game Love\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=M9IdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=dragon+age+2+homophobic&source=bl&ots=S6TGDYD11e&sig=ACfU3U1ZSIEcKXpt6u7cEiWYSBqZiqwzBA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHrpyhspDoAhVZILcAHWHKASYQ6AEwDnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=L-word&f=false|title=Game Love: Essays on Play and Affection|editors= Jessica Enevold, Esther MacCallum-Stewart|date=January 9, 2015|publisher=CRC Press, 2019|isbn=97814-7661-878-4|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hepler\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=fyGVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=jennifer+hepler&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLhuaP6Y_oAhXYTX0KHQ0hAE4Q6AEITzAE#v=onepage&q=anders&f=false|title= Women in Game Development: Breaking the Glass Level-Cap|editor= Jennifer Brandes Hepler|date=April 24, 2019 |publisher=CRC Press, 2019|isbn=97810-0000-777-0|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Women\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=39nKDwAAQBAJ&dq=anders+flirt+controversy&q=anders#v=onepage&q=anders&f=false|title=Women and Video Game Modding: Essays on Gender and the Digital Community|editors= Bridget Whelan, Matthew Wilhelm Kapell|date=January 24, 2020|publisher=McFarland, 2020|isbn=97814-7661-878-4|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"World\">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=''Dragon Age: The World of Thedas'', Volume 2 |location=[[Milwaukie, Oregon]] |publisher=[[Dark Horse Books]] |date=May 2015|isbn=978-161655-501-6}}</ref>\n\n<!--Web sources-->\n<ref name=\"Bisexuality\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/25/dragon-age-writer-on-characters-bisexuality/|title=Dragon Age Writer On Characters' Bisexuality|author=John Walker |date=March 25, 2011 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bomb\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/21/a-question-of-people-born-as-walking-bombs|title=A Question of People Born As Walking Bombs|author=Cam Shea |date=December 22, 2014 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GameCrate\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/definitive-ranking-dragon-age-and-mass-effect-companions-second-opinion/10972|author= Lucy K.

The genome is composed of a number of chromosomes\u2014complexes of tightly coiled [[DNA]] that contain [[DNA sequence|genetic information]] vital for proper cell function. Because each resultant daughter cell should be [[clone (genetics)|genetically identical]] to the parent cell, the parent cell must make a copy of each chromosome before mitosis. This occurs during the [[S phase]] of interphase.<ref name=Blow2005/> [[DNA replication|Chromosome duplication]] results in two identical ''[[sister chromatids]]'' bound together by [[cohesin]] proteins at the ''[[centromere]]''.\n\nWhen mitosis begins, the chromosomes condense and become visible. In some eukaryotes, for example animals, the [[nuclear envelope]], which segregates the DNA from the cytoplasm, disintegrates into small vesicles. The [[nucleolus]], which makes ribosomes in the cell, also disappears. [[Microtubule]]s project from opposite ends of the cell, attach to the centromeres, and align the chromosomes centrally within the cell. The microtubules then contract to pull the sister chromatids of each chromosome apart.<ref name=Zhou2002/> Sister chromatids at this point are called ''daughter chromosomes''. As the cell elongates, corresponding daughter chromosomes are pulled toward opposite ends of the cell and condense maximally in late anaphase. A new nuclear envelope forms around the separated daughter chromosomes, which decondense to form interphase nuclei.\n\nDuring mitotic progression, typically after the anaphase onset, the cell may undergo cytokinesis. In [[animal cell]]s, a [[cleavage furrow|cell membrane pinches inward]] between the two developing nuclei to produce two new cells. In [[plant cell]]s, a [[cell plate]] forms between the two nuclei. Cytokinesis does not always occur; coenocytic (a type of multinucleate condition) cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis.\n\n{{wide image|Mitosis Stages.svg|1100px|Diagram of the mitotic phases}}\n\n===Interphase===\n<!-- that graph and the following paragraph must have full labels not just single letters -->\n{{main|Interphase}}\nThe mitotic phase is a relatively short period of the [[cell cycle]]. It alternates with the much longer ''[[interphase]]'', where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division. Interphase is divided into three phases: [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub> (first gap)]], [[S phase|S (synthesis)]], and [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub> (second gap)]]. During all three parts of interphase, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are replicated only during the [[S phase]]. Thus, a cell grows (G<sub>1</sub>), continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes (S), grows more and prepares for mitosis (G<sub>2</sub>), and finally divides (M) before restarting the cycle.<ref name=Blow2005/> All these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by [[cyclins]], [[cyclin-dependent kinases]], and other cell cycle proteins. The phases follow one another in strict order and there are \"[[Cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]]\" that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to another<ref>{{cite web |last1=Biology Online |title= Mitosis |url=https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/mitosis |website=Biology Online}}</ref>. Cells may also temporarily or permanently leave the cell cycle and enter [[G0 phase|G<sub>0</sub> phase]] to stop dividing. This can occur when cells become overcrowded ([[density-dependent inhibition]]) or when they [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to carry out specific functions for the organism, as is the case for [[Cardiac muscle cell|human heart muscle cells]] and [[neurons]]. Some G<sub>0</sub> cells have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle.\n\nDNA double-strand breaks can be [[DNA repair|repaired]] during interphase by two principal processes.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 28781144 | doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2017.07.011 | volume=803-805 | title=Regulation of repair pathway choice at two-ended DNA double-strand breaks | year=2017 | journal=Mutat Res | pages=51\u201355  | last1 = Shibata | first1 = A}}</ref>  The first process, [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ), can join the two broken ends of DNA in the [[G1 phase|G1]], [[S phase|S]] and [[G2 phase|G2]] phases of interphase.  The second process, [[homologous recombination]]al repair (HRR), is more accurate than NHEJ in repairing double-strand breaks.  HRR is active during the S and G2 phases of interphase when [[DNA replication]] is either partially accomplished or after it is completed, since HRR requires two adjacent [[chromatids|homologs]].\n\n===Mitosis===\n\n====Preprophase (plant cells)====\n{{main|Preprophase}}\nIn plant cells only, prophase is preceded by a pre-prophase stage. In highly [[vacuole|vacuolated]] plant cells, the nucleus has to migrate into the center of the cell before mitosis can begin. This is achieved through the formation of a [[phragmosome]], a transverse sheet of cytoplasm that bisects the cell along the future plane of cell division. In addition to phragmosome formation, preprophase is characterized by the formation of a ring of microtubules and [[actin]] filaments (called [[preprophase band]]) underneath the plasma membrane around the equatorial plane of the future mitotic [[spindle apparatus|spindle]]. This band marks the position where the cell will eventually divide. The cells of higher plants (such as the [[flowering plant]]s) lack [[centrioles]]; instead, microtubules form a spindle on the surface of the nucleus and are then organized into a spindle by the chromosomes themselves, after the nuclear envelope breaks down.<ref name=Lloyd/> The preprophase band disappears during nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle formation in prometaphase.<ref name = \"Raven_2005\">{{cite book |last1= Raven |first1= P.

During interphase, the genetic material in the nucleus consists of loosely packed [[chromatin]]. At the onset of prophase, chromatin fibers condense into discrete chromosomes that are typically visible at high magnification through a [[light microscope]]. In this stage, chromosomes are long, thin and thread-like. Each chromosome has two chromatids. The two chromatids are joined at the centromere.\n\n[[Gene transcription]] ceases during prophase and does not resume until late anaphase to early G<sub>1</sub> phase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prasanth KV, Sacco-Bubulya PA, Prasanth SG, Spector DL | title = Sequential entry of components of the gene expression machinery into daughter nuclei | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 1043\u201357 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12631722 | pmc = 151578 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E02-10-0669 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kadauke S, Blobel GA | title = Mitotic bookmarking by transcription factors | journal = Epigenetics & Chromatin | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 6 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23547918 | pmc = 3621617 | doi = 10.1186/1756-8935-6-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prescott DM, Bender MA | title = Synthesis of RNA and protein during mitosis in mammalian tissue culture cells | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 260\u20138 | date = March 1962 | pmid = 14488623 | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(62)90176-3 }}</ref> The [[nucleolus]] also disappears during early prophase.<ref>{{cite book |last=Olson |first=Mark O.

The centrosome is the coordinating center for the cell's [[microtubule]]s. A cell inherits a single centrosome at cell division, which is [[Centrosome cycle|duplicated by the cell]] before a new round of mitosis begins, giving a pair of centrosomes.

This motor activity, coupled with polymerisation and depolymerisation of microtubules, provides the pulling force necessary to later separate the chromosome's two chromatids.<ref name=Maiato2004/>\n\n====Metaphase====\n[[File:Mitosis-fluorescent.jpg|thumb|right|A cell in late [[metaphase]]. All chromosomes (blue) but one have arrived at the metaphase plate.]] \n{{main|Metaphase}}\nAfter the microtubules have located and attached to the kinetochores in prometaphase, the two centrosomes begin pulling the chromosomes towards opposite ends of the cell. The resulting tension causes the chromosomes to align along the ''metaphase plate'' or ''equatorial plane'', an imaginary line that is centrally located between the two centrosomes (at approximately the midline of the cell).<ref name=Winey1995/> To ensure equitable distribution of chromosomes at the end of mitosis, the ''[[spindle checkpoint|metaphase checkpoint]]'' guarantees that kinetochores are properly attached to the mitotic spindle and that the chromosomes are aligned along the metaphase plate.<ref name=Chan2003/> If the cell successfully passes through the metaphase checkpoint, it proceeds to anaphase.\n\n====Anaphase====\n{{main|Anaphase}}\nDuring ''anaphase A'', the [[cohesin]]s that bind sister chromatids together are cleaved, forming two identical daughter chromosomes.<ref name=\"FitzHarris\"/> Shortening of the kinetochore microtubules pulls the newly formed daughter chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell.

At telophase, the polar microtubules continue to lengthen, elongating the cell even more. If the nuclear envelope has broken down, a new nuclear envelope forms using the membrane vesicles of the parent cell's old nuclear envelope. The new envelope forms around each set of separated daughter chromosomes (though the membrane does not enclose the centrosomes) and the nucleolus reappears. Both sets of chromosomes, now surrounded by new nuclear membrane, begin to \"relax\" or decondense. Mitosis is complete. Each daughter nucleus has an identical set of chromosomes. Cell division may or may not occur at this time depending on the organism.\n\n===Cytokinesis===\n[[File:Unk.cilliate.jpg|thumb|right|Cilliate undergoing cytokinesis, with the [[cleavage furrow]] being clearly visible]]\n{{main|Cytokinesis}}\nCytokinesis is not a phase of mitosis but rather a separate process, necessary for completing cell division. In animal cells, a [[cleavage furrow]] (pinch) containing a contractile ring develops where the metaphase plate used to be, pinching off the separated nuclei.<ref name=Glotzer2005/> In both animal and plant cells, cell division is also driven by vesicles derived from the [[Golgi apparatus]], which move along microtubules to the middle of the cell.<ref name=Albertson2005/> In plants, this structure coalesces into a cell plate at the center of the [[phragmoplast]] and develops into a cell wall, separating the two nuclei. The phragmoplast is a microtubule structure typical for higher plants, whereas some green algae use a [[phycoplast]] microtubule array during cytokinesis.<ref name = \"Raven_2005\"/>{{rp|64\u20137, 328\u20139}} Each daughter cell has a complete copy of the genome of its parent cell. The end of cytokinesis marks the end of the M-phase.\n\nThere are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei. The most notable occurrence of this is among the [[fungus|fungi]], [[slime mold]]s, and coenocytic algae, but the phenomenon is found in various other organisms. Even in animals, cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] embryonic development.<ref name=Lilly2005/>\n\n== Function ==\nMitosis \"[[function (biology)|function]]\" or significance relies on the maintenance of the chromosomal set; each cell formed receives chromosomes that are alike in composition and equal in number to the chromosomes of the parent cell.\n\nMitosis occurs in the following circumstances:\n*Development and growth: The number of cells within an organism increases by mitosis. This is the basis of the development of a multicellular body from a single cell, i.e., [[zygote]] and also the basis of the growth of a [[multicellular]] body.\n*Cell replacement: In some parts of the body, e.g. skin and digestive tract, cells are constantly sloughed off and replaced by new ones. New cells are formed by mitosis and so are exact copies of the cells being replaced. In like manner, [[red blood cells]] have a short lifespan (only about 4 months) and new RBCs are formed by mitosis.\n*Regeneration: Some organisms can regenerate body parts. The production of new cells in such instances is achieved by mitosis. For example, [[starfish]] regenerate lost arms through mitosis.\n*Asexual reproduction: Some organisms produce genetically similar offspring through [[asexual reproduction]]. For example, the [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] reproduces asexually by budding. The cells at the surface of hydra undergo mitosis and form a mass called a bud. Mitosis continues in the cells of the bud and this grows into a new individual. The same division happens during asexual reproduction or [[vegetative propagation]] in plants.\n\n==Variations==\n=== Forms of mitosis ===\nThe mitosis process in the cells of eukaryotic organisms follow a similar pattern, but with variations in three main details. \"Closed\" and \"open\" mitosis can be distinguished on the basis of [[nuclear envelope]] remaining intact or breaking down. An intermediate form with partial degradation of the nuclear envelope is called \"semiopen\" mitosis. With respesct to the symmetry of the [[spindle apparatus]] during metaphase, an approximately axially symmetric (centered) shape is called as \"orthomitosis\", distinguished from the eccentric spindles of \"pleuromitosis\", in which mitotic apparatus has bilateral symmetry. Finally, a third criterion is the location of the [[central spindle]] in case of closed pleuromitosis: \"extranuclear\" (spindle located in the cytoplasm) or \"intranuclear\" (in the nucleus).<ref name= \"Raikov1994\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Mitosis classification closed intranuclear pleuromitoses.svg|closed <br> intranuclear <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification closed extranuclear pleuromitoses.svg|closed <br> extranuclear <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification closed orthomitoses.svg|closed <br> orthomitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification semiopen pleuromitoses.svg|semiopen <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification semiopen orthomitoses.svg|semiopen <br> orthomitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification open orthomitoses.svg|open <br> orthomitosis\n</gallery>\n\nNuclear division takes place only in cells of organisms of the [[eukaryotic]] domain, as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] have no nucleus.

The genome is composed of a number of chromosomes\u2014complexes of tightly coiled [[DNA]] that contain [[DNA sequence|genetic information]] vital for proper cell function. Because each resultant daughter cell should be [[clone (genetics)|genetically identical]] to the parent cell, the parent cell must make a copy of each chromosome before mitosis. This occurs during the [[S phase]] of interphase.<ref name=Blow2005/> [[DNA replication|Chromosome duplication]] results in two identical ''[[sister chromatids]]'' bound together by [[cohesin]] proteins at the ''[[centromere]]''.\n\nWhen mitosis begins, the chromosomes condense and become visible. In some eukaryotes, for example animals, the [[nuclear envelope]], which segregates the DNA from the cytoplasm, disintegrates into small vesicles. The [[nucleolus]], which makes ribosomes in the cell, also disappears. [[Microtubule]]s project from opposite ends of the cell, attach to the centromeres, and align the chromosomes centrally within the cell. The microtubules then contract to pull the sister chromatids of each chromosome apart.<ref name=Zhou2002/> Sister chromatids at this point are called ''daughter chromosomes''. As the cell elongates, corresponding daughter chromosomes are pulled toward opposite ends of the cell and condense maximally in late anaphase. A new nuclear envelope forms around the separated daughter chromosomes, which decondense to form interphase nuclei.\n\nDuring mitotic progression, typically after the anaphase onset, the cell may undergo cytokinesis. In [[animal cell]]s, a [[cleavage furrow|cell membrane pinches inward]] between the two developing nuclei to produce two new cells. In [[plant cell]]s, a [[cell plate]] forms between the two nuclei. Cytokinesis does not always occur; coenocytic (a type of multinucleate condition) cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis.\n\n{{wide image|Mitosis Stages.svg|1100px|Diagram of the mitotic phases}}\n\n===Interphase===\n<!-- that graph and the following paragraph must have full labels not just single letters -->\n{{main|Interphase}}\nThe mitotic phase is a relatively short period of the [[cell cycle]]. It alternates with the much longer ''[[interphase]]'', where the cell prepares itself for the process of cell division. Interphase is divided into three phases: [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub> (first gap)]], [[S phase|S (synthesis)]], and [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub> (second gap)]]. During all three parts of interphase, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are replicated only during the [[S phase]]. Thus, a cell grows (G<sub>1</sub>), continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes (S), grows more and prepares for mitosis (G<sub>2</sub>), and finally divides (M) before restarting the cycle.<ref name=Blow2005/> All these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by [[cyclins]], [[cyclin-dependent kinases]], and other cell cycle proteins. The phases follow one another in strict order and there are \"[[Cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]]\" that give the cell cues to proceed from one phase to another<ref>{{cite web |last1=Biology Online |title= Mitosis |url=https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/mitosis |website=Biology Online}}</ref>. Cells may also temporarily or permanently leave the cell cycle and enter [[G0 phase|G<sub>0</sub> phase]] to stop dividing. This can occur when cells become overcrowded ([[density-dependent inhibition]]) or when they [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to carry out specific functions for the organism, as is the case for [[Cardiac muscle cell|human heart muscle cells]] and [[neurons]]. Some G<sub>0</sub> cells have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle.\n\nDNA double-strand breaks can be [[DNA repair|repaired]] during interphase by two principal processes.<ref>Shibata A.  Regulation of repair pathway choice at two-ended DNA double-strand breaks.  Mutat Res. 2017 Oct;803-805:51-55. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2017.07.011. Epub 2017 Jul 29. Review. PMID: 28781144</ref>  The first process, [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ), can join the two broken ends of DNA in the [[G1 phase|G1]], [[S phase|S]] and [[G2 phase|G2]] phases of interphase.  The second process, [[homologous recombination]]al repair (HRR), is more accurate than NHEJ in repairing double-strand breaks.  HRR is active during the S and G2 phases of interphase when [[DNA replication]] is either partially accomplished or after it is completed, since HRR requires two adjacent [[chromatids|homologs]].\n\n===Mitosis===\n\n====Preprophase (plant cells)====\n{{main|Preprophase}}\nIn plant cells only, prophase is preceded by a pre-prophase stage. In highly [[vacuole|vacuolated]] plant cells, the nucleus has to migrate into the center of the cell before mitosis can begin. This is achieved through the formation of a [[phragmosome]], a transverse sheet of cytoplasm that bisects the cell along the future plane of cell division. In addition to phragmosome formation, preprophase is characterized by the formation of a ring of microtubules and [[actin]] filaments (called [[preprophase band]]) underneath the plasma membrane around the equatorial plane of the future mitotic [[spindle apparatus|spindle]]. This band marks the position where the cell will eventually divide. The cells of higher plants (such as the [[flowering plant]]s) lack [[centrioles]]; instead, microtubules form a spindle on the surface of the nucleus and are then organized into a spindle by the chromosomes themselves, after the nuclear envelope breaks down.<ref name=Lloyd/> The preprophase band disappears during nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle formation in prometaphase.<ref name = \"Raven_2005\">{{cite book |last1= Raven |first1= P.

During interphase, the genetic material in the nucleus consists of loosely packed [[chromatin]]. At the onset of prophase, chromatin fibers condense into discrete chromosomes that are typically visible at high magnification through a [[light microscope]]. In this stage, chromosomes are long, thin and thread-like. Each chromosome has two chromatids. The two chromatids are joined at the centromere.\n\n[[Gene transcription]] ceases during prophase and does not resume until late anaphase to early G<sub>1</sub> phase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prasanth KV, Sacco-Bubulya PA, Prasanth SG, Spector DL | title = Sequential entry of components of the gene expression machinery into daughter nuclei | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 1043\u201357 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12631722 | pmc = 151578 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E02-10-0669 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kadauke S, Blobel GA | title = Mitotic bookmarking by transcription factors | journal = Epigenetics & Chromatin | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 6 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23547918 | pmc = 3621617 | doi = 10.1186/1756-8935-6-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prescott DM, Bender MA | title = Synthesis of RNA and protein during mitosis in mammalian tissue culture cells | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 260\u20138 | date = March 1962 | pmid = 14488623 | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(62)90176-3 }}</ref> The [[nucleolus]] also disappears during early prophase.<ref>{{cite book |last=Olson |first=Mark O.

The centrosome is the coordinating center for the cell's [[microtubule]]s. A cell inherits a single centrosome at cell division, which is [[Centrosome cycle|duplicated by the cell]] before a new round of mitosis begins, giving a pair of centrosomes. The two centrosomes polymerize [[tubulin]] to help form a [[spindle apparatus|microtubule spindle apparatus]]. [[Motor proteins]] then push the centrosomes along these microtubules to opposite sides of the cell.

This motor activity, coupled with polymerisation and depolymerisation of microtubules, provides the pulling force necessary to later separate the chromosome's two chromatids.<ref name=Maiato2004/>\n\n====Metaphase====\n[[File:Mitosis-fluorescent.jpg|thumb|right|A cell in late [[metaphase]]. All chromosomes (blue) but one have arrived at the metaphase plate.]] \n{{main|Metaphase}}\nAfter the microtubules have located and attached to the kinetochores in prometaphase, the two centrosomes begin pulling the chromosomes towards opposite ends of the cell. The resulting tension causes the chromosomes to align along the ''metaphase plate'' or ''equatorial plane'', an imaginary line that is centrally located between the two centrosomes (at approximately the midline of the cell).<ref name=Winey1995/> To ensure equitable distribution of chromosomes at the end of mitosis, the ''[[spindle checkpoint|metaphase checkpoint]]'' guarantees that kinetochores are properly attached to the mitotic spindle and that the chromosomes are aligned along the metaphase plate.<ref name=Chan2003/> If the cell successfully passes through the metaphase checkpoint, it proceeds to anaphase.\n\n====Anaphase====\n{{main|Anaphase}}\nDuring ''anaphase A'', the [[cohesin]]s that bind sister chromatids together are cleaved, forming two identical daughter chromosomes.<ref name=\"FitzHarris\"/> Shortening of the kinetochore microtubules pulls the newly formed daughter chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell.

At telophase, the polar microtubules continue to lengthen, elongating the cell even more. If the nuclear envelope has broken down, a new nuclear envelope forms using the membrane vesicles of the parent cell's old nuclear envelope. The new envelope forms around each set of separated daughter chromosomes (though the membrane does not enclose the centrosomes) and the nucleolus reappears. Both sets of chromosomes, now surrounded by new nuclear membrane, begin to \"relax\" or decondense. Mitosis is complete. Each daughter nucleus has an identical set of chromosomes. Cell division may or may not occur at this time depending on the organism.\n\n===Cytokinesis===\n[[File:Unk.cilliate.jpg|thumb|right|Cilliate undergoing cytokinesis, with the [[cleavage furrow]] being clearly visible]]\n{{main|Cytokinesis}}\nCytokinesis is not a phase of mitosis but rather a separate process, necessary for completing cell division. In animal cells, a [[cleavage furrow]] (pinch) containing a contractile ring develops where the metaphase plate used to be, pinching off the separated nuclei.<ref name=Glotzer2005/> In both animal and plant cells, cell division is also driven by vesicles derived from the [[Golgi apparatus]], which move along microtubules to the middle of the cell.<ref name=Albertson2005/> In plants, this structure coalesces into a cell plate at the center of the [[phragmoplast]] and develops into a cell wall, separating the two nuclei. The phragmoplast is a microtubule structure typical for higher plants, whereas some green algae use a [[phycoplast]] microtubule array during cytokinesis.<ref name = \"Raven_2005\"/>{{rp|64\u20137, 328\u20139}} Each daughter cell has a complete copy of the genome of its parent cell. The end of cytokinesis marks the end of the M-phase.\n\nThere are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei. The most notable occurrence of this is among the [[fungus|fungi]], [[slime mold]]s, and coenocytic algae, but the phenomenon is found in various other organisms. Even in animals, cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] embryonic development.<ref name=Lilly2005/>\n\n== Function ==\nMitosis \"[[function (biology)|function]]\" or significance relies on the maintenance of the chromosomal set; each cell formed receives chromosomes that are alike in composition and equal in number to the chromosomes of the parent cell.\n\nMitosis occurs in the following circumstances:\n*Development and growth: The number of cells within an organism increases by mitosis. This is the basis of the development of a multicellular body from a single cell, i.e., [[zygote]] and also the basis of the growth of a [[multicellular]] body.\n*Cell replacement: In some parts of the body, e.g. skin and digestive tract, cells are constantly sloughed off and replaced by new ones. New cells are formed by mitosis and so are exact copies of the cells being replaced. In like manner, [[red blood cells]] have a short lifespan (only about 4 months) and new RBCs are formed by mitosis.\n*Regeneration: Some organisms can regenerate body parts. The production of new cells in such instances is achieved by mitosis. For example, [[starfish]] regenerate lost arms through mitosis.\n*Asexual reproduction: Some organisms produce genetically similar offspring through [[asexual reproduction]]. For example, the [[hydra (genus)|hydra]] reproduces asexually by budding. The cells at the surface of hydra undergo mitosis and form a mass called a bud. Mitosis continues in the cells of the bud and this grows into a new individual. The same division happens during asexual reproduction or [[vegetative propagation]] in plants.\n\n==Variations==\n=== Forms of mitosis ===\nThe mitosis process in the cells of eukaryotic organisms follow a similar pattern, but with variations in three main details. \"Closed\" and \"open\" mitosis can be distinguished on the basis of [[nuclear envelope]] remaining intact or breaking down. An intermediate form with partial degradation of the nuclear envelope is called \"semiopen\" mitosis. With respesct to the symmetry of the [[spindle apparatus]] during metaphase, an approximately axially symmetric (centered) shape is called as \"orthomitosis\", distinguished from the eccentric spindles of \"pleuromitosis\", in which mitotic apparatus has bilateral symmetry. Finally, a third criterion is the location of the [[central spindle]] in case of closed pleuromitosis: \"extranuclear\" (spindle located in the cytoplasm) or \"intranuclear\" (in the nucleus).<ref name= \"Raikov1994\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Mitosis classification closed intranuclear pleuromitoses.svg|closed <br> intranuclear <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification closed extranuclear pleuromitoses.svg|closed <br> extranuclear <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification closed orthomitoses.svg|closed <br> orthomitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification semiopen pleuromitoses.svg|semiopen <br> pleuromitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification semiopen orthomitoses.svg|semiopen <br> orthomitosis\nFile:Mitosis classification open orthomitoses.svg|open <br> orthomitosis\n</gallery>\n\nNuclear division takes place only in cells of organisms of the [[eukaryotic]] domain, as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] have no nucleus.
