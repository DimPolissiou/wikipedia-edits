Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain [[subplot]]s that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Furthermore, a romance novel must have an \"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\"\n\nOthers, including Leslie Gelbman, a president of [[Berkley Books]], define the genre more simply, stating only that a romance must make the \"romantic relationship between the hero and the heroine ... the core of the book.\"<ref name=\"whatsinaname\">{{Cite news|title=What's in a Name? |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=July 2, 2001 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/index.asp?layout=article&articleId=CA91257&display=searchResults |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212184432/http://www.publishersweekly.com/index.asp?layout=article |archivedate=February 12, 2008 }}</ref> In general, romance novels reward characters who are good people and penalize those who are evil, and a couple who fights for and believes in their relationship will likely be rewarded with unconditional love.<ref name=\"rwadefn\" /> Bestselling author [[Nora Roberts]] sums up the genre, saying: \"The books are about the celebration of falling in love and emotion and commitment, and all of those things we really want.\"<ref name=\"gray\" /> [[Women's fiction]] (including \"[[chick lit]]\") is not directly a subcategory of the romance novel genre, because in women's fiction the heroine's relationship with her family or friends may be as important as her relationship with the hero.<ref name=\"whatsinaname\" />\n\nSome romance novel authors and readers believe the genre has additional restrictions, from plot considerations (such as the [[protagonists]]' meeting early on in the story), to avoiding themes (such as [[adultery]]). Other disagreements have centered on the firm requirement for a happy ending; some readers admit stories without a happy ending, if the focus of the story is on the [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] between the two main characters (e.g., ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''). While the majority of romance novels meet the stricter criteria, there are also many books widely considered to be romance novels that deviate from these rules.

''Pamela'' was the first popular novel to be based on a courtship as told from the perspective of the heroine. Unlike many of the novels of the time, ''Pamela'' had a happy ending, when after Mr. B attempts unsuccessfully to seduce and rape Pamela multiple times, he eventually rewards her virtue by sincerely proposing an equitable marriage to her. The book was one of the first bestsellers, with five editions printed in the first eleven months of release.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 63, 64, 66</ref>\n\n[[Jane Austen]] is an important influence on romance [[genre fiction]], and ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', published in 1813, has been called \"the best romance novel ever written.\"<ref>Regis (2003), p 75.</ref> In the early part of the [[Victorian era]], the [[Bront\u00eb|Bront\u00eb sisters]], like Austen, wrote [[literary fiction]] that influenced later popular fiction. [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] in ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', published in 1847, introduced the orphaned heroine. Bront\u00eb's love romance incorporates elements of both the [[Gothic fiction|gothic novel]] and [[Elizabethan drama]], and  \"demonstrate[s] the flexibility of the romance novel form.\"<ref>Regis (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\nWhile the literary fiction romance continued to develop in the 20th century, the new subgenre of genre fiction, which first developed in the 19th century, started to become more popular after the [[First World War]]. In 1919, [[E.M. Hull]]'s novel ''[[The Sheik (novel)|The Sheik]]'' was published in the [[United Kingdom]]. The novel, which became hugely popular, was adapted into a [[The Sheik (film)|movie]] (1921), which established star [[Rudolph Valentino]] as the top male actor of the time. The hero of this book was an iconic [[alpha male]] who kidnapped the heroine and won her admiration through his forceful actions. The novel was one of the first modern works to introduce the [[rape fantasy]], a theme explored in Samuel Richardson's ''Pamela'' (1740). Although women were gaining more independence in life, publishers believed that readers would only accept premarital sex in the context of rape. In this novel and those that followed, the rape was depicted as more of a fantasy; the heroine is rarely if ever shown experiencing terror, stress, or trauma as a result.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 115\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe popular, mass market version of the [[historical novel|historical romance]], which [[Walter Scott]] developed in the early 19th century, is seen as beginning in 1921, when [[Georgette Heyer]] published ''The Black Moth''. This is set in 1751, but many of Heyer's novels were inspired by Jane Austen's novels and are set around the time Austen lived, in the later [[Regency period]]. Because Heyer's romances are set more than 100 years earlier, she includes carefully researched historical detail to help her readers understand the period.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 125-126.</ref> Unlike other popular love-romance novels of the time, Heyer's novels used the setting as a major plot device. Her characters often exhibit twentieth century sensibilities, and more conventional characters in the novels point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 127.</ref> Heyer was a prolific author, and wrote one to two historical romance novels per year until her death in 1974.<ref>Regis (2003), p 125.</ref>\n\n===Rise of the category romance===\nIn the 1930s, the British publishers [[Mills & Boon]] began releasing hardback romance novels. The books were sold through weekly two-penny libraries and were known as \"the books in brown\" for their brown binding. In the 1950s, the company began offering the books for sale through newsagents across the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"mandb\">{{cite web|title=Mills & Boon - Our History|url=http://www.millsandboon.co.uk/cgi-bin/millsandboon.filereader?461262c700a12d24273f58d0dc9e068f+EN/catalogs/1124|publisher=Harlequin Mills and Boon|accessdate=July 19, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013164823/http://millsandboon.co.uk/cgi-bin/millsandboon.filereader?461262c700a12d24273f58d0dc9e068f+EN%2Fcatalogs%2F1124|archivedate=October 13, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nA Canadian company, [[Harlequin Enterprises]], began distributing in North America in 1957 the category romances published by Mills & Boon.<ref name=\"Thurston 1987, p. 42\">Thurston (1987), p. 42.</ref> Mary Bonneycastle, wife of Harlequin founder Richard Bonneycastle, and her daughter, Judy Burgess, exercised editorial control over which Mills & Boon novels Harlequin reprinted. They had a \"decency code,\" and rejected more sexually explicit material that Mills and Boon submitted for reprinting. Realizing that the genre was popular, Richard Bonneycastle finally decided to read a romance novel. He chose one of the more explicit novels and enjoyed it. On his orders, the company conducted a market test with the novel he had read and discovered that it outsold a similar, tamer novel.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 185</ref> Overall, the novels were short and formulaic, featuring heroines who were sweet, compassionate, pure and innocent. The few heroines who worked did so in traditional female jobs, including as [[nurse]]s, [[governess]]es and [[secretary|secretaries]]. Intimacy in the novels never extended beyond a chaste kiss between the protagonists.<ref name=\"Thurston 1987, p. 42\"/>\n\nOn October 1, 1971, Harlequin purchased Mills & Boon. By this point, the romance novel genre \"had been popularized and distributed widely to an enthusiastic audience\" in [[Great Britain]]. In an attempt to duplicate Mills & Boon's success in North America, Harlequin improved their distribution and marketing system.<ref name=\"Regis 2003, p. 156\">Regis (2003), p. 156.</ref> By choosing to sell their books \"where the women are,\" they allowed many mass-market merchandisers and even supermarkets to sell the books, all of which were exactly 192 pages.

The women were [[virgins]], while the men were not, and both members of the couple were described as beautiful.<ref>Thurston, p 75.</ref>\n\n===Category romance adapts===\nCategory romance lines were slower to react to some of the changes that had swept the historical romance subgenre. Despite the fact that the former Mills & Boon lines were now owned by a [[North America]]n company, the lines did not have any American writers until 1975, when Harlequin purchased a novel by [[Janet Dailey]].<ref>Thurston (1987), pp. 46-47.</ref><ref>Regis (2003), pp. 155\u2013156</ref> Dailey's novels provided the romance genre's \"first look at heroines, heroes and courtships that take place in America, with American sensibilities, assumptions, history, and most of all, settings.\"<ref>Regis (2003), p. 159.</ref> Harlequin was unsure how the market would react to this new type of romance, and was unwilling to fully embrace it. In the late 1970s, a Harlequin editor rejected a manuscript by [[Nora Roberts]], who has since become the top-selling romance author, because \"they already had their American writer.\"<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 158, 183, 184.</ref>\n\nHarlequin sold almost $70&nbsp;million of its paperback romances in 1979 through 100,000 supermarkets and other stores, giving the company almost 10% of the market for paperback books. That year the company began distributing its own books in the United States instead of through [[Simon & Schuster]]'s [[Pocket Books]]. In 1980 Simon & Schuster formed Silhouette Books to publish its own romance novels, beginning what ''The New York Times'' called \"perhaps the most bitter war in American book publishing history.\"<ref name=\"walters19801012\">{{cite news | title=Paperback Talk | work=The New York Times | date=October 12, 1980 | author=Walters, Ray | pages=A47}}</ref> The company sought to take advantage of the untapped talent of the American writers.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 156, 159.</ref> They published several lines of category romance, and encouraged their writers to create stronger heroines and less dominant heroes.

Despite the acquisition, Silhouette continued to retain editorial control and to publish various lines under their own imprint.<ref name=\"Regis 2003, p. 156\"/>\n\nHarlequin had also failed to adapt quickly to the signs that readers appreciated novels with more explicit sex scenes, and in 1980, several publishers entered the category romance market to fill that gap. That year, Dell launched their Candlelight Ecstasy line with [[Amii Lorin]]'s ''The Tawny Gold Man'', becoming the first line to waive the requirement that heroines be virgins. By the end of 1983 sales for the Candlelight Ecstasy line totaled $30&nbsp;million.

Sometimes the larger culture is aware of the magical in its midst; sometimes it is not. Some paranormal romances focus less on the specifics of their [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate worlds]] than do traditional science fiction or fantasy novels, keeping the attention strongly on the underlying romance.<ref name=\"marble\"/> Others develop the [[Alternative universe (fan fiction)|alternate reality]] meticulously, combining well-planned magical systems and inhuman cultures with contemporary reality.\n\n===Science fiction romance===\nThese books (time travel, fantasy, science fiction, and futuristic) blend romance with fantasy or science fiction, and they often overlap the paranormal subgenre. While exploring their alternate worlds, they also offer a fully developed romance. The sensuality level in these novels varies from chaste to very sexy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grant|2007|p=230}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, many publishers have included futuristic, fantasy, and science-fiction romances in their contemporary series lines (for example, Harlequin Temptation, Harlequin Superromance, Silhouette Special Edition). Today these romances are published by most major publishers, including Berkley Books, Harlequin's LUNA and MIRA, Pocket Books, Kensington Books, Dorchester Publishing, Avon Books, and NAL. The e-Book publisher Ellora's Cave has published many erotic romances with fantasy themes and other-worldly heroes and heroines.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grant|2007|p=231}}</ref>\n\nThere is overlap in these subgenres. [[Steampunk]] is science fiction mixed with alternate history which takes place during the Victorian era. It mixes historical elements with technology (think of the television series ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (1965\u20131969)). Authors to check out include [[M. K. Hobson]] and Gail Dayton.<ref>{{harvtxt|Palmquist|2012|p=68}}</ref>\n\nThe first futuristic romance to be marketed by a mainstream romance publisher, [[Jayne Ann Krentz]]'s ''Sweet Starfire'', was published in 1986 and was a \"classic road trip romance\" that just happened to be set in a separate galaxy.<ref name=\"gelsomino\"/> This genre has become more popular since 2000. Krentz attributes the popularity of this romance genre to the fact that the novels \"are, at heart, classic historical romances that just happen to be set on other worlds.\"<ref name=\"gelsomino\"/>\n\n===Fantasy romance===\n{{Main|Romantic fantasy}}\n\nFantasy romance, also known as romantic fantasy, is a [[Genre|subgenre]] of [[fantasy fiction]], describing a fantasy story using many of the elements and conventions of the romance genre. Romantic fantasy has been published by both fantasy and romance lines, with some publishers distinguishing between \"fantasy romance\" being more like a contemporary fantasy novel with romantic elements, and \"romantic fantasy\" with more emphasis on the romance elements of the story.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://web.utk.edu/~wrobinso/590_lec_fan.html\n| title=A Few Thoughts on the Fantasy Genre\n| author=William C.

In most, the heroine is from the present day and travels into the past to meet the hero. In a smaller subset of these novels, the hero, who lives in the past, travels forward into his future to meet the heroine. A successful time-travel romance must have the characters react logically to their experience and should investigate some of the differences, both physical and mental, between the world the character normally inhabits and the one where they landed. Some writers end their novels with the protagonists trapped in different time periods and unable to be together\u2014to the displeasure of many readers of the genre.<ref name=\"timetravel\">{{cite web|last=Marble|first=Anne M.|title=Writing Time Travel Romances|publisher=Writing-world.Com|date=September 2002|url=http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble05.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626181045/http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble05.shtml |archivedate = June 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Inspirational romance===\nInspirational romance, as the market exists today, combines explicitly [[Christian fiction|Christian]] themes with the development of a romantic relationship.<ref name=\"rwasub\"/> In 2004, 167 novels were published in the inspirational romance subgenre.<ref name=\"rwastat\"/> These novels typically do not include gratuitous violence or swearing, and the central courtship is chaste. Sex, if it is present at all, occurs after marriage and is not explicitly detailed.

The ENCANTO novels were originally released in two ways - a bilingual Spanish/English version and a Spanish-only version. Two novels were published every month until late 2001, when the line went into hiatus. Despite the demise of the line, several of the ENCANTO authors have continued writing novels with Latino protagonists, namely Sylvia Mendoza, Tracy Montoya, Caridad Pineiro, Berta Platas, Lara Rios and Lynda Sandoval.\n\nAlthough romance novels featuring African-Americans and Hispanic protagonists are becoming more popular, those featuring Asian or Asian-American characters are rare. Author [[Tess Gerritsen]] believes this is due to the fact that there are fewer Asian-American women who read romances: \"We read romances because we want to feel good about love...in order to do that, the reader must identify with the heroine.\"<ref name=\"nguyen\">{{Cite news   | last = Nguyen  | first = Lan| title = The Color of Romance | newspaper =Audrey Magazine  | date = September 2005  | url =http://www.audreymagazine.com/Sep2005/Living03.asp| accessdate = April 30, 2007   | format = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406210723/http://www.audreymagazine.com/Sep2005/Living03.asp |archivedate = April 6, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Erotic romance===\n{{Main|Erotic romance novels}}\n\nErotic romance is a blend of romance and [[erotica]]. Erotic romance novels are characterized by strong sexual content, but can contain elements of any of the other romance subgenres. Erotic romance novels tend to use more frank language, avoiding many of the euphemisms used in books with milder content. These novels also usually include more sex scenes, often focusing more on the sex act rather than being a more traditional love scene, and may include more unusual positions or acts.<ref name=\"marbleerotic\"/> Despite a greater emphasis on the sex scenes, however, erotic romance is distinguishable from traditional [[pornography]]. Pornography concentrates on the sex acts, but erotic novels include well-developed characters and a plot that could exist without the sex acts.<ref name=\"cooperposey\">{{cite web|last=Cooper-Posey|first=Tracy|title=An End to Euphemisms: Is Erotica Right for You?|publisher=Writing-world.Com|year=2004|url=http://www.writing-world.com/romance/romantica.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nErotic romances' lengths run from short stories to single-title novels. Some of these are published as part of a category, such as Harlequin Blaze, while others are published as part of an anthology and are only [[novella]] length. Even single-title erotic romances may be as short as a novella, however.<ref name=\"marbleerotic\">{{cite web|last=Marble|first=Anne M.|title=Getting to Know the Erotic Romance Field|publisher=Writing-World.Com|date=January 2005|url=http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble23.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211135434/http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble23.shtml |archivedate = February 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\nMany of the publishers of erotic romance are either [[small press]] publishers or [[electronic book]] publishers. Writers often have more leeway as to what types of erotic acts can be included when working with an electronic publisher than they would have when working with a print publisher.<ref name=marbleerotic/> The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly, leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books.<ref name=\"avonred\">{{cite web | title = Avon Red | publisher = [[Avon (publishers)]] | url =http://www.harpercollins.com/imprints/index.aspx?imprintid=518015| accessdate = May 11, 2008}}</ref> Some subjects are still considered taboo, even with erotic romance. Themes such as pedophilia, incest, and bestiality are discouraged by all publishers.<ref name=\"marbleerotic\"/>\n\nThe market for erotic romances has grown rapidly. [[Ellora's Cave]], an electronic publisher that focuses on erotic romance, became the first electronic publisher recognized by the Romance Writers of America as a legitimate publisher.<ref name=\"cooperposey\"/>\n\n===Chick lit===\nChick lit or chick literature is named after the readership it attracts (women in their twenties and thirties), and it is said to be inspired by the 1996 novel ''Bridget Jones' Diary''. Some of the dominant themes of chick lit are a single woman's journey through career, high-powered work environment, personal life, relationships, motherhood, parenting, etc. Some subcategories of this genre are baby lit and mummy lit <ref>{{cite book |last1=Parv |first1=Valerie |title=The Art of Romance Writing |date=2004 |publisher=Allen & Unwin |location=Austrailia |isbn=1741143748 |page=8 |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n==Markets==\n\n===North America===\nThe romance fiction market \"has been impervious to the overall economic recession, with faithful readers spending up to $40 a month\" on romance novels in 1982.<ref name=\"nyt1982\">\n{{Cite news  | title = Expanding Romance Market  | newspaper = [[New York Times]]  | date =  March 8, 1982  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/08/business/expanding-romance-market.html |accessdate = May 24, 2007}}</ref>  That year, paperback romances totaled $300&nbsp;million in sales, and the total audience was estimated at 20&nbsp;million readers.

The genre boomed in the 1980s, with the addition of many different categories of romance and an increased number of single-title romances, but popular authors started pushing the boundaries of both the genre and plot, as well as creating more contemporary characters.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn North America, romance novels are the most popular literary genre, comprising almost 55% of all paperback books sold in 2004.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The genre is also popular in Europe and Australia, and romance novels appear in 90 languages.

Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain [[subplot]]s that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Furthermore, a romance novel must have an \"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\" \n\nOthers, including Leslie Gelbman, a president of [[Berkley Books]], define the genre more simply, stating only that a romance must make the \"romantic relationship between the hero and the heroine ... the core of the book.\"<ref name=\"whatsinaname\">{{Cite news|title=What's in a Name? |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=July 2, 2001 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/index.asp?layout=article&articleId=CA91257&display=searchResults |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212184432/http://www.publishersweekly.com/index.asp?layout=article |archivedate=February 12, 2008 }}</ref> In general, romance novels reward characters who are good people and penalize those who are evil, and a couple who fights for and believes in their relationship will likely be rewarded with unconditional love.<ref name=\"rwadefn\" /> Bestselling author [[Nora Roberts]] sums up the genre, saying: \"The books are about the celebration of falling in love and emotion and commitment, and all of those things we really want.\"<ref name=\"gray\" /> [[Women's fiction]] (including \"[[chick lit]]\") is not directly a subcategory of the romance novel genre, because in women's fiction the heroine's relationship with her family or friends may be as important as her relationship with the hero.<ref name=\"whatsinaname\" />\n\nSome romance novel authors and readers believe the genre has additional restrictions, from plot considerations (such as the [[protagonists]]' meeting early on in the story), to avoiding themes (such as [[adultery]]). Other disagreements have centered on the firm requirement for a happy ending; some readers admit stories without a happy ending, if the focus of the story is on the [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] between the two main characters (e.g., ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''). While the majority of romance novels meet the stricter criteria, there are also many books widely considered to be romance novels that deviate from these rules. Therefore, the general definition, as embraced by the RWA and publishers, includes only the focus on a developing romantic relationship and an optimistic ending.<ref name=\"crusiedefn\">{{Cite web |first=Jennifer |last=Crusie |author-link=Jennifer Crusie |title=I Know What It Is When I Read It: Defining the Romance Genre |url=http://www.jennycrusie.com/essays/definingromancegenre.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502024919/http://www.jennycrusie.com/essays/definingromancegenre.php |archive-date=2006-05-02 |date=March 2000 |publisher=PAN |website=Romance Writer's Report}}</ref><ref name=\"dorchester\"/> [[Escapism]] is important; an Avon executive observed that \"The phone never rings, the baby never cries and the rent's never overdue in romances.\"{{r|nyt1982}}\n\nAs long as a romance novel meets those twin criteria, it can be set in any time period and in any location.

''Pamela'' was the first popular novel to be based on a courtship as told from the perspective of the heroine. Unlike many of the novels of the time, ''Pamela'' had a happy ending, when after Mr. B attempts unsuccessfully to seduce and rape Pamela multiple times, he eventually rewards her virtue by sincerely proposing an equitable marriage to her. The book was one of the first bestsellers, with five editions printed in the first eleven months of release.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 63, 64, 66</ref>\n\n[[Jane Austen]] is an important influence on romance [[genre fiction]], and ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', published in 1813, has been called \"the best romance novel ever written.\"<ref>Regis (2003), p 75.</ref> In the early part of the [[Victorian era]], the [[Bront\u00eb|Bront\u00eb sisters]], like Austen, wrote [[literary fiction]] that influenced later popular fiction. [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] in ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', published in 1847, introduced the orphaned heroine. Bront\u00eb's love romance incorporates elements of both the [[Gothic fiction|gothic novel]] and [[Elizabethan drama]], and  \"demonstrate[s] the flexibility of the romance novel form.\"<ref>Regis (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\nWhile the literary fiction romance continued to develop in the 20th century, the new subgenre of genre fiction, which first developed in the 19th century, started to become more popular after the [[First World War]]. In 1919, [[E.M. Hull]]'s novel ''[[The Sheik (novel)|The Sheik]]'' was published in the [[United Kingdom]]. The novel, which became hugely popular, was adapted into a [[The Sheik (film)|movie]] (1921), which established star [[Rudolph Valentino]] as the top male actor of the time. The hero of this book was an iconic [[alpha male]] who kidnapped the heroine and won her admiration through his forceful actions. The novel was one of the first modern works to introduce the [[rape fantasy]], a theme explored in Samuel Richardson's ''Pamela'' (1740). Although women were gaining more independence in life, publishers believed that readers would only accept premarital sex in the context of rape. In this novel and those that followed, the rape was depicted as more of a fantasy; the heroine is rarely if ever shown experiencing terror, stress, or trauma as a result.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 115\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe popular, mass market version of the [[historical novel|historical romance]], which [[Walter Scott]] developed in the early 19th century, is seen as beginning in 1921, when [[Georgette Heyer]] published ''The Black Moth''. This is set in 1751, but many of Heyer's novels were inspired by Jane Austen's novels and are set around the time Austen lived, in the later [[Regency period]]. Because Heyer's romances are set more than 100 years earlier, she includes carefully researched historical detail to help her readers understand the period.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 125-126.</ref> Unlike other popular love-romance novels of the time, Heyer's novels used the setting as a major plot device. Her characters often exhibit twentieth century sensibilities, and more conventional characters in the novels point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 127.</ref> Heyer was a prolific author, and wrote one to two historical romance novels per year until her death in 1974.<ref>Regis (2003), p 125.</ref>\n\n===Rise of the category romance===\nIn the 1930s, the British publishers [[Mills & Boon]] began releasing hardback romance novels. The books were sold through weekly two-penny libraries and were known as \"the books in brown\" for their brown binding. In the 1950s, the company began offering the books for sale through newsagents across the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"mandb\">{{cite web|title=Mills & Boon - Our History|url=http://www.millsandboon.co.uk/cgi-bin/millsandboon.filereader?461262c700a12d24273f58d0dc9e068f+EN/catalogs/1124|publisher=Harlequin Mills and Boon|accessdate=July 19, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013164823/http://millsandboon.co.uk/cgi-bin/millsandboon.filereader?461262c700a12d24273f58d0dc9e068f+EN%2Fcatalogs%2F1124|archivedate=October 13, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nA Canadian company, [[Harlequin Enterprises]], began distributing in North America in 1957 the category romances published by Mills & Boon.<ref name=\"Thurston 1987, p. 42\">Thurston (1987), p. 42.</ref> Mary Bonneycastle, wife of Harlequin founder Richard Bonneycastle, and her daughter, Judy Burgess, exercised editorial control over which Mills & Boon novels Harlequin reprinted. They had a \"decency code,\" and rejected more sexually explicit material that Mills and Boon submitted for reprinting. Realizing that the genre was popular, Richard Bonneycastle finally decided to read a romance novel. He chose one of the more explicit novels and enjoyed it. On his orders, the company conducted a market test with the novel he had read and discovered that it outsold a similar, tamer novel.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 185</ref> Overall, the novels were short and formulaic, featuring heroines who were sweet, compassionate, pure and innocent. The few heroines who worked did so in traditional female jobs, including as [[nurse]]s, [[governess]]es and [[secretary|secretaries]]. Intimacy in the novels never extended beyond a chaste kiss between the protagonists.<ref name=\"Thurston 1987, p. 42\"/>\n\nOn October 1, 1971, Harlequin purchased Mills & Boon. By this point, the romance novel genre \"had been popularized and distributed widely to an enthusiastic audience\" in [[Great Britain]]. In an attempt to duplicate Mills & Boon's success in North America, Harlequin improved their distribution and marketing system.<ref name=\"Regis 2003, p. 156\">Regis (2003), p. 156.</ref> By choosing to sell their books \"where the women are,\" they allowed many mass-market merchandisers and even supermarkets to sell the books, all of which were exactly 192 pages.

By 1975, ''Publishers Weekly'' had reported that the \"Avon originals\" had sold a combined {{nowrap|8 million copies}}.<ref name=\"thurston4748\">Thurston, pp 47-48.</ref> The following year over 150 historical romance novels, many of them paperback originals, were published, selling over {{nowrap|40 million copies}}.<ref name=\"darrach\"/>\n\nThe success of these novels prompted a new style of writing romance, concentrating primarily on historical fiction tracking the monogamous relationship between a helpless heroine and the hero who rescued her, even if he had been the one to place her in danger.<ref name=\"whitepamela\">{{Cite news  | last = White  | first = Pamela  | title = Romancing Society  | newspaper = Boulder Weekly  | date = August 15, 2002  | url = http://www.boulderweekly.com/archive/081502/coverstory.html  | accessdate = April 23, 2007  | url-status = dead  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070904133155/http://www.boulderweekly.com/archive/081502/coverstory.html  | archivedate = September 4, 2007  | df = mdy-all  }}</ref> The covers of these novels tended to feature scantily clad women being grabbed by the hero, and caused the novels to be referred to as '''bodice rippers'''.<ref name=\"athitakis\"/> A ''[[Wall St. Journal]]'' article in 1980 referred to these bodice rippers as \"publishing's answer to the Big Mac: They are juicy, cheap, predictable, and devoured in stupefying quantities by legions of loyal fans.\"<ref>Thurston, p 67.</ref> The term ''bodice ripper'' is now considered offensive to many in the romance industry.<ref name=\"athitakis\"/>\n\nIn this new style of historical romance, heroines were independent and strong-willed and were often paired with heroes who evolved into caring and compassionate men who truly admired the women they loved.<ref>Thurston, p 72.</ref> This was in contrast to the contemporary romances published during this time, which were often characterized by weak females who fell in love with overbearing [[alpha male]]s. <ref name=\"grossman\"/> Although these heroines had active roles in the plot, they were \"passive in relationships with the heroes.\"<ref name=\"crusie\"/> Across the genre, heroines during this time were usually aged 16\u201321, with the heroes slightly older, usually around 30. The women were [[virgins]], while the men were not, and both members of the couple were described as beautiful.<ref>Thurston, p 75.</ref>\n\n===Category romance adapts===\nCategory romance lines were slower to react to some of the changes that had swept the historical romance subgenre. Despite the fact that the former Mills & Boon lines were now owned by a [[North America]]n company, the lines did not have any American writers until 1975, when Harlequin purchased a novel by [[Janet Dailey]].<ref>Thurston (1987), pp. 46-47.</ref><ref>Regis (2003), pp. 155\u2013156</ref> Dailey's novels provided the romance genre's \"first look at heroines, heroes and courtships that take place in America, with American sensibilities, assumptions, history, and most of all, settings.\"<ref>Regis (2003), p. 159.</ref> Harlequin was unsure how the market would react to this new type of romance, and was unwilling to fully embrace it. In the late 1970s, a Harlequin editor rejected a manuscript by [[Nora Roberts]], who has since become the top-selling romance author, because \"they already had their American writer.\"<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 158, 183, 184.</ref>\n\nHarlequin sold almost $70 million of its paperback romances in 1979 through 100,000 supermarkets and other stores, giving the company almost 10% of the market for paperback books. That year the company began distributing its own books in the United States instead of through [[Simon & Schuster]]'s [[Pocket Books]]. In 1980 Simon & Schuster formed Silhouette Books to publish its own romance novels, beginning what ''The New York Times'' called \"perhaps the most bitter war in American book publishing history.\"<ref name=\"walters19801012\">{{cite news | title=Paperback Talk | work=The New York Times | date=October 12, 1980 | author=Walters, Ray | pages=A47}}</ref> The company sought to take advantage of the untapped talent of the American writers.<ref>Regis (2003), pp. 156, 159.</ref> They published several lines of category romance, and encouraged their writers to create stronger heroines and less dominant heroes. Authors were also expected to address contemporary issues where appropriate.<ref>Regis (2003), p. 184</ref> Silhouette soon saw their market share expand, and in 1984, Harlequin acquired them. Despite the acquisition, Silhouette continued to retain editorial control and to publish various lines under their own imprint.<ref name=\"Regis 2003, p. 156\"/>\n\nHarlequin had also failed to adapt quickly to the signs that readers appreciated novels with more explicit sex scenes, and in 1980, several publishers entered the category romance market to fill that gap. That year, Dell launched their Candlelight Ecstasy line with [[Amii Lorin]]'s ''The Tawny Gold Man'', becoming the first line to waive the requirement that heroines be virgins. By the end of 1983 sales for the Candlelight Ecstasy line totaled $30 million. Silhoeutte also launched similar lines, Desire (sexually explicit) and Special Edition (sexually explicit and longer stories, up to 250 pages), each of which had a 90\u2013100% sellout rate each month.<ref name=\"barret\">{{Cite news  | last =Barrett  | first =Mary Ellin  | title =Pure as the Driven Slush  | newspaper =Family Weekly  | date =January 9, 1983  | url =http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%203.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate =May 24, 2007  | url-status =dead  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004649/http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%203.pdf  | archivedate =September 27, 2007  | df =mdy-all  }}</ref>\n\nA 1982 survey of romance readers confirmed that the new styles of writing were attracting new readers to the genre. 35% of the readers surveyed had begun reading romances after 1977. An additional 31% of those surveyed had been readers for between 6 and 10 years, meaning they had become interested in the genre after 1972, when Woodiwiss's revolutionary novel was published.

This tight market caused a proportionate decrease in the quality of the novels that were being released. By 1984, the market was saturated with category lines and readers had begun to complain of redundancy in plots.<ref>Thurston, p 188.</ref> The following year, the \"dampening effect of the high level of redundancy associated with series romances was evident in the decreased number of titles being read per month.\"<ref>Thurston, p 128.</ref> Harlequin's return rate, which had been less than 25% in 1978, when it was the primary provider of category romance, swelled to 60%.<ref>Thurston, p 190.</ref>\n\n===Further change===\nThe genre continued to expand in the mid-to-late 1980s, as publishers realized that the more popular authors were often those who stretched the boundaries of the genre.

Heroes also changed, with some authors veering towards a more sensitive man.

However, the focus here is on the [[mass-market]] genre.\n\nThis subgenre includes a wide variety of other subgenres, including [[Regency romance]]. Mass-market historical romance novels are rarely published in hardcover, with fewer than 15 receiving that status each year, less than one-fifth of the number of contemporary romance novels published in that format. Because historical romances are primarily published in mass-market format, their fortunes are tied to a certain extent to the mass-market trends. Booksellers and large merchandisers now sell fewer mass market paperbacks, preferring trade paperbacks or hardcovers, which prevents historical romances from being sold in some price clubs and other mass merchandise outlets.<ref name=\"dyer\"/>\n\nIn 2001, 778 mass-market historical romances were published, a 10-year high.

While exploring their alternate worlds, they also offer a fully developed romance. The sensuality level in these novels varies from chaste to very sexy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grant|2007|p=230}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, many publishers have included futuristic, fantasy, and science-fiction romances in their contemporary series lines (for example, Harlequin Temptation, Harlequin Superromance, Silhouette Special Edition). Today these romances are published by most major publishers, including Berkley Books, Harlequin's LUNA and MIRA, Pocket Books, Kensington Books, Dorchester Publishing, Avon Books, and NAL. The e-Book publisher Ellora's Cave has published many erotic romances with fantasy themes and other-worldly heroes and heroines.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grant|2007|p=231}}</ref>\n\nThere is overlap in these subgenres. [[Steampunk]] is science fiction mixed with alternate history which takes place during the Victorian era. It mixes historical elements with technology (think of the television series ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (1965\u20131969)). Authors to check out include [[M. K.

In a smaller subset of these novels, the hero, who lives in the past, travels forward into his future to meet the heroine. A successful time-travel romance must have the characters react logically to their experience and should investigate some of the differences, both physical and mental, between the world the character normally inhabits and the one where they landed.

Despite the demise of the line, several of the ENCANTO authors have continued writing novels with Latino protagonists, namely Sylvia Mendoza, Tracy Montoya, Caridad Pineiro, Berta Platas, Lara Rios and Lynda Sandoval.\n\nAlthough romance novels featuring African-Americans and Hispanic protagonists are becoming more popular, those featuring Asian or Asian-American characters are rare. Author [[Tess Gerritsen]] believes this is due to the fact that there are fewer Asian-American women who read romances: \"We read romances because we want to feel good about love...in order to do that, the reader must identify with the heroine.\"<ref name=\"nguyen\">{{Cite news   | last = Nguyen  | first = Lan| title = The Color of Romance | newspaper =Audrey Magazine  | date = September 2005  | url =http://www.audreymagazine.com/Sep2005/Living03.asp| accessdate = April 30, 2007   | format = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406210723/http://www.audreymagazine.com/Sep2005/Living03.asp |archivedate = April 6, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Erotic romance===\n{{Main article|Erotic romance novels}}\n\nErotic romance is a blend of romance and [[erotica]]. Erotic romance novels are characterized by strong sexual content, but can contain elements of any of the other romance subgenres. Erotic romance novels tend to use more frank language, avoiding many of the euphemisms used in books with milder content. These novels also usually include more sex scenes, often focusing more on the sex act rather than being a more traditional love scene, and may include more unusual positions or acts.<ref name=\"marbleerotic\"/> Despite a greater emphasis on the sex scenes, however, erotic romance is distinguishable from traditional [[pornography]]. Pornography concentrates on the sex acts, but erotic novels include well-developed characters and a plot that could exist without the sex acts.<ref name=\"cooperposey\">{{cite web|last=Cooper-Posey|first=Tracy|title=An End to Euphemisms: Is Erotica Right for You?|publisher=Writing-world.Com|year=2004|url=http://www.writing-world.com/romance/romantica.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nErotic romances' lengths run from short stories to single-title novels.

While this term can be used for any team in Gda\u0144sk it has historically this term has been used for games involving [[Gedania 1922 Gda\u0144sk|Gedania Gda\u0144sk]], [[Lechia Gda\u0144sk]] and [[Polonia Gda\u0144sk]], historically the three biggest teams in the city of [[Gda\u0144sk]]. Lechia Gda\u0144sk are both the most successful team in Gda\u0144sk as well as the most successful team in the derby. Through most of the derbies history the derby has been played in the second and third divisions, with more recent Gda\u0144sk Derbies being played in the regional divisions. There has never been a Gda\u0144sk Derby in the top division as Lechia Gda\u0144sk are currently the only team from Gda\u0144sk to have played in the [[Ekstraklasa]].\n\nThe first post-war football match in Gda\u0144sk was played by Milicyjny KS Pogo\u0144, playing against Soviet soldiers who were stationed in Gda\u0144sk at the time. The first recorded competitive post-war derby was between Lechia Gda\u0144sk and WKS 16 Dywizji on 9 September 1945 with Lechia winning the game 9-1. It is also the same two teams who hold the record for the biggest win in the derby, with Lechia winning away at WKS 16 Dywizji 13-0 on 30 September 1945. The record for the highest scoring game was contested between Lechia Gda\u0144sk and P\u0142omie\u0144 Gda\u0144sk on 9 December 1945, with the game finishing as an 11-4 win to Lechia. Lechia also holds the record for documented fixtures, having played in at least 69 Gda\u0144sk Derbies also holding the record for the most wins with 41. Polonia Gda\u0144sk hold the record for having the most draws and defeats in the derby.\n\nAt least 13 teams have played in the Gda\u0144sk Derby, with the derby having been played more than 100 times since 1945. The majority of the teams who featured in the derby in the 1940s only experienced short spells of playing in the league, most likely due to their sports clubs closing down or merging with other clubs. Gedania Gda\u0144sk, Lechia Gda\u0144sk and Polonia Gda\u0144sk are seen as the big three teams in the derby due to all three teams being created in 1945 and being among the few teams to not be dissolved which resulted in the teams playing each other often over the following decades. The only other two teams who are now able to play in the Gda\u0144sk Derby are [[KP Jaguar Gda\u0144sk|Jaguar Gda\u0144sk]] and [[Portowiec Gda\u0144sk]], both teams being formed after the other three and having had much lower levels of success in the leagues.\n\nLechia are considered the biggest team in Gda\u0144sk by some margin. This is due to them being the only team from Gda\u0144sk to play in the [[Ekstraklasa]] and having won the [[Polish Cup]] twice, most recently in 2019. Polonia would be seen as Gda\u0144sk's second biggest team due to the number of years they spent in the second and third divisions. In recent years however they have struggled in the lower divisions and fund themselves as one of the lowest ranked teams in Gda\u0144sk. Gedania have also struggled in recent years and have only seen success outside of the regional leagues during the 1945-51 period of their history. Portowiec has often only played in the regional leagues other than short spells in the third division during the 1970s and 1980s. The youngest team of those listed, Jaguar Gda\u0144sk, has slowly been rising up the leagues and has been involved in many Gda\u0144sk Derby's in recent years.\n\n==The historic big three==\n\nThe \"big three\" or the \"main three\" teams in the Gda\u0144sk Derby are [[Gedania 1922 Gda\u0144sk|Gedania Gda\u0144sk]], [[Lechia Gda\u0144sk]] and [[Polonia Gda\u0144sk]]. All three teams were founded in 1945 after the end of World War II, along with many other sports and football clubs in Gda\u0144sk. While the other teams were eventually closed down, these three teams have kept functioning to the present day. Each team has had their period of success, and times when they could be seen as the biggest team in Gda\u0144sk; Gedania during the early 1950s, Lechia during the 1940s, 1950s, 1980s, and since the turn of the century, and Polonia in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n===Gedania vs Lechia===\n\nBoth teams faced each other often in their early years, with the teams playing 9 times in the league in the first six years of their creations. After 1951, when Lechia were promoted to the top division, the teams did not face each other again until the 2003-04 season. This was due to Lechia having to restart from the lower tiers and passed Gedania on their way back up through the divisions. Since 2004 the teams have not faced each other competitively, with the regional cup game in 2004 currently being the last Gda\u0144sk derby between the two teams. A Gedania and Lechia game has never resulted in a draw with Lechia winning 9 and Gedania winning 3 of the 12 competitive games they have played in.\n\n===Lechia vs Polonia===\n\nLechia and Polonia did not play each other until 1967 after Lechia were relegated to the third tier, after which the two teams faced each other in 15 of the next 16 seasons, with the longest spell coming during 10 consecutive seasons of the teams playing in the same division. During this time the Lechia vs Polonia rivalry was at its highest. In contrast to Lechia and Gedania never drawing, Lechia and Polonia drew a third of their games against each other. Lechia and Polonia have not played each other competitively since 1983, a period of time when Lechia saw success winning back to back promotions, getting back to the [[Ekstraklasa]], and winning the [[Polish Cup]] while in the third tier, and the [[Polish SuperCup]] while also playing in European competitions the following season in the second tier.\n\nDespite the two teams not playing since 1983 their paths did cross again in 1998 when the two teams merged creating [[Lechia-Polonia Gda\u0144sk]]. Due to this merger Polonia dropped down to the fifth tier for the following season, with Lechia having to restart in the sixth tier in 2001 after it was evident that the merger team was dropping down the leagues after successive relegation's. While Lechia are now back in the top division Polonia have never recovered from their pre-merger times when they were competitive in the second and third tiers.\n\n===Gedania vs Polonia===\n\nAfter their first meeting in 1952 the two teams started to go in different directions. With Gedania being one of the biggest teams in Gda\u0144sk during the years after their formation, the team started to slip down into the lower divisions, in contrast Polonia often found themselves moving between the second and third divisions. It wasn't until Polonia had to restart in the lower divisions did the two teams meet regularly. From 2001-2011 the teams met 14 times in the league Gedania often edging out the games winning five to Polonias two. The two teams have not met competitively since 2011.\n\n==Big three clubs head-to-head==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=4| Comparison of Gedania, Lechia and Polonia\n|-\n| ||bgcolor=blue |<span style=\"color:white\">Gedania</span>||bgcolor=green |<span style=\"color:white\">Lechia</span>||bgcolor=red |<span style=\"color:white\">Polonia</span>\n|-\n|Year of establishment||1945<ref>The current Gedania Gda\u0144sk was founded in 1945.

While this term can be used for any team in Gda\u0144sk it has historically this term has been used for games involving [[Gedania 1922 Gda\u0144sk|Gedania Gda\u0144sk]], [[Lechia Gda\u0144sk]] and [[Polonia Gda\u0144sk]], historically the three biggest teams in the city of [[Gda\u0144sk]]. Lechia Gda\u0144sk are both the most successful team in Gda\u0144sk as well as the most successful team in the derby. Through most of the derbies history the derby has been played in the second and third divisions, with more recent Gda\u0144sk Derbies being played in the regional divisions. There has never been a Gda\u0144sk Derby in the top division as Lechia Gda\u0144sk are currently the only team from Gda\u0144sk to have played in the [[Ekstraklasa]].\n\nThe first post-war football match in Gda\u0144sk was played by Milicyjny KS Pogo\u0144, playing against Soviet soldiers who were stationed in Gda\u0144sk at the time. The first recorded competitive post-war derby was between Lechia Gda\u0144sk and WKS 16 Dywizji on 9 September 1945 with Lechia winning the game 9-1. It is also the same two teams who hold the record for the biggest win in the derby, with Lechia winning away at WKS 16 Dywizji 13-0 on 30 September 1945. The record for the highest scoring game was contested between Lechia Gda\u0144sk and P\u0142omie\u0144 Gda\u0144sk on 9 December 1945, with the game finishing as a 11-4 win to Lechia. Lechia also holds the record for documented fixtures, having played in at least 69 Gda\u0144sk Derbies also holding the record for the most wins with 41. Polonia Gda\u0144sk hold the record for having the most draws and defeats in the derby.\n\nAt least 13 teams have played in the Gda\u0144sk Derby, with the derby having been played more than 100 times since 1945. The majority of the teams who featured in the derby in the 1940s only experienced short spells of playing in the league, most likely due to their sports clubs closing down or merging with other clubs. Gedania Gda\u0144sk, Lechia Gda\u0144sk and Polonia Gda\u0144sk are seen as the big three teams in the derby due to all three teams being created in 1945 and being among the few teams to not be dissolved which resulted in the teams playing each other often over the following decades. The only other two teams who are now able to play in the Gda\u0144sk Derby are [[KP Jaguar Gda\u0144sk|Jaguar Gda\u0144sk]] and [[Portowiec Gda\u0144sk]], both teams being formed after the other three and having had much lower levels of success in the leagues.\n\nLechia are considered the biggest team in Gda\u0144sk by some margin. This is due to them being the only team from Gda\u0144sk to play in the [[Ekstraklasa]] and having won the [[Polish Cup]] twice, most recently in 2019. Polonia would be seen as Gda\u0144sk's second biggest team due to the number of years they spent in the second and third divisions. In recent years however they have struggled in the lower divisions and fund themselves as one of the lowest ranked teams in Gda\u0144sk. Gedania have also struggled in recent years and have only seen success outside of the regional leagues during the 1945-51 period of their history. Portowiec has often only played in the regional leagues other than short spells in the third division during the 1970s and 1980s. The youngest team of those listed, Jaguar Gda\u0144sk, has slowly been rising up the leagues and has been involved in many Gda\u0144sk Derby's in recent years.\n\n==The historic big three==\n\nThe \"big three\" or the \"main three\" teams in the Gda\u0144sk Derby are [[Gedania 1922 Gda\u0144sk|Gedania Gda\u0144sk]], [[Lechia Gda\u0144sk]] and [[Polonia Gda\u0144sk]]. All three teams were founded in 1945 after the end of World War II, along with many other sports and football clubs in Gda\u0144sk. While the other teams were eventually closed down, these three teams have kept functioning to the present day. Each team has had their period of success, and times when they could be seen as the biggest team in Gda\u0144sk; Gedania during the early 1950s, Lechia during the 1940s, 1950s, 1980s, and since the turn of the century, and Polonia in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n===Gedania vs Lechia===\n\nBoth teams faced each other often in their early years, with the teams playing 9 times in the league in the first six years of their creations. After 1951, when Lechia were promoted to the top division, the teams did not face each other again until the 2003-04 season. This was due to Lechia having to restart from the lower tiers and passed Gedania on their way back up through the divisions. Since 2004 the teams have not faced each other competitively, with the regional cup game in 2004 currently being the last Gda\u0144sk derby between the two teams. A Gedania and Lechia game has never resulted in a draw with Lechia winning 9 and Gedania winning 3 of the 12 competitive games they have played in.\n\n===Lechia vs Polonia===\n\nLechia and Polonia did not play each other until 1967 after Lechia were relegated to the third tier, after which the two teams faced each other in 15 of the next 16 seasons, with the longest spell coming during 10 consecutive seasons of the teams playing in the same division. During this time the Lechia vs Polonia rivalry was at its highest. In contrast to Lechia and Gedania never drawing, Lechia and Polonia drew a third of their games against each other. Lechia and Polonia have not played each other competitively since 1983, a period of time when Lechia saw success winning back to back promotions, getting back to the [[Ekstraklasa]], and winning the [[Polish Cup]] while in the third tier, and the [[Polish SuperCup]] while also playing in European competitions the following season in the second tier. \n\nDespite the two teams not playing since 1983 their paths did cross again in 1998 when the two teams merged creating [[Lechia-Polonia Gda\u0144sk]]. Due to this merger Polonia dropped down to the fifth tier for the following season, with Lechia having to restart in the sixth tier in 2001 after it was evident that the merger team was dropping down the leagues after successive relegation's. While Lechia are now back in the top division Polonia have never recovered from their pre-merger times when they were competitive in the second and third tiers.\n\n===Gedania vs Polonia===\n\nAfter their first meeting in 1952 the two teams started to go in different directions. With Gedania being one of the biggest teams in Gda\u0144sk during the years after their formation, the team started to slip down into the lower divisions, in contrast Polonia often found themselves moving between the second and third divisions. It wasn't until Polonia had to restart in the lower divisions did the two teams meet regularly. From 2001-2011 the teams met 14 times in the league Gedania often edging out the games winning five to Polonias two. The two teams have not met competitively since 2011.\n\n==Big three clubs head-to-head==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=4| Comparison of Gedania, Lechia and Polonia\n|-\n| ||bgcolor=blue |<span style=\"color:white\">Gedania</span>||bgcolor=green |<span style=\"color:white\">Lechia</span>||bgcolor=red |<span style=\"color:white\">Polonia</span>\n|-\n|Year of establishment||1945<ref>The current Gedania Gda\u0144sk was founded in 1945.

Outaouais and Northern Quebec'''.\n\n==Regional Profile==\nThe [[Outaouais]] is one of the most federalist areas of Quebec outside of Montreal because of its close proximity to [[Ottawa]] and its concurrent large population of civil servants.  However, Northern Quebec and the Laurentides have long been strongly [[Quebec nationalism|nationalist]], a recipe for two decades of [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] dominance. Only in a recent by-election were the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] able to get the traditionally Bloquist [[Riding (division)|riding]] of Temiscamingue, having previously gained the northern riding of [[Abitibi&mdash;Baie-James&mdash;Nunavik]] in 1997.  [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit]] did well here from the 1960s through the 1970s, usually winning two or three seats; [[R\u00e9al Caouette]], the main voice of Social Credit in the province, was from this area.  [[Hull\u2014Aylmer]] was one of the few ridings outside the Montreal area that was not swept up in the [[Brian Mulroney]] tide, as it went Liberal in both [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]] and [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]; in 1984 it was one of only five Liberal-held ridings outside Montreal in the entire province.  The Liberals managed to retake Gatineau in 1988. In 2006, however, everything changed as Liberal support melted here; the party lost two of their three Outaouais seats &ndash; one to the Bloc and one to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]].\n\nThe region was swept up in the massive [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] tsunami that swept through Quebec in 2011, as the NDP took every seat here by considerable margins (9,000 votes or more), ousting the region's highest-profile MP, Foreign Affairs Minister [[Lawrence Cannon]] in [[Pontiac (electoral district)|Pontiac]].  The NDP even snapped up Hull\u2014Aylmer\u2014a seat that had been in Liberal hands since the riding's creation in 1917.  In 2015, the Liberals took all of the Outoauais, and took four ridings in the Laurentides.  The Bloc took three Laurentides ridings, while the NDP was reduced to the two northernmost ridings in the province. The region reverted to type in 2019. The Bloc swept he north and took all but one seat in the Laurentides, while the Liberals maintained their sweep of the Outaouais and narrowly held onto one Laurentides seat.\n\n==2019 - 43nd General

Outaouais and Northern Quebec'''.\n\n==Regional Profile==\nThe [[Outaouais]] is one of the most federalist areas of Quebec outside of Montreal because of its close proximity to [[Ottawa]] and its concurrent large population of civil servants.  However, Northern Quebec and the Laurentides have long been strongly [[Quebec nationalism|nationalist]], a recipe for two decades of [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] dominance. Only in a recent by-election were the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] able to get the traditionally Bloquist [[Riding (division)|riding]] of Temiscamingue, having previously gained the northern riding of [[Abitibi&mdash;Baie-James&mdash;Nunavik]] in 1997.  [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit]] did well here from the 1960s through the 1970s, usually winning two or three seats; [[R\u00e9al Caouette]], the main voice of Social Credit in the province, was from this area.  [[Hull\u2014Aylmer]] was one of the few ridings outside the Montreal area that was not swept up in the [[Brian Mulroney]] tide, as it went Liberal in both [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]] and [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]; in 1984 it was one of only five Liberal-held ridings outside Montreal in the entire province.  The Liberals managed to retake Gatineau in 1988. In 2006, however, everything changed as Liberal support melted here; the party lost two of their three Outaouais seats &ndash; one to the Bloc and one to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]].\n\nThe region was swept up in the massive [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] tsunami that swept through Quebec in 2011, as the NDP took every seat here by considerable margins (9,000 votes or more), ousting the region's highest-profile MP, Foreign Affairs Minister [[Lawrence Cannon]] in [[Pontiac (electoral district)|Pontiac]].  The NDP even snapped up Hull\u2014Aylmer\u2014a seat that had been in Liberal hands since the riding's creation in 1917.  In 2015, the Liberals took all of the Outoauais, and took four ridings in the Laurentides.  The Bloc took three Laurentides ridings, while the NDP was reduced to the two northernmost ridings in the province. The region reverted to type in 2019. The Bloc swept he north and took all but one seat in the Laurentides, while the Liberals maintained their sweep of the Outaouais and narrowly held onto one Laurentides seat.\n\n==2019 - 43nd General Election==\n{{Canadian federal election, 2019/qc-lo}}\n\n==2015 - 42nd General Election==\n{{Canadian federal election, 2015/qc-lo}}\n\n==2011 - 41st General Election==\n{{Canadian_federal_election,_2011/qc-lo}}\n=== Maps ===\n<gallery>\nimage:nq11.PNG|Map of the ridings in this region, coloured to identify the party they elected in the 2011 election\n</gallery>\n\n==2008 - 40th General Election==\n{{Canadian_federal_election,_2008/qc-lo}}\n\n==2006 - 39th General Election==\n{{Canadian federal election, 2006/qc-lo}}\n\n==2004 - 38th General Election==\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-lo}}\n=== Maps ===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n#Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue\n#Argenteuil-Mirabel\n#Gatineau\n#Hull-Aylmer\n#Laurentides-Labelle\n#Nunavik-Eeyou\n#Pontiac\n#Rivi\u00e8re-des-Mille-\u00celes\n#Rivi\u00e8re-du-Nord\n#Terrebonne-Blainville\n{{col-break}}\n<gallery widths=185 heights=185>\nImage:nq04.PNG|Key map\nImage:nqbq.PNG|Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\nImage:nqcpc.PNG|Conservative Party of Canada\nImage:nqgpc.PNG|Green Party of Canada\nImage:nqlpc.PNG|Liberal Party of Canada\nImage:nqndp.PNG|New Democratic Party\n</gallery>\n{{col-end}}\n\n==2000 - 37th General Election==\n{{Canadian federal election, 2000/qc-lo}}\n\n== 1997 - 36th General Election ==\n{{Canadian federal election, 1997/qc-lo}}\n\n{{Canada macroriding}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Canadian Federal Election Results In The Laurentides, Outaouais And Northern Quebec}}\n[[Category:Canadian federal election results in Quebec]]\n", "name_user": "Amrcmln", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1997 - 36th General Election", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federal_election_results_in_the_Laurentides,_Outaouais_and_Northern_Quebec"}

{"title_page": "Border ware", "text_new": "[[File:16th_century_Border_Ware_tall_jug.jpg|thumb|16th century Border ware jug]]\n\n'''Border ware''' is a type of post-medieval [[Great Britain|British]] pottery commonly used in [[London]] during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The lead-glazed, sandy earthenware was produced from kilns along the border between [[Hampshire]] and [[Surrey]]. There are two classes of Border ware, fine whitewares and fine redwares. \n\n==History==\nBorder ware evolved from a medieval pottery known as [[Surrey whiteware]]. Surrey whiteware consisted of four classes: [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston-type]] ware, Coarse Border ware, [[Cheam]] whiteware  and Tudor Green ware. The earlier whitewares were produced from the 13th to the 16th centuries.{{sfn|Vince|1985|p=76}}{{sfn|Pearce|1988|p=7}}\n\nBorder ware was manufactured in the Surrey-Hampshire border area from the 16th century to the 19th centuries, although the whitewares were produced only during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The  demand for whitewares declined during the 17th century while the demand for redwares increased..{{sfn|Holling|1971|p=64}} The production of whitewares ended most likely during the early 18th century; Redwares continued to be produced until the 19th century.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=1}}\n\n==Description==\n[[File:16th_century_Border_ware_flask.jpg|thumb|Border ware flask, 16th century]]\nThe term, \"Border ware\" was introduced by [[Archaeologist|archaeologist]], Clive Orton, to describe the lead-glazed, sandy earthenware produced along the Surrey-Hampshire borders during the early post-medieval period. The pottery is divided into two classes, whitewares and redwares, although the term \"Border ware\" generally refers to the whitewares. The redwares are known as \"Red Border ware.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=1}}\n\n===Fabrics===\nWhiteware fabrics are generally hard with a smooth and fine texture. Fabric colours include off-white, yellow, brown, buff, olive and pinkish grey. Glazes are often [[Crazing|crazed]] and finishes range from thin and spotty to thick and glossy. Glaze colours include yellow, brown, olive clear, and green.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=5}}\n\nRedware fabrics range from smooth to slightly rough in feel. Fabric colours generally range from brick red to reddish-yellow. Finishes range from thin and uneven to thick and glossy. A clear lead glaze was often used, giving the pottery products an orange or reddish-brown colour. Other glaze colours include olive, brown and green. Green glaze was created by potters by adding copper to lead glaze.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=6}}\n\n===Forms===\nPottery products were traditional household items commonly used during the post-medieval period.{{sfn|Holling|1971|p=69}} [[Skillet|Skillets]], saucepans, chafing dishes and [[Pipkin|tripod pipkins]] were common cookware products manufactured by the Border ware pottery industry.\n[[File:Border_ware_porridger_yellow-glaze.jpg|thumb|left||Border ware porringer]]\nBorder ware forms used for serving and storing food begin with dishes, which are divided into flanged dishes and deep dishes. Bowls were manufactured in a wide variety of shapes and sizes: wide bowls, deep bowls, bowls with handles, and [[Porringer|porringers]]. Vessels for storing and serving liquids include drinking [[Jug|jugs]], [[Cup|cups]], goblets and [[Mug|mugs]]. \n\nOther Border ware forms include costrels (portable flasks), which can be divided into two categories, mammiform costrels and bottle shaped costrels. [[Candlestick|Candlesticks]] were two styles: upright and saucer.

Three sites have been identified as producing the pottery best representing Border Ware fabrics, forms and glazes. These sites are: ''Farnborough Hill Convent'' in [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], Hampshire, Ye Old Malthouse in [[Hawley, Hampshire|Hawley]], Hampshire and ''The Lime'', [[Ash]], Surrey.{{sfn|Pearce|1992|p=2}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stamford ware]]\n*[[Surrey whiteware]]\n*[[Humber ware]]\n*[[Bartmann jug]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=150px heights=150px perrow=6\">\nBorder ware jar green-glaze.jpg||Green-glazed Border ware jar \nBorder ware candlestick.jpg|Border ware candlestick \nBorder_ware_small_bowl.jpg|Border ware bowl\nBorder_ware_jug.jpg| Border ware jug\nBorder_ware_pipkin_green-glazed.jpg|Border ware pipkin\nKingston-type_jug_round.jpg||Surrey whiteware \n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Holling |first1=F.W. |title=A preliminary note on the pottery industry of the Hampshire-Surrey Borders |journal=Surrey Archaeological Collections |date=1971 |volume=68 |pages=57-88|url=https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/surreyac/contents.cfm?vol=68 |accessdate=4 April 2020|ref=harv}} \n\n*{{cite book|last1=Pearce|first1=Jaqueline ||last2=Vince|first2=Alan |title=Surrey Whitewares\n|year=1988|isbn= 978-0903290340|location=London |publisher=London & Middlesex Archaeological societies |ref=harv}}\n\n*{{cite book|last1=Pearce|first1=Jaqueline |title=Border Wares.
