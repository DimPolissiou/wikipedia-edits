The Hoyas, who were seeded first in the East regional bracket, faced the Tigers, who were seeded 16th in the East.\n\nThe Hoyas, who were strong favorites, won by an unexpectedly narrow margin of 50\u201349, only securing their win by preventing a Princeton basket on the final possession of the game. Had Princeton won, they would have been the first 16-seed in tournament history to defeat a 1-seed, a feat that was not achieved until [[2018 UMBC vs. Virginia men's basketball game|UMBC upset Virginia]] in 2018.\n\nMedia outlets have dubbed the Georgetown\u2013Princeton match-up as \"the game that saved March Madness.\" The game is widely credited with halting discussions to downsize the NCAA tournament by eliminating automatic bid for smaller conferences. It also reportedly factored into [[CBS]]'s decisions to renew their NCAA contract later that year and to obtain broadcasting rights for the first round games two years later.\n\n==Background==\nGeorgetown entered the NCAA tournament with a 22\u20134 regular-season record, and a roster that included future NBA stars such as [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Dikembe Mutombo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Twenty-Five Years Later Princeton, Georgetown Matchup Still Stands Out |url=https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2014/03/22/princeton-georgetown-ncaa-tournament |website=[[WBUR-FM]] |accessdate=15 April 2020 |language=en |date=22 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nPrinceton came into the tournament with a 17\u20137 regular season record. They earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament by winning the [[Ivy League]] championship.\n\n==Game summary==\n[[File:Georgetown-Princeton 1989.jpg|thumb|right|Freshman [[Alonzo Mourning]] of Gonzaga shoots free throws with 1:41 left.]]\n\nPrinceton lead Georgetown for most of the first half, and held a 29\u201320 points advantage at halftime. Georgetown never held a lead until a basket by forward Sam Jefferson game them a 39\u201337 lead with 10:25 to play in the second half.\n\nThe game remained close to the very end. With seconds left, [[Alonzo Mourning]] sunk a free throw to give Georgetown the 50\u201349 lead. With 15 seconds remaining, Princeton senior Bob Scrabis attempted a three-pointer but was blocked by Mourning, sending the ball out of bounds. Kit Mueller received the inbound pass with one second left to attempt a final shot, but Mourning executed another successful block as time expired.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moran |first1=Malcolm |title=Georgetown Survives a Scare by Princeton |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/18/sports/ncaa-tournament-east-georgetown-survives-princeton-scare.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=15 April 2020 |location=Providence, RI |page=45 |language=en |date=18 March 1989}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Box score==\n{{basketballbox\n | bg = #e3e3e3\n | date = Friday, March 17\n | time = 7:07 PM EST\n | report = [https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/1989-03-17-georgetown.html box score]\n | team1 = '''#1 Georgetown Hoyas'''\n | score1 = '''50'''\n | team2 = #16 Princeton Tigers\n | score2 = 49\n | H1 = 29\u201321\n | H2 = 20\u201329\n | points1 = [[Alonzo Mourning|A.

The Hoyas, who were seeded first in the East regional bracket, faced the Tigers, who were seeded 16th in the East.\n\nThe Hoyas, who were strong favorites, won by an unexpectedly narrow margin of 50\u201349, only securing their win by preventing a Princeton basket on the final possession of the game. Had Princeton won, they would have been the first 16-seed in tournament history to defeat a 1-seed, a feat that was not achieved until [[2018 UMBC vs. Virginia men's basketball game|UMBC upset Virginia]] in 2018.\n\nMedia outlets have dubbed the Georgetown\u2013Princeton match-up as \"the game that saved March Madness.\" The game is widely credited with halting discussions to downsize the NCAA tournament by eliminating automatic bid for smaller conferences. It also reportedly factored into [[CBS]]'s decisions to renew their NCAA contract later that year and to obtain broadcasting rights for the first round games two years later.\n\n==Background==\nGeorgetown entered the NCAA tournament with a 22\u20134 regular-season record, and a roster that included future NBA stars such as [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Dikembe Mutombo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Twenty-Five Years Later Princeton, Georgetown Matchup Still Stands Out |url=https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2014/03/22/princeton-georgetown-ncaa-tournament |website=[[WBUR-FM]] |accessdate=15 April 2020 |language=en |date=22 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nPrinceton came into the tournament with a 17\u20137 regular season record. They earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament by winning the [[Ivy League]] championship.\n\n==Game summary==\n[[File:Georgetown-Princeton 1989.jpg|thumb|right|Freshman [[Alonzo Mourning]] of Gonzaga shoots free throws with 1:41 left.]]\n\nPrinceton lead Georgetown for most of the first half, and held a 29\u201320 points advantage at halftime. Georgetown never held a lead until a basket by forward Sam Jefferson game them a 39\u201337 lead with 10:25 to play in the second half.\n\nThe game remained close to the very end. With seconds left, [[Alonzo Mourning]] sunk a free throw to give Georgetown the 50\u201349 lead. With 15 seconds remaining, Princeton senior Bob Scrabis attempted a three-pointer but was blocked by Mourning, sending the ball out of bounds. Kit Mueller received the inbound pass with one second left to attempt a final shot, but Mourning executed another successful block as time expired.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moran |first1=Malcolm |title=Georgetown Survives a Scare by Princeton |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/18/sports/ncaa-tournament-east-georgetown-survives-princeton-scare.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=15 April 2020 |location=Providence, RI |page=45 |language=en |date=18 March 1989}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Box score==\n{{basketballbox\n | bg = #e3e3e3\n | date = Friday, March 17\n | time = 7:07 PM EST\n | report = [https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/1989-03-17-georgetown.html box score]\n | team1 = '''#1 Georgetown Hoyas'''\n | score1 = '''50'''\n | team2 = #16 Princeton Tigers\n | score2 = 49\n | H1 = 29\u201321\n | H2 = 20\u201329\n | points1 = [[Alonzo Mourning|A.

{"title_page": "Liar's dice", "text_new": "{{About|the dice game|the 2013 Indian film|Liar's Dice (film)|dice that have been tampered with|Dice#Loaded dice}}\n{{original research|date=January 2016}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2007}}\n\n'''Liar's dice''' is a class of [[dice games]] for two or more players requiring the ability to deceive and to detect an opponent's deception. \n\nIn \"single hand\" liar's dice games, each player has a set of dice, all players roll once, and the bids relate to the dice each player can see (their hand) plus all the concealed dice (the other players' hands).  In \"common hand\" games, there is one set of dice which is passed from player to player. The bids relate to the dice as they are in front of the bidder after selected dice have been re-rolled.  \n\nThe genre has its roots in [[South America]], with games there being known as [[Dudo]], Cachito, Perudo or Dadinho; other names include \"pirate's dice,\" \"deception dice\" and \"diception.\" The [[drinking game]] version  is sometimes called ''Mexicali'' or ''Mexican'' in the United States; the latter term may be a corruption of ''M\u00e4xchen'' (\"Little Max\"), the name by which a similar game, [[Mia (game)|Mia]], is known in Germany, while Liar's dice is known in Germany as ''Bluff''. It is known by various names in Asia.\n\n==Single hand==\n[[File:Perudo.jpg|right|thumb|Five six-sided dice are used per player, with dice cups used for concealment.]]\nFive dice are used per player with dice cups used for concealment.\n\nEach round, each player rolls a \"hand\" of dice under their cup and looks at their hand while keeping it concealed from the other players. The first player begins bidding, announcing any face value and the minimum number of dice that the player believes are showing that value, under all of the cups in the game.  Ones are often wild, always counting as the face of the current bid.\n\nTurns rotate among the players in a clockwise order.  Each player has two choices during their turn: to make a higher bid, or challenge the previous bid\u2014typically with a call of \"liar\". Raising the bid means either increasing the quantity, or the face value, or both, according to the specific bidding rules used. There are many variants of allowed and disallowed bids; common bidding variants, given a previous bid of an arbitrary quantity and face value, include:\n\n* the player may bid a higher quantity of any particular face, or the same quantity of a higher face (allowing a player to \"re-assert\" a face value they believe prevalent if another player increased the face value on their bid);\n* the player may bid a higher quantity of the same face, or any particular quantity of a higher face (allowing a player to \"reset\" the quantity);\n* the player may bid a higher quantity of the same face or the same quantity of a higher face (the most restrictive; a reduction in either face value or quantity is never allowed).\n\nIf the current player challenges the previous bid, all dice are revealed. If the bid is valid (at least as many of the face value and any wild aces are showing as were bid), the bidder wins. Otherwise, the challenger wins. The player who loses a round loses one of their dice. The last player to still retain a die (or dice) is the winner.  The loser of the last round starts the bidding on the next round.  If the loser of the last round was eliminated, the next player starts the new round.\n\n===Variants===\n* Instead of the current player being the only one who can raise the bet, challenge (or \"call up\") the previously-made bid, any player may raise or challenge a bid at any time. The first challenge made ends the round, and the challenger closest to the current bidder in the direction of play has priority if multiple players challenge at the same time.\n* If played with the above variant, the player who made the last bid may count aloud from 1 to 10. If he reaches 10 with no one challenging or increasing the bid, the round ends with that player earning back a die. A player may have more than 5 dice that way, and any player who reaches 10 dice that way wins the game.\n* With the above-mentioned variants, some players may stay quiet and win easily. To avoid that, the following rule may be added: Each time a player loses a challenge, he loses a die normally, but the two players sitting to their left and right lose a die as well (unless one of them was the player to win the challenge).\n* Another solution to the above-mentioned variants is to force all players to choose a side: Each player holds a two-sided item (preferred a coin or a card), and decides which side means 'true', and which means 'lie'. When a player challenges, all players must join the challenge, placing their items on the table on either 'true' or 'lie', hidden beneath their hands. Once all players have joined, the items are revealed and the table is divided into players who support either side of the challenge. Every player on the losing side loses a die at the end of the challenge.\n* With some bidding systems, a player may elect to choose one or more dice of matching value from under their cup, place them outside the cup in view of the other players, re-roll the remaining dice, and make a new bid of any quantity of that face value.\n* When a player has no two dice with the same face, he may choose to ''pass'' once in a game round. If he does so, the bid will not be raised. The next player can raise the bid using standard rules, or call the bluff. By doing so, he challenges the claim of the passing player having no two dice with the same face. This is commonly used in multi-round games where dice are removed from the game, as it helps players with few dice left to gain more information about the other dice without risk.\n* If a bidder is challenged, yet their bid was \"spot on\", they may win back a die.\n* Instead of raising or challenging, the player can claim that the current bid is exactly correct (\"Spot On\"). If the number is higher or lower, the player loses to the previous bidder, but if they are correct, they win. A \"spot-on\" claim typically has a lower chance of being correct than a challenge, so a correct \"spot on\" call sometimes has a greater reward, such as the player regaining a previously lost die or all other players losing a die.\n\n===Elements of strategy===\nAs with any game of chance, probability is highly important. The key element is the \"expected quantity\": the quantity of any face value that has the highest probability of being present. For six-sided dice, the expected quantity is one-sixth the number of dice in play, rounded down.{{cn|reason=I don't believe it |date=December 2018}} When wilds are used, the expected quantity is doubled as players can expect as many aces, on average, as any other value. Because each rolled die is independent of all others, any combination of values is possible, but the \"expected quantity\" has a greater than 50% chance of being correct, and the highest probability of being exactly correct. For example, when 15 dice are in play and wilds are used, the expected quantity is 5. The chances of a bid of 5 being correct are about 59.5%; in contrast, the chances of a bid of 8 being correct are only about 8.8%.\n\nHowever, a high bid is not necessarily incorrect, because bids incorporate information the player knows. A player who holds several dice of a single value (for instance, four out of the five dice in their hand are threes) may make a bid, with fifteen dice on the table, of \"six threes\". To an outside observer who sees none of the dice, this has an extremely low probability of being correct (even with wilds), however since the player knows the value of five of those dice, the player is actually betting that there are two additional threes among the ten unknown dice. This is far more likely to be true (about 40%).\n\nEach bid gives others at the table information. Players, through subsequent bids, reveal the players' confidence in the quantity of each face value rolled. A player with two or three of a certain face value under his or her own cup may make a bid favoring that face value. Players can thus use these bids to build a mental picture of the unknown values, which either strengthens or weakens their confidence in a bid they are considering. Others may consider a bid as evidence it is true, and if their own dice support the same conclusion, may increase the bid on that face value, or if their dice refute it may bid on a different face, or challenge the previous bid.\n\nConversely, bids can also be bluffs. Bluffs in liar's dice can be split into two main categories: early bluffs and late bluffs. An early bluff is likely to be correct by simple probability (depending on the number of players), but other players may believe the bidder made that bid because his or her dice supported it. Thus, the bluff is false information that can lead to incorrect higher bids being made on that face value. Players will thus attempt to trick other players into overbidding by use of early bluffs to inflate a particular face value. A late bluff, on the other hand, is usually less voluntary; the player is often unwilling to challenge a bid, but as a higher bid is even more likely to be incorrect it is even less appealing. A late bluff is thus a critical part of the game; convincing bluffs, as well as reliable detection of bluffs, allow the player to avoid being challenged on an incorrect bid.\n\nPlaying Liar's dice involves interpersonal skills similar to other bluffing games such as [[poker]]. Being able to reliably detect bluffs through giveaways, or \"tells\", and analyzing a player's bidding history for patterns that can indicate the likelihood of a bluff, are important skills here just as in poker.\n\n===Dice odds===\nFor a given number of unknown dice ''n'', the probability that ''exactly'' a certain quantity ''q'' of any face value are showing, ''P(q)'', is\n\n:<math>\\ P(q) = C(n,q) \\cdot (1/6)^q \\cdot (5/6)^{n-q}</math>\n\nWhere ''C(n,q)'' is the [[binomial coefficient|number of unique subsets]] of ''q'' dice out of the set of ''n'' unknown dice. In other words, the number of dice with any particular face value follows the [[binomial distribution]] <math>B(n,\\tfrac{1}{6})</math>.\n\nFor the same n, the probability ''P'(q)'' that ''at least q'' dice are showing a given face is the sum of ''P(x)'' for all ''x'' such that ''q \u2264 x \u2264 n'', or\n\n:<math>\\ P'(q) = \\sum_{x=q}^n C(n,x) \\cdot (1/6)^x \\cdot (5/6)^{n-x}</math>\n\nThese equations can be used to calculate and chart the probability of exactly ''q'' and at least ''q'' for any or multiple ''n''. For most purposes, it is sufficient to know the following facts of dice probability:\n\n* The expected quantity of any face value among a number of unknown dice is one-sixth the total unknown dice.\n* A bid of the expected quantity (or twice the expected value when playing with wilds), rounded down, has a greater than 50% chance of being correct and the highest chance of being exactly correct.<ref name=\"Christopher P Ferguson\">{{cite web|last2=Ferguson|first2=Thomas S|title=Models for the Game of Liar's Dice|url=https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/papers/LiarsDice.pdf|publisher=University of California at Los Angeles|accessdate=16 January 2013|last1=Ferguson|first1=Christopher P}}</ref>\n\n==Common hand==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}\n[[File:Liar Dice.jpg|thumb|A set of [[poker dice]] being rolled behind a screen, played as in the \"individual\" hand version of liar's dice.]]\n\nThe \"Common hand\" version is for two players.

Albert H. Morehead and Georffrey Mott-Smith - Revised and Updated by Philip D. Morehead</ref>\n\n==Drinking game version==\nThe first player rolls two dice under a cup and claims a roll. Most claims are scored by reading the higher die as the 10s place and the lower as the 1s, e.g., a roll of 1 and 4 is read as \"41\".\n\nThe next player may do one of two things. If he believes the roller, he simply takes the dice (without looking at the result), rolls, and claims a higher scoring roll.  If he does not believe the roller, the cup is lifted, revealing the roller's hand.

There are many variants of allowed and disallowed bids; common bidding variants, given a previous bid of an arbitrary quantity and face value, include:\n\n* the player may bid a higher quantity of any particular face, or the same quantity of a higher face (allowing a player to \"re-assert\" a face value they believe prevalent if another player increased the face value on their bid);\n* the player may bid a higher quantity of the same face, or any particular quantity of a higher face (allowing a player to \"reset\" the quantity);\n* the player may bid a higher quantity of the same face or the same quantity of a higher face (the most restrictive; a reduction in either face value or quantity is never allowed).\n\nIf the current player challenges the previous bid, all dice are revealed. If the bid is valid (at least as many of the face value and any wild aces are showing as were bid), the bidder wins. Otherwise, the challenger wins. The player who loses a round loses one of their dice. The last player to still retain a die (or dice) is the winner.  The loser of the last round starts the bidding on the next round.  If the loser of the last round was eliminated, the next player starts the new round.\n\n===Variants===\n* Instead of the current player being the only one who can raise the bet, challenge (or \"call up\") the previously-made bid, any player may raise or challenge a bid at any time. The first challenge made ends the round, and the challenger closest to the current bidder in the direction of play has priority if multiple players challenge at the same time.\n* If played with the above variant, the player who made the last bid may count aloud from 1 to 10. If he reaches 10 with no one challenging or increasing the bid, the round ends with that player earning back a die. A player may have more than 5 dice that way, and any player who reaches 10 dice that way wins the game.\n* With the above-mentioned variants, some players may stay quiet and win easily. To avoid that, the following rule may be added: Each time a player loses a challenge, he loses a die normally, but the two players sitting to their left and right lose a die as well (unless one of them was the player to win the challenge).\n* Another solution to the above-mentioned variants is to force all players to choose a side: Each player holds a two-sided item (preferred a coin or a card), and decides which side means 'true', and which means 'lie'. When a player challenges, all players must join the challenge, placing their items on the table on either 'true' or 'lie', hidden beneath their hands. Once all players have joined, the items are revealed and the table is divided into players who support either side of the challenge. Every player on the losing side loses a die at the end of the challenge.\n* With some bidding systems, a player may elect to choose one or more dice of matching value from under their cup, place them outside the cup in view of the other players, re-roll the remaining dice, and make a new bid of any quantity of that face value.\n* When a player has no two dice with the same face, he may choose to ''pass'' once in a game round. If he does so, the bid will not be raised. The next player can raise the bid using standard rules, or call the bluff. By doing so, he challenges the claim of the passing player having no two dice with the same face. This is commonly used in multi-round games where dice are removed from the game, as it helps players with few dice left to gain more information about the other dice without risk.\n* If a bidder is challenged, yet their bid was \"spot on\", they may win back a die.\n* Instead of raising or challenging, the player can claim that the current bid is exactly correct (\"Spot On\"). If the number is higher or lower, the player loses to the previous bidder, but if they are correct, they win. A \"spot-on\" claim typically has a lower chance of being correct than a challenge, so a correct \"spot on\" call sometimes has a greater reward, such as the player regaining a previously lost die or all other players losing a die.\n\n===Elements of strategy===\nAs with any game of chance, probability is highly important. The key element is the \"expected quantity\": the quantity of any face value that has the highest probability of being present. For six-sided dice, the expected quantity is one-sixth the number of dice in play, rounded down.{{cn|reason=I don't believe it |date=December 2018}} When wilds are used, the expected quantity is doubled as players can expect as many aces, on average, as any other value. Because each rolled die is independent of all others, any combination of values is possible, but the \"expected quantity\" has a greater than 50% chance of being correct, and the highest probability of being exactly correct. For example, when 15 dice are in play and wilds are used, the expected quantity is 5. The chances of a bid of 5 being correct are about 59.5%; in contrast, the chances of a bid of 8 being correct are only about 8.8%.\n\nHowever, a high bid is not necessarily incorrect, because bids incorporate information the player knows. A player who holds several dice of a single value (for instance, four out of the five dice in their hand are threes) may make a bid, with fifteen dice on the table, of \"six threes\". To an outside observer who sees none of the dice, this has an extremely low probability of being correct (even with wilds), however since the player knows the value of five of those dice, the player is actually betting that there are two additional threes among the ten unknown dice. This is far more likely to be true (about 40%).\n\nEach bid gives others at the table information. Players, through subsequent bids, reveal the players' confidence in the quantity of each face value rolled. A player with two or three of a certain face value under his or her own cup may make a bid favoring that face value. Players can thus use these bids to build a mental picture of the unknown values, which either strengthens or weakens their confidence in a bid they are considering. Others may consider a bid as evidence it is true, and if their own dice support the same conclusion, may increase the bid on that face value, or if their dice refute it may bid on a different face, or challenge the previous bid.\n\nConversely, bids can also be bluffs. Bluffs in liar's dice can be split into two main categories: early bluffs and late bluffs. An early bluff is likely to be correct by simple probability (depending on the number of players), but other players may believe the bidder made that bid because his or her dice supported it. Thus, the bluff is false information that can lead to incorrect higher bids being made on that face value. Players will thus attempt to trick other players into overbidding by use of early bluffs to inflate a particular face value. A late bluff, on the other hand, is usually less voluntary; the player is often unwilling to challenge a bid, but as a higher bid is even more likely to be incorrect it is even less appealing. A late bluff is thus a critical part of the game; convincing bluffs, as well as reliable detection of bluffs, allow the player to avoid being challenged on an incorrect bid.\n\nPlaying Liar's dice involves interpersonal skills similar to other bluffing games such as [[poker]]. Being able to reliably detect bluffs through giveaways, or \"tells\", and analyzing a player's bidding history for patterns that can indicate the likelihood of a bluff, are important skills here just as in poker.\n\n===Dice odds===\nFor a given number of unknown dice ''n'', the probability that ''exactly'' a certain quantity ''q'' of any face value are showing, ''P(q)'', is\n\n:<math>\\ P(q) = C(n,q) \\cdot (1/6)^q \\cdot (5/6)^{n-q}</math>\n\nWhere ''C(n,q)'' is the [[binomial coefficient|number of unique subsets]] of ''q'' dice out of the set of ''n'' unknown dice. In other words, the number of dice with any particular face value follows the [[binomial distribution]] <math>B(n,\\tfrac{1}{6})</math>.\n\nFor the same n, the probability ''P'(q)'' that ''at least q'' dice are showing a given face is the sum of ''P(x)'' for all ''x'' such that ''q \u2264 x \u2264 n'', or\n\n:<math>\\ P'(q) = \\sum_{x=q}^n C(n,x) \\cdot (1/6)^x \\cdot (5/6)^{n-x}</math>\n\nThese equations can be used to calculate and chart the probability of exactly ''q'' and at least ''q'' for any or multiple ''n''. For most purposes, it is sufficient to know the following facts of dice probability:\n\n* The expected quantity of any face value among a number of unknown dice is one-sixth the total unknown dice.\n* A bid of the expected quantity (or twice the expected value when playing with wilds), rounded down, has a greater than 50% chance of being correct and the highest chance of being exactly correct.<ref name=\"Christopher P Ferguson\">{{cite web|last2=Ferguson|first2=Thomas S|title=Models for the Game of Liar's Dice|url=https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/papers/LiarsDice.pdf|publisher=University of California at Los Angeles|accessdate=16 January 2013|last1=Ferguson|first1=Christopher P}}</ref>\n\n==Common hand==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}\n[[File:Liar Dice.jpg|thumb|A set of [[poker dice]] being rolled behind a screen, played as in the \"individual\" hand version of liar's dice.]]\n\nThe \"Common hand\" version is for two players.

Albert H. Morehead and Georffrey Mott-Smith - Revised and Updated by Philip D. Morehead</ref>\n\n==Drinking game version==\nThe first player rolls two dice under a cup and claims a roll. Most claims are scored by reading the higher die as the 10s place and the lower as the 1s, e.g., a roll of 1 and 4 is read as \"41\". Doubles are higher than \"65\", and what would be the lowest roll 2-1, is a \"Mexican\" and higher than 6-6.\n\nSpecial rolls:\n*3-1 Social (everyone drinks, cancel all previous rolls, roll again to open)\n*3-2 Reverse (change direction and previous player drinks one sip, cancel all previous rolls, roll again to open)\n*2-1 Mexican (if the cup is lifted revealing a Mexican, the incorrect challenger drinks twice, if the player does not challenge, the player must still drink, since nothing is higher than Mexican)\n\nThe next player may do one of two things. If he believes the roller, he simply takes the dice (without looking at the result), rolls, and claims a higher scoring roll.  If he does not believe the roller, the cup is lifted, revealing the roller's hand. Either the bluffer or incorrect challenger must drink.\n\n==Commercial versions==\n{{refimprovesect|date=August 2018}}\n{{Expand list|date=October 2012}}\n*1993 ''Call My Bluff'', by FX Schmid, designer [[Richard Borg]], won the 1993 [[Spiel des Jahres]] and [[Deutscher Spiele Preis]] awards.<ref>[http://www.funagain.com/control/productaward/~award_type=SDJ/~award_year=1993 1993 Spiel des Jahres]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Game design]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{bgg title|45|Liar's Dice}}\n* [http://www.dicegamedepot.com/dice-n-games-blog/dice-game-rules-liars-dice/ Liar's Dice rules for both \"single hand\" and \"common hand\" versions]\n\n{{Spiel des Jahres}}\n{{Drinking games}}\n{{Dice games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Liar's Dice}}\n[[Category:Dice games]]\n[[Category:Drinking games]]\n[[Category:Spiel des Jahres winners]]\n[[Category:Richard Borg games]]\n[[Category:Ravensburger games]]\n[[Category:Endless Games games]]\n", "name_user": "99.23.158.171", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Michigan Technological University version circa 1986)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_dice"}

She was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of Denmark from the death of her elder brother in 1747 until the birth of her second brother in 1749, and retained her status as next in line to the Danish throne after her brother until her marriage.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> She was therefore often referred to as Crown Princess of Denmark.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/>\n\n[[File:Sophiemagdaleneofdenmark queen of sweden.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Carl Gustaf Pilo]], c. 1765]]\n\nIn the spring of 1751, at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, and she was brought up to be the Queen of Sweden.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The marriage was arranged by the [[Riksdag of the Estates]], not by the Swedish royal family. The marriage was arranged as a way of creating peace between Sweden and Denmark, which had a long history of war and which had strained relations following the election of an heir to the Swedish throne in 1743, where the Danish candidate had lost. The engagement was met with some worry from Queen Louise, who feared that her daughter would be mistreated by the Queen of Sweden, [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia]].<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The match was known to be disliked by the Queen of Sweden, who was in constant conflict with the Parliament; and who was known in Denmark for her pride, dominant personality and hatred of anything Danish, which she demonstrated in her treatment of the Danish ambassadors in Stockholm.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/>\n\nAfter the death of her mother early in her life, Sophia Magdalena was given a very strict and religious upbringing by her grandmother and her stepmother, who considered her father and brother to be morally degenerate.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> She is noted to have had good relationships with her siblings, her grandmother and her stepmother; her father, however, often frightened her when he came before her drunk, and was reportedly known to set his dogs upon her, causing in her a lifelong [[Cynophobia|phobia]].<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/>\n\nIn 1760, the betrothal was again brought up by Denmark, which regarded it as a matter of prestige.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The negotiations were made between Denmark and the Swedish Queen, as King [[Adolf Frederick of Sweden]] was never considered to be of any more than purely formal importance.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Louisa Ulrika favored a match between Gustav and her niece [[Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt]] instead, and claimed that she regarded the engagement to be void and forced upon her by [[Carl Gustaf Tessin]].<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> She negotiated with [[Catherine the Great]] and her brother [[Frederick the Great]] to create some political benefit for Denmark in exchange for a broken engagement.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, [[Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark]], who was very loved for her kindness and charity.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> This view was supported by the [[Caps (party)|Caps political party]], which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: \"His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen\".<ref name=\"Ribbing\" /> In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated. When a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: \"why Gustav, you seem to be already in love with her! She looks stupid\", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: \"She would suit you better!\"<ref name=\"Ribbing\">Gerd Ribbing (1958). ''Gustav III:s hustru.

Bonniers Boktryckeri.</ref>\n\n== Crown Princess ==\nOn 1 October 1766, Sophia Magdalena was married to Gustav by proxy at [[Christiansborg Palace]] in [[Copenhagen]] with her brother [[Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark]] as representative of her groom. She traveled in the royal golden [[sloop]] from [[Kronborg]] in Denmark over [[\u00d6resund]] to [[H\u00e4lsingborg]] in Sweden; when she was halfway, the Danish cannon salute ended, and the Swedish started to fire.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> In [[Helsingborg]], she was welcomed by her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Hesse, who had crossed the sea shortly before her, the Danish envoy in Stockholm, Baron Schack, as well as Crown Prince Gustav. As she was about to set foot on ground, Gustav was afraid that she would fall, and he therefore reached her his hand with the words: \"Watch out, Madame!\",<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\">Gerd Ribbing (1958). Gustav III:s hustru. Sofia Magdalena. Stockholm: Alb. Bonniers Boktryckeri. ISBN</ref> a reply which quickly became a topic of gossip at the Swedish court. The couple then traveled by land toward Stockholm, being celebrated on the way. She met her father-in-law the King and her brothers-in-law at St\u00e4ket Manor on 27 October, and she continued to be well-treated and liked by them all during her life in Sweden. Thereafter, she met her mother-in-law the Queen and her sister-in-law at S\u00e4by Manor, and on the 28th, she was formally presented for the Swedish royal court at [[Drottningholm Palace]]. At this occasion, Countess Ebba Bonde noted that the impression about her was: \"By God, how beautiful she is!\", but that her appearance was affected by the fact that she had a: \"terrible fear of the Queen\".<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\" /> The 4 November 1766, she was officially welcomed to the capital of Stockholm, where she was married to Gustav in person in the Royal Chapel at Stockholm Royal Palace.\n\nSophia Magdalena initially made a good impression upon the Swedish nobility with her beauty, elegance and skillful dance; but her shy, silent, and reserved nature soon made her a disappointment in the society life.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Being of a reserved nature, she was considered cold and arrogant. Her mother-in-law Queen Louisa Ulrika, who once stated that she could comprehend nothing more humiliating than the position of a Queen Dowager, harassed her in many ways: a typical example was when she invited Gustav to her birthday celebrations, but asked him to make Sophia Magdalena excuse herself by pretending to be too ill to attend.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Louisa Ulrika encouraged a distance between the couple in various ways, and Gustav largely ignored her so as not to make his mother jealous. Sophia Magdalena was known to be popular with the [[Caps (party)]], who were supported by Denmark, while Louisa Ulrika and Gustav sided with the [[Hats (party)]].<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The Caps regarded Sophia Magdalena to be a symbol of virtue and religion in a degenerated royal court, and officially demonstrated their support.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Sophia Magdalena was advised by the Danish ambassador not to involve herself in politics, and when the spies of Louisa Ulrika reported that Sophia Magdalena received letters from the Danish ambassador through her Danish entourage, the Queen regarded her to be a sympathizer of the Danish-supported Caps: she was isolated from any contact with the Danish embassy, and the Queen encouraged Gustav to force her to send her Danish servants home.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> This she did not do until 1770, and his demand contributed to their tense and distant relationship.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> In 1768, [[Charlotta Sparre]] tried to reconcile the couple at their summer residence [[Ekolsund Castle]], but the marriage remained unconsummated.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/>\n\nAfter King [[Adolf Frederick of Sweden]] died in 1771, [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] became King of Sweden. The following year, Sophia Magdalena was crowned Queen.\n\n== Queen ==\n[[File:Sophia-Magdalena-av-Danmark Droning-av-Sverige.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Official portrait as Queen of Sweden by [[Lorens Pasch the Younger|Lorens Pasch]]]]\nThe coronation of Gustav III and Sophia Magdalena took place on 29 May 1772. She was not informed about the [[Revolution of 1772|coup of Gustav III]], which reinstated absolute monarchy and ended the parliamentary rule of the Estates in the revolution of 1772. At the time, she was made suspicious and politically untrustworthy in the eyes of the King, especially by her mother-in-law, who painted her as pro-Danish.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Denmark was presumed to oppose the coup, and there were also at the time plans to conquer [[Norway]] from Denmark.\n\nSophia Magdalena appears to have been informed about politics nonetheless; she expressed herself pleased with the 1772 parliament, because Count [[Fredrik Ribbing]], for whom she had taken an interest, had regained his seat.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The conflict between her and her mother-in-law was publicly known and disliked, and the sympathies were on her side. In the contemporary paper ''Dagligt Allehanda'', a fable was presented about ''R\u00e4vinnan och Turturduvan'' [The She Fox and the Turtle Dove].<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The fable was about the innocent Turtle Dove (Sophia Magdalena) who was slandered by the wicked She Fox (Louisa Ulrika), who was supported by the Second She Fox (The Mistress of the Robes [[Anna Maria Hj\u00e4rne]]) and the other Foxes (the nobility).<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The fable was believed to have been sent from the Caps Party.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/>\n\nQueen Sophia Magdalena was of a shy and reserved character and was never a member of the King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents: in 1777, for example she dressed as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Normally, however, it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award. She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the Court around her outgoing spouse. As Queen, she was expected to do a great deal of representation, more than had been expected from previous queens because of her consort's love for representation. On formal occasions, she was at her best: she performed beautifully according to Court etiquette, and was seen as dignified and impressive. On 17 September 1784, for example, she cut the cord to let off the first air balloons from the Stockholm observatory. During the King's Italian journey in 1783\u201384, she hosted a grand formal public dinner every two weeks, court presentation and showed herself at the Royal Swedish Opera and at the [[French Theater of Gustav III|French Theater]], but otherwise preferred her solitude. This attracted attention as during the absence of the King, she had been expected to represent the royal couple all the more. During this time, she is said to have enjoyed nature trips in the country side, with only one lady in waiting and two footmen, but this was stopped, because it was deemed unsuitable. Several of her ladies-in-waiting were well known Swedish women of the era, among them ''The Three [[Graces]]'', as [[Augusta von Fersen]], [[Ulla von H\u00f6pken]] and Lovisa Meijerfelt were called, and the artists [[Marianne Ehrenstr\u00f6m]] and [[Charlotta Cedercreutz]]. Sophia Magdalena was a popular Queen: the 22 July 1788, for example, during the absence of her spouse in Finland, several members of the Royal Dramatic Theater and the musical society Augustibr\u00f6der, among them [[Carl Michael Bellman|Bellman]], took a spontaneous trip by boat from the capital to Ulriksdal Palace, where she was, and performed a poem by Bellman to her honor at the occasion of her name day.\n[[File:Sergel Queen Sofia Magdalena 1783.JPG|upright|thumb|Bust of Sophia Magdalena, 1783 by [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].]]\nIn the famous diary of her sister-in-law, [[Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Princess Charlotte]], Sophia Magdalena is described as beautiful, cold, silent and haughty, very polite and formal, reserved and unsociable. When she performed her duties as Queen, her sister-in-law, [[Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp]], described her as \"Forced to meet people\". She preferred to spend her days in solitude whenever she could. She had two very intimate friends, [[Maria Aurora Uggla]] and [[Baron]]ess [[Virginia Charlotta Manderstr\u00f6m]], but otherwise rarely participated in any social life outside of what was absolutely necessary to perform her representational duties. She frequently visited the theater, and she also had a great interest for fashion. As a result of this, she was somewhat criticized for being too vain: even when she had no representational duties to dress up for and spend her days alone in her rooms, she is said to have changed costumes several times daily, and according her chamberlain Adolf Ludvig Hamilton, she never passed a mirror without studying herself in it. She was also interested in literature, and educated herself in various subjects: her library contained works about geography, genealogy and history, she educated herself in Swedish, English, German and Italian and regularly read French magazines. According to [[Augusta von Fersen]], Sophia Magdalena was quite educated, but she was not perceived as such because she rarely engaged in conversation.\n\nIn 1784, after the King had returned from his trip to Italy and France, the relationship between the King and Queen soured. At this time, Gustav III spent more and more time with male favorites. In 1786, this came to an open conflict. The King had taken to spend more time at intimate evenings with his favorite [[Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt]], from which he excluded her company. When he gave some of her rooms at the Royal Palace to Armfelt, Sophia Magdalena refused to participate in any representation until the rooms were given back to her, and she also banned her ladies-in-waiting from accepting his invitations without her permission. In 1787, she threatened him with asking for the support of the parliament against him if he took their son with him to Finland, which she opposed, and the year after, she successfully prevented him from doing so. She also reprimanded him from allowing his male favorites to slander her before him.\n\nQueen Sophia Magdalena was never involved in politics, except for one on one occasion. In August 1788, during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788\u20131790)]], the King gave her the task to enter in negotiations with Denmark to prevent a declaration of war from Denmark during the ongoing war against Russia. He asked her to call upon the Danish ambassador Reventlow and give him a letter to be read in the Danish royal council before her brother, [[Christian VII of Denmark|the Danish King]]. He gave her the freedom to write as she wished, but to use the argument that she spoke as a sister and mother to a son with the right to the Danish throne and upon her own initiative. Sophia Magdalena called upon the Danish ambassador, held a speech to him followed by a long conversation and then handed him a letter written as a \"warm appeal\" to her brother. A copy was sent to Gustav III, and her letter was read in the royal Danish council, where it reportedly made a good impression. However, her mission was still unsuccessful, as the Russo-Danish alliance made it unavoidable for Denmark to declare war shortly afterward. [[Russo-Swedish War (1788\u20131790)|At the time]], there were a note that she met two Russian prisoners of war in the park of the [[Haga Palace]], and gave them 100 [[Swedish krona|kronor]] each.\n[[File:Alexander Roslin 009.jpeg|upright|left|thumb|Portrait by [[Alexander Roslin]], c. 1774]]\nAt the parliament of 1789 Gustav III united the other estates against the nobility and to gain support for the war and for his constitutional reform. Coming into conflict with the nobility, he had many of its representatives imprisoned. This act led to a social boycott of the monarch by the female members of the aristocracy, who followed the example of [[Jeanna von Lantingshausen]] as well as the King's sister and sister-in-law, [[Sophie Albertine of Sweden]] and Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte. The Queen did not participate in this political demonstration and refused to allow any talk of politics in her presence. She was nevertheless involved in the conflict. When the King informed his son about the event, he discovered the child to be already informed in other ways than what he had intended. He suspected Sophia Magdalena to be responsible, and asked the governor of the prince, Count Nils Gyldenstolpe, to speak to her. Gyldenstolpe, however, sent one of the king's favorites, Baron Erik Boye. The Queen, who despised the favorites of the King, furiously told Boye that she spoke to her son how she wished and that only her contempt for him prevented her from having him thrown out of the window.<ref>Gerd Ribbing (1959).

At the celebrations of the Victory at Fredrikshamn in 1790, she refused to be escorted by riksr\u00e5d Count Joakim Beck-Friis, who was in favor of the reform, and demanded to be escorted by Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, who was in opposition to it.\n\nIn the autumn of 1790, the King chose to remain in the summer residence of [[Drottningholm Palace]] well in to the autumn because of the social boycott. Finally, the Queen returned to the capital without his consent. He accused her of having been manipulated by the female courtiers into participating in the political demonstration, and refusing him the company of her ladies-in-waiting by leaving. This applied especially to [[Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie]] and Augusta von Fersen, who did not participate in the boycott: he suspected [[Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen]] to have persuaded the Queen to participate in the boycott. This is however is not considered to have been true: though the Queen did oppose to the act of 1789, she is reported never to have allowed any one to speak of politics in her presence. The reason to why she wished to leave was reportedly due to her health, as Drottningholm was quite cold by that time of the year and she had been afflicted by an ear infection.<ref>Gerd Ribbing (1959).

When she was made aware of this, Sophia Magdalena caused a public scene when she visited him in his box at the opera and demanded to be given access to her son. This led to a heated argument and she left the box with the words: \"I will have my vengeance, monsieur! I give you my sacred vow on that!\" <ref>Gerd Ribbing (1959). Ensam drottning.

Her marriage was a then normal arranged royal match for political convenience, in which Sophia Magdalena at first was described by her spouse as \"cold as ice\". Sophia Magdalena's religious upbringing and introverted character made her avoid the lively and spontaneous Gustavian court life, which made her even less attractive in the eyes of her outgoing spouse. Their marriage was not consummated until 1775, nine years after the wedding. The ''status quo'' between [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] and his consort was nurtured by the Queen Dowager, who did not want competition in her influence over her son.  There were rumors that the King was a [[homosexual]] or sexually underdeveloped. His sexuality, which had much effect on Sophia Magdalena's life, as a royal marriage was designed to produce offspring, has been much debated. His sexual inexperience has been blamed on immaturity or his also being [[asexuality|asexual]]. As a teenager, he had a crush on [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel von Fersen's]] mother, [[Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie]], though this affection was never physical. In 1768, he had another infatuation with the noble [[Charlotte Du Rietz]], but this is not believed to have been sexually consummated either.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\" /><ref>Gunilla Roempke (1994).

In the King's private chamber, however, the Queen found the actor and page of the King, [[Lars Hjortsberg]], sleeping, naked.

After having been told of the successful coup where her consort had reinstated absolute monarchy, she confided to her Mistress of the Robes, Countess Anna Maria Hj\u00e4rne, that she was afraid that she would now be divorced by Gustav, because she knew she was not liked by him, because she had not given birth, and because she knew she was being slandered before him. Gustav III was told of this and her words led to a conflict. At a following ball at Ekolsund, the King told Count [[Axel von Fersen the Elder]], that he did plan to divorce her on the grounds of pro-Danish plots and adultery with [[riksr\u00e5d]] Count Fredrik Sparre and Marcus Gerhard Rosencrone of the Danish legation in Stockholm. von Fersen, however, convinced him not to by saying that she should not be regarded to participate in pro-Danish plots just for her love of her Danish chamber-maids, and that as a neglected wife, she should not be blamed for enjoying the compliments of Count Ribbing, which were not grounds for suspicions of adultery. During this period, it had been noted that Count Ribbing was often seen in the company of the Queen and had paid her compliments and made her laugh, among other things by caricaturing her Mistress of the Robes Countess Anna Maria Hj\u00e4rne. Countess Hj\u00e4rne had informed the King that the Queen was pregnant \"And the riksr\u00e5d Ribbing is her favorite.\"<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958 page 213\">Gerd Ribbing (1958).

After the reconciliation of Sophia Magdalena and Gustav III, he apologized to her for having believed these rumors.\n\nIn 1774, the King arranged the marriage between his brother, the future [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], and [[Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp]], to solve, for the time being, the immediate question of an heir to the throne. The Duchess had false pregnancies and miscarriages only, which may have hastened the King to expedite the consummation of his own marriage and produce a son of his own.\n\nIn 1778, Sofia Magdalena gave birth to [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav Adolf]], successor to the throne, and in 1782, she gave birth to a second son, [[Prince Carl Gustav, Duke of Sm\u00e5land|Charles Gustav]], who only lived for one year. It was suggested in some circles that King Gustav's first son was sired by someone else. When the heir was born, the father was believed, by the Queen Dowager among others, to be [[Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila]], then [[Master of the Horse#Sweden|Riksstallm\u00e4stare]].

The scene gained a lot of attention and broke the bonds between Gustav III and his mother. The scandal disturbed celebrations, as did an accident with the public banquet. The public was invited to a great feast to celebrate the birth of the heir, but too many people were let in, and the crowd panicked. Between sixty and one hundred people were trampled to death in the crowd.\n\nSven Anders Hedin, a medical doctor at the royal court, and married to one of the Queen's chambermaids, Charlotta Hellman, contributed two statements which have been quoted in connection with the scandal. In the summer of 1780, during the King's absence abroad, he passed through the private apartments of the Queen, which were expected to be empty at that hour.

She lived in a circle of her own court, and seldom entertained any guests other than her lifelong friends Maria Aurora Uggla and Virginia Manderstr\u00f6m. It is noted that, although she had hated the male favorites of her spouse during his lifetime, she gave several of them positions in her court as a widow. Sophia Magdalena had a close relationship with her son, King Gustav IV Adolf, who visited her regularly and with whom she shared an interest in religion.\n[[File:Sophia Magdalene of Sweden c 1792 by Niclas Lafrensen.jpg|thumb|Sophia Magdalena in 1792, by [[Niclas Lafrensen]], the younger]]\nIn 1797, she insisted on skipping the protocol at the reception of her daughter-in-law, [[Frederica of Baden]]. The etiquette demanded that as Queen Dowager, she should not greet her daughter-in-law at the stair of the royal palace with the rest of the royal family, but wait for her in her own salon, but she refused: \"I know myself how I suffered, when I arrived to Sweden, and how painfully I reacted to the cold reception I was given by Queen Louisa Ulrika. As for my daughter-in-law, I have decided to spare her from having to experience such bitter emotions!\"<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1959\" /> During the reign of her son, she seldom showed herself at court except on Sundays and at court presentations, and preferred to stay at her estate. She regularly met her son and his family on family visits, but she did not participate in court life.\n\nIn 1809 she witnessed the coup and following [[abdication]] of her son, King [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]], after Sweden lost Finland to Russia. She was deeply affected by his deposition. On the day of the coup, she was informed by her friend Maria Aurora Uggla, and in her company she immediately rushed to the quarters of her son. She was prevented from seeing him by guards, and burst into tears in the arms of Uggla. Shortly after, she was visited in her quarters by Duke Charles in the company of guards, who officially told her what had happened and made her burst into tears again by officially banning her from seeing her son. When she, during the captivity of her son, formally applied for permission to see him, and was told by Charles that she could not unless given permission by the government, she publicly commented: \"The government was not asked for permission for the murder of my husband, neither any permission was sought to depose and imprison my son, but I must have their permission, to speak to my child.\"<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1959\" /> She was never to see her son again, but she corresponded with him for the rest of her life. He was sent into exile and replaced by his paternal uncle [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]], but she remained in Sweden until her death. She did, however, say goodbye to her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren when they left Stockholm to join Gustav Adolf.\n\nIn January 1810, she was presented to the elected heir to the throne, [[Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden]]. During his visit, he stopped before the portrait of her grandson Gustav, and informed her that he wished to adopt him for his successor. Later that year (2 November 1810), she was presented to the next elected heir to the throne, [[Jean Baptiste Bernadotte]]. He regarded her with suspicion and believed that she did not wish to see him, but she commented: \"I am grateful for the sensitivity of the Crown prince, but he is mistaken, if he believes that I do not wish to see him! It would be unfair if I were to hold the least bit of dislike toward him, for it is not he who has deposed my son!\"<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1959\" /> At the meeting, her face was said to have turned white, but at the end, she is said to have been delighted by his charm. In 1811, she was one of the few in the Swedish Court who were nice to [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]].\n\nIn September 1812, [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] was presented to her, and gave her impression of her: \"Her Majesty analyzed my books as an educated woman, whose judgement showed as much thoroughness as well as delicate feeling. Never has any one impressed me such as your Queen! I almost dared not reply to her, so taken was I by the royal glory around her \u2013 it gave me such respect, that I shivered!\"<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1959\" /> When the Crown Prince banned any contact between Swedes and the former royal family, Germaine de Sta\u00ebl asked that an exception was to be made for Sophia Magdalena, and it was: her letters were however read by foreign minister [[Lars von Engestr\u00f6m]].\n\nSophia Magdalena lived more and more isolated toward the end of her life and was affected by worsened health. From 1812, she devoted much of her time to her friendship with the young amateur botanic Baron Anton Fredrik Wrangel. She never fully recovered after having suffered a stroke in May 1813.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Royal Monogram of Queen Sophia Magdalena of Sweden.svg|thumb|Royal Monogram of Queen Sophia Magdalena of Sweden]]\nThe affair of the consummation of her marriage and the succession scandal was portrayed in [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]'s period drama production of \"[[Gustav III:s \u00e4ktenskap]]\" (''The Marriage of Gustav III'') in 2001, where Sophia Magdalena was portrayed by Danish actress [[Iben Hjejle]].\n\nIt was also used to inspire the novel [[Drottningens juvelsmycke]], famous in Sweden, where the character of ''Tintomara'' is portrayed as a half sibling of Gustav IV Adolf through Count Munck.\n\n== Titles and styles ==\n*'''3 July 1746 \u2013 1 October 1766''' ''Her Royal Highness'' Princess Sophie Magdalene of Denmark and Norway\n*'''1 October 1766-12-February 1771''' ''Her Royal Highness'' the Crown-Princess of Sweden\n*'''12 February 1771 \u2013 29 March 1792''' ''Her Majesty'' the Queen of Sweden\n*'''29 March 1792 \u2013 21 August 1813''' ''Her Majesty'' the Queen-Dowager of Sweden\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogie ascendante jusqu'au quatrieme degre inclusivement de tous les Rois et Princes de maisons souveraines de l'Europe actuellement vivans| trans-title=Genealogy up to the fourth degree inclusive of all the Kings and Princes of sovereign houses of Europe currently living |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AINPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA6|year=1768|publisher=Frederic Guillaume Birnstiel|location=Bourdeaux|language=fr|page=6}}</ref>\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

She was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of Denmark from the death of her elder brother in 1747 until the birth of her second brother in 1749, and retained her status as next in line to the Danish throne after her brother until her marriage.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> She was therefore often referred to as Crown Princess of Denmark.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/>\n\n[[File:Sophiemagdaleneofdenmark queen of sweden.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Carl Gustaf Pilo]], c. 1765]]\n\nIn the spring of 1751, at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, and she was brought up to be the Queen of Sweden.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The marriage was arranged by the [[Riksdag of the Estates]], not by the Swedish royal family. The marriage was arranged as a way of creating peace between Sweden and Denmark, which had a long history of war and which had strained relations following the election of an heir to the Swedish throne in 1743, where the Danish candidate had lost. The engagement was met with some worry from Queen Louise, who feared that her daughter would be mistreated by the Queen of Sweden, [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia]].<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The match was known to be disliked by the Queen of Sweden, who was in constant conflict with the Parliament; and who was known in Denmark for her pride, dominant personality and hatred of anything Danish, which she demonstrated in her treatment of the Danish ambassadors in Stockholm.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/>\n\nAfter the death of her mother early in her life, Sophia Magdalena was given a very strict and religious upbringing by her grandmother and her stepmother, who considered her father and brother to be morally degenerate.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> She is noted to have had good relationships with her siblings, her grandmother and her stepmother; her father, however, often frightened her when he came before her drunk, and was reportedly known to set his dogs upon her, causing in her a lifelong [[Cynophobia|phobia]].<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/>\n\nIn 1760, the betrothal was again brought up by Denmark, which regarded it as a matter of prestige.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The negotiations were made between Denmark and the Swedish Queen, as King [[Adolf Frederick of Sweden]] was never considered to be of any more than purely formal importance.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Louisa Ulrika favored a match between Gustav and her niece [[Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt]] instead, and claimed that she regarded the engagement to be void and forced upon her by [[Carl Gustaf Tessin]].<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> She negotiated with [[Catherine the Great]] and her brother [[Frederick the Great]] to create some political benefit for Denmark in exchange for a broken engagement.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, [[Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark]], who was very loved for her kindness and charity.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> This view was supported by the [[Caps (party)|Caps political party]], which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: \"His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen\".<ref name=\"Ribbing\" /> In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated. When a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: \"why Gustav, you seem to be already in love with her! She looks stupid\", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: \"She would suit you better!\"<ref name=\"Ribbing\">Gerd Ribbing (1958). ''Gustav III:s hustru. Sofia Magdalena'' [''The wife of Gustav III. Sofia Magdalena''], Stockholm: Alb. Bonniers Boktryckeri.</ref>\n\n== Crown Princess ==\nOn 1 October 1766, Sophia Magdalena was married to Gustav by proxy at [[Christiansborg Palace]] in [[Copenhagen]] with her brother [[Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark]] as representative of her groom. She traveled in the royal golden [[sloop]] from [[Kronborg]] in Denmark over [[\u00d6resund]] to [[H\u00e4lsingborg]] in Sweden; when she was halfway, the Danish cannon salute ended, and the Swedish started to fire.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> In [[Helsingborg]], she was welcomed by her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Hesse, who had crossed the sea shortly before her, the Danish envoy in Stockholm, Baron Schack, as well as Crown Prince Gustav. As she was about to set foot on ground, Gustav was afraid that she would fall, and he therefore reached her his hand with the words: \"Watch out, Madame!\",<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\">Gerd Ribbing (1958). Gustav III:s hustru. Sofia Magdalena. Stockholm: Alb. Bonniers Boktryckeri. ISBN</ref> a reply which quickly became a topic of gossip at the Swedish court. The couple then traveled by land toward Stockholm, being celebrated on the way. She met her father-in-law the King and her brothers-in-law at St\u00e4ket Manor on 27 October, and she continued to be well-treated and liked by them all during her life in Sweden. Thereafter, she met her mother-in-law the Queen and her sister-in-law at S\u00e4by Manor, and on the 28th, she was formally presented for the Swedish royal court at [[Drottningholm Palace]]. At this occasion, Countess Ebba Bonde noted that the impression about her was: \"By God, how beautiful she is!\", but that her appearance was affected by the fact that she had a: \"terrible fear of the Queen\".<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\" /> The 4 November 1766, she was officially welcomed to the capital of Stockholm, where she was married to Gustav in person in the Royal Chapel at Stockholm Royal Palace.\n\nSophia Magdalena initially made a good impression upon the Swedish nobility with her beauty, elegance and skillful dance; but her shy, silent, and reserved nature soon made her a disappointment in the society life.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Being of a reserved nature, she was considered cold and arrogant. Her mother-in-law Queen Louisa Ulrika, who once stated that she could comprehend nothing more humiliating than the position of a Queen Dowager, harassed her in many ways: a typical example was when she invited Gustav to her birthday celebrations, but asked him to make Sophia Magdalena excuse herself by pretending to be too ill to attend.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Louisa Ulrika encouraged a distance between the couple in various ways, and Gustav largely ignored her so as not to make his mother jealous. Sophia Magdalena was known to be popular with the [[Caps (party)]], who were supported by Denmark, while Louisa Ulrika and Gustav sided with the [[Hats (party)]].<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The Caps regarded Sophia Magdalena to be a symbol of virtue and religion in a degenerated royal court, and officially demonstrated their support.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Sophia Magdalena was advised by the Danish ambassador not to involve herself in politics, and when the spies of Louisa Ulrika reported that Sophia Magdalena received letters from the Danish ambassador through her Danish entourage, the Queen regarded her to be a sympathizer of the Danish-supported Caps: she was isolated from any contact with the Danish embassy, and the Queen encouraged Gustav to force her to send her Danish servants home.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> This she did not do until 1770, and his demand contributed to their tense and distant relationship.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> In 1768, [[Charlotta Sparre]] tried to reconcile the couple at their summer residence [[Ekolsund Castle]], but the marriage remained unconsummated.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/>\n\nAfter King [[Adolf Frederick of Sweden]] died in 1771, [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] became King of Sweden. The following year, Sophia Magdalena was crowned Queen.\n\n== Queen ==\n[[File:Sophia-Magdalena-av-Danmark Droning-av-Sverige.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Official portrait as Queen of Sweden by [[Lorens Pasch the Younger|Lorens Pasch]]]]\nThe coronation of Gustav III and Sophia Magdalena took place on 29 May 1772. She was not informed about the [[Revolution of 1772|coup of Gustav III]], which reinstated absolute monarchy and ended the parliamentary rule of the Estates in the revolution of 1772. At the time, she was made suspicious and politically untrustworthy in the eyes of the King, especially by her mother-in-law, who painted her as pro-Danish.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> Denmark was presumed to oppose the coup, and there were also at the time plans to conquer [[Norway]] from Denmark.\n\nSophia Magdalena appears to have been informed about politics nonetheless; she expressed herself pleased with the 1772 parliament, because Count [[Fredrik Ribbing]], for whom she had taken an interest, had regained his seat.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The conflict between her and her mother-in-law was publicly known and disliked, and the sympathies were on her side. In the contemporary paper ''Dagligt Allehanda'', a fable was presented about ''R\u00e4vinnan och Turturduvan'' [The She Fox and the Turtle Dove].<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The fable was about the innocent Turtle Dove (Sophia Magdalena) who was slandered by the wicked She Fox (Louisa Ulrika), who was supported by the Second She Fox (The Mistress of the Robes [[Anna Maria Hj\u00e4rne]]) and the other Foxes (the nobility).<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/> The fable was believed to have been sent from the Caps Party.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\"/>\n\nQueen Sophia Magdalena was of a shy and reserved character and was never a member of the King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents: in 1777, for example she dressed as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Normally, however, it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award. She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the Court around her outgoing spouse. As Queen, she was expected to do a great deal of representation, more than had been expected from previous queens because of her consort's love for representation. On formal occasions, she was at her best: she performed beautifully according to Court etiquette, and was seen as dignified and impressive. On 17 September 1784, for example, she cut the cord to let off the first air balloons from the Stockholm observatory. During the King's Italian journey in 1783\u201384, she hosted a grand formal public dinner every two weeks, court presentation and showed herself at the Royal Swedish Opera and at the [[French Theater of Gustav III|French Theater]], but otherwise preferred her solitude. This attracted attention as during the absence of the King, she had been expected to represent the royal couple all the more. During this time, she is said to have enjoyed nature trips in the country side, with only one lady in waiting and two footmen, but this was stopped, because it was deemed unsuitable. Several of her ladies-in-waiting were well known Swedish women of the era, among them ''The Three [[Graces]]'', as [[Augusta von Fersen]], [[Ulla von H\u00f6pken]] and Lovisa Meijerfelt were called, and the artists [[Marianne Ehrenstr\u00f6m]] and [[Charlotta Cedercreutz]]. Sophia Magdalena was a popular Queen: the 22 July 1788, for example, during the absence of her spouse in Finland, several members of the Royal Dramatic Theater and the musical society Augustibr\u00f6der, among them [[Carl Michael Bellman|Bellman]], took a spontaneous trip by boat from the capital to Ulriksdal Palace, where she was, and performed a poem by Bellman to her honor at the occasion of her name day.\n[[File:Sergel Queen Sofia Magdalena 1783.JPG|upright|thumb|Bust of Sophia Magdalena, 1783 by [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].]]\nIn the famous diary of her sister-in-law, [[Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp|Princess Charlotte]], Sophia Magdalena is described as beautiful, cold, silent and haughty, very polite and formal, reserved and unsociable. When she performed her duties as Queen, her sister-in-law, [[Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp]], described her as \"Forced to meet people\". She preferred to spend her days in solitude whenever she could. She had two very intimate friends, [[Maria Aurora Uggla]] and [[Baron]]ess [[Virginia Charlotta Manderstr\u00f6m]], but otherwise rarely participated in any social life outside of what was absolutely necessary to perform her representational duties. She frequently visited the theater, and she also had a great interest for fashion. As a result of this, she was somewhat criticized for being too vain: even when she had no representational duties to dress up for and spend her days alone in her rooms, she is said to have changed costumes several times daily, and according her chamberlain Adolf Ludvig Hamilton, she never passed a mirror without studying herself in it. She was also interested in literature, and educated herself in various subjects: her library contained works about geography, genealogy and history, she educated herself in Swedish, English, German and Italian and regularly read French magazines. According to [[Augusta von Fersen]], Sophia Magdalena was quite educated, but she was not perceived as such because she rarely engaged in conversation.\n\nIn 1784, after the King had returned from his trip to Italy and France, the relationship between the King and Queen soured. At this time, Gustav III spent more and more time with male favorites. In 1786, this came to an open conflict. The King had taken to spend more time at intimate evenings with his favorite [[Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt]], from which he excluded her company. When he gave some of her rooms at the Royal Palace to Armfelt, Sophia Magdalena refused to participate in any representation until the rooms were given back to her, and she also banned her ladies-in-waiting from accepting his invitations without her permission. In 1787, she threatened him with asking for the support of the parliament against him if he took their son with him to Finland, which she opposed, and the year after, she successfully prevented him from doing so. She also reprimanded him from allowing his male favorites to slander her before him.\n\nQueen Sophia Magdalena was never involved in politics, except for one on one occasion. In August 1788, during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788\u20131790)]], the King gave her the task to enter in negotiations with Denmark to prevent a declaration of war from Denmark during the ongoing war against Russia. He asked her to call upon the Danish ambassador Reventlow and give him a letter to be read in the Danish royal council before her brother, [[Christian VII of Denmark|the Danish King]]. He gave her the freedom to write as she wished, but to use the argument that she spoke as a sister and mother to a son with the right to the Danish throne and upon her own initiative. Sophia Magdalena called upon the Danish ambassador, held a speech to him followed by a long conversation and then handed him a letter written as a \"warm appeal\" to her brother. A copy was sent to Gustav III, and her letter was read in the royal Danish council, where it reportedly made a good impression. However, her mission was still unsuccessful, as the Russo-Danish alliance made it unavoidable for Denmark to declare war shortly afterward. [[Russo-Swedish War (1788\u20131790)|At the time]], there were a note that she met two Russian prisoners of war in the park of the [[Haga Palace]], and gave them 100 [[Swedish krona|kronor]] each.\n[[File:Alexander Roslin 009.jpeg|upright|left|thumb|Portrait by [[Alexander Roslin]], c. 1774]]\nAt the parliament of 1789 Gustav III united the other estates against the nobility and to gain support for the war and for his constitutional reform. Coming into conflict with the nobility, he had many of its representatives imprisoned. This act led to a social boycott of the monarch by the female members of the aristocracy, who followed the example of [[Jeanna von Lantingshausen]] as well as the King's sister and sister-in-law, [[Sophie Albertine of Sweden]] and Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte. The Queen did not participate in this political demonstration and refused to allow any talk of politics in her presence. She was nevertheless involved in the conflict. When the King informed his son about the event, he discovered the child to be already informed in other ways than what he had intended. He suspected Sophia Magdalena to be responsible, and asked the governor of the prince, Count Nils Gyldenstolpe, to speak to her. Gyldenstolpe, however, sent one of the king's favorites, Baron Erik Boye. The Queen, who despised the favorites of the King, furiously told Boye that she spoke to her son how she wished and that only her contempt for him prevented her from having him thrown out of the window.<ref>Gerd Ribbing (1959).

At the celebrations of the Victory at Fredrikshamn in 1790, she refused to be escorted by riksr\u00e5d Count Joakim Beck-Friis, who was in favor of the reform, and demanded to be escorted by Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, who was in opposition to it.\n\nIn the autumn of 1790, the King chose to remain in the summer residence of [[Drottningholm Palace]] well in to the autumn because of the social boycott. Finally, the Queen returned to the capital without his consent. He accused her of having been manipulated by the female courtiers into participating in the political demonstration, and refusing him the company of her ladies-in-waiting by leaving. This applied especially to [[Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie]] and Augusta von Fersen, who did not participate in the boycott: he suspected [[Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen]] to have persuaded the Queen to participate in the boycott. This is however is not considered to have been true: though the Queen did oppose to the act of 1789, she is reported never to have allowed any one to speak of politics in her presence. The reason to why she wished to leave was reportedly due to her health, as Drottningholm was quite cold by that time of the year and she had been afflicted by an ear infection.<ref>Gerd Ribbing (1959).

When she was made aware of this, Sophia Magdalena caused a public scene when she visited him in his box at the opera and demanded to be given access to her son.

Her marriage was a then normal arranged royal match for political convenience, in which Sophia Magdalena at first was described by her spouse as \"cold as ice\". Sophia Magdalena's religious upbringing and introverted character made her avoid the lively and spontaneous Gustavian court life, which made her even less attractive in the eyes of her outgoing spouse. Their marriage was not consummated until 1775, nine years after the wedding. The ''status quo'' between [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] and his consort was nurtured by the Queen Dowager, who did not want competition in her influence over her son.  There were rumors that the King was a [[homosexual]] or sexually underdeveloped. His sexuality, which had much effect on Sophia Magdalena's life, as a royal marriage was designed to produce offspring, has been much debated. His sexual inexperience has been blamed on immaturity or his also being [[asexuality|asexual]]. As a teenager, he had a crush on [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel von Fersen's]] mother, [[Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie]], though this affection was never physical. In 1768, he had another infatuation with the noble [[Charlotte Du Rietz]], but this is not believed to have been sexually consummated either.<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958\" /><ref>Gunilla Roempke (1994).

After having been told of the successful coup where her consort had reinstated absolute monarchy, she confided to her Mistress of the Robes, Countess Anna Maria Hj\u00e4rne, that she was afraid that she would now be divorced by Gustav, because she knew she was not liked by him, because she had not given birth, and because she knew she was being slandered before him. Gustav III was told of this and her words led to a conflict. At a following ball at Ekolsund, the King told Count [[Axel von Fersen the Elder]], that he did plan to divorce her on the grounds of pro-Danish plots and adultery with [[riksr\u00e5d]] Count Fredrik Sparre and Marcus Gerhard Rosencrone of the Danish legation in Stockholm. von Fersen, however, convinced him not to by saying that she should not be regarded to participate in pro-Danish plots just for her love of her Danish chamber-maids, and that as a neglected wife, she should not be blamed for enjoying the compliments of Count Ribbing, which were not grounds for suspicions of adultery. During this period, it had been noted that Count Ribbing was often seen in the company of the Queen and had paid her compliments and made her laugh, among other things by caricaturing her Mistress of the Robes Countess Anna Maria Hj\u00e4rne. Countess Hj\u00e4rne had informed the King that the Queen was pregnant \"And the riksr\u00e5d Ribbing is her favorite.\"<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1958 page 213\">Gerd Ribbing (1958).

After the reconciliation of Sophia Magdalena and Gustav III, he apologized to her for having believed these rumors.\n\nIn 1774, the King arranged the marriage between his brother, the future [[Charles XIII of Sweden]], and [[Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp]], to solve, for the time being, the immediate question of an heir to the throne. The Duchess had false pregnancies and miscarriages only, which may have hastened the King to expedite the consummation of his own marriage and produce a son of his own.\n\nIn 1778, Sofia Magdalena gave birth to [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav Adolf]], successor to the throne, and in 1782, she gave birth to a second son, [[Prince Carl Gustav, Duke of Sm\u00e5land|Charles Gustav]], who only lived for one year. It was suggested in some circles that King Gustav's first son was sired by someone else. When the heir was born, the father was believed, by the Queen Dowager among others, to be [[Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila]], then [[Master of the Horse#Sweden|Riksstallm\u00e4stare]].

She swore she would never speak to the Queen Dowager again, and indeed she never did.\n\nThe King arranged for his mother to make a public apology for her accusation in the presence of the rest of the Royal Family the 12 May 1778. The scene gained a lot of attention and broke the bonds between Gustav III and his mother. The scandal disturbed celebrations, as did an accident with the public banquet. The public was invited to a great feast to celebrate the birth of the heir, but too many people were let in, and the crowd panicked. Between sixty and one hundred people were trampled to death in the crowd.\n\nSven Anders Hedin, a medical doctor at the royal court, and married to one of the Queen's chambermaids, Charlotta Hellman, contributed two statements which have been quoted in connection with the scandal. In the summer of 1780, during the King's absence abroad, he passed through the private apartments of the Queen, which were expected to be empty at that hour.

The etiquette demanded that as Queen Dowager, she should not greet her daughter-in-law at the stair of the royal palace with the rest of the royal family, but wait for her in her own salon, but she refused: \"I know myself how I suffered, when I arrived to Sweden, and how painfully I reacted to the cold reception I was given by Queen Louisa Ulrika. As for my daughter-in-law, I have decided to spare her from having to experience such bitter emotions!\"<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1959\" /> During the reign of her son, she seldom showed herself at court except on Sundays and at court presentations, and preferred to stay at her estate. She regularly met her son and his family on family visits, but she did not participate in court life.\n\nIn 1809 she witnessed the coup and following [[abdication]] of her son, King [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]], after Sweden lost Finland to Russia. She was deeply affected by his deposition. On the day of the coup, she was informed by her friend Maria Aurora Uggla, and in her company she immediately rushed to the quarters of her son. She was prevented from seeing him by guards, and burst into tears in the arms of Uggla. Shortly after, she was visited in her quarters by Duke Charles in the company of guards, who officially told her what had happened and made her burst into tears again by officially banning her from seeing her son. When she, during the captivity of her son, formally applied for permission to see him, and was told by Charles that she could not unless given permission by the government, she publicly commented: \"The government was not asked for permission for the murder of my husband, neither any permission was sought to depose and imprison my son, but I must have their permission, to speak to my child.\"<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1959\" /> She was never to see her son again, but she corresponded with him for the rest of her life. He was sent into exile and replaced by his paternal uncle [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]], but she remained in Sweden until her death. She did, however, say goodbye to her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren when they left Stockholm to join Gustav Adolf.\n\nIn January 1810, she was presented to the elected heir to the throne, [[Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden]]. During his visit, he stopped before the portrait of her grandson Gustav, and informed her that he wished to adopt him for his successor. Later that year (2 November 1810), she was presented to the next elected heir to the throne, [[Jean Baptiste Bernadotte]]. He regarded her with suspicion and believed that she did not wish to see him, but she commented: \"I am grateful for the sensitivity of the Crown prince, but he is mistaken, if he believes that I do not wish to see him! It would be unfair if I were to hold the least bit of dislike toward him, for it is not he who has deposed my son!\"<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1959\" /> At the meeting, her face was said to have turned white, but at the end, she is said to have been delighted by his charm. In 1811, she was one of the few in the Swedish Court who were nice to [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary]].\n\nIn September 1812, [[Germaine de Sta\u00ebl]] was presented to her, and gave her impression of her: \"Her Majesty analyzed my books as an educated woman, whose judgement showed as much thoroughness as well as delicate feeling. Never has any one impressed me such as your Queen! I almost dared not reply to her, so taken was I by the royal glory around her \u2013 it gave me such respect, that I shivered!\"<ref name=\"Gerd Ribbing 1959\" /> When the Crown Prince banned any contact between Swedes and the former royal family, Germaine de Sta\u00ebl asked that an exception was to be made for Sophia Magdalena, and it was: her letters were however read by foreign minister [[Lars von Engestr\u00f6m]].\n\nSophia Magdalena lived more and more isolated toward the end of her life and was affected by worsened health. From 1812, she devoted much of her time to her friendship with the young amateur botanic Baron Anton Fredrik Wrangel. She never fully recovered after having suffered a stroke in May 1813.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Royal Monogram of Queen Sophia Magdalena of Sweden.svg|thumb|Royal Monogram of Queen Sophia Magdalena of Sweden]]\nThe affair of the consummation of her marriage and the succession scandal was portrayed in [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]'s period drama production of \"[[Gustav III:s \u00e4ktenskap]]\" (''The Marriage of Gustav III'') in 2001, where Sophia Magdalena was portrayed by Danish actress [[Iben Hjejle]].\n\nIt was also used to inspire the novel [[Drottningens juvelsmycke]], famous in Sweden, where the character of ''Tintomara'' is portrayed as a half sibling of Gustav IV Adolf through Count Munck.\n\n== Titles and styles ==\n*'''3 July 1746 \u2013 1 October 1766''' ''Her Royal Highness'' Princess Sophie Magdalene of Denmark and Norway\n*'''1 October 1766-12-February 1771''' ''Her Royal Highness'' the Crown-Princess of Sweden\n*'''12 February 1771 \u2013 29 March 1792''' ''Her Majesty'' the Queen of Sweden\n*'''29 March 1792 \u2013 21 August 1813''' ''Her Majesty'' the Queen-Dowager of Sweden\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogie ascendante jusqu'au quatrieme degre inclusivement de tous les Rois et Princes de maisons souveraines de l'Europe actuellement vivans| trans-title=Genealogy up to the fourth degree inclusive of all the Kings and Princes of sovereign houses of Europe currently living |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AINPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA6|year=1768|publisher=Frederic Guillaume Birnstiel|location=Bourdeaux|language=fr|page=6}}</ref>\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

{"title_page": "List of Swedish consorts", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a list of [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Queen consort|queens consort]] and spouses of Swedish monarchs and regents. The list covers a large time span and the role of a consort has changed much over the centuries. The first Swedish consorts are spoken of in legends. The consorts until c. 1000 are often semi-legendary, as are the monarchs. Between the 14th and 16th century, during periods of de facto Swedish independence from the formal union with Denmark, the Swedish regents did not have the title of king or queen, nor did the spouses of kings have the title of queen consort, although they had the equivalent position. Due to unions with Finland, [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], many of the Swedish consorts were also consorts of monarchs of those countries. Consorts listed during the period of 1380\u20131520 were in fact also consorts to monarchs of Denmark. The consorts listed during the period of 1814-1905 were also consorts to monarchs of Norway. [[Finland]] was from the Middle Ages a part of Sweden, and although there was no official title, such as \"Queen Consort of Finland\", from the 16th century until the year of 1809, the queen consort of Sweden also held the title \"Grand Princess of Finland.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} \n\nSweden has had three female [[List of Swedish monarchs|monarchs]]. One of the consorts listed below is male.\n\n[[Image:Konung Agne blir om natten upph\u00e4ngd i ett tr\u00e4d by Hugo Hamilton.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Agne being hanged by his wife Skjalf.

The list covers a large time span and the role of a consort has changed much over the centuries. The first Swedish consorts are spoken of in legends. The consorts until c. 1000 are often semi-legendary, as are the monarchs. Between the 14th and 16th century, during periods of de facto Swedish independence from the formal union with Denmark, the Swedish regents did not have the title of king or queen, nor did the spouses of kings have the title of queen consort, although they had the equivalent position. Due to unions with Finland, [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], many of the Swedish consorts were also consorts of monarchs of those countries. Consorts listed during the period of 1380\u20131520 were in fact also consorts to monarchs of Denmark. The consorts listed during the period of 1814-1905 were also consorts to monarchs of Norway. [[Finland]] was from the Middle Ages a part of Sweden, and although there was no official title, such as \"Queen Consort of Finland\", from the 16th century until the year of 1809, the queen consort of Sweden also held the title \"Grand Princess of Finland.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} \n\nSweden has had three female [[List of Swedish monarchs|monarchs]].
