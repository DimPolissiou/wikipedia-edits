In early fur trading days the South Saskatchewan tributary was known as \"La Fourche des Gros Ventres\" (\"Fork of the Great Gorges\") and the North Saskatchewan was known as \"Rivi\u00e8re du Pas\".\n\nFirst Nations inhabiting the area of the rivers included at one time or another the [[Atsina]], [[Cree]], [[Saulteaux]], [[Blackfoot Confederacy]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], and [[Sioux]].\n\n[[Henry Kelsey]] penetrated the area in the 1690s for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and [[Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne]], established the farthest western post of the French Empire in America (See [[New France]]) just east of the Saskatchewan River Forks at [[Fort de la Corne]]. In addition to this the Hudson's Bay Company and [[North West Company]] both ran numerous fur posts up the river and its two branches throughout the late 18th to late 19th centuries. [[York boats]] and [[canoes]] formed the primary means of travel during the fur trade period.\n\nIn the mid-19th century [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|Metis]] settlements became important along stretches of the rivers (notably at the [[Southbranch Settlement]], Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and [[St. Albert, Alberta]]).\n\n[[Riverboats]] were introduced from the [[Red River of the North]] in the 19th century and remained an important means of transportation until the 1890s and the coming of railways to the area.<ref>{{Citation|publisher =Clark |isbn =|location =Chicago |title =Saskatchewan and its people Volume 1 (Steamboating in the old days)|url =http://www.ourroots.ca/page.aspx?id=163685&amp;qryID=8cece23b-1e2e-4366-93c5-1c1db65da312|author =Hawkes, John |date = 1924}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest settlements in Saskatchewan and Alberta generally were established around the rivers. Examples include [[Fort Edmonton]] ([[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]), [[Fort Battleford]] ([[Battleford, Saskatchewan]]), Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and [[Cumberland House, Saskatchewan]].\n\nFur trade on the lower river: The first European to ascend the river as far as the forks was [[Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La V\u00e9rendrye]] in spring 1739. The main posts on the river were (landmarks in parentheses): (Saskatchewan River Forks) [[Fort Le Jonqui\u00e8re]] (?), Fort de la Corne, Cumberland House, Saskatchewan, (The Pas):second Fort Paskoya, (inflow to Cedar Lake:) first [[Fort Paskoya]] and second [[Fort Bourbon]], (Cedar Lake), (inflow to Lake Winnipeg:) Grand Rapids, Manitoba, and first Fort Bourbon. There were also a number of temporary posts that have left few records. By far the most important post was Cumberland House which was the depot for the route northwest to the rich Athabasca country. To the west, the North Saskatchewan had the greatest number of posts.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Saskatchewan River is featured in [[The Arrogant Worms]]' song \"[[The Last Saskatchewan Pirate]]\", which implies incorrectly that it flows past [[Regina, Saskatchewan]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of longest rivers of Canada]]\n* [[List of rivers of Manitoba]]\n* [[List of rivers of Saskatchewan]]\n* [[List of rivers of Alberta]]\n* [[Manitoba Hydro]]\n* [[Watershed management]]\n* [[Saskatchewan River Delta]]\n* [[Saskatchewan River fur trade]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Myrna Kostash, \"Reading the River: A Traveller's Companion to the North Saskatchewan River\",2005\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ourroots.ca/page.aspx?id=163685&amp;qryID=8cece23b-1e2e-4366-93c5-1c1db65da312 Saskatchewan and its people Volume 1 (Steamboating in the old days)]\n* [http://www.ccge.org/resources/rivers_of_canada/saskatchewan_river/default.asp Canadian Council for Geographic Education page with a series of articles on the history of the Saskatchewan River].\n* [http://www.saskriverbasin.ca/ Partners FOR the Saskatchewan River Basin]\n* [http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/saskatchewan_river.html Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan]\n\n{{Commons category|Saskatchewan River}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Saskatchewan River]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Manitoba]]\n[[Category:Tributaries of Hudson Bay]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|river in Canada}}\n{{Infobox river\n| name               = Saskatchewan River\n| name_native        = \n| name_native_lang   = \n| name_other         = \n| name_etymology     = \n<!---------------------- IMAGE & MAP -->\n| image              = Saskatchewan_River_Bridge.jpg\n| image_size         = \n| image_caption      = The [[South Saskatchewan River]] near [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]]\n| map                = Saskatchewan basin map.png\n| map_size           = \n| map_caption        = Map of Saskatchewan River & Watershed\n| pushpin_map        = \n| pushpin_map_size   = \n| pushpin_map_caption= \n<!---------------------- LOCATION -->\n| subdivision_type1  = Country\n| subdivision_name1  = [[Canada]]\n| subdivision_type2  = \n| subdivision_name2  = \n| subdivision_type3  = Region\n| subdivision_name3  = [[Manitoba]], [[Saskatchewan]]\n| subdivision_type4  = \n| subdivision_name4  = \n| subdivision_type5  = \n| subdivision_name5  = \n<!---------------------- PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS -->\n| length             = {{convert|547|km|mi|abbr=on}} \n| width_min          = \n| width_avg          = \n| width_max          = \n| depth_min          = \n| depth_avg          = \n| depth_max          = \n| discharge1_location= [[The Pas]], [[Manitoba]]\n| discharge1_min     = {{convert|54|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}\n| discharge1_avg     = {{convert|634|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}\n| discharge1_max     = {{convert|3000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}\n<!---------------------- BASIN FEATURES -->\n| source1            = \n| source1_location   = \n| source1_coordinates= \n| source1_elevation  = \n| source2            = Confluence of [[North Saskatchewan River|North]] and [[South Saskatchewan River]]s\n| source2_location   = {{convert|40|km|mi}} east of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]]\n| source2_coordinates= {{coord|53|14|6|N|105|4|58|W|display=inline}}\n| source2_elevation  = {{convert|380|m|abbr=on}}\n| mouth              = [[Lake Winnipeg]]\n| mouth_location     = [[Grand Rapids, Manitoba]]\n| mouth_coordinates  = {{coord|53|11|6|N|99|15|22|W|display=inline,title}}\n| mouth_elevation    = {{convert|220|m|abbr=on}}\n| progression        = \n| river_system       = \n| basin_size         = {{convert|335900|km2|abbr=on}}\n| tributaries_left   = \n| tributaries_right  = \n| custom_label       = \n| custom_data        = \n| extra              = <ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Summary of the State of the Saskatchewan River Basin\n |url         = http://www.saskriverbasin.ca/file/SRB%20Summary.pdf\n |date        = 2009\n |accessdate  = 2014-08-29\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140904202158/http://www.saskriverbasin.ca/file/SRB%20Summary.pdf\n |archivedate = 2014-09-04\n}}</ref><ref name= \"Atlas of Canada\">{{cite web\n| title =Atlas of Canada Toporama\n| url =http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/toporama/index.html\n| date = \n| accessdate =2014-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Natural Resources Canada-Canadian Geographical Names (Saskatchewan River)\n| url = http://www4.rncan.gc.ca/search-place-names/unique/HAHJI  \n| date = \n| accessdate =2014-08-29}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe '''Saskatchewan River''' ([[Cree language|Cree]]: ''kisisk\u0101ciwani-s\u012bpiy'', \"swift flowing river\") is a major river in Canada, about {{convert|550|km|-1|}} long, flowing roughly eastward across [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] to empty into [[Lake Winnipeg]].

[[York boats]] and [[canoes]] formed the primary means of travel during the fur trade period.\n\nIn the mid-19th century [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|Metis]] settlements became important along stretches of the rivers (notably at the [[Southbranch Settlement]], Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and [[St. Albert, Alberta]]).\n\n[[Riverboats]] were introduced from the [[Red River of the North]] in the 19th century and remained an important means of transportation until the 1890s and the coming of railways to the area.<ref>{{Citation|publisher =Clark |isbn =|location =Chicago |title =Saskatchewan and its people Volume 1 (Steamboating in the old days)|url =http://www.ourroots.ca/page.aspx?id=163685&amp;qryID=8cece23b-1e2e-4366-93c5-1c1db65da312|author =Hawkes, John |date = 1924}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest settlements in Saskatchewan and Alberta generally were established around the rivers. Examples include [[Fort Edmonton]] ([[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]), [[Fort Battleford]] ([[Battleford, Saskatchewan]]), Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and [[Cumberland House, Saskatchewan]].\n\nFur trade on the lower river: The first European to ascended the river as far as the forks was [[Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La V\u00e9rendrye]] in spring 1739. The main posts on the river were (landmarks in parentheses): (Saskatchewan River Forks) [[Fort Le Jonqui\u00e8re]] (?), Fort de la Corne, Cumberland House, Saskatchewan, (The Pas):second Fort Paskoya, (inflow to Cedar Lake:) first [[Fort Paskoya]] and second [[Fort Bourbon]], (Cedar Lake), (inflow to Lake Winnipeg:) Grand Rapids, Manitoba, and first Fort Bourbon. There were also a number of temporary posts that have left few records. By far the most important post was Cumberland House which was the depot for the route northwest to the rich Athabasca country. To the west, the North Saskatchewan had the greatest number of posts.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Saskatchewan River is featured in [[The Arrogant Worms]]' song \"[[The Last Saskatchewan Pirate]]\", which implies incorrectly that it flows past [[Regina, Saskatchewan]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of longest rivers of Canada]]\n* [[List of rivers of Manitoba]]\n* [[List of rivers of Saskatchewan]]\n* [[List of rivers of Alberta]]\n* [[Manitoba Hydro]]\n* [[Watershed management]]\n* [[Saskatchewan River Delta]]\n* [[Saskatchewan River fur trade]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Myrna Kostash, \"Reading the River: A Traveller's Companion to the North Saskatchewan River\",2005\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ourroots.ca/page.aspx?id=163685&amp;qryID=8cece23b-1e2e-4366-93c5-1c1db65da312 Saskatchewan and its people Volume 1 (Steamboating in the old days)]\n* [http://www.ccge.org/resources/rivers_of_canada/saskatchewan_river/default.asp Canadian Council for Geographic Education page with a series of articles on the history of the Saskatchewan River].\n* [http://www.saskriverbasin.ca/ Partners FOR the Saskatchewan River Basin]\n* [http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/saskatchewan_river.html Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan]\n\n{{Commons category|Saskatchewan River}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Saskatchewan River]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Manitoba]]\n[[Category:Tributaries of Hudson Bay]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Typo fixing, replaced: to ascended \u2192 to ascend", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_River"}

He is a disciple at Konronsan and Genshitenson's best pupil.  He received the Hoshin project from Genshitenson, and became a strategist to defeat the collapsing Yin Dynasty and to help the Buo of the Shu. Although he wears very strange clothes, he has the sharpest mind in Konron.  Taikoubo was the son of the leader of the Kyo tribe, and was named Ryo Bo, but he lost his parents in a Yin human hunt. After twelve years on earth, he became a disciple, and with 30 years of study, attained Senin level power. Though, Taikobo is still an average Senin with a low rank, he is the personal disciple of the leader of Konronsan, Genshitenson, so his position in the Senkai (spirit world) is high.  At the beginning of the story, he receives a retractable baton-shaped Paopei (Magic Tool) called Dashinben, which grants him the power to create and control wind. Later, because of the Orb of Revival, the Dashinben gets an upgrade, a larger shape and improved abilities.  Eventually, his Dashinben is upgraded by fusing with the paopei 'Kyokoki' that can absorb Konronsan's energy for recovery, and the super paopei, 'Taikyokuzu,' that negates all other paopei's power,draw magic seals and can heal injuries. Basically, his speciality is fighting by wits, and using cleverness to swindle his enemies, so that sometimes even his allies boo him. His constant companion, main ally, and mode of transportation is the spirit beast, Supushan. Taikobo's real age is at least 72 years old, and contrary to his boyish appearance, love of peaches and sweet things, and dislike of shots and medicine, his speech and mannerisms are that of an old man. His personality is aloof, and he has a strong belief in a peaceful human world. Additionally, he is left-handed, but during the fight with Inkou (the older), he lost his left arm up to the elbow. Soon after, he received an artificial arm created by Taiitsu Shinjin.\n\n:Although Taikobo is often criticized by other characters for being very 'un-protagonist-like,' he was voted first in a ''Jump magazine'' character poll twice. From time to time, the author changes his drawing into a simple shape, with a circle and two points for a head and a stick figure like body. The last volume of the Kanzenban came with a limited edition plush toy of this form.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Suupuushan|\u56db\u4e0d\u8c61|''S\u016bp\u016bshan''|''Sibuxiang''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Y\u014dichi Masukawa]] (1st series), [[Takahiro Sakurai]] (2nd series)|Steve Flanagin (1st series), Griffin Puatu<ref name=\"castlist\"/> (2nd series)}}\n:Taikoubou's spirit beast who has the appearance of a white hippo (his original design was more like a dragon). Suupuushan uses the inflection \"~su\" at the end of sentences. He has adult-like and serious personality. Originally, he lived in his birthplace in the Suupuu valley in Northern Europe with his parents, Suupuupapa and Suupuumama, but Suupuupapa, Genshitenson's spirit beast, was greatly wounded in a battle with Chou Koumei, and was forced to retire. In order to support the family, a young Suupuushan went off to work. From the beginning, he carries the Orb of Revival, which he uses to come back to life in a temporary adult form after he was killed in the battle with Chou Koumei. In his adult form, his voice and speech patterns change, and, like all adults of his species, can eat paopei energy. The battle with Bunchuu activates a licence designating Supushan as an adult, and from that point forward, he is able to transform at will. Later, he receives a second Orb of Revival, recovered from the ruins of Kingo Island.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Nezha|Nataku]]||\u54ea\u5412|''Nezha''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dki Miyata]] (1st series), [[Makoto Furukawa]] (2nd series)|Derek Wade (1st series), Zach Aguilar (2nd series)}}\n:A living human-paopei (divine superweapon) hybrid, he was once dead and now revived, with the aid of Taiitsu, built via lotus plant. He exists largely to fight and is more \"directed\" by Taikoubou (provided that he actually listens), albeit at times that becomes hazardous to Taikoubou's health, as Nataku has no qualms about shooting his weapons at people. He can fly thanks to his special paopei, Fuukarin, boots which have a metal wheel under each one. He also possesses a weapon paopei in the shape of 2 iron bracelets called Kenkonen, which work as homing missiles and striking his target with tremendous force. Throughout the manga, Nataku gets several \"up grades\", namely from Taiitsu who gives him new weapons. Towards the end, Nataku becomes paopei \"customized\" and has the super paopei Kinkousen (previously wielded by Chou Koumei) which allows him to summon Dragons made of light.\n\n:Nataku may seem cold and emotionless, but, according to himself, he has a serious grudge against his father who was responsible for destroying the grave his mother made for him when he died; Nataku has had many chances to kill his father, but never did. Nataku also has a soft spot for his mother, and also for Ko Hiko's fourth son Tensho, whom he took care of after most of his family died.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Erlang Shen|Yozen]]|\u694a\u6229|''Y\u014dzen''|''Yang Jian''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Susumu Chiba]] (1st series), [[Y\u016bichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Y\u016bichi Nakamura]] (2nd series)|Ben Wolfe (1st series), [[Todd Haberkorn]] (2nd series)}}\n:A disciple at Konronsan.  Actually, he is the son of the leader of Kingoto, Tsutenkyoushu and a yokai [[senin]].  He surpassed his teacher and has power equal to a senin, but because he does not want to take a student, remains one himself.  His senin name is Kenseijiro Shinkun.  He is a person of extreme confidence and takes great pride in his appearance.  At first, he doubted Taikoubou's strength, and proposed a test, but finally approved of his means and became an ally.  He has the ability to change into the body of any living thing, although his favorite transformation is that of Dakki.  When transforming into a doshi or senin, he can use the other's paopei, but if they are a higher level, he cannot copy them perfectly.  Because of his ability to transform without using paopei, even the Seninkai call him the genius disciple.  Halfway through the series, he learns how to use a partial transformation and only change part of his body.  This way, he can copy multiple of paopei at the same time.  When he becomes hanyotai, his strength is increased.  His own paopei are 'Sansento,' a giant fork shaped weapon that can release a shock wave, and 'Kotenken' a paopei with the appearance of a dog which lives in his sleeve and can be called to attack enemies or used as a riding mount to fly.  Towards the end, he obtained the cape super paopei 'Rikukonhan,' which wraps up enemies so that not even their soul escapes.  After the final battle, he founded the new Seninkai.\n\n;{{nihongo|Bukichi|\u6b66\u5409||''Wu Ji''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Naomi Nagasawa]] (1st series), [[Yuuma Uchida]] (2nd series)|Laura Stahl (2nd series)}}\n:A tennendoushi who used to be a woodcutter in Seiki.  He proclaims himself as Taikobo's disciple.  His aspiration to become Taikobo's disciple was quickly refused, but later, he saves Taikobo's life, and eventually travels together with him.  His personality is natural and true to himself.  His eyesight is 10.0, can perceive [[infra-red]] light, and can see in the dark.  He has the ability to run on water.  When he is overly emotional, his fighting strength increases a surprising amount, even enough to injure senin.  He has had an abundance of unusual part time jobs, including elephant trainer and bird breeder. Although no one except sendo should be able to touch paopei, Bukichi is seen many times coming into contact with them.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Leizhenzi|Raishinshi]]||\u96f7\u9707\u5b50|''Leizhenzi''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Rica Matsumoto]]|Craig Saper}}\n:As an infant, he was saved by Ki Sho and became his 100th child.  He only had one senin bone, however, he became the disciple of the eccentric Konronsan senin, Unchushi.  Under his experiments, Raishinshi's skin became black, and he grew the wind and lighting controlling, wing-shaped paopei, Tensoyoku, from his back. With that power, he successfully escaped from Unchushi's tyrannical experiments, and thought to return to his father, but concerned with his current form, he instead gained fame as thief for the people, during which he fought and lost to Taikoubou. At this chance, he disbanded his group of thieves, and after training in Konronsan, he participated in the Shu revolution.\n\n:Because he was busy having his wings remodeled (increasing power and upgrading to three pairs), he has proportionately less screen time than other characters. However, toward the final battle, his number of appearances increase. In the manga version, by the time of his father's, Ki Sho's, death, they had not met, but in the anime they are reunited.

His body can endure very strong poisons, and he has the force of will to withstand mind control by a super paopei, as he is a tennendoushi (a human with senin bones).  For generations, his ancestors served the Yin, so he was loyal to Chuo, but could not withstand Dakki's conniving.  He met Taikobo who came to defeat Dakki, and they immediately trusted and respected one other.  Some years later, Hiko lost his wife, Kashi and his sister, Koshi, to Dakki's schemes and decided to leave the Yin.  After which, he was appointed Kaikoku Buseiou by Ki Shou of the Shuu.  He has a rough and cheerful personality.  Before he left for the Shuu, he was friends with Bunchuu, however, afterwards, they were irreconcilable and ended up fighting during the Sennin war, during which Hiko was hoshin-ed.

One of the Juunisen, Seikyo Dotoku Shinkun, discovered and recruited him as a doushi.  He appeared to save his father, who was being chased by pursuers from the Yin rebellion.  He has his father's upstanding spirit and fighting skills, but his mother's, Kashi's, black hair.  He uses the inflection \"-sa\" at the end of a sentence, and is always smoking a cigarette.  He is master of the lightsaber-like paopei, 'Bakuya no Hoken,' and later receives a fire-emitting, boomerang paopei called 'Karyuhyo,' and the tiny 'Sanshintei.'  Lastly, he could use the 'Bakuya no Hoken 2,' which has a blade on either side of the handle.  Because of his absolute self confidence in close combat, and too much of a warrior's spirit, he extremely hates to lose.  As a result of a cursed wound received from one of Chou Koumei's yokai senin subordinates, his life was shortened. He fought Chuo in order to avenge his mother, but the moment he defeated him, he lost his resolve. Immediately after, he was run through by the sword of a nameless soldier and hoshin-ed; this only happens in the manga, however, as he lives in the anime and even appears to have a love interest.

She is not good at telling things like hippos or Capybaras, but she gets along with Supushan and calls Dokoson 'Honey.' Her Paopei, 'Gokoseki,' has the ability that once thrown, it will always hit its target, and give them the appearance of wearing too much make-up, but there was a limiter that suppressed its power to 1/5. When the limiter was canceled, its destructive power increased.

Despite that, Taiitsu is \"bullied\" by Nataku for repair of his broken paopei, or demanding new paopei (however, Taiitsu still seems to view Nataku as a son, and cares deeply for him). Even though Taiitsu is rather weak, he is acknowledged as one of the Junisen because of his ability to create paopei; many things like the Kokinrikushi (the flying robot paopei) and Konron 2 were made by Taiitsu. Although he has made many paopei, his main one is a nutshell-like protection paopei (its main use is to shut Nataku in whenever he disobeys him).\n\n:Taiitsu also provides some of the comic relief in the story in that he is scared of heights, and that he will always look for the camera and look into it while talking.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fugen Shinjin|\u666e\u8ce2\u771f\u4eba||''Pu-Xian Zhen-Ren''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]] (1st series), [[Nobunaga Shimazaki]] (2nd series)|Jon S.

Fugen is also the one who gave Taikobo a straight fishhook, saying that the fish shouldn't suffer just for the sake of Taikobo thinking. He is a Sennin well-versed in chemistry, and his paopei is one which controls the atoms. He is one of the Konron Junisen, the one who replaced Nento Doujin after his faked death.

The vixen demon is 5,000 years old, very beautiful and intelligent to the point when she could be labeled as \"genius\". In the manga, her character is more complex, but in the anime, she is pictured as the evil, selfish Empress who wants nothing but power and cares only about herself and her two sisters (not blood related, however) O Kijin and Ko Kibi.\n:She is capable of using multiple paopeis at once (ex: two fans, the Veil of Temptation). Her most important paopei is the Veil of Temptation and she is rarely seen without it. It emits a strong scent which affects all men and bring them under control. In order to resist the spell, one needs an iron will. After her descend into the Human World, she took many names (Ou Shi, Bakki) and seduced the leaders, living in luxury. At first, she was content to throw over the top and overpriced parties, but after several hundreds of years, she mastered the Temptation spell and began her reign of cruelty.\n:Dakki obviously enjoys other people's torment. She even built torture devices like the Horaku or the Taibon (a pit full of poisonous snakes). She is a very good actress and is capable of hiding her emotions. Another ability would be her good knowledge of human psychology. In the manga, when Chu O's first wife was imprisoned, Dakki knew the woman could not stand the pressure any longer and allowed the guard to give the true empress anything she wished for, knowing that she will ask for a dagger in order to commit suicide. She predicted Bunchu's reaction when Ko Hiko left Choka. Bunchu and Hiko were friends and Bunchu would rather kill Hiko himself than let Dakki decide how and when it would be done.\n:She shows sympathy only to her sisters and to her adopted son, Ou Eki/O Tenkun. Cruel as Dakki might be, she turned out not to be entirely evil in the end. In the manga the reason Dakki worked for Jyoka was at first due to her desire for power. But after she learned about the Ancients and that they fused with the planet, she was deeply affected and so her secret goal became to obtain Jyoka's body so she too may become one with the world.

She acts in a silly manner most of the time and does not understand much, but is caring towards her elder and younger sister (in the manga, she saves O Kijin after she lost a battle and returned to her original form). She has a major crush on Supushan and even surrendered her Nyoi Hagoromo to Taikobo in order to prevent him from hurting Suupuu (of course, that was one of Taikobo's tricks). She has a transformation ability which rivals Yozen's. With the aid of her Hagoromo, she can transform into anyone, even Dakki. Kousen in Houshin Engi Gaiden is her younger brother.

Bunchuu has been the Yin's strategist and protector for 300 years and he had 30 emperors under his care. He was a disciple of T-san and became the second strongest under T-san. Determined to protect the Yin Dynasty, he was a formidable enemy. In the anime, he was the first who killed Dakki, after the Yin dynasty had fallen. His only close friend was Hiko, whose death prompted him to render his obsession meaningless and subsequently chose to end his own life. His spirit travels back to Choka and he bows one last time to Emperor Chu O. Then, he travels to the Yin burial grounds and sees the spirit of Shuushi, who thanks him for \"doing such a great job\" with the dynasty. Bunchuu's spirit is seen later in the Houshindai, when he told to his follower Cho Kei to find his own path.\n:In the anime Bunchu does not die.

Kashi is considered to be one of China's most beautiful and graceful women. Her beauty is renowned and reached even Chu O's ear, triggering the unfortunate events that led to her tragic death. She loves her husband deeply and takes great pride in being his wife. In the anime, she took care of the princes while their mother was imprisoned and even went out to face Dakki, in hope of getting Kyohi freed. She is pictured as being a kind, loving and at the same time strong woman, who endangered herself for the sake of the princes, whom she considered \"the country's future\".\n:In the manga, her character gets less scenes and her most important one is when she visits her sister-in-law and falls into Dakki's trap (chapter 26).\n:Unlike the manga, in the anime her soul is sent to the Hoshindai.\n\n;{{nihongo|Koshi|\u9ec4\u6c0f|''K\u014dshi''|''Huang Shi''}}\n*{{Voiced by|Yuko Kato (1st series), [[Mikako Komatsu]] (2nd series)|Unknown (1st series), [[Erika Harlacher]] (2nd series)}}\n:In the novel, she was called \"Concubine Huang\" and was one of many Chu O's wives. She is the younger sister of Buseio Ko Hiko. In the manga, she was confined to the imperial harem, but in the anime, she seems to be free to go wherever she wants. Koshi is an admirable character: she tried (in vain) to save the Empress from the soldiers who came to arrest her and even blocked their way in a desperate attempt to prevent them from taking away the Empress. She was the one who took the two princes and placed them in Kashi's care. She is very close to Kashi and tried to protect her from the Emperor's eyes; she was outraged when she died because Chu O violated the rite between an Emperor and his vassals. Realising that Dakki will hold her as a hostage against her brother, she threw herself off the balcony and granted Ko Hiko his freedom.\n:Unlike the manga, in the anime her soul was sent to the Houshindai.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kyohi|\u59dc\u5983|''Ky\u014dhi''|''Jiang Fei''}}\n*{{Voiced by|Naoko Miura|Ellie McBride}}\n:The lovely daughter of the King of the East, she was considered the most beautiful woman in the empire by her husband (that is, before he saw Dakki and Kashi). Mother of the two princes and legal wife of the Emperor. After Dakki appeared and took over the Emperor's mind, the Empress became very depressed and could often be found crying. After her father was killed, she was accused of treason and imprisoned. Her royal pride and perhaps desperation determined her to commit suicide in her cell. In the anime, Kyouhi not only looks totally different from her manga counterpart, but she's a more lively character. Described by Buseio as being one of \"the most refined ladies of the country\" she was a kind, fair and generous person, loved by her people. At the end of Hoshin Engi, there are some family scenes from the life of the royal couple. She always stood by her husband's side and they were shown having a happy marriage. But after Dakki showed up, Kyohi became sad and placed a lot of pressure on her son, Inchao's shoulders, because she wanted him to become a good emperor and an honorable man, \"just like his father\". After Dakki accused her of plotting to kill the Emperor, she is imprisoned. Meanwhile, Kashi takes care of her children, thus becoming Dakki's next target. When she found out about Kashi's summoning, Kyohi foresaw Dakki's plan and tried to stop her by ordering her servant to go and call Buseio immediately. Buseiou and Bunchuu tried to make a plan to save the Empress, but failed to present something viable in time. Dakki convinced the Emperor to set his wife free and summoned her to the throne room. Kyohi defies Dakki, but in the end, she is forced by the Emperor to accept her gift. The gift proves to be a dagger that sticks to the hand magically. Scared, Kyohi hides the dagger from the inquiring Emperor, but eventually she unwillingly reveals the dagger. Framed, she sees no other way out and stabs herself with the dagger. Her last request was for Buseiou to take care of her children.\n:Both the manga and the anime Kyohis were sent to the Hoshin Dai. The only difference was that the manga Kyohi's human soul flew to the platform of souls, determining Taikobou to return to the Sennin World to investigate.

At the beginning of the manga, he prefers to stay outside of the affair, as to watch it from an angle, and see how things turn out. He is also the first doushi listed on the Hoshin, and is also the first to confront Taikobo (and asks him with an air of excitement if he is on the list to begin with). He, like Taikobo, has a spirit beast named Koutenko. Shinkyohyo's only paopei is the Raikouben; which he has only used against Taikobo. Raikouben's power was so tremendous that when Shinkyohyo first used it, he himself said that he was shocked at its abilities. Towards the middle of the series, he decides to side with Dakki, and persuades Chuuo's eldest son to fight for the Yin. Eventually, though, when Dakki tries to escape Taikobo, she is attacked by Shinkohyo's Raikouben, and helps weaken her when Taikobo slices her in half. Shinkyoho was the only doushi on the Hoshin list that did not get sent to Houshindai, and was still on Earth with Taikobo in the last chapter.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Taishang Laojun|Taijo Roukun (Roshi)]]|\u592a\u4e0a\u8001\u541b (\u8001\u5b50)|''Taij\u014d R\u014dkun'' (''R\u014dshi'')|''Tai-Shang Lao-Jun (Lao-Shi)''}}\n:One of the Sandai Sennin, he is extremely lazy and spends most of his time sleeping.

She has the paopei \"Sangashashoku\" and \"Shihoken.\" Her designs were to create the earth's history exactly the same as her world that evolved to the point where it was destroyed. The other Original People, not wishing for history to repeat itself, argued against this plan and put Jyoka in an eternal sleep, while they merged with the life of the planet, eventually creating the Sennin and Yokai. Jyoka has the ability to work behind the scenes as a spirit, while her body still sleeps, and subtly changes the world to more resemble her own, but when the histories diverge, she simply destroys the world and starts over. No one knows how long this cycle has been continuing until the current history. She has the ability to split her soul, which along with her regenerative abilities, make her a very difficult enemy to destroy completely. In the final battle, her body is taken over by Dakki before she can reach it, and Dakki uses that body to become the Great Mother and merge with the earth, like the other Original People.\n\n:There is much foreshadowing of Jyoka's appearance throughout the manga; for instance, Chou Koumei's ship is called the 'Queen Joker.'\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Fuxi|Fukki]]|\u4f0f\u7fb2||''Fu Xi''}}\n:One of the Original People, and the creator of the Houshin plan.

Fearing Jyoka's revival, he chose to remain and not merge with the earth like the other Original People. He became a human named Ou Eki and approached the Sandai Sennin with the Houshin plan, becoming Genshitenson's disciple. Genshitenson, realizing O Eki's ability to split his soul, divided him into two, returning one to O Eki (who would be traded with Tsuten Kyoshu for Yozen, and would become Otenkun) and keeping the other, eventually placing it in Ryo Bo, a deceased baby of the Kyou tribe (who would become Taikobou). Ou Eki loses his memories of being one of the Original People, and does not regain them until Taikobo and Otenkun merge to create Fukki. After merging, Fukki(who still identifies himself as Taikobo since he is the dominant personality) retains the ability to split,and can return to being Taikobo and Otenkun at will.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Shinnou]]|\u795e\u8fb2||''Shennong''}}\n:One of the Original People to come to Earth, and the owner of the mysterious Super-paopei Kinkouza (Super-paopei help user travel through time).

He is a disciple at Konronsan and Genshitenson's best pupil.  He received the Hoshin project from Genshitenson, and became a strategist to defeat the collapsing Yin Dynasty and to help the Buo of the Shu. Although he wears very strange clothes, he has the sharpest mind in Konron.  Taikoubo was the son of the leader of the Kyo tribe, and was named Ryo Bo, but he lost his parents in a Yin human hunt. After twelve years on earth, he became a disciple, and with 30 years of study, attained Senin level power. Though, Taikobo is still an average Senin with a low rank, he is the personal disciple of the leader of Konronsan, Genshitenson, so his position in the Senkai (spirit world) is high.  At the beginning of the story, he receives a retractable baton-shaped Paopei (Magic Tool) called Dashinben, which grants him the power to create and control wind. Later, because of the Orb of Revival, the Dashinben gets an upgrade, a larger shape and improved abilities.  Eventually, his Dashinben is upgraded by fusing with the paopei 'Kyokoki' that can absorb Konronsan's energy for recovery, and the super paopei, 'Taikyokuzu,' that negates all other paopei's power,draw magic seals and can heal injuries. Basically, his speciality is fighting by wits, and using cleverness to swindle his enemies, so that sometimes even his allies boo him. His constant companion, main ally, and mode of transportation is the spirit beast, Supushan. Taikobo's real age is at least 72 years old, and contrary to his boyish appearance, love of peaches and sweet things, and dislike of shots and medicine, his speech and mannerisms are that of an old man. His personality is aloof, and he has a strong belief in a peaceful human world. Additionally, he is left-handed, but during the fight with Inkou (the older), he lost his left arm up to the elbow. Soon after, he received an artificial arm created by Taiitsu Shinjin.\n\n:Although Taikobo is often criticized by other characters for being very 'un-protagonist-like,' he was voted first in a ''Jump magazine'' character poll twice. From time to time, the author changes his drawing into a simple shape, with a circle and two points for a head and a stick figure like body. The last volume of the Kanzenban came with a limited edition plush toy of this form.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Suupuushan|\u56db\u4e0d\u8c61|''S\u016bp\u016bshan''|''Sibuxiang''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Y\u014dichi Masukawa]] (1st series), [[Takahiro Sakurai]] (2nd series)|Steve Flanagin (1st series), Tyler Walker<ref name=\"castlist\"/> (2nd series)}}\n:Taikoubou's spirit beast who has the appearance of a white hippo (his original design was more like a dragon). Suupuushan uses the inflection \"~su\" at the end of sentences. He has adult-like and serious personality. Originally, he lived in his birthplace in the Suupuu valley in Northern Europe with his parents, Suupuupapa and Suupuumama, but Suupuupapa, Genshitenson's spirit beast, was greatly wounded in a battle with Chou Koumei, and was forced to retire. In order to support the family, a young Suupuushan went off to work. From the beginning, he carries the Orb of Revival, which he uses to come back to life in a temporary adult form after he was killed in the battle with Chou Koumei. In his adult form, his voice and speech patterns change, and, like all adults of his species, can eat paopei energy. The battle with Bunchuu activates a licence designating Supushan as an adult, and from that point forward, he is able to transform at will. Later, he receives a second Orb of Revival, recovered from the ruins of Kingo Island.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Nezha|Nataku]]||\u54ea\u5412|''Nezha''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dki Miyata]] (1st series), [[Makoto Furukawa]] (2nd series)|Derek Wade (1st series), [[Justin Briner]] (2nd series)}}\n:A living human-paopei (divine superweapon) hybrid, he was once dead and now revived, with the aid of Taiitsu, built via lotus plant. He exists largely to fight and is more \"directed\" by Taikoubou (provided that he actually listens), albeit at times that becomes hazardous to Taikoubou's health, as Nataku has no qualms about shooting his weapons at people. He can fly thanks to his special paopei, Fuukarin, boots which have a metal wheel under each one. He also possesses a weapon paopei in the shape of 2 iron bracelets called Kenkonen, which work as homing missiles and striking his target with tremendous force. Throughout the manga, Nataku gets several \"up grades\", namely from Taiitsu who gives him new weapons. Towards the end, Nataku becomes paopei \"customized\" and has the super paopei Kinkousen (previously wielded by Chou Koumei) which allows him to summon Dragons made of light.\n\n:Nataku may seem cold and emotionless, but, according to himself, he has a serious grudge against his father who was responsible for destroying the grave his mother made for him when he died; Nataku has had many chances to kill his father, but never did. Nataku also has a soft spot for his mother, and also for Ko Hiko's fourth son Tensho, whom he took care of after most of his family died.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Erlang Shen|Yozen]]|\u694a\u6229|''Y\u014dzen''|''Yang Jian''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Susumu Chiba]] (1st series), [[Y\u016bichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Y\u016bichi Nakamura]] (2nd series)|Ben Wolfe (1st series), Ian Ferguson (2nd series)}}\n:A disciple at Konronsan.  Actually, he is the son of the leader of Kingoto, Tsutenkyoushu and a yokai [[senin]].  He surpassed his teacher and has power equal to a senin, but because he does not want to take a student, remains one himself.  His senin name is Kenseijiro Shinkun.  He is a person of extreme confidence and takes great pride in his appearance.  At first, he doubted Taikoubou's strength, and proposed a test, but finally approved of his means and became an ally.  He has the ability to change into the body of any living thing, although his favorite transformation is that of Dakki.  When transforming into a doshi or senin, he can use the other's paopei, but if they are a higher level, he cannot copy them perfectly.  Because of his ability to transform without using paopei, even the Seninkai call him the genius disciple.  Halfway through the series, he learns how to use a partial transformation and only change part of his body.  This way, he can copy multiple of paopei at the same time.  When he becomes hanyotai, his strength is increased.  His own paopei are 'Sansento,' a giant fork shaped weapon that can release a shock wave, and 'Kotenken' a paopei with the appearance of a dog which lives in his sleeve and can be called to attack enemies or used as a riding mount to fly.  Towards the end, he obtained the cape super paopei 'Rikukonhan,' which wraps up enemies so that not even their soul escapes.  After the final battle, he founded the new Seninkai.\n\n;{{nihongo|Bukichi|\u6b66\u5409||''Wu Ji''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Naomi Nagasawa]] (1st series), [[Yuuma Uchida]] (2nd series)|Coby Lewin (2nd series)}}\n:A tennendoushi who used to be a woodcutter in Seiki.  He proclaims himself as Taikobo's disciple.  His aspiration to become Taikobo's disciple was quickly refused, but later, he saves Taikobo's life, and eventually travels together with him.  His personality is natural and true to himself.  His eyesight is 10.0, can perceive [[infra-red]] light, and can see in the dark.  He has the ability to run on water.  When he is overly emotional, his fighting strength increases a surprising amount, even enough to injure senin.  He has had an abundance of unusual part time jobs, including elephant trainer and bird breeder. Although no one except sendo should be able to touch paopei, Bukichi is seen many times coming into contact with them.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Leizhenzi|Raishinshi]]||\u96f7\u9707\u5b50|''Leizhenzi''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Rica Matsumoto]]|Craig Saper}}\n:As an infant, he was saved by Ki Sho and became his 100th child.  He only had one senin bone, however, he became the disciple of the eccentric Konronsan senin, Unchushi.  Under his experiments, Raishinshi's skin became black, and he grew the wind and lighting controlling, wing-shaped paopei, Tensoyoku, from his back. With that power, he successfully escaped from Unchushi's tyrannical experiments, and thought to return to his father, but concerned with his current form, he instead gained fame as thief for the people, during which he fought and lost to Taikoubou. At this chance, he disbanded his group of thieves, and after training in Konronsan, he participated in the Shu revolution.\n\n:Because he was busy having his wings remodeled (increasing power and upgrading to three pairs), he has proportionately less screen time than other characters. However, toward the final battle, his number of appearances increase. In the manga version, by the time of his father's, Ki Sho's, death, they had not met, but in the anime they are reunited. Raishinshi is a comedy relief type character with a hot temper.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Huang Feihu|Ko Hiko]]|\u9ec4\u98db\u864e|''K\u014d Hiko''|''Huang Fei-Hu''|Buseiou, ''Wucheng Wang''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Kazunari Tanaka]] (1st series), [[Yoshimasa Hosoya]] (2nd series)|Christopher Loveless (1st series), [[Brad Hawkins]]<ref name=\"castlist\"/> (2nd series)}}\n:Originally, the Yin's Chinkoku Buseio.  He is the father of Ko Tenka and Ko Tensho.  His superhuman is strength is such that he can destroy even paopei with his bare hands.  His body can endure very strong poisons, and he has the force of will to withstand mind control by a super paopei, as he is a tennendoushi (a human with senin bones).  For generations, his ancestors served the Yin, so he was loyal to Chuo, but could not withstand Dakki's conniving.  He met Taikobo who came to defeat Dakki, and they immediately trusted and respected one other.  Some years later, Hiko lost his wife, Kashi and his sister, Koshi, to Dakki's schemes and decided to leave the Yin.  After which, he was appointed Kaikoku Buseiou by Ki Shou of the Shuu.  He has a rough and cheerful personality.  Before he left for the Shuu, he was friends with Bunchuu, however, afterwards, they were irreconcilable and ended up fighting during the Sennin war, during which Hiko was hoshin-ed.

One of the Juunisen, Seikyo Dotoku Shinkun, discovered and recruited him as a doushi.  He appeared to save his father, who was being chased by pursuers from the Yin rebellion.  He has his father's upstanding spirit and fighting skills, but his mother's, Kashi's, black hair.  He uses the inflection \"-sa\" at the end of a sentence, and is always smoking a cigarette.  He is master of the lightsaber-like paopei, 'Bakuya no Hoken,' and later receives a fire-emitting, boomerang paopei called 'Karyuhyo,' and the tiny 'Sanshintei.'  Lastly, he could use the 'Bakuya no Hoken 2,' which has a blade on either side of the handle.  Because of his absolute self confidence in close combat, and too much of a warrior's spirit, he extremely hates to lose.  As a result of a cursed wound received from one of Chou Koumei's yokai senin subordinates, his life was shortened. He fought Chuo in order to avenge his mother, but the moment he defeated him, he lost his resolve. Immediately after, he was run through by the sword of a nameless soldier and hoshin-ed; this only happens in the manga, however, as he lives in the anime and even appears to have a love interest. He has a rough attitude and would jump to conclusions.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ko Tensho|\u9ec4\u5929\u7965|''K\u014d Tensh\u014d''|''Huang Tian-Xiang''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Sachi Matsumoto]] (PS2 Game), Daiki Kobayashi (2nd series)|[[Alison Viktorin]] (2nd series)}}\n:Ko Hiko's fourth and youngest son, a Tennendoshi who inherited his father's strengths.  He views Nataku as a friend and older brother, perhaps ignorant of the destructive tendencies Nataku possesses. After his mother, aunt, father and brother die, Tensho closed himself off, until Nataku told him that he would take care of Tensho, and that he would never lose or die.

As a result of falling in love with Dokouson, she turned traitor and joined with the Shu along with her father, Tokyuko. The wrong impression is a violent, wholeheartedly bright young girl. She is not good at telling things like hippos or Capybaras, but she gets along with Supushan and calls Dokoson 'Honey.' Her Paopei, 'Gokoseki,' has the ability that once thrown, it will always hit its target, and give them the appearance of wearing too much make-up, but there was a limiter that suppressed its power to 1/5. When the limiter was canceled, its destructive power increased.

His sense of touch is finely attuned, and he uses that in order to fight.

He cares very deeply about his half-sister, Ryukitsu Koshu, to the point that other characters comment on his devotion.\n\n:Fujiryu re-used an earlier design he made for the game \"The Great Sennin World War\" and recolored the character to create Nentou.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Taiyi Zhenren|Taiitsu Shinjin]]|\u592a\u4e59\u771f\u4eba||''Tai-Yi Zhen-Ren''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Daisuke Sakaguchi]] (1st Series), [[Daisuke Hirakawa]] (2nd Series)|Orin Serivello (1st Series), Matt Shipman (2nd Series)}}\n:Taiitsu Shinjin is the machine-crazy Sennin who is responsible for putting the Reijyu into Inshi's (Li Sei's wife, and Nataku's mother) stomach, creating the birth of the paopei human Nataku; in a sense, he is Nataku's father. Despite that, Taiitsu is \"bullied\" by Nataku for repair of his broken paopei, or demanding new paopei (however, Taiitsu still seems to view Nataku as a son, and cares deeply for him). Even though Taiitsu is rather weak, he is acknowledged as one of the Junisen because of his ability to create paopei; many things like the Kokinrikushi (the flying robot paopei) and Konron 2 were made by Taiitsu. Although he has made many paopei, his main one is a nutshell-like protection paopei (its main use is to shut Nataku in whenever he disobeys him).\n\n:Taiitsu also provides some of the comic relief in the story in that he is scared of heights, and that he will always look for the camera and look into it while talking.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fugen Shinjin|\u666e\u8ce2\u771f\u4eba||''Pu-Xian Zhen-Ren''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]] (1st series), [[Nobunaga Shimazaki]] (2nd series)|Jon S.

Fugen is also the one who gave Taikobo a straight fishhook, saying that the fish shouldn't suffer just for the sake of Taikobo thinking. He is a Sennin well-versed in chemistry, and his paopei is one which controls the atoms. He is one of the Konron Junisen, the one who replaced Nento Doujin after his faked death.

Before Dakki put him under his control, the Emperor cared about the people and his family but after the misfortunate marriage with the fox yokai, he lost all his senses.

The vixen demon is 5,000 years old, very beautiful and intelligent to the point when she could be labeled as \"genius\". In the manga, her character is more complex, but in the anime, she is pictured as the evil, selfish Empress who wants nothing but power and cares only about herself and her two sisters (not blood related, however) O Kijin and Ko Kibi.\n:She is capable of using multiple paopeis at once (ex: two fans, the Veil of Temptation). Her most important paopei is the Veil of Temptation and she is rarely seen without it. It emits a strong scent which affects all men and bring them under control. In order to resist the spell, one needs an iron will. After her descend into the Human World, she took many names (Ou Shi, Bakki) and seduced the leaders, living in luxury. At first, she was content to throw over the top and overpriced parties, but after several hundreds of years, she mastered the Temptation spell and began her reign of cruelty.\n:Dakki obviously enjoys other people's torment. She even built torture devices like the Horaku or the Taibon (a pit full of poisonous snakes). She is a very good actress and is capable of hiding her emotions. Another ability would be her good knowledge of human psychology. In the manga, when Chu O's first wife was imprisoned, Dakki knew the woman could not stand the pressure any longer and allowed the guard to give the true empress anything she wished for, knowing that she will ask for a dagger in order to commit suicide. She predicted Bunchu's reaction when Ko Hiko left Choka. Bunchu and Hiko were friends and Bunchu would rather kill Hiko himself than let Dakki decide how and when it would be done.\n:She shows sympathy only to her sisters and to her adopted son, Ou Eki/O Tenkun. Cruel as Dakki might be, she turned out not to be entirely evil in the end. In the manga the reason Dakki worked for Jyoka was at first due to her desire for power. But after she learned about the Ancients and that they fused with the planet, she was deeply affected and so her secret goal became to obtain Jyoka's body so she too may become one with the world.

She acts in a silly manner most of the time and does not understand much, but is caring towards her elder and younger sister (in the manga, she saves O Kijin after she lost a battle and returned to her original form). She has a major crush on Supushan and even surrendered her Nyoi Hagoromo to Taikobo in order to prevent him from hurting Suupuu (of course, that was one of Taikobo's tricks). She has a transformation ability which rivals Yozen's. With the aid of her Hagoromo, she can transform into anyone, even Dakki. Kousen in Houshin Engi Gaiden is her younger brother.

She is pictured as being a kind, loving and at the same time strong woman, who endangered herself for the sake of the princes, whom she considered \"the country's future\".\n:In the manga, her character gets less scenes and her most important one is when she visits her sister-in-law and falls into Dakki's trap (chapter 26).\n:Unlike the manga, in the anime her soul is sent to the Hoshindai.\n\n;{{nihongo|Koshi|\u9ec4\u6c0f|''K\u014dshi''|''Huang Shi''}}\n*{{Voiced by|Yuko Kato (1st series), [[Mikako Komatsu]] (2nd series)|Unknown (1st series), [[Felecia Angelle]] (2nd series)}}\n:In the novel, she was called \"Concubine Huang\" and was one of many Chu O's wives. She is the younger sister of Buseio Ko Hiko. In the manga, she was confined to the imperial harem, but in the anime, she seems to be free to go wherever she wants. Koshi is an admirable character: she tried (in vain) to save the Empress from the soldiers who came to arrest her and even blocked their way in a desperate attempt to prevent them from taking away the Empress. She was the one who took the two princes and placed them in Kashi's care. She is very close to Kashi and tried to protect her from the Emperor's eyes; she was outraged when she died because Chu O violated the rite between an Emperor and his vassals. Realising that Dakki will hold her as a hostage against her brother, she threw herself off the balcony and granted Ko Hiko his freedom.\n:Unlike the manga, in the anime her soul was sent to the Houshindai.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kyohi|\u59dc\u5983|''Ky\u014dhi''|''Jiang Fei''}}\n*{{Voiced by|Naoko Miura|Ellie McBride}}\n:The lovely daughter of the King of the East, she was considered the most beautiful woman in the empire by her husband (that is, before he saw Dakki and Kashi). Mother of the two princes and legal wife of the Emperor. After Dakki appeared and took over the Emperor's mind, the Empress became very depressed and could often be found crying. After her father was killed, she was accused of treason and imprisoned. Her royal pride and perhaps desperation determined her to commit suicide in her cell. In the anime, Kyouhi not only looks totally different from her manga counterpart, but she's a more lively character. Described by Buseio as being one of \"the most refined ladies of the country\" she was a kind, fair and generous person, loved by her people. At the end of Hoshin Engi, there are some family scenes from the life of the royal couple. She always stood by her husband's side and they were shown having a happy marriage. But after Dakki showed up, Kyohi became sad and placed a lot of pressure on her son, Inchao's shoulders, because she wanted him to become a good emperor and an honorable man, \"just like his father\". After Dakki accused her of plotting to kill the Emperor, she is imprisoned. Meanwhile, Kashi takes care of her children, thus becoming Dakki's next target. When she found out about Kashi's summoning, Kyohi foresaw Dakki's plan and tried to stop her by ordering her servant to go and call Buseio immediately. Buseiou and Bunchuu tried to make a plan to save the Empress, but failed to present something viable in time. Dakki convinced the Emperor to set his wife free and summoned her to the throne room. Kyohi defies Dakki, but in the end, she is forced by the Emperor to accept her gift. The gift proves to be a dagger that sticks to the hand magically. Scared, Kyohi hides the dagger from the inquiring Emperor, but eventually she unwillingly reveals the dagger. Framed, she sees no other way out and stabs herself with the dagger. Her last request was for Buseiou to take care of her children.\n:Both the manga and the anime Kyohis were sent to the Hoshin Dai. The only difference was that the manga Kyohi's human soul flew to the platform of souls, determining Taikobou to return to the Sennin World to investigate. Also, in the manga, her name changes into Kyoshi after the first half of the manga.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Unaffiliated===\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Shen Gong Bao|Shinkohyo]]|\u7533\u516c\u8c79|''Shink\u014dhy\u014d''|''Shen-Gong Bao''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Akira Ishida]](1st series), [[K\u014dsuke Toriumi]] (2nd series)|Jim Canning (1st series), Kyle Igneczi<ref name=\"castlist\"/> (2nd series)}}\n:The most powerful doushi under Dakki's Allies. At the beginning of the manga, he prefers to stay outside of the affair, as to watch it from an angle, and see how things turn out. He is also the first doushi listed on the Hoshin, and is also the first to confront Taikobo (and asks him with an air of excitement if he is on the list to begin with). He, like Taikobo, has a spirit beast named Koutenko. Shinkyohyo's only paopei is the Raikouben; which he has only used against Taikobo. Raikouben's power was so tremendous that when Shinkyohyo first used it, he himself said that he was shocked at its abilities. Towards the middle of the series, he decides to side with Dakki, and persuades Chuuo's eldest son to fight for the Yin. Eventually, though, when Dakki tries to escape Taikobo, she is attacked by Shinkohyo's Raikouben, and helps weaken her when Taikobo slices her in half. Shinkyoho was the only doushi on the Hoshin list that did not get sent to Houshindai, and was still on Earth with Taikobo in the last chapter.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Taishang Laojun|Taijo Roukun (Roshi)]]|\u592a\u4e0a\u8001\u541b (\u8001\u5b50)|''Taij\u014d R\u014dkun'' (''R\u014dshi'')|''Tai-Shang Lao-Jun (Lao-Shi)''}}\n:One of the Sandai Sennin, he is extremely lazy and spends most of his time sleeping. He created the resilient Taida suit to help him sleep peacefully.  He used to be Shinkouhyou's master.\n\n;[[Kousen]]\n:This character is only appear in Houshin Engi Gaiden manga version.\n:Kousen is Ko Kibi's younger brother. His real form is rare bird youkai Chikeisei. This bird youkai specie can travel freely in the past and future. It is the first time when Shinnou sent Taikobo and Shupushan to the past just at the moment when Kousen was resting up in same moment. He wanted to defeat Taikobo but unfortunately Taikobo didn't meet him in this moment. Kousen's appearance in past caused drastic change in Earth's history. Earth's history changed in large scale then Jyoka resurrected and destroyed the world.\n\n===The Original People===\n\n;{{nihongo|[[N\u00fcwa|Jyoka]]|\u5973\u5aa7||''N\u00fc Wa''}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Maaya Sakamoto]]|[[Monica Rial]]}}\n:The strongest of the five Original People to come to Earth and the ultimate antagonist of the story. She has the paopei \"Sangashashoku\" and \"Shihoken.\" Her designs were to create the earth's history exactly the same as her world that evolved to the point where it was destroyed. The other Original People, not wishing for history to repeat itself, argued against this plan and put Jyoka in an eternal sleep, while they merged with the life of the planet, eventually creating the Sennin and Yokai. Jyoka has the ability to work behind the scenes as a spirit, while her body still sleeps, and subtly changes the world to more resemble her own, but when the histories diverge, she simply destroys the world and starts over. No one knows how long this cycle has been continuing until the current history. She has the ability to split her soul, which along with her regenerative abilities, make her a very difficult enemy to destroy completely. In the final battle, her body is taken over by Dakki before she can reach it, and Dakki uses that body to become the Great Mother and merge with the earth, like the other Original People.\n\n:There is much foreshadowing of Jyoka's appearance throughout the manga; for instance, Chou Koumei's ship is called the 'Queen Joker.'\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Fuxi|Fukki]]|\u4f0f\u7fb2||''Fu Xi''}}\n:One of the Original People, and the creator of the Houshin plan. He has the peopei Dashinben, Taikyokuzu, Chusenjin (snow that damages the soul), and Bansenjin. Fearing Jyoka's revival, he chose to remain and not merge with the earth like the other Original People. He became a human named Ou Eki and approached the Sandai Sennin with the Houshin plan, becoming Genshitenson's disciple. Genshitenson, realizing O Eki's ability to split his soul, divided him into two, returning one to O Eki (who would be traded with Tsuten Kyoshu for Yozen, and would become Otenkun) and keeping the other, eventually placing it in Ryo Bo, a deceased baby of the Kyou tribe (who would become Taikobou). Ou Eki loses his memories of being one of the Original People, and does not regain them until Taikobo and Otenkun merge to create Fukki. After merging, Fukki(who still identifies himself as Taikobo since he is the dominant personality) retains the ability to split,and can return to being Taikobo and Otenkun at will.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Shinnou]]|\u795e\u8fb2||''Shennong''}}\n:One of the Original People to come to Earth, and the owner of the mysterious Super-paopei Kinkouza (Super-paopei help user travel through time). He merged with the life of the planet but he could mantain his human form in short amount of time at power spot (power spot are places where natural energy concentrated so Original People as Shinnou can maintain human form in power spot). After Taikobo had deafeated Jyoka, Taikoko found him to ask about dangerous Super-paopei Kinkouza's trace. He showed Super-paopei Kinkouza with Taikobo and Supushan. Suddenly, he sent Taikobo and Shupushan to the past.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Suiren]]|\u71e7\u4eba|}}\n:One of the Original People came to Earth in ancient times. Suijin along with the other Original People battled against Jyoka and put Jyoka in an eternal sleep. After all, Suijin chose to merge with the life of the planet.\n\n;{{nihongo|[[Shukuyuu]]|\u795d\u878d||''Zh\u00f9 R\u00f3ng''}}\n:One of the Original People came to Earth in ancients times.

The Human Rights Committee case was in 1999, with two same-sex couples as the plaintiffs/petitioners and the government of New Zealand as the defender/respondent. The ECHR case, ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'', was in 2010, with a same-sex couple as the plaintiffs/petitioners and the government of Austria as the respondents. Although both New Zealand and Austria then responded against the petitions then in each case, both countries now legally recognize same-sex marriage.\n\n====Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling====\nOn 8 January 2018, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] (IACHR) ruled that the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] mandates and requires the legalisation of same-sex marriage. The landmark ruling was fully binding on [[Same-sex marriage in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]] and set binding precedent in the other signatory countries. The Court recommended that governments issue temporary decrees legalising same-sex marriage until new legislation is brought in. The ruling applies to the countries of [[LGBT rights in Barbados|Barbados]], [[LGBT rights in Bolivia|Bolivia]], Chile, Costa Rica, the [[LGBT rights in the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], Ecuador, [[LGBT rights in El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[LGBT rights in Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[LGBT rights in Haiti|Haiti]], [[LGBT rights in Honduras|Honduras]], Mexico, [[LGBT rights in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], [[LGBT rights in Panama|Panama]], [[LGBT rights in Paraguay|Paraguay]], [[LGBT rights in Peru|Peru]] and [[LGBT rights in Suriname|Suriname]].

The Human Rights Committee case was in 1999, with two same-sex couples as the plaintiffs/petitioners and the government of New Zealand as the defender/respondent. The ECHR case, ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'', was in 2010, with a same-sex couple as the plaintiffs/petitioners and the government of Austria as the respondents. Although both New Zealand and Austria then responded against the petitions then in each case, both countries now legally recognize same-sex marriage.\n\n====Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling====\nOn 8 January 2018, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] (IACHR) ruled that the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] mandates and requires the legalisation of same-sex marriage. The landmark ruling was fully binding on [[Same-sex marriage in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]] and set binding precedent in the other signatory countries. The Court recommended that governments issue temporary decrees legalising same-sex marriage until new legislation is brought in. The ruling applies to the countries of [[LGBT rights in Barbados|Barbados]], [[LGBT rights in Bolivia|Bolivia]], Chile, Costa Rica, the [[LGBT rights in the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], Ecuador, [[LGBT rights in El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[LGBT rights in Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[LGBT rights in Haiti|Haiti]], [[LGBT rights in Honduras|Honduras]], Mexico, [[LGBT rights in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], [[LGBT rights in Panama|Panama]], [[LGBT rights in Paraguay|Paraguay]], [[LGBT rights in Peru|Peru]] and [[LGBT rights in Suriname|Suriname]].

''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot/midrashas}}'') refers to an institute of [[Torah study]] for women, generally in [[Israel]]. It is typically an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] institution that caters solely to women, and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men. An alternative term, and translation, is '[[seminary]]' ({{hebrew|\u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05e8}}). <ref name=\"science.co.il\">[https://www.science.co.il/jewish-studies/Midrashot.php ''Midrashot''], science.co.il</ref>\nA midrasha that offers [[academic degree|degree studies]] is sometimes called a ''machon'' ({{hebrew|\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df}}, institute).\nThe word \"''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''\" is based on the term ''[[beit midrash]]'', \"house of study\".  It is [[cognate]] with the [[Arabic]] \"''{{transl|ar|[[madrasa|madrasah]]}}'',\" which also refers to a place of learning.\n\nThe term ''Midrasha'' is used  more widely, sometimes referring to [[Cultural Judaism|pluralistic]], as opposed to [[orthodox Judaism|orthodox]], institutions. These are usually structured around continuing / [[adult education]], and accept both men and women. Examples are \nthe Ein Prat Midrasha<ref>[http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html Ein Prat Midrasha Bogrim.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101012427/http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html |date=2007-11-01 }}</ref> in Israel, \nand the [[Florence Melton|Melton School]]'s ''Midrasha'' in [[Cape Town]]. <ref>[https://meltoncapetown.org/midrasha/ Midrasha Adult Education Institute], meltoncapetown.org</ref>\nWithin the Orthodox community, programs of this type are also offered, \nfor example by  [[Matan_Women's_Institute_for_Torah_Studies|Matan]] <ref>[https://www.matan.org.il/en/learn-en/lessons/ Classes], matan.org.il</ref>\nand ''Emunah''. <ref>[http://www.emunah.org.il/%d7%90%d7%9e%d7%95%d7%a0%d7%94-%d7%91%d7%a7%d7%94%d7%99%d7%9c%d7%94/%d7%91%d7%aa%d7%99-%d7%9e%d7%93%d7%a8%d7%a9/ \u05d1\u05ea\u05d9-\u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9], emunah.org.il; with international branches, for example [http://emunah.co.za/ emunah.co.za]</ref>\nIn the [[United States]], the term also refers to programs for high school students continuing their Jewish education post [[bar mitzvah|bar]] / [[bat mitzvah]]. <ref>[https://www.midrasha.org/ midrasha.org]</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n''{{lang|he-Latn|Midrashot}}'' vary in curriculum and [[Orthodox Judaism#Social and philosophic differences|philosophy]]. \n<ref name=\"Lilith\">[https://www.lilith.org/blog/2014/09/a-modest-year-in-israel-when-young-women-go-to-seminary/ A Modest Year in Israel: When Young Women go to \u201cSeminary\u201d].
