One of the last acts of the Benfleet Parish Council was to purchase 30 acres of The Downs in 1929, with a view to it becoming a public open space. \n\nOn 14th July 1934 \u00a0Sir Edgar Bonham Carter, K.C.M.G., Vice Chairman of the Open Spaces Preservation Society officially opened the Downs making it an official public space. At the official opening of the Downs a hope was expressed in the programme by Walter Bingham:\n\n\u2018To \u00a0have lost to posterity this beautiful place would have been a tragedy indeed its closing or otherwise would have extinguished the eyes of Benfleet. \u00a0A pious hope has often been expressed that at some time in the future, the authorities concerned may get possession of the whole of the slopes from Benfleet to Leigh and thus preserve for ever to the people a vista unrivalled anywhere in Europe...'.\n\nOver time the area in public ownership increased and the park was a long time in gestating. Much of the drive for its establishment came from Councillor Dennis Nisbet, at the opening ceremony. The park covering some 458 acres was officially opened on 18th May 1987 at this event by Sir Derek Barber, chairman of the Countryside Commission and a commemorative stone in honour of him was laid to celebrate the event.\n\n==Facilities==\nThe park is home to an [[iron age]] roundhouse, mountain biking trails, horse riding, a reservoir, conservation area, walking routes, a visitor centre and natural habitats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hadleigh-park.co.uk/|title=Hadleigh Park - Home of the 2012 Olympic Mountain Biking|website=Hadleigh Park}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation area==\nThe park incorporates a wetland conservation area and salt marsh that is home to [[dragonflies]].<ref>http://www.visitparks.co.uk/media/1238/hadleigh-park-map-compressed.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jG9UAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT109&dq=Hadleigh+Country+Park&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjPpI3L04ThAhU6QxUIHYhYCkMQ6AEITDAG#v=onepage&q=Hadleigh+Country+Park&f=false|title=A Field Guide to the Damselflies and Dragonflies of Britain and Ireland|first1=Dave|last1=Smallshire|first2=Andy|last2=Swash|date=22 May 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Events==\nThe park was the venue for mountain biking in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].

Originally, the station, as set out in the design competition, was to be built in a covered tunnel, but instead it was built with a large glass roof.

There is an hourly service to the airport station via [[Regional-Express]] line RE 6 (the [[Rhein-Weser-Express]]) to [[Minden station|Minden]] and the [[Regionalbahn]] RB 27 (the [[Rhein-Erft-Bahn]]) along the [[East Rhine Railway]] (Cologne\u2013Troisdorf\u2013[[Bonn-Beuel station|Bonn-Beuel]]). Frequent connections are not possible, since the line carries dense freight traffic. A new track (in parts two) are planned to be built along the line from Troisdorf to [[Bonn-Oberkassel station|Bonn-Oberkassel]] so that services on line S 13 can be extended from [[Horrem station|Horrem]] via [[Cologne Hauptbahnhof]], the airport and Troisdorf to Oberkassel.

A large glass-walled staircase in the middle of the platforms is used to change of platform and leads to one of the emergency exits. Escalators and lifts from the platform lead to the basement of terminal 2. The difference in height between rail and platform edge on the outer tracks is 76&nbsp;cm. The central tracks are laid a little lower, so that their platforms are 96&nbsp;cm high above the rail.

The operator of the airport hoped that the construction of the station, which would strengthen connection between transport modes, would stimulate growth, including of the number of passengers using the airport. Originally, the station, as set out in the design competition, was to be built in a covered tunnel, but instead it was built with a large glass roof. Nevertheless, it is an underground station and is also referred to as such by Deutsche Bahn. So smoking is banned as in other underground stations in Germany.\n\n===Planning===\n\nThe building was designed by the architectural firm Murphy/[[Helmut Jahn|Jahn]], which had already designed terminal 2.\n\nWith the opening of the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed railway, two ICE and three S-Bahn trains could run each hour in each direction through the station.<ref name=\"koeln-1998-23\">{{cite book|publisher=Stadtplanungsamt der Stadt K\u00f6ln |title=Bahnh\u00f6fe der Zukunft an den neuen Hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecken |location=Cologne|year= c. 1998 |page=23  |language=German}}</ref> According to the estimates of 1995, about 30 percent of passengers would in future travel to the airport by train.<ref name=\"zt-1995s-10\">{{cite journal|journal=Zum Thema|title=Vom Rei\u00dfbrett zur Realit\u00e4t |issue=1 (special) | date= December 1995 |location=Darmstadt |editor=DBBauProjekt GmbH |publisher= Hestra|pages=10\u201313 |language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\n\nThe station was constructed in three sections.

It was also designed by the Murphy/Jahn architecture firm.\n\nThe construction of the station was the final component of a comprehensive concept for the airport, ''Terminal 2000'', costing more than \u20ac500&nbsp;million. The catchment area of the airport was increased with the new station to more than 20 million people.<ref name=\"db-2004-06-01\"/>\n\n===Operations===\n\nThe number of daily ICE trains was reduced from eight to six pairs of trains in 2007 as a result of low demand.<ref name=\"eb-106-16\">{{cite journal| title= Elektrischer Betrieb bei der Deutschen Bahn im Jahre 2007|journal=Elektrische Bahnen | volume=106 |year=2008 |issue= 1-2 |page=16  |language=German}}</ref>\n\n===S-Bahn connections===\n\nThe construction of the airport loop was, for the most part, financed by funds under the Berlin\u2013Bonn Act, especially to improve connections from the Bonn/Rhine-[[Sieg]] region to the airport. Currently only Cologne and\u2014[[Troisdorf station|Troisdorf]] in the [[Rhein-Sieg-Kreis|Rhein-Sieg district]]\u2014have direct connections to the airport via lines [[S13 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)|S13]] and [[S19 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)|S19]] of the S-Bahn, providing a service every 20 minutes on week days. There is an hourly service to the airport station via [[Regional-Express]] line RE 6 (the [[Rhein-Weser-Express]]) to [[Minden station|Minden]] and the [[Regionalbahn]] RB 27 (the [[Rhein-Erft-Bahn]]) along the [[East Rhine Railway]] (Cologne\u2013Troisdorf\u2013[[Bonn-Beuel station|Bonn-Beuel]]). Frequent connections are not possible, since the line carries dense freight traffic. A new track (in parts two) are planned to be built along the line from Troisdorf to [[Bonn-Oberkassel station|Bonn-Oberkassel]] so that services on line S 13 can be extended from [[Horrem station|Horrem]] via [[Cologne Hauptbahnhof]], the airport and Troisdorf to Oberkassel.

Pietro Platina, main master of Vilnius coin mint designed coins during the reign of [[Stephen B\u00e1thory]]. [[Antoni Tyzenhaus|Antanas Tyzenhauzas]] was the first creator of manufactures in Lithuania. French masters from [[Lion]] created patterns for his royal silk textile manufacture.\n\n==First Republic. 1918\u20131940==\n[[File:LAM 2008-09 Anbo-1.jpg|thumb| [[ANBO-I]] (1925) in [[Lithuanian Aviation Museum]]]]\n[[File:Romuladas Marcinkus reporting.jpg|thumb|Three ANBO-41s (circa 1938)]]\nAfter regaining the Independence of Lithuania, the need emerged for architects, engineers and artists. Best students were sent to the universities of Europe. Architects which returned, changed Kaunas unrecognizably; well-off citizens started to live in the new buildings with modern interiors. Kaunas Art School included design into the teaching curriculum - A.Smetona, S.U\u0161inskas, J.Mik\u0117nas were the professors. [[Art Deco]] design dominated in the graphical design, especially in poster design.\nAviation engineer [[Antanas Gustaitis]] designed [[ANBO]] series airplanes which he tested himself. ANBO 41 was then the only aircraft in Europe to employ a wooden three-blade propeller. Furniture creator Jonas Prapuolenis created furniture based on Lithuanian national art. P.Rim\u0161a, V.K.Jonynas were also known as furniture designers.\n\nSelected works:\n* Furniture set by Jonas Prapuolenis in [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] in Paris was awarded a Golden medal.\n\n==Period of Soviet occupation. 1940\u20131990==\n[[File: Landing glider \"Sportine Aviacija LAK-12 Lietuva\" (5839855267).jpg|thumb|left|Glider LAK-12, 1979]]\n[[File:Ereliukas W72.jpg|thumb|right|Bicycle ''Ereliukas'' (''Little Eagle'') W-72, 1962]]\n[[File:Lithuanian glider BrO-18 Boru\u017e\u0117 by Br.O\u0161kinis, 1975.jpg|thumb|World's smallest glider ''BrO-18 Boru\u017e\u0117 (Ladybird)'', 1975]]\nAfter the Soviet occupation requirements for the design were mostly ideological and restrictive. Some of the inventions of modernists were adopted and implemented - e.g. ideas of [[Le Corbusier|Corbusier\u2019s]] ''machine for living''. Despite the [[Iron Curtain]] and censorship, ideas and journals from the West reached the creators in Lithuania. \n''Projektavimo \u2013 konstravimo biuras'' (''The Office of Design and Construction'') in 1957, ''Eksperimentinis meninio konstravimo biuras'' (''The Office of Experimental Design and Construction'') in 1964 were established in Vilnius. Designers were prepared since 1961 in the Department of Design, which was established at [[Vilnius Academy of Arts]]. [[Feliksas Daukantas]] (1915-1995) is considered a pioneer of design studies in Lithuania. He established ''Pramon\u0117s gamini\u0173 meninio konstravimo katedra'' (''The Department of Artistic Construction of Industrial Products'') in Vilnius Academy of Arts and created a teaching program, based on Bauhaus. Design objects were created by artists as well. Sculptor Teodoras Valaitis created a wall of biomorphs for world exhibition [[Expo '70|Expo-70]] in [[Osaka]], which remained unrealized. Algimantas Sto\u0161kus created a spatial stained glass project for exhibition of Lithuanian design in London in 1968.\nCreators of design contended with the West. According to architect and designer Tadas Baginskas, who created the Architecture of Lithuanian Pavilion for 1968 [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]] in London:\n\u201cWe always contended with the West - we were studying Scandinavian, Italian, Japanese design. Occupants were not an authority for us. And the most pleasant - all noticed our direction in the London exhibition. The exposition (of Lithuanian pavilion) perfectly fitted into the context.\u201d\n\nSelected works:\n* In 1963 vacuum cleaner ''Saturnas'' was created.

Way of life, and style in day-to-day life became increasingly important - interiors were refurbished and changed, new fashion styles were followed. Fashion design became more important. New sorts of design appeared, such as electronic graphic design.\n\n[[Per Mollerup]], Danish researcher of design, made a study of the possibilities of Lithuanian design, \"Design in Lithuania - guaranty of concurrent advantage\". One of its conclusions is that there are more trained designers working in Lithuania than in other Baltic countries. Creators of graphic design united in the Lithuanian Association of Graphic Design. The Lithuanian design review ''Design index'' is published yearly. Digital design overlaps the borders of graphic design; the software for picture editing and its innovative design [[Pixelmator]] were created.

Pietro Platina, main master of Vilnius coin mint designed coins during the reign of [[Stephen B\u00e1thory]]. [[Antoni Tyzenhaus|Antanas Tyzenhauzas]] was the first creator of manufactures in Lithuania. French masters from [[Lion]] created patterns for his royal silk textile manufacture.\n\n==First Republic. 1918\u20131940==\n[[File:LAM 2008-09 Anbo-1.jpg|thumb| [[ANBO-I]] (1925) in [[Lithuanian Aviation Museum]]]]\n[[File:Romuladas Marcinkus reporting.jpg|thumb|Three ANBO-41s (circa 1938)]]\nAfter regaining the Independence of Lithuania, the need emerged for architects, engineers and artists. Best students were sent to the universities of Europe. Architects which returned, changed Kaunas unrecognizably; well-off citizens started to live in the new buildings with modern interiors. Kaunas Art School included design into the teaching curriculum - A.Smetona, S.U\u0161inskas, J.Mik\u0117nas were the professors. [[Art Deco]] design dominated in the graphical design, especially in poster design.\nAviation engineer [[Antanas Gustaitis]] designed [[ANBO]] series airplanes which he tested himself. ANBO 41 was then the only aircraft in Europe to employ a wooden three-blade propeller. Furniture creator Jonas Prapuolenis created furniture based on Lithuanian national art. P.Rim\u0161a, V.K.Jonynas were also known as furniture designers.\n\nSelected works:\n* Furniture set by Jonas Prapuolenis in [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] in Paris was awarded a Golden medal.\n\n==Period of Soviet occupation. 1940\u20131990==\n[[File: Landing glider \"Sportine Aviacija LAK-12 Lietuva\" (5839855267).jpg|thumb|left|Glider LAK-12, 1979]]\n[[File:Ereliukas W72.jpg|thumb|right|Bicycle ''Ereliukas'' (''Little Eagle'') W-72, 1962]]\n[[File:Lithuanian glider BrO-18 Boru\u017e\u0117 by Br.O\u0161kinis, 1975.jpg|thumb|World's smallest glider ''BrO-18 Boru\u017e\u0117 (Ladybird)'', 1975]]\nAfter the Soviet occupation requirements for the design were mostly ideological and restrictive. Some of the inventions of modernists were adopted and implemented - e.g. ideas of [[Le Corbusier|Corbusier\u2019s]] ''machine for living''. Despite the [[Iron Curtain]] and censorship, ideas and journals from the West reached the creators in Lithuania. \n''Projektavimo \u2013 konstravimo biuras'' (''The Office of Design and Construction'') in 1957, ''Eksperimentinis meninio konstravimo biuras'' (''The Office of Experimental Design and Construction'') in 1964 were established in Vilnius. Designers were prepared since 1961 in the Department of Design, which was established at [[Vilnius Academy of Arts]]. [[Feliksas Daukantas]] (1915-1995) is considered a pioneer of design studies in Lithuania. He established ''Pramon\u0117s gamini\u0173 meninio konstravimo katedra'' (''The Department of Artistic Construction of Industrial Products'') in Vilnius Academy of Arts and created a teaching program, based on Bauhaus. Design objects were created by artists as well. Sculptor Teodoras Valaitis created a wall of biomorphs for world exhibition [[Expo '70|Expo-70]] in [[Osaka]], which remained unrealized. Algimantas Sto\u0161kus created a spatial stained glass project for exhibition of Lithuanian design in London in 1968.\nCreators of design contended with the West. According to architect and designer Tadas Baginskas, who created the Architecture of Lithuanian Pavilion for 1968 [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]] in London:\n\u201cWe always contended with the West - we were studying Scandinavian, Italian, Japanese design. Occupants were not an authority for us. And the most pleasant - all noticed our direction in the London exhibition. The exposition (of Lithuanian pavilion) perfectly fitted into the context.\u201d\n\nSelected works:\n* In 1963 vacuum cleaner ''Saturnas'' was created.

Way of life, and style in day-to-day life became increasingly important - interiors were refurbished and changed, new fashion styles were followed. Fashion design became more important. New sorts of design appeared, such as electronic graphic design.\n\n[[Per Mollerup]], Danish researcher of design, made a study of the possibilities of Lithuanian design, \"Design in Lithuania - guaranty of concurrent advantage\". One of its conclusions is that there are more trained designers working in Lithuania than in other Baltic countries. Creators of graphic design united in the Lithuanian Association of Graphic Design. The Lithuanian design review ''Design index'' is published yearly. Digital design overlaps the borders of graphic design; the software for picture editing and its innovative design [[Pixelmator]] were created.

Hungarian-born founder [[Adolph Zukor]], who had been an early investor in [[nickelodeon movie theatre|nickelodeons]], saw that movies appealed mainly to working-class immigrants.<ref name=\"TIMWU2010\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iM6sos2U554C&printsec=frontcover |title=The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires \u2013 Tim Wu \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref> With partners [[Daniel Frohman]] and [[Charles Frohman]] he planned to offer feature-length films that would appeal to the middle class by featuring the leading theatrical players of the time (leading to the slogan \"Famous Players in Famous Plays\"). By mid-1913, Famous Players had completed five films, and Zukor was on his way to success. Its first film was ''[[Les Amours de la reine \u00c9lisabeth]]'', which starred [[Sarah Bernhardt]].\n\nThat same year, another aspiring producer, [[Jesse L. Lasky]], opened his Lasky Feature Play Company with money borrowed from his brother-in-law, Samuel Goldfish, later known as [[Samuel Goldwyn]]. The Lasky company hired as their first employee a stage director with virtually no film experience, [[Cecil B. DeMille]], who would find a suitable site in Hollywood, near Los Angeles, for his first feature film, ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]''.\n\n[[File:Paramount logo 1914.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Paramount Pictures' first logo, based on a design by its founder [[William Wadsworth Hodkinson]], used from 1917 to 1967.]]\n\nStarting in 1914, both Lasky and Famous Players released their films through a start-up company, Paramount Pictures Corporation, organized early that year by a Utah theatre owner, [[W. W. Hodkinson]], who had bought and merged several smaller firms. Hodkinson and actor, director, producer [[Hobart Bosworth]] had started production of a series of [[Jack London]] movies. Paramount was the first successful nationwide distributor; until this time, films were sold on a statewide or regional basis which had proved costly to film producers. Also, Famous Players and Lasky were privately owned while Paramount was a corporation.\n\n=== Famous Players-Lasky ===\n{{Main|Famous Players-Lasky}}\n[[File:Spanish Paramount logo (Distribuida Pela Paramount), circa 1929.ogv|thumb|The logo, with Portuguese captions: ''Distribuida Pela Paramount''.]]\nIn 1916, Zukor maneuvered a three-way merger of his Famous Players, the Lasky Company, and Paramount. Zukor and Lasky bought Hodkinson out of Paramount, and merged the three companies into one. The new company Lasky and Zukor founded, '''[[Famous Players-Lasky]] Corporation''', grew quickly, with Lasky and his partners Goldwyn and DeMille running the production side, Hiram Abrams in charge of distribution, and Zukor making great plans. With only the exhibitor-owned [[First National Pictures|First National]] as a rival, Famous Players-Lasky and its \"Paramount Pictures\" soon dominated the business.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lasky-company-merges-with-famous-players-later-to-become-paramount|title=Lasky Company merges with Famous Players, later to become Paramount \u2013 Jun 28, 1916 \u2013 HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:GrangeLasky-DeMille1913.jpg|thumb|left| Lasky's original studio (a.k.a. \"The Barn\") as it appeared in the mid 1920s.

With so many important players, Paramount was able to introduce \"[[block booking]]\", which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star's films had to buy a year's worth of other Paramount productions. It was this system that gave Paramount a leading position in the 1920s and 1930s, but which led the government to pursue it on [[antitrust]] grounds for more than twenty years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/ftc-case_into.htm|title=The Famous Players-Lasky Antitrust Case|website=www.cobbles.com|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe driving force behind Paramount's rise was Zukor. Through the teens and twenties, he built the '''Publix Theatres Corporation''', a chain of nearly 2,000 screens, ran two production studios (in [[Astoria, New York]], now the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]], and [[Hollywood, California]]), and became an early investor in radio, taking a 50% interest in the new [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] in 1928 (selling it within a few years; this would not be the last time Paramount and CBS crossed paths).\n\nIn 1926, Zukor hired independent producer [[B. P. Schulberg]], an unerring eye for new talent, to run the new West Coast operations. They purchased the Robert Brunton Studios, a 26-acre facility at 5451 Marathon Street for US$1 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paramount.com/node/7664 |title=1926: THE NEW STUDIO &#124; Paramount Pictures |publisher=Paramount.com |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114001735/http://www.paramount.com/node/7664 |archivedate=November 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1927, Famous Players-Lasky took the name '''Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation'''. Three years later, because of the importance of the Publix Theatres, it became '''Paramount Publix Corporation'''.\n\nIn 1928, Paramount began releasing ''[[Inkwell Imps]],'' animated cartoons produced by [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]]'s [[Fleischer Studios]] in New York City. The Fleischers, veterans in the animation industry, were among the few animation producers capable of challenging the prominence of [[Walt Disney]]. The Paramount newsreel series [[Paramount News]] ran from 1927 to 1957. Paramount was also one of the first Hollywood studios to release what were known at that time as \"[[sound film|talkies]]\", and in 1929, released their first musical, ''[[Innocents of Paris]]''. [[Richard A. Whiting]] and [[Leo Robin]] composed the score for the film; [[Maurice Chevalier]] starred and sung the most famous song from the film, \"[[Louise (Maurice Chevalier song)|Louise]]\".\n\n==== Publix, Balaban and Katz, Loew's competition and wonder theaters ====\n[[File:Publix theatre Indiana Repertory Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of Publix Theatre logo on what is now [[Indiana Repertory Theatre]].]]\n\nBy acquiring the successful [[Balaban & Katz]] chain in 1926, Zukor gained the services of [[Barney Balaban]] (who would eventually become Paramount's president in 1936), his brother [[A. J. Balaban]] (who would eventually supervise all stage production nationwide and produce talkie shorts), and their partner Sam Katz (who would run the Paramount-Publix theatre chain in New York City from the thirty-five-story Paramount Theatre Building on [[Times Square]]).\n\nBalaban and Katz had developed the Wonder Theater concept, first publicized around 1918 in Chicago. The Chicago Theater was created as a very ornate theater and advertised as a \"wonder theater.\" When Publix acquired Balaban, they embarked on a project to expand the wonder theaters, and starting building in New York in 1927. While Balaban and Public were dominant in Chicago, [[Loew's]] was the big player in New York, and did not want the Publix theaters to overshadow theirs. The two companies brokered a non-competition deal for New York and Chicago, and Loew's took over the New York area projects, developing five [[Loew's Wonder Theaters|wonder theaters]]. Publix continued Balaban's wonder theater development in its home area.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Kings Is Dead!

Zukor's over-expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases led the company into receivership in 1933. A bank-mandated reorganization team, led by [[John D. Hertz|John Hertz]] and [[Otto Kahn]] kept the company intact, and, miraculously, Zukor was kept on. In 1935, Paramount-Publix went bankrupt. In June 1935 [[John E. Otterson]]<ref>Eileen S. Quigley. ''International Motion Picture Almanac,'' 1938. p. 581.</ref>  and in 1936 [[Barney Balaban]] became president, and Zukor was bumped up to chairman of the board. In this role, Zukor reorganized the company as '''Paramount Pictures, Inc.''' and was able to successfully bring the studio out of bankruptcy.\n\nAs always, Paramount films continued to emphasize stars; in the 1920s there were [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Wallace Reid]], [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Florence Vidor]], [[Thomas Meighan]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Bebe Daniels]], [[Antonio Moreno]], [[Richard Dix]], [[Esther Ralston]], [[Emil Jannings]], [[George Bancroft (actor)|George Bancroft]], [[Betty Compson]], [[Clara Bow]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], and [[Charles Buddy Rogers]]. By the late 1920s and the early 1930s, talkies brought in a range of powerful draws: [[Richard Arlen]], [[Nancy Carroll]], [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Charles Ruggles]], [[Ruth Chatterton]], [[William Powell]], [[Mae West]], [[Sylvia Sidney]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Claudette Colbert]], the [[Marx Brothers]], [[W.C. Fields]], [[Fredric March]], [[Jack Oakie]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]] (whose first two films were shot at Paramount's [[Astoria, New York]], studio), [[Carole Lombard]], [[George Raft]], [[Miriam Hopkins]], [[Cary Grant]] and [[Stuart Erwin]], among them.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eames |first=John Douglas |title=The Paramount story |year=1985 |publisher=Crown |location=New York |isbn=0-517-55348-1 |page=37 |edition=[1st ed.].}}</ref> In this period Paramount can truly be described as a movie factory, turning out sixty to seventy pictures a year. Such were the benefits of having a huge theater chain to fill, and of block booking to persuade other chains to go along. In 1933, [[Mae West]] would also add greatly to Paramount's success with her suggestive movies ''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'' and ''[[I'm No Angel]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/shed.html |title=Filmsite.org |publisher=Filmsite.org |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/imno.html |title=Filmsite.org |publisher=Filmsite.org |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> However, the sex appeal West gave in these movies would also lead to the enforcement of the [[Production Code]], as the newly formed organization the [[Catholic Legion of Decency]] threatened a boycott if it was not enforced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mae-west.org/old/mw.bio.html |title=Mae-West.org |publisher=Mae-West.org |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nParamount cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios continued to be successful, with [[Character (arts)|characters]] such as [[Betty Boop]] and [[Popeye the Sailor]] becoming widely successful. One Fleischer series, ''[[Screen Songs]]'', featured live-action music stars under contract to Paramount hosting sing-alongs of popular songs. The animation studio would rebound with [[Popeye]], and in 1935, polls showed that Popeye was even more popular than [[Mickey Mouse]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forums.goldenagecartoons.com/showthread.php?t=2907 |title=Forums.GoldenAgeCartoons.com |publisher=Forums.GoldenAgeCartoons.com |accessdate=January 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711104313/http://forums.goldenagecartoons.com/showthread.php?t=2907 |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> After an unsuccessful expansion into feature films, as well as the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer were no longer speaking to one another, Fleischer Studios was acquired by Paramount, which renamed the operation [[Famous Studios]].

Paramount Pictures, Inc.'' ===\nIn 1940, Paramount agreed to a government-instituted consent decree: block booking and \"pre-selling\" (the practice of collecting up-front money for films not yet in production) would end. Immediately, Paramount cut back on production, from 71 films to a more modest 19 annually in the war years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eames |first=John Douglas |title=The Paramount Story |year=1985 |publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc |location=New York |isbn=0-517-55348-1 |page=115}}</ref> Still, with more new stars like [[Bob Hope]], [[Alan Ladd]], [[Veronica Lake]], [[Paulette Goddard]], and [[Betty Hutton]], and with war-time attendance at astronomical numbers, Paramount and the other integrated studio-theatre combines made more money than ever. At this, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] decided to reopen their case against the five integrated studios. Paramount also had a monopoly over [[Detroit]] movie theaters through subsidiary company United Detroit Theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/united-detroit_paramount-history.htm |series=SIMPP v.

This decision broke up Adolph Zukor's creation, with the theater chain being split into a new company, [[United Paramount Theaters]], and effectively brought an end to the classic Hollywood [[studio system]].\n\n=== 1951\u201366: Split and after ===\nWith the separation of production and exhibition forced by the U.S. Supreme Court, Paramount Pictures Inc. was split in two.<ref name=\"Nelmes\">{{cite book |last=Nelmes |first=Jill |title=An Introduction to Film Studies |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |edition=3 |page=16 |isbn=0-415-26268-2}}</ref> Paramount Pictures Corporation was formed to be the production distribution company, with the 1,500-screen theater chain handed to the new [[United Paramount Theaters]] on December 31, 1949. [[Leonard Goldenson]], who had headed the chain since 1938, remained as the new company's president. The Balaban and Katz theatre division was spun off with UPT; its trademark eventually became the property of the Balaban and Katz Historical Foundation. The Foundation has recently acquired ownership of the Famous Players Trademark. Cash-rich and controlling prime downtown real estate, Goldenson began looking for investments. Barred from film-making by prior antitrust rulings, he acquired the struggling [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network in February 1953, leading it first to financial health, and eventually, in the mid-1970s, to first place in the national Nielsen ratings, before selling out to [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities]] in 1985 (Capital Cities would eventually sell out, in turn, to [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1996). United Paramount Theaters was renamed ABC Theaters in 1965 and was sold to businessman Henry Plitt in 1977. The movie theater chain was renamed Plitt Theaters. In 1985, [[Cineplex Odeon Corporation]] merged with Plitt. In later years, Paramount's TV division would develop a strong relationship with ABC, providing many hit series to the network.\n\n==== The DuMont Network ====\nParamount Pictures had been an early backer of television, launching experimental stations in 1939 in Los Angeles and Chicago. The Los Angeles station eventually became [[KTLA]], the first commercial station on the West Coast. The Chicago station got a commercial license as WBKB in 1943, but was sold to UPT along with Balaban & Katz in 1948 and was eventually resold to CBS as [[WBBM-TV]].\n\nIn 1938, Paramount bought a stake in television manufacturer [[DuMont Laboratories]]. Through this stake, it became a minority owner of the [[DuMont Television Network]].<ref name=\"Hess1\">{{cite book |last=Hess |first=Gary Newton |title=An Historical Study of the DuMont Television Network |publisher=Arno Press |location=New York |year=1979 |page=91 |isbn=0-405-11758-2}}</ref> Also Paramount launched its own network, [[Paramount Television Network]], in 1948 through its television unit, Television Productions, Inc.<ref name=\"Schatz\">{{cite book |last=Schatz |first=Thomas |title=Boom and Bust: American Cinema in the 1940s |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |page=433 |isbn=0-520-22130-3}}</ref>\n\nParamount management planned to acquire additional [[owned-and-operated station]]s (\"O&Os\"); the company applied to the FCC for additional stations in San Francisco, Detroit, and Boston.<ref name=\"Browne\">{{cite book|last=Browne|first=Nick|title=American Television: New Directions in History and Theory|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|page=32|isbn=3-7186-0563-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yuU72DJI97UC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=%22Paramount+Pictures%22%2B%22FCC%22%2B%22San+Francisco%22&q=%22Paramount%20Pictures%22%2B%22FCC%22%2B%22San%20Francisco%22|access-date=April 9, 2010}}</ref> The FCC, however, denied Paramount's applications. A few years earlier, the federal regulator had placed a five-station cap on all television networks: no network was allowed to own more than five [[VHF]] television stations. Paramount was hampered by its minority stake in the DuMont Television Network. Although both DuMont and Paramount executives stated that the companies were separate, the FCC ruled that Paramount's partial ownership of DuMont meant that DuMont and Paramount were in theory branches of the same company. Since DuMont owned three television stations and Paramount owned two, the federal agency ruled neither network could acquire additional television stations. The FCC requested that Paramount relinquish its stake in DuMont, but Paramount refused.<ref name=\"Browne\" /> According to television historian William Boddy, \"Paramount's checkered antitrust history\" helped convince the FCC that Paramount controlled DuMont.<ref name=\"Boddy\">{{cite book|last=Boddy|first=William|title=Fifties Television: the Industry and Its Critics|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1992|page=56|isbn=0-252-06299-X}}</ref> Both DuMont and Paramount Television Network suffered as a result, with neither company able to acquire five O&Os.

By the mid-1950s, all the great names were gone; only [[Cecil B. DeMille]], associated with Paramount since 1913, kept making pictures in the grand old style. Despite Paramount's losses, DeMille would, however, give the studio some relief and create his most successful film at Paramount, a 1956 [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|remake]] of his 1923 film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/tenc.html |title=Filmsite.org |publisher=Filmsite.org |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> DeMille died in 1959.

Both Paramount and CIC entered the video market with Paramount Home Video (now [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Entertainment]]) and [[CIC Video]], respectively.\n\nRobert Evans abandoned his position as head of production in 1974; his successor, [[Richard Sylbert]], proved to be too literary and too tasteful for Gulf + Western's Bluhdorn. By 1976, a new, television-trained team was in place headed by [[Barry Diller]] and his \"Killer-Dillers\", as they were called by admirers or \"Dillettes\" as they were called by detractors. These associates, made up of [[Michael Eisner]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Dawn Steel]] and [[Don Simpson]] would each go on and head up major movie studios of their own later in their careers.\n\nThe Paramount specialty was now simpler. \"[[High concept]]\" pictures such as ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' hit big, hit hard and hit fast all over the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/80sintro.html |title=Film History of the 1980s |publisher=Filmsite.org |date=September 8, 1986 |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref>  and Diller's television background led him to propose one of his longest-standing ideas to the board: [[Paramount Television Service]], a [[Fourth television network|fourth commercial network]]. Paramount Pictures purchased the [[Hughes Television Network]] (HTN) including its satellite time in planning for PTVS in 1976.

Lasting eleven years before being merged with [[The WB]] network to become [[The CW]] in 2006, UPN would feature many of the shows it originally produced for other networks, and would take numerous gambles on series such as ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' that would have otherwise either gone direct-to-cable or become [[Broadcast syndication|first-run syndication]] to independent stations across the country (as ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' were).\n\nParamount Pictures was not connected to either [[Paramount Records]] (1910s-1935) or [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount Records]] (1955\u201366) until it purchased the rights to use the name (but not the latter's catalog) in the late 1960s. The [[Paramount Records (1969)|Paramount]] name was used for soundtrack albums and some pop re-issues from the [[Dot Records]] catalog which Paramount had acquired in 1957.

Other examples are the ''[[Star Trek]]'' film series and a string of films starring comedian [[Eddie Murphy]] like ''[[Trading Places]]'', ''[[Coming to America]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' and its [[sequel]]s.

More so than most, Paramount's slate of films included many remakes and television [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]]; while sometimes commercially successful, there have been few compelling films of the kind that once made Paramount the industry leader.\n\nOn August 25, 1983, Paramount Studios caught fire.

With the influx of cash from the sale of G+W's industrial properties in the mid-1980s, Paramount bought a string of television stations and [[KECO Entertainment]]'s theme park operations, renaming them [[Paramount Parks]]. These parks included [[California's Great America|Paramount's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland|Paramount Canada's Wonderland]], [[Carowinds|Paramount's Carowinds]], [[Kings Dominion|Paramount's Kings Dominion]], and [[Kings Island|Paramount's Kings Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitkingsisland.com/media-center/park-history |title=Park History &#124; Kings Island, Mason OH |publisher=Visitkingsisland.com |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, [[Sumner Redstone]]'s entertainment conglomerate [[Viacom (1971\u20132005)|Viacom]] made a bid for a merger with Paramount Communications; this quickly escalated into a bidding war with [[Barry Diller]]'s [[QVC]].

When Paramount moved to its present home in 1927, it was in the heart of the film community. Since then, former next-door neighbor [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] closed up shop in 1957 (Paramount ultimately absorbed their former lot); [[Warner Bros.]] (whose old Sunset Boulevard studio was sold to Paramount in 1949 as a home for [[KTLA]]) moved to [[Burbank, Los Angeles County, California|Burbank]] in 1930; [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] joined Warners in Burbank in 1973 then moved again to [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] in 1989; and the Pickford-Fairbanks-Goldwyn-United Artists lot, after a lively history, has been turned into a [[post-production]] and music-scoring facility for Warners, known simply as \"The Lot\". For a time the semi-industrial neighborhood around Paramount was in decline, but has now come back. The recently refurbished studio has come to symbolize Hollywood for many visitors, and its studio tour is a popular attraction.\n\n=== 1989\u201394: Paramount Communications ===\n{{Infobox company\n|name = Paramount Communications, Inc.\n|type = [[Conglomerate (company)|Conglomerate]]\n|logo = Paramount Communications Inc. logo.png\n|logo_size = 300px\n|fate = Sold and merged into [[Viacom (1952-2006)|Viacom]]\n|predecessor = [[Gulf+Western]]\n|successor = [[Viacom (1952-2006)|Viacom]] (now remnants operating as [[ViacomCBS]] owned by National Amusements)\n|foundation = {{start date and age|1989}}\n|defunct = {{end date and age|1994|7|7}}\n|location = [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]\n|industry = [[Entertainment]], [[industry]], [[mass media]]\n|key_people = [[Charles Bluhdorn]], Martin S.

The idea was to aid financial markets in measuring the company's success, which, in turn, would help place better value on its shares. Though its Paramount division did very well in recent years, Gulf and Western's success as a whole was translating poorly with investors. This process eventually led Davis to divest many of the company's subsidiaries. Its sugar plantations in Florida and the Dominican Republic were sold in 1985; the consumer and industrial products branch was sold off that same year.<ref name = \"lbm\" /> In 1989, Davis renamed the company Paramount Communications Incorporated after its primary asset, Paramount Pictures.<ref name=\"restructure\">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-10/business/fi-1718_1_paramount-s-parent-plans-values-publishing-businesses|title=Gulf & Western Wants Buyer for Finance Division : Paramount's Parent Plans to Change Name, Focus on Entertainment, Publishing|last=Williams|first=Linda|date=April 10, 1989|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref> In addition to the Paramount film, television, home video, and music publishing divisions, the company continued to own the Madison Square Garden properties (which also included [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]]), a 50% stake in [[USA Network]]s (the other 50% was owned by [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]/[[Universal Studios]]) and Simon & Schuster, [[Prentice Hall]], [[Pocket Books]], [[Allyn & Bacon]], Cineamerica (a joint venture with [[Warner Communications]]), and Canadian cinema chain [[Famous Players Theatres]].<ref name = \"lbm\">Prince, Stephen (2000) ''A New Pot of Gold: Hollywood Under the Electronic Rainbow, 1980\u20131989'' (p. 60-65).

(The original name of Warner Communications was [[Kinney National Company]].) This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Gulf and Western responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time-Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Gulf and Western to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of [[Time Warner]].\n\nParamount used cash acquired from the sale of Gulf and Western's non-entertainment properties to take over the [[TVX Broadcast Group]] chain of television stations (which at that point consisted mainly of large-market stations which TVX had bought from [[Taft Broadcasting]], plus two mid-market stations which TVX owned prior to the Taft purchase), and the [[KECO Entertainment]] chain of theme parks from Taft successor Great American Broadcasting. Both of these companies had their names changed to reflect new ownership: TVX became known as the [[Paramount Stations Group]], while KECO was renamed to [[Paramount Parks]].\n\nParamount Television launched Wilshire Court Productions in conjunction with USA Networks, before the latter was renamed [[NBCUniversal Cable]], in 1989. Wilshire Court Productions (named for a side street in Los Angeles) produced [[television film]]s that aired on the USA Networks, and later for other networks. USA Networks launched a second channel, the Sci-Fi Channel (now known as [[Syfy]]), in 1992. As its name implied, it focused on films and television series within the science fiction genre. Much of the initial programming was owned either by Paramount or Universal. Paramount bought one more television station in 1993: [[Cox Enterprises]]' [[WKBD-TV]] in Detroit, Michigan, at the time an affiliate of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].\n\n=== 1994\u20132005: Dolgen/Lansing and \"old\" Viacom era ===\nOn July 7, 1994, Paramount Communications Inc. was sold to [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Report|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/44482/0000950112-94-002132.txt|website=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players: The Outsiders|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=61 |quote=Viacom completed acquisition of Paramount Communications in July 1994, creating one of the world's largest entertainment companies.}}</ref> following the purchase of 50.1% of Paramount's shares for $9.75 billion.

Around the same time, Viacom bought out [[Spelling Television|Spelling Entertainment]], incorporating its library into that of Paramount itself.\n\nViacom split into two companies in 2006, one retaining the [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] name (which continues to own Paramount Pictures), while another was named [[CBS Corporation]] (which now controls Paramount Television Group, which was renamed CBS Paramount Television, now known as [[CBS Television Studios]] and worldwide distribution unit is now [[CBS Television Distribution]] and [[CBS Studios International]], in 2006, Simon & Schuster [except for Prentice Hall and other educational units, which Viacom sold to [[Pearson PLC]] in 1998, and what's left of the original Paramount Stations Group, now known as [[CBS Television Stations]]). National Amusements retains majority control of the two.\n\nTogether, these two companies own many of the former media assets of Gulf and Western and its Paramount successor today. Meanwhile, the Madison Square Garden properties (including the Knicks and Rangers) were sold to [[Cablevision]] not long after the Viacom takeover. Cablevision owned the MSG properties until 2010, when they were spun off as their own company. CBS retained ownership of the Paramount Parks chain for a few months after becoming part of the new CBS Corporation, but sold the parks to [[Cedar Fair]] in the summer of 2006, and thus National Amusements got out of the theme park ownership business entirely. Over the next few years, Cedar Fair purged references to Viacom-owned properties from the former Paramount Parks, a task completed in 2010. Viacom also sold its stake in the [[NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group|USA Networks]] to Universal in 1997, and the channels came under the ownership of Universal's successor, [[NBCUniversal]], which still retained those holdings as of late July 2013.\n\nDuring this time period, Paramount Pictures went under the guidance of Jonathan Dolgen, chairman and [[Sherry Lansing]], president.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-17/business/fi-35287_1_sony-pictures |title=Viacom to Name Jonathan Dolgen New Paramount Studio Head : Hollywood: The Sony Pictures executive will oversee movie and TV operations in a deal that is expected to be announced today. \u2013 latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=March 18, 1994 |accessdate=August 8, 2015 |first=Alan |last=Citron}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherrylansingfoundation.org/page.php?whPage=lansing.php |title=The Sherry Lansing Foundation |publisher=The Sherry Lansing Foundation |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref> During their administration over Paramount, the studio had an extremely successful period of films with two of Paramount's ten highest-grossing films being produced during this period.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/studio/chart/?view=company&view2=allrovis&studio=paramount.htm |title=Box Office by Studio: Paramount|website=BoxOfficeMojo.com |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> The most successful of these films, ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', a joint partnership with [[20th Century Fox]], and [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] became the highest-grossing film up to that time, grossing over $1.8&nbsp;billion worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=titanic.htm |title=Titanic|website=BoxOfficeMojo.com |date=March 15, 1998 |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> Also during this time, three Paramount Pictures films won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Picture; ''Titanic, Braveheart'', and ''Forrest Gump''.\n\nParamount's most important property, however, was ''Star Trek''.

Paramount also gained the ownership rights to the [[Rysher Entertainment|Rysher]] library, after Viacom acquired the rights from [[Cox Enterprises]].\n\nDuring this period, Paramount and its related subsidiaries and affiliates, operating under the name \"Viacom Entertainment Group\" also included the fourth largest group of theme parks in the United States and Canada which in addition to traditional rides and attractions launched numerous successful location-based entertainment units including a long running \"Star Trek\" attraction at the Las Vegas Hilton.

Through the combined efforts of Famous Music and the studio over ten \"Broadway\" musicals were created including Irving Berlin's ''White Christmas'', ''Footloose, Saturday Night Fever'', [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''Sunset Boulevard'' among others.

That logo was introduced as a prototype in the 1986 film ''[[The Golden Child]]''; the 1987 film ''[[Critical Condition (film)|Critical Condition]]'' was the first to feature the finalized version of the logo. 1999's ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' was the first to use an enhanced version of the logo, which was last used on 2002's ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]''.]]\n\n[[File:Paramount Pictures logo (2010).jpg|right|250px|thumb|For its 90th anniversary, Paramount adopted the logo shown here.

In the sound era, the logo was accompanied by a fanfare called ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' after the film of the same name, released in 1930. The words to the fanfare, originally sung in the 1930 film, were \"Proud of the crowd that will never be loud, it's Paramount on Parade.\"\n\nLegend has it that the mountain is based on a doodle made by [[W. W. Hodkinson]] during a meeting with [[Adolph Zukor]]. It is said to be based on the memories of his childhood in [[Utah]]. Some claim that Utah's [[Ben Lomond Mountain (Utah)|Ben Lomond]] is the mountain Hodkinson doodled, and that Peru's [[Artesonraju]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150268/artesonraju.html |title=Artesonraju \u2013 Climbing, Hiking & Mountaineering |publisher=SummitPost |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> is the mountain in the live-action logo, while others claim that the Italian side of [[Monte Viso|Monviso]] inspired the logo. Some editions of the logo bear a striking resemblance to the [[Pfeifferhorn]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.summitpost.org/trip-report/466312/wasatch-alpine-classic-north-ridge-pfeifferhorn-photo-trip-report-november-2008.html |title=Wasatch Alpine Classic |work=Summit Post |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> another [[Wasatch Range]] peak, and to the [[Matterhorn]] on the border between [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]]. [[Mount Huntington (Alaska)|Mount Huntington]] in Alaska also bears a striking resemblance.\n\nThe motion picture logo has gone through many changes over the years:\n* The logo began as a somewhat indistinct charcoal rendering of the mountain ringed with superimposed stars. The logo originally had twenty-four stars, as a tribute to the then current system of contracts for actors, since Paramount had twenty-four stars signed at the time.\n* In 1951, the logo was redesigned as a [[matte painting]] created by [[Jan Domela]].\n* A newer, more realistic-looking logo debuted in 1953 for Paramount films made in 3D. It was reworked in early-to-mid 1954 for Paramount films made in [[widescreen]] process [[VistaVision]]. The text ''VistaVision \u2013 Motion Picture High Fidelity'' was often imposed over the Paramount logo briefly before dissolving into the [[title sequence]]. In early 1968, the text \"A Paramount Picture/Release\" was shortened to \"Paramount\", and the byline ''A Gulf+Western Company'' appeared on the bottom. The logo was given yet another modification in 1974, with the number of stars being reduced to 22, and the Paramount text and Gulf+Western byline appearing in different fonts.\n* In September 1975, the logo was simplified in a shade of blue, adopting the modified design of the 1968 print logo, which was in use for many decades afterward. A version of the print logo had been in use by Paramount Television since 1968.\n* The studio launched an entirely new logo in December 1986 with [[computer-generated imagery]] of a lake and stars. This version of the Paramount logo was designed by Dario Campanile and animated by Apogee, Inc; for this logo, the stars would move across the screen into the arc shape instead of it being superimposed over the mountain as it was before. A redone version of this logo debuted with ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', released on June 30, 1999.\n* In March 2002, an updated logo was introduced in which shooting stars would fall from a night sky to form the arc while the Paramount logo would fly into place between them. An enhanced version of this logo debuted with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', released on May 7, 2010. The south col area of [[Mount Everest]] became the primary basis. The music is accompanied by ''Paramount on Parade''.

Paramount saw this as a bargain since the fleeting movie studio saw very little value in its library of old films at the time. To address any antitrust concerns, MCA set up [[EMKA, Ltd.]] as a dummy corporation to sell these films to television.

Hungarian-born founder [[Adolph Zukor]], who had been an early investor in [[nickelodeon movie theatre|nickelodeons]], saw that movies appealed mainly to working-class immigrants.<ref name=\"TIMWU2010\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iM6sos2U554C&printsec=frontcover |title=The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires \u2013 Tim Wu \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref> With partners [[Daniel Frohman]] and [[Charles Frohman]] he planned to offer feature-length films that would appeal to the middle class by featuring the leading theatrical players of the time (leading to the slogan \"Famous Players in Famous Plays\"). By mid-1913, Famous Players had completed five films, and Zukor was on his way to success. Its first film was ''[[Les Amours de la reine \u00c9lisabeth]]'', which starred [[Sarah Bernhardt]].\n\nThat same year, another aspiring producer, [[Jesse L. Lasky]], opened his Lasky Feature Play Company with money borrowed from his brother-in-law, Samuel Goldfish, later known as [[Samuel Goldwyn]]. The Lasky company hired as their first employee a stage director with virtually no film experience, [[Cecil B. DeMille]], who would find a suitable site in Hollywood, near Los Angeles, for his first feature film, ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]''.\n\n[[File:Paramount logo 1914.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Paramount Pictures' first logo, based on a design by its founder [[William Wadsworth Hodkinson]], used from 1917 to 1967.]]\n\nStarting in 1914, both Lasky and Famous Players released their films through a start-up company, Paramount Pictures Corporation, organized early that year by a Utah theatre owner, [[W. W. Hodkinson]], who had bought and merged several smaller firms. Hodkinson and actor, director, producer [[Hobart Bosworth]] had started production of a series of [[Jack London]] movies. Paramount was the first successful nationwide distributor; until this time, films were sold on a statewide or regional basis which had proved costly to film producers. Also, Famous Players and Lasky were privately owned while Paramount was a corporation.\n\n=== Famous Players-Lasky ===\n{{Main|Famous Players-Lasky}}\n[[File:Spanish Paramount logo (Distribuida Pela Paramount), circa 1929.ogv|thumb|The logo, with Portuguese captions: ''Distribuida Pela Paramount''.]]\nIn 1916, Zukor maneuvered a three-way merger of his Famous Players, the Lasky Company, and Paramount. Zukor and Lasky bought Hodkinson out of Paramount, and merged the three companies into one. The new company Lasky and Zukor founded, '''[[Famous Players-Lasky]] Corporation''', grew quickly, with Lasky and his partners Goldwyn and DeMille running the production side, Hiram Abrams in charge of distribution, and Zukor making great plans. With only the exhibitor-owned [[First National Pictures|First National]] as a rival, Famous Players-Lasky and its \"Paramount Pictures\" soon dominated the business.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lasky-company-merges-with-famous-players-later-to-become-paramount|title=Lasky Company merges with Famous Players, later to become Paramount \u2013 Jun 28, 1916 \u2013 HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:GrangeLasky-DeMille1913.jpg|thumb|left| Lasky's original studio (a.k.a. \"The Barn\") as it appeared in the mid 1920s. The Taft building, built in 1923, is visible in the background.]]\nBecause Zukor believed in stars, he signed and developed many of the leading early stars, including [[Mary Pickford]], [[Marguerite Clark]], [[Pauline Frederick]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Rudolph Valentino]], and [[Wallace Reid]]. With so many important players, Paramount was able to introduce \"[[block booking]]\", which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star's films had to buy a year's worth of other Paramount productions. It was this system that gave Paramount a leading position in the 1920s and 1930s, but which led the government to pursue it on [[antitrust]] grounds for more than twenty years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/ftc-case_into.htm|title=The Famous Players-Lasky Antitrust Case|website=www.cobbles.com|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe driving force behind Paramount's rise was Zukor. Through the teens and twenties, he built the '''Publix Theatres Corporation''', a chain of nearly 2,000 screens, ran two production studios (in [[Astoria, New York]], now the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]], and [[Hollywood, California]]), and became an early investor in radio, taking a 50% interest in the new [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] in 1928 (selling it within a few years; this would not be the last time Paramount and CBS crossed paths).\n\nIn 1926, Zukor hired independent producer [[B. P. Schulberg]], an unerring eye for new talent, to run the new West Coast operations. They purchased the Robert Brunton Studios, a 26-acre facility at 5451 Marathon Street for US$1 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paramount.com/node/7664 |title=1926: THE NEW STUDIO &#124; Paramount Pictures |publisher=Paramount.com |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114001735/http://www.paramount.com/node/7664 |archivedate=November 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1927, Famous Players-Lasky took the name '''Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation'''. Three years later, because of the importance of the Publix Theatres, it became '''Paramount Publix Corporation'''.\n\nIn 1928, Paramount began releasing ''[[Inkwell Imps]],'' animated cartoons produced by [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]]'s [[Fleischer Studios]] in New York City. The Fleischers, veterans in the animation industry, were among the few animation producers capable of challenging the prominence of [[Walt Disney]]. The Paramount newsreel series [[Paramount News]] ran from 1927 to 1957. Paramount was also one of the first Hollywood studios to release what were known at that time as \"[[sound film|talkies]]\", and in 1929, released their first musical, ''[[Innocents of Paris]]''.

Whiting]] and [[Leo Robin]] composed the score for the film; [[Maurice Chevalier]] starred and sung the most famous song from the film, \"[[Louise (Maurice Chevalier song)|Louise]]\".\n\n==== Publix, Balaban and Katz, Loew's competition and wonder theaters ====\n[[File:Publix theatre Indiana Repertory Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of Publix Theatre logo on what is now [[Indiana Repertory Theatre]].]]\n\nBy acquiring the successful [[Balaban & Katz]] chain in 1926, Zukor gained the services of [[Barney Balaban]] (who would eventually become Paramount's president in 1936), his brother [[A. J. Balaban]] (who would eventually supervise all stage production nationwide and produce talkie shorts), and their partner Sam Katz (who would run the Paramount-Publix theatre chain in New York City from the thirty-five-story Paramount Theatre Building on [[Times Square]]).\n\nBalaban and Katz had developed the Wonder Theater concept, first publicized around 1918 in Chicago. The Chicago Theater was created as a very ornate theater and advertised as a \"wonder theater.\" When Publix acquired Balaban, they embarked on a project to expand the wonder theaters, and starting building in New York in 1927. While Balaban and Public were dominant in Chicago, [[Loew's]] was the big player in New York, and did not want the Publix theaters to overshadow theirs. The two companies brokered a non-competition deal for New York and Chicago, and Loew's took over the New York area projects, developing five [[Loew's Wonder Theaters|wonder theaters]]. Publix continued Balaban's wonder theater development in its home area.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Kings Is Dead!

Zukor's over-expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases led the company into receivership in 1933. A bank-mandated reorganization team, led by [[John D. Hertz|John Hertz]] and [[Otto Kahn]] kept the company intact, and, miraculously, Zukor was kept on. In 1935, Paramount-Publix went bankrupt. In June 1935 [[John E. Otterson]]<ref>Eileen S. Quigley.

In this role, Zukor reorganized the company as '''Paramount Pictures, Inc.''' and was able to successfully bring the studio out of bankruptcy.\n\nAs always, Paramount films continued to emphasize stars; in the 1920s there were [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Wallace Reid]], [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Florence Vidor]], [[Thomas Meighan]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Bebe Daniels]], [[Antonio Moreno]], [[Richard Dix]], [[Esther Ralston]], [[Emil Jannings]], [[George Bancroft (actor)|George Bancroft]], [[Betty Compson]], [[Clara Bow]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], and [[Charles Buddy Rogers]]. By the late 1920s and the early 1930s, talkies brought in a range of powerful draws: [[Richard Arlen]], [[Nancy Carroll]], [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Charles Ruggles]], [[Ruth Chatterton]], [[William Powell]], [[Mae West]], [[Sylvia Sidney]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Claudette Colbert]], the [[Marx Brothers]], [[W.C.

[[Leonard Goldenson]], who had headed the chain since 1938, remained as the new company's president. The Balaban and Katz theatre division was spun off with UPT; its trademark eventually became the property of the Balaban and Katz Historical Foundation. The Foundation has recently acquired ownership of the Famous Players Trademark. Cash-rich and controlling prime downtown real estate, Goldenson began looking for investments. Barred from film-making by prior antitrust rulings, he acquired the struggling [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network in February 1953, leading it first to financial health, and eventually, in the mid-1970s, to first place in the national Nielsen ratings, before selling out to [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities]] in 1985 (Capital Cities would eventually sell out, in turn, to [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1996). United Paramount Theaters was renamed ABC Theaters in 1965 and was sold to businessman Henry Plitt in 1977. The movie theater chain was renamed Plitt Theaters. In 1985, [[Cineplex Odeon Corporation]] merged with Plitt. In later years, Paramount's TV division would develop a strong relationship with ABC, providing many hit series to the network.\n\n==== The DuMont Network ====\nParamount Pictures had been an early backer of television, launching experimental stations in 1939 in Los Angeles and Chicago. The Los Angeles station eventually became [[KTLA]], the first commercial station on the West Coast. The Chicago station got a commercial license as WBKB in 1943, but was sold to UPT along with Balaban & Katz in 1948 and was eventually resold to CBS as [[WBBM-TV]].\n\nIn 1938, Paramount bought a stake in television manufacturer [[DuMont Laboratories]].

A few years earlier, the federal regulator had placed a five-station cap on all television networks: no network was allowed to own more than five [[VHF]] television stations. Paramount was hampered by its minority stake in the DuMont Television Network. Although both DuMont and Paramount executives stated that the companies were separate, the FCC ruled that Paramount's partial ownership of DuMont meant that DuMont and Paramount were in theory branches of the same company. Since DuMont owned three television stations and Paramount owned two, the federal agency ruled neither network could acquire additional television stations. The FCC requested that Paramount relinquish its stake in DuMont, but Paramount refused.<ref name=\"Browne\" /> According to television historian William Boddy, \"Paramount's checkered antitrust history\" helped convince the FCC that Paramount controlled DuMont.<ref name=\"Boddy\">{{cite book|last=Boddy|first=William|title=Fifties Television: the Industry and Its Critics|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1992|page=56|isbn=0-252-06299-X}}</ref> Both DuMont and Paramount Television Network suffered as a result, with neither company able to acquire five O&Os.

By the mid-1950s, all the great names were gone; only [[Cecil B. DeMille]], associated with Paramount since 1913, kept making pictures in the grand old style. Despite Paramount's losses, DeMille would, however, give the studio some relief and create his most successful film at Paramount, a 1956 [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|remake]] of his 1923 film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/tenc.html |title=Filmsite.org |publisher=Filmsite.org |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> DeMille died in 1959.

Bluhdorn immediately put his stamp on the studio, installing a virtually unknown producer named [[Robert Evans]] as head of production.

The recently refurbished studio has come to symbolize Hollywood for many visitors, and its studio tour is a popular attraction.\n\n=== 1989\u201394: Paramount Communications ===\n{{Infobox company\n|name = Paramount Communications, Inc.\n|type = [[Conglomerate (company)|Conglomerate]]\n|logo = Paramount Communications Inc. logo.png\n|logo_size = 300px\n|fate = Sold and merged into [[Viacom (1952-2006)|Viacom]]\n|predecessor = [[Gulf+Western]]\n|successor = [[Viacom (1952-2006)|Viacom]] (now remnants operating as [[ViacomCBS]] owned by National Amusements)\n|foundation = {{start date and age|1989}}\n|defunct = {{end date and age|1994|7|7}}\n|location = [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]\n|industry = [[Entertainment]], [[industry]], [[mass media]]\n|key_people = [[Charles Bluhdorn]], Martin S.

The idea was to aid financial markets in measuring the company's success, which, in turn, would help place better value on its shares. Though its Paramount division did very well in recent years, Gulf and Western's success as a whole was translating poorly with investors. This process eventually led Davis to divest many of the company's subsidiaries. Its sugar plantations in Florida and the Dominican Republic were sold in 1985; the consumer and industrial products branch was sold off that same year.<ref name = \"lbm\" /> In 1989, Davis renamed the company Paramount Communications Incorporated after its primary asset, Paramount Pictures.<ref name=\"restructure\">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-10/business/fi-1718_1_paramount-s-parent-plans-values-publishing-businesses|title=Gulf & Western Wants Buyer for Finance Division : Paramount's Parent Plans to Change Name, Focus on Entertainment, Publishing|last=Williams|first=Linda|date=April 10, 1989|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref> In addition to the Paramount film, television, home video, and music publishing divisions, the company continued to own the Madison Square Garden properties (which also included [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]]), a 50% stake in [[USA Network]]s (the other 50% was owned by [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]/[[Universal Studios]]) and Simon & Schuster, [[Prentice Hall]], [[Pocket Books]], [[Allyn & Bacon]], Cineamerica (a joint venture with [[Warner Communications]]), and Canadian cinema chain [[Famous Players Theatres]].<ref name = \"lbm\">Prince, Stephen (2000) ''A New Pot of Gold: Hollywood Under the Electronic Rainbow, 1980\u20131989'' (p. 60-65). [[University of California Press]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]/[[Los Angeles, California]]. {{ISBN|0-520-23266-6}}</ref>\n\nThat same year, the company launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire [[Time Inc.]] in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications, which also renamed itself after a [[Warner Bros.|film studio it owned]] upon selling off its non-entertainment assets. (The original name of Warner Communications was [[Kinney National Company]].) This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Gulf and Western responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time-Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Gulf and Western to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of [[Time Warner]].\n\nParamount used cash acquired from the sale of Gulf and Western's non-entertainment properties to take over the [[TVX Broadcast Group]] chain of television stations (which at that point consisted mainly of large-market stations which TVX had bought from [[Taft Broadcasting]], plus two mid-market stations which TVX owned prior to the Taft purchase), and the [[KECO Entertainment]] chain of theme parks from Taft successor Great American Broadcasting. Both of these companies had their names changed to reflect new ownership: TVX became known as the [[Paramount Stations Group]], while KECO was renamed to [[Paramount Parks]].\n\nParamount Television launched Wilshire Court Productions in conjunction with USA Networks, before the latter was renamed [[NBCUniversal Cable]], in 1989. Wilshire Court Productions (named for a side street in Los Angeles) produced [[television film]]s that aired on the USA Networks, and later for other networks. USA Networks launched a second channel, the Sci-Fi Channel (now known as [[Syfy]]), in 1992. As its name implied, it focused on films and television series within the science fiction genre. Much of the initial programming was owned either by Paramount or Universal. Paramount bought one more television station in 1993: [[Cox Enterprises]]' [[WKBD-TV]] in Detroit, Michigan, at the time an affiliate of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].\n\n=== 1994\u20132005: Dolgen/Lansing and \"old\" Viacom era ===\nOn July 7, 1994, Paramount Communications Inc. was sold to [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Report|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/44482/0000950112-94-002132.txt|website=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players: The Outsiders|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=61 |quote=Viacom completed acquisition of Paramount Communications in July 1994, creating one of the world's largest entertainment companies.}}</ref> following the purchase of 50.1% of Paramount's shares for $9.75 billion.

Around the same time, Viacom bought out [[Spelling Television|Spelling Entertainment]], incorporating its library into that of Paramount itself.\n\nViacom split into two companies in 2006, one retaining the [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] name (which continues to own Paramount Pictures), while another was named [[CBS Corporation]] (which now controls Paramount Television Group, which was renamed CBS Paramount Television, now known as [[CBS Television Studios]] and worldwide distribution unit is now [[CBS Television Distribution]] and [[CBS Studios International]], in 2006, Simon & Schuster [except for Prentice Hall and other educational units, which Viacom sold to [[Pearson PLC]] in 1998, and what's left of the original Paramount Stations Group, now known as [[CBS Television Stations]]). National Amusements retains majority control of the two.\n\nTogether, these two companies own many of the former media assets of Gulf and Western and its Paramount successor today. Meanwhile, the Madison Square Garden properties (including the Knicks and Rangers) were sold to [[Cablevision]] not long after the Viacom takeover. Cablevision owned the MSG properties until 2010, when they were spun off as their own company. CBS retained ownership of the Paramount Parks chain for a few months after becoming part of the new CBS Corporation, but sold the parks to [[Cedar Fair]] in the summer of 2006, and thus National Amusements got out of the theme park ownership business entirely. Over the next few years, Cedar Fair purged references to Viacom-owned properties from the former Paramount Parks, a task completed in 2010. Viacom also sold its stake in the [[NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group|USA Networks]] to Universal in 1997, and the channels came under the ownership of Universal's successor, [[NBCUniversal]], which still retained those holdings as of late July 2013.\n\nDuring this time period, Paramount Pictures went under the guidance of Jonathan Dolgen, chairman and [[Sherry Lansing]], president.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-17/business/fi-35287_1_sony-pictures |title=Viacom to Name Jonathan Dolgen New Paramount Studio Head : Hollywood: The Sony Pictures executive will oversee movie and TV operations in a deal that is expected to be announced today. \u2013 latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=March 18, 1994 |accessdate=August 8, 2015 |first=Alan |last=Citron}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherrylansingfoundation.org/page.php?whPage=lansing.php |title=The Sherry Lansing Foundation |publisher=The Sherry Lansing Foundation |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref> During their administration over Paramount, the studio had an extremely successful period of films with two of Paramount's ten highest-grossing films being produced during this period.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/studio/chart/?view=company&view2=allrovis&studio=paramount.htm |title=Box Office by Studio: Paramount|website=BoxOfficeMojo.com |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> The most successful of these films, ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', a joint partnership with [[20th Century Fox]], and [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] became the highest-grossing film up to that time, grossing over $1.8&nbsp;billion worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=titanic.htm |title=Titanic|website=BoxOfficeMojo.com |date=March 15, 1998 |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> Also during this time, three Paramount Pictures films won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Picture; ''Titanic, Braveheart'', and ''Forrest Gump''.\n\nParamount's most important property, however, was ''Star Trek''.

By 1998 ''Star Trek'' TV shows, movies, books, videotapes, and licensing provided so much of the studio's profit that \"it is not possible to spend any reasonable amount of time at Paramount and not be aware of [its] presence\"; filming for ''Star Trek: Voyager'' and ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' required up to nine of the largest of the studio's 36 [[sound stage]]s.<ref name=\"meehan2005\">{{cite book |title=Why TV is not our fault: television programming, viewers, and who's really in control |last=Meehan |first=Eileen R. |year=2005 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEtw4yGRjwUC&lpg=PA93&dq=%22star%20trek%22%20%22the%20franchise%22%20paramount&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q=%22star%20trek%22%20%22the%20franchise%22%20paramount&f=false |isbn=0-7425-2486-8}}</ref><ref name=\"poe1998\">{{cite book |title=A Vision of the Future |last=Poe |first=Stephen Edward |year=1998 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-671-53481-5}}</ref>{{rp|49\u201350,54}}\n\nIn 1995, Viacom and [[Chris-Craft Industries]]' [[BHC Communications#United Television|United Television]] launched [[UPN|United Paramount Network]] (UPN) with ''Star Trek: Voyager'' as its flagship series, fulfilling Barry Diller's plan for a Paramount network from 25 years earlier.

The TV division produced the dominant prime time show for the decade in ''Frasier'' as well as such long running hits as NCIS and ''Becker'' and the dominant prime time magazine show ''Entertainment Tonight.'' Paramount also gained the ownership rights to the [[Rysher Entertainment|Rysher]] library, after Viacom acquired the rights from [[Cox Enterprises]].\n\nDuring this period, Paramount and its related subsidiaries and affiliates, operating under the name \"Viacom Entertainment Group\" also included the fourth largest group of theme parks in the United States and Canada which in addition to traditional rides and attractions launched numerous successful location-based entertainment units including a long running \"Star Trek\" attraction at the Las Vegas Hilton. Famous Music \u2013 the company's celebrated music publishing arm almost doubled in size and developed artists including Pink, Bush, Green Day as well as catalog favorites including Duke Ellington and Henry Mancini. The Paramount/Viacom licensing group under the leadership of [[Tom McGrath (media executive)|Tom McGrath]] created the \"Cheers\" franchise bars and restaurants and a chain of restaurants borrowing from the studio's Academy Award-winning film ''Forrest Gump'' \u2013 ''The Bubba Gump Shrimp Company''. Through the combined efforts of Famous Music and the studio over ten \"Broadway\" musicals were created including Irving Berlin's ''White Christmas'', ''Footloose, Saturday Night Fever'', [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''Sunset Boulevard'' among others. The Company's international arm, United International Pictures (UIP), was the dominant distributor internationally for ten straight years representing Paramount, Universal and MGM. Simon and Schuster became part of the Viacom Entertainment Group emerging as the US' dominant trade book publisher.\n\nIn 2002, Paramount; along with [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Sony Pictures|Columbia TriStar Pictures Entertainment]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/UA Entertainment]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]], [[DreamWorks Pictures]], [[Artisan Entertainment]], [[Lionsgate|Lions Gate Entertainment]], and [[Warner Bros.]] formed the [[Digital Cinema Initiatives]].

Some editions of the logo bear a striking resemblance to the [[Pfeifferhorn]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.summitpost.org/trip-report/466312/wasatch-alpine-classic-north-ridge-pfeifferhorn-photo-trip-report-november-2008.html |title=Wasatch Alpine Classic |work=Summit Post |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> another [[Wasatch Range]] peak, and to the [[Matterhorn]] on the border between [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]]. [[Mount Huntington (Alaska)|Mount Huntington]] in Alaska also bears a striking resemblance.\n\nThe motion picture logo has gone through many changes over the years:\n* The logo began as a somewhat indistinct charcoal rendering of the mountain ringed with superimposed stars. The logo originally had twenty-four stars, as a tribute to the then current system of contracts for actors, since Paramount had twenty-four stars signed at the time.\n* In 1951, the logo was redesigned as a [[matte painting]] created by [[Jan Domela]].\n* A newer, more realistic-looking logo debuted in 1953 for Paramount films made in 3D. It was reworked in early-to-mid 1954 for Paramount films made in [[widescreen]] process [[VistaVision]]. The text ''VistaVision \u2013 Motion Picture High Fidelity'' was often imposed over the Paramount logo briefly before dissolving into the [[title sequence]]. In early 1968, the text \"A Paramount Picture/Release\" was shortened to \"Paramount\", and the byline ''A Gulf+Western Company'' appeared on the bottom. The logo was given yet another modification in 1974, with the number of stars being reduced to 22, and the Paramount text and Gulf+Western byline appearing in different fonts.\n* In September 1975, the logo was simplified in a shade of blue, adopting the modified design of the 1968 print logo, which was in use for many decades afterward. A version of the print logo had been in use by Paramount Television since 1968.\n* The studio launched an entirely new logo in December 1986 with [[computer-generated imagery]] of a lake and stars. This version of the Paramount logo was designed by Dario Campanile and animated by Apogee, Inc; for this logo, the stars would move across the screen into the arc shape instead of it being superimposed over the mountain as it was before. A redone version of this logo debuted with ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', released on June 30, 1999.\n* In March 2002, an updated logo was introduced in which shooting stars would fall from a night sky to form the arc while the Paramount logo would fly into place between them. An enhanced version of this logo debuted with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', released on May 7, 2010. The south col area of [[Mount Everest]] became the primary basis. The music is accompanied by ''Paramount on Parade''. This logo continued to be featured on DVD and Blu-ray releases with the [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|first incarnation of Viacom]] byline until March 5, 2019, ending with ''[[Instant Family]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n* On December 16, 2011, an updated logo<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/12/paramount-unveils-100th-anniversary-logo/ |title=Paramount Unveils New Logo As Part Of 100th Anniversary Celebration |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mission-impossible-ghost-protocol-paramount-anniversary-logo-273798 |title=Hollywood Reporter \u2013 Paramount Pictures Release 100th Anniversary Logo |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paramount.com/news/press-releases/paramount-pictures-unveils-new-logo-in-celebration-of-the-studio%27s-100th-anniversary|title=Press Release \u2013 Paramount Pictures Unveils New Logo in Celebration of the Studio's 100th Anniversary|publisher=Paramount.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028110852/http://www.paramount.com/news/press-releases/paramount-pictures-unveils-new-logo-in-celebration-of-the-studio%E2%80%99s-100th-anniversary|archive-date=October 28, 2012|accessdate=March 16, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> was introduced with animation done by Devastudios, Inc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.devastudios.com/ |title=Devastudios \u2013 Paramount Pictures |publisher=Devastudios.com |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}</ref> The new logo includes a surrounding mountain range and the sun shining in the background.

Paramount saw this as a bargain since the fleeting movie studio saw very little value in its library of old films at the time. To address any antitrust concerns, MCA set up [[EMKA, Ltd.]] as a dummy corporation to sell these films to television.

These people were the main sources of transmission of the virus to the other 50%, in a single situation being unable to identify a suggestive epidemiological context for the diagnosed patient.<ref name=\"schitea\" /> Two diagnosed people (cases #17 and #27) were responsible for infecting 22% of the number of patients.<ref name=\"schitea\" /> This situation was possible because each of them hid from authorities, in the initial phase, the fact that they had previously travelled to an area at risk of infection, which delayed the initiation of the epidemiological investigation and exposed more people to the risk of infection. More than half of the cases (54%) were diagnosed in three counties: [[Bucharest]], [[Timi\u0219 County|Timi\u0219]] and [[Hunedoara County|Hunedoara]].<ref name=\"schitea\" /> A patient out of three was diagnosed in Bucharest.

He joined [[glam rock]] group [[Roxy Music]] as [[synthesiser]] player in 1971, recording two albums with the group. He departed in 1973 to record a number of solo albums, coining the term \"ambient music\" to describe his work on releases such as ''[[Another Green World]]'' (1975) and ''[[Music for Airports]]'' (1978). He also collaborated with artists such as [[Robert Fripp]], [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]], [[Harold Budd]], [[David Bowie]], and [[David Byrne]], and [[music producer|produced]] albums by artists including [[John Cale]], [[Jon Hassell]], [[Laraaji]], [[Talking Heads]] and [[Devo]], and the [[no wave]] compilation ''[[No New York]]'' (1978).

He did, however, eventually appear on stage as a performing member of the group, usually flamboyantly costumed.

''Tiger Mountain'' contains the galloping \"Third Uncle\", one of Eno's best-known songs, owing in part to its later being covered by [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] and [[801 (band)|801]]. Critic [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]] writes that the song is \"a near punk attack of riffing guitars and clattering percussion, 'Third Uncle' could, in other hands, be a heavy metal anthem, albeit one whose lyrical content would tongue-tie the most slavish air guitarist.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dave |url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t821132|pure_url=yes}} |title=All Music review |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThese four albums were remastered and reissued in 2004 by [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]'s [[Astralwerks]] label. Due to Eno's decision not to add any extra tracks of the original material, a handful of tracks originally issued as singles have not been reissued, including the single mix of \"King's Lead Hat\", the title of which is an [[anagram]] of \"[[Talking Heads]]\", whilst \"Seven Deadly Finns\" and \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" were included on the [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] ''Eno Box II: Vocal''.\n\nDuring this period, Eno also played three dates with [[Phil Manzanera]] in the band [[801 (band)|801]], a \"[[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]\" that performed more or less reworked selections from albums by Eno, Manzanera, and [[Quiet Sun (band)|Quiet Sun]], as well as covers of songs by [[The Beatles]] (\"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\") and [[The Kinks]] (\"[[You Really Got Me]]\").\n\nIn 1967, Eno developed a [[delay (audio effect)|tape delay]] system. The technique involved two [[Revox]] tape recorders set up side by side, with the tape unspooling from the first deck being carried over to the second deck to be spooled.  This enabled sound recorded on the first deck to be played back by the second deck at a time delay that varied with the distance between the two decks and the speed of the tape (typically a few seconds). Working with [[Robert Fripp]] (from [[King Crimson]]) the pair used this system in their collaboration ''[[(No Pussyfooting)]]'' (1973).<ref name=\"BBCEquatorialStars\">{{cite web|title = BBC \u2013 Experimental Review \u2013 Fripp Eno, The Equatorial Stars | publisher = BBC| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/qqzf/ |date=5 July 2004|author=Marsh, Peter|accessdate = 8 June 2008 }}</ref> Subsequently, Fripp referred to this method as \"[[Frippertronics]]\". In 1975, Fripp and Eno released a second album, ''[[Evening Star (Fripp & Eno album)|Evening Star]]'', and played several live shows in Europe.\n\nEno was a prominent member of the performance art-classical orchestra the [[Portsmouth Sinfonia]]&nbsp;\u2013 having started playing clarinet with them in 1972. In 1973, he produced the orchestra's first album ''The Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays the Popular Classics'' (released in March 1974) and in 1974, he produced the live album ''Hallelujah! The Portsmouth Sinfonia Live at the Royal Albert Hall'', a recording of their infamous May 1974 concert (released in October 1974). In addition to producing both albums, Eno performed in the orchestra on both recordings playing the clarinet. Eno also deployed the orchestra's famously dissonant string section on his second solo album ''Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)''. The orchestra at this time included other musicians whose solo work he would subsequently release on his Obscure label including [[Gavin Bryars]] and [[Michael Nyman]]. That year he also composed music for the album ''[[Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy]]'', with [[Kevin Ayers]], to accompany the poet [[Lady June|June Campbell Cramer]].\n\n==== Ambient music ====\n{{Main|Ambient music}}\nEno released a number of eclectic ambient electronic and acoustic albums. He coined the term \"ambient music\",<ref>{Prendergast, ''The Ambient Century'': p.93}</ref> which is designed to modify the listener's perception of the surrounding environment. In the liner notes accompanying [[Ambient 1: Music for Airports|''Ambient 1: Music for Airports'']], Eno wrote: \"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.\"<ref>{(PVC7908(AMB001)}</ref>\n\nEno was hit by a taxi while crossing the street in January 1975 and spent several weeks recuperating at home. His girlfriend brought him an old record of harp music, which he lay down to listen to. He realized that he had set the amplifier to a very low volume, and one channel of the stereo was not working, but he lacked the energy to get up and correct it. \"This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music \u2013 as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and sound of the rain were parts of the ambience.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/how-brian-eno-created-a-quiet-revolution-in-music/|title=How Brian Eno created a quiet revolution in music|work=The Telegraph|access-date=21 October 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nEno's first work of ambient music was ''[[Discreet Music]]'' (1975), again created with an elaborate tape-delay methodology which he diagrammed on the back cover of the LP; it is considered the landmark album of the genre. This was followed by his ''Ambient'' series: ''[[Music for Airports]] (Ambient 1)'', ''[[The Plateaux of Mirror]] (Ambient 2)'' featuring Harold Budd on keyboard, ''[[Day of Radiance]] (Ambient 3)'' with American composer [[Laraaji]] playing zither and hammered dulcimer, and ''[[On Land]] (Ambient 4)'').\n\n===1980s===\n\nIn 1980, Eno provided a film score for [[Herbert Vesely]]'s ''[[Egon Schiele \u2013 Exzess und Bestrafung]]'', also known as ''Egon Schiele \u2013 Excess and Punishment''. The ambient-style score was an unusual choice for an historical piece, but it worked effectively with the film's themes of sexual obsession and death.\n\nBefore Eno made ''On Land,'' [[Robert Quine]] played him [[Miles Davis]]' \"[[Get Up With It|He Loved Him Madly]]\" (1974). Eno stated in the liner notes for ''On Land,'' \"Teo Macero's revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the \"spacious\" quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini's 1973 film ''Amarcord'', it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/onland-txt.html |title=''Ambient 4: On Land'' 1986 release notes |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980 to 1981, during which time Eno travelled to [[Ghana]] for a festival of West African music, he was collaborating with [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] of [[Talking Heads]]. Their album [[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'']], was built around radio broadcasts Eno collected whilst living in the [[United States]], along with sampled music recordings from around the world transposed over music predominantly inspired by African and [[Middle East]]ern rhythms.\n\nIn 1983, Eno collaborated with his brother, [[Roger Eno]], and [[Daniel Lanois]] on the album ''[[Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks]]'' that had been commissioned by Al Reinert for his film ''[[For All Mankind]]'' (1989).<ref>{{cite news|first1=John L.|last1=Walters|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Pop review: Brian Eno's Apollo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/22/brian-eno-apollo-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Brian Eno explains Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/08/apollo-11-moon-brian-eno|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Tracks from the album were subsequently used in several other films, including ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/soundtrack|title=Trainspotting (1996)|accessdate=16 January 2018|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nIn September 1992, Eno released ''[[Nerve Net]]'', an album utilising heavily syncopated rhythms with contributions from several former collaborators including Fripp, [[Benmont Tench]], [[Robert Quine]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]. This album was a last-minute substitution for ''My Squelchy Life'', which contained more pop oriented material, with Eno on vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20032-brian-eno-nerve-netthe-shutov-assemblynerolithe-drop/|title=Brian Eno: Nerve Net/The Shutov Assembly/Neroli/The Drop Album Review - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> Several tracks from ''My Squelchy Life'' later appeared on 1993's retrospective box set ''Eno Box II: Vocals,'' and the entire album was eventually released in 2014 as part of an expanded re-release of ''Nerve Net.'' Eno also released ''[[The Shutov Assembly]]'' in 1992, recorded between 1985 and 1990. This album embraces [[atonality]] and abandons most conventional concepts of [[Mode (music)|modes]], [[Scale (music)|scales]] and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. Emancipated from the constant attraction towards the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] that underpins the Western [[tonal music|tonal tradition]], the gradually shifting music originally eschewed any conventional instrumentation, save for treated keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/me_intr3.html#q2|title=Brian Eno interviewed by Michael Engelbrecht|website=Music.hyperreal.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, Eno worked increasingly with self-generating musical systems, the results of which he called [[generative music]]. This allows the listener to hear music that slowly unfolds in almost infinite non-repeating combinations of sound.<ref>The Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music pp118-119 Ed. Nick Collins ({{ISBN|9780521688659}})</ref> In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated that it would take almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. Eno achieves this through the blending of several independent musical tracks of varying length. Each track features different musical elements and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again re-configuring differently with the other tracks. He has presented this music in his own art and sound installations and those in collaboration with other artists, including ''[[I Dormienti]] (The Sleepers)'', ''[[Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace \u2013 The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg|Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace]],'' ''[[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]],'' ''[[The Quiet Room]],'' and ''Music for Prague.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/music-time-and-long-term-thinking-brian-eno-expands-the-vocabulary-of-human-feeling-98e0fbad5950|title=Brian Eno Expands the Vocabulary of Human Feeling|first=The Long Now|last=Foundation|date=30 November 2017|website=Medium.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of Eno's better-known collaborations was with the members of [[U2]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and several other artists in a group called Passengers. They produced the 1995 album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]],'' which reached No. 76 on the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and No. 12 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It featured a single, \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\", which reached number 6 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/miss%20sarajevo/|title=miss+sarajevo {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> This collaboration is chronicled in Eno's book ''[[A Year with Swollen Appendices]],'' a diary published in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Eno scored the six-part fantasy television series ''[[Neverwhere]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115288/fullcredits|title=Neverwhere (TV Mini-Series 1996\u2013 )|accessdate=8 December 2017|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2004, Fripp and Eno recorded another ambient music collaboration album, ''[[The Equatorial Stars]]''.\n\nEno returned in June 2005 with ''[[Another Day on Earth]]'', his first major album since ''[[Wrong Way Up]]'' (with [[John Cale]]) to prominently feature vocals (a trend he continued with ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]''). The album differs from his 1970s solo work due to the impact technological advances on musical production, evident in its semi-electronic production.\n\nIn early 2006, Eno collaborated with David Byrne again, for the reissue of ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' in celebration of the influential album's 25th anniversary. Eight previously unreleased tracks recorded during the initial sessions in 1980/81, were added to the album.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6382-david-byrne/\n| title = Interview: David Byrne\n| last = Dahlen\n| first = Chris\n| date = 17 July 2006\n| work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>\nAn unusual interactive marketing strategy was employed for its re-release, the album's promotional website features the ability for anyone to officially and legally download the [[multitrack recording|multi-tracks]] of two songs from the album, \"A Secret Life\" and \"Help Me Somebody\". This allowed listeners to [[remix]] and upload new mixes of these tracks to the website for others to listen and rate them.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno Profile Long Now Foundation 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Eno at the [[Long Now Foundation]], 26 June 2006]]\nIn late 2006, Eno released ''[[77 Million Paintings]]'', a program of generative video and music specifically for home computers. As its title suggests, there is a possible combination of 77 million paintings where the viewer will see different combinations of video slides prepared by Eno each time the program is launched. Likewise, the accompanying music is generated by the program so that it's almost certain the listener will never hear the same arrangement twice. The second edition of \"77 Million Paintings\" featuring improved morphing and a further two layers of sound was released on 14 January 2008. In June 2007, when commissioned in the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]], San Francisco, California, [[Annabeth Robinson]] (AngryBeth Shortbread) recreated ''77 Million Paintings'' in [[Second Life]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Author|first=Unknown|title=77-million-paintings-brian-eno|url=http://longnow.org/events/02007/jun/29/77-million-paintings-brian-eno/|work=77 Million Paintings|publisher=The Long Now Foundation|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Eno's music was featured in a [[Ecstasy (2007 film)|movie adaption]] of [[Irvine Welsh]]'s best-selling collection ''[[Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance]]''. He also appeared playing keyboards in ''[[Voila (album)|Voila]]'', [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s solo album sung entirely in French.\n\nAlso in 2007, Eno contributed a composition titled \"Grafton Street\" to [[Dido (singer)|Dido's]] third album, ''[[Safe Trip Home]]'', released in November 2008.<ref name=\"qmag\">Aizlewood, John.

Eno's lengthy string of producer credits includes albums for [[Talking Heads]], [[U2]], [[Devo]], [[Ultravox]] and [[James (band)|James]]. He also produced part of the 1993 album ''[[When I Was a Boy]]'' by [[Jane Siberry]]. He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 [[BRIT Awards]].\n\nEno describes himself as a \"non-musician\", using the term \"treatments\" to describe his modification of the sound of musical instruments, and to separate his role from that of the traditional instrumentalist. His skill at using \"The Studio as a Compositional Tool\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/downbeat79.htm |title=Pro Session&nbsp;\u2013 The Studio as Compositional Tool |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> (the title of an essay by Eno) led in part to his career as a producer. His methods were recognised at the time (mid-1970s) as unique, so much so that on [[Genesis (band)|Genesis's]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', he is credited with 'Enossification'; on [[Robert Wyatt]]'s ''[[Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard]]'' with a ''Direct inject anti-jazz raygun'' and on [[John Cale]]'s [[Island Records|Island]] albums as simply being \"Eno\".\n\nEno has contributed to recordings by artists as varied as [[Nico]], Robert Calvert, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Zvuki Mu]], in various capacities such as use of his studio/synthesiser/electronic treatments, vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and as just being 'Eno'. In 1984, he (amongst others) composed and performed the \"Prophecy Theme\" for the [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''; the rest of the [[Dune (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was composed and performed by the group [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. Eno produced performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]]'s ''[[Bright Red]]'' album, and also composed for it. The work is avant-garde spoken word with haunting and magnifying sounds. Eno played on David Byrne's musical score for ''The Catherine Wheel'', a project commissioned by [[Twyla Tharp]] to accompany her Broadway dance project of the same name.\n\nHe worked with Bowie as a writer and musician on Bowie's influential 1977\u201379 'Berlin Trilogy' of albums, ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]], [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'', on Bowie's later album ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]'', and on the song \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Recorded in France and Germany, the spacey effects on ''Low'' were largely created by Eno, who played a portable [[EMS Synthi A]] synthesizer.

In 1995, U2 and Eno joined forces to create the album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]'' under the group name Passengers; songs from which included \"[[Your Blue Room]]\" and \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\".  Even though films are listed and described for each song, all but three are bogus. Eno also produced ''[[Laid (album)|Laid]]'' (1993), ''[[Wah Wah (album)|Wah Wah]]'' (1994) ''[[Millionaires (album)|Millionaires]]'' (1999) and ''[[Pleased to Meet You (James album)|Pleased to Meet You]]'' (2001) for [[James (band)|James]], performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for \"frequent interference and occasional co-production\" on their 1997 album ''[[Whiplash (album)|Whiplash]]''.\n\nEno played on the 1986 album ''[[Measure for Measure (album)|Measure for Measure]]'' by Australian band [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]]. He remixed two tracks for [[Depeche Mode]], \"[[I Feel You]]\" and \"[[In Your Room (Depeche Mode song)|In Your Room]]\", both single releases from the album ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' in 1993. In 1995, Eno provided one of several remixes of \"[[Protection (Massive Attack song)|Protection]]\" by [[Massive Attack]] (originally from their ''[[Protection (Massive Attack album)|Protection]]'' album) for release as a single.\n\nIn 2007, he produced the fourth studio album by [[Coldplay]], ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'', released in 2008. Also in 2008, he worked with [[Grace Jones]] on her album ''[[Hurricane (Grace Jones album)|Hurricane]]'', credited for \"production consultation\" and as a member of the band, playing keyboards, treatments and background vocals. He worked on the twelfth studio album by [[U2]], again with Lanois, titled ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]''. It was recorded in Morocco, the South of France and [[Dublin]] and released in Europe on 27 February 2009.\n\nIn 2011, Eno and Coldplay reunited and Eno contributed \"enoxification\" and additional composition on Coldplay's fifth studio album ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]'', released on 24 October of that year.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno's musical web.jpg|thumb|Eno's connections to other progressive rock music artists]]\n\n===The Microsoft Sound===\nIn 1994, [[Microsoft]] designers [[Mark Malamud]] and Erik Gavriluk approached Eno to compose music for the [[Windows 95]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/intel-microsoft-research-in-motion-apple/5/25/2010/id/28465?refresh=1|title=Who Created The Windows Start-Up Sound?|last=Rohrlich|first=Justin|date=25 May 2010|work=[[Minyanville]]'s Wall Street|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> The result was the six-second [[Booting|start-up]] music-sound of the Windows 95 [[operating system]], \"The Microsoft Sound\".

It's like making a tiny little jewel.\n\nIn fact, I made eighty-four pieces. I got completely into this world of tiny, tiny little pieces of music. I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke a logjam in my own work.

He started experimenting with the medium of video in 1978. Eno describes the first video camera he received, which would initially become his main tool for creating ambient video and light installations:\n\n\"One afternoon while I was working in the studio with [[Talking Heads]], the roadie from [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], working in an adjacent studio, came in and asked whether anyone wanted to buy some video equipment. I'd never really thought much about video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was, at that time, quite exotic.\"<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). ''77 Million Paintings'' \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref>\n\nThe [[Panasonic]] industrial camera Eno received had significant [[design flaws]] preventing the camera from sitting upright without the assistance of a tripod. This led to his works being filmed in vertical format, requiring the television set to be flipped on its side to view it in the proper orientation.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref> The pieces Eno produced with this method, such as ''Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan'' (1980) and ''[[Thursday Afternoon]]'' (1984) (accompanied by the album of the same title), were labelled as 'Video Paintings.' He explained the genre title in the music magazine NME:\n\n\"I was delighted to find this other way of using video because at last here's video which draws from another source, which is painting&nbsp;... I call them 'video paintings' because if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/nme85.html#Thursday |title=NME: Proxy Music |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |date=9 November 1985 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThese works presented Eno with the opportunity to expand his ambient aesthetic into a visual form, manipulating the medium of video to produce something not present in the normal television experience. His video works were shown around the world in exhibitions in New York and Tokyo, as well as released on the compilation 14 Video Paintings in 2005.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 5.</ref>\n\nEno continued his video experimentation through the 80s, 90s and 2000s, leading to further experimentation with the television as a malleable light source and informing his generative works such as [[77 Million Paintings]] in 2006.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 6\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Generative music===\nEno gives the example of [[wind chime]]s. He says that these systems and the creation of them have been a focus of his since he was a student: \"I got interested in the idea of music that could make itself, in a sense, in the mid 1960s really, when I first heard composers like [[Terry Riley]], and when I first started playing with tape recorders.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/appsblog/2012/sep/26/brian-eno-scape-ipad-apps|title=Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers talk Scape, iPad apps and generative music|first=Stuart|last=Dredge|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=3 May 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\nInitially Eno began to experiment with tape loops to create [[generative music]] systems. With the advent of CDs he developed systems to make music of indeterminate duration using several discs of material that he'd specifically recorded so that they would work together musically when driven by random playback.\n\nIn 1995, he began working with the company Intermorphic to create generative music through utilising programmed algorithms. The collaboration with Intermorphic led Eno to release ''Generative Music 1'' - which requires Intermorphic's ''Koan Player'' software for PC. The Koan software made it possible for generative music to be experienced in the domestic environment for the first time.\n\n====Generative Music 1====\nIn 1996, Eno collaborated in developing the SSEYO [[Koan (program)|Koan]] generative music software system (by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of Intermorphic) that he used in composing ''Generative Music 1''\u2014only playable on the Koan generative music system. Further music releases using Koan software include: ''Wander'' (2001) and ''Dark Symphony'' (2007)\u2014both include works by Eno, and those of other artists (including SSEYO's Tim Cole).\n\n====Released excerpts====\nEno started to release excerpts of results from his 'generative music' systems as early as 1975 with the album ''Discreet Music''. Then again in 1978 with ''Music for Airports'':\n\n{{Quote|text=Music for Airports, at least one of the pieces on there, is structurally very, very simple. There are sung notes, sung by three women and my self. One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long [recorded tape] loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank's studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable \u2013 they are not likely to come back into sync again. So this is the piece moving along in time. Your experience of the piece of course is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements. The basic elements in that particular piece never change. They stay the same. But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety. In fact it's about eight minutes long on that record, but I did have a thirty minute version which I would bore friends who would listen to it. The thing about pieces like this of course is that they are actually of almost infinite length if the numbers involved are complex enough. They simply don't ever re-configure in the same way again. This is music for free in a sense. The considerations that are important, then, become questions of how the system works and most important of all what you feed into the system. |author=Brian Eno |source=Generative Music: A talk delivered in San Francisco, June 8, 1996<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html|title=Generative Music \u2013 Brian Eno \u2013 In Motion Magazine|website=Inmotionmagazine.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe list below consists of albums, soundtracks and downloadable files that contain excerpts from some of Eno's generative music explorations:\n{{div col}}\n\n* 1970 \u2013 Berlin Horse [Film Short]\n* 1975 \u2013 Discreet Music\n* 1975 \u2013 Evening Star (Fripp & Eno)\n* 1978 \u2013 Ambient 1: Music For Airports\n* 1981 \u2013 Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan [Installation Video]\n* 1982 \u2013 Ambient 4: On Land\n* 1983 \u2013 Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1983 \u2013 Music For Films II (Eno, Lanois & R Eno) [exclusive to 'Working Backwards' Box Set]\n* 1984 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon [Installation Video]\n* 1985 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon\n* 1988 \u2013 Music For Films III (Various Artists)\n* 1989 \u2013 Textures (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1989 \u2013 For All Mankind [Documentary Soundtrack]\n* 1992 \u2013 The Shutov Assembly\n* 1993 \u2013 Neroli (Thinking Music Part IV)\n* 1994 \u2013 Glitterbug [Original Soundtrack]\n* 1996 \u2013 Neverwhere [BBC TV Mini-Series Soundtrack]\n* 1997 \u2013 Contra 1.2\n* 1997 \u2013 Lightness\n* 1998 \u2013 Music for Prague\n* 1999 \u2013 I Dormienti\n* 1999 \u2013 Kite Stories\n* 2000 \u2013 Music For Civic Recovery Centre\n* 2001 \u2013 Compact Forest Proposal\n* 2003 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume I\n* 2004 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume II\n* 2012 \u2013 Lux\n* 2013 \u2013 CAM [Web \u2013 the book 'Brian Eno: Visual Music' includes a Download Code]\n* 2014 \u2013 The Shutov Bonus Material ['Shutov Assembly' Bonus CD]\n* 2014 \u2013 New Space Music ['Neroli' Bonus CD]\n* 2016 \u2013 The Ship\n* 2016 \u2013 Reflection\n* 2017 \u2013 Sisters [Web Download]\n* 2018 \u2013 Music for Installations [Box Set]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.enoshop.co.uk/BrianEnoMusicForInstallations | title=Brian Eno Releases 'Music for Installations' on May 4th (2018)|website=Enoshop.co.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\nSeveral of the released excerpts (listed above) originated as, or are derivative of, soundtracks Eno created for art installations.

Ross writes in the programme notes to Matrix 44 in 1981: \"In a series of painterly video installations first shown in 1979, Eno explored the notion of environmental ambiance. Eno proposes a use for music and video that is antithetical to behavior control-oriented \"Muzak\" in that it induces and invites the viewer to enter a meditative, detached state, rather than serve as an operant conditioner for work-force efficiency. His underlying strategy is to create works which provide natural levels of variety and redundancy which bring attention to, rather than mimic, essential characteristics of the natural environment. Eno echoes Matisse's stated desire that his art serve as an armchair for the weary businessman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu/exhibition/44|title=BAMPFA - Art Exhibitions - Brian Eno / MATRIX 44|website=Archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarly installations benefitted from breakthroughs in video technology that inspired Eno to use the TV screen as a monitor and enabled him to experiment with the opposite of the fast-moving narratives typical of TV to create evolving images with an almost imperceptible rate of change. \"2 Fifth Avenue\", (\"a linear four-screen installation with music from Music For Airports\") resulted from Eno shooting \"the view from his apartment window: without&nbsp;... intervention,\" recording \"what was in front of the camera for an unspecified period of time&nbsp;... In a simple but crude form of experimental post production, the colour controls of the monitors on which the work was shown were adjusted to wash out the picture, producing a high-contrast black and white image in which colour appeared only in the darkest areas.&nbsp;... Eno manipulated colour as though painting, observing: 'video for me is a way of configuring light, just as painting is a way of configuring paint.'\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music.

TV was actually the most controllable light source that had ever been invented \u2013 because you could precisely specify the movement and behaviour of several million points of coloured light on a surface. The fact that this prodigious possibility had almost exclusively been used to reproduce figurative images in the service of narratives pointed to evolution of the medium from the theatre and cinema. What I thought was that this machine, which pumped out highly controllable light, was actually the first synthesizer, and that its use as an imager-retailer represented a subset of its possible range.\" <ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P121. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nTurning the TV on its back, Eno played video colour fields of differing lengths of time that would slowly re-combine in different configurations. Placing ziggurats (3 dimensional constructions) of different lengths and sizes on top of the screens that defined each separate colour field, these served to project the internal light source upward. \"The light from it was tangible as though caught in a cloud of vapour. Its slowly changing hues and striking colour collisions were addictive. We sat watching for ages, transfixed by this totally new experience of light as a physical presence.\"<ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P122. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nCalling these light sculptures Crystals (first shown in Boston in 1983), Eno further developed them for the Pictures of Venice exhibition at Gabriella Cardazzo's Cavallino Gallery (Venice,1985). Placing plexiglass on top of the structures he found that these further diffused the light so the shapes outlined through this surface appeared to be described differently in the slowly changing fields of light.<ref>My Light Years Brian Eno np accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nBy positioning sound sources in different places and different heights in the exhibition room Eno intended that the music would be something listened to from the inside rather than the outside. For the [[I Dormienti]] show in 1999 that featured sculptures of sleeping figures by [[Mimmo Paladino]] in the middle of the circular room, Eno placed speakers in each of the 12 tunnels running from it.\n\nEnvisioning the speakers themselves as instruments, led to Eno's 'speaker flowers' becoming a feature of many installations, including at the Museo dell' Ara Pacis (Rome, 2008), again with Mimmo Paladino and 'Speaker Flowers and Lightboxes' at [[Castello Svevo]] in Trani (Italy 2017). Re-imagining the speaker as a flower with a voice that could be heard as it moved in the breeze, he made 'bunches' of them, \"sculptural objects [that]&nbsp;... consist of tiny chassis speakers attached to tall metal stands that sway in response to the sound they emit.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106131601/http://www.jamesputnam.org.uk/httpwww.jamesputnam.org.ukinv_exhibition_26.html] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The first version of these were shown at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]](1984).\n\nSince ''[[On Land]]'' (1982), Eno has sought to blur the boundaries between music and non-music and incorporates environmental sounds into his work. He treats synthesised and recorded sounds for specific effects.<ref>''Brian Eno : Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time'',  Christopher Scoates, pp. 135\u2013137, {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the antithesis of 20th century [[shock art]], Eno's works create environments that are: \"Envisioned as extensions of everyday life while offering a refuge from its stresses.\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music p.132 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref> Creating a space to reflect was a stated aim in Eno's Quiet Club series of installations that have shown across the world, and include [[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]] at the [[David Toop]] curated Sonic Boom festival at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in 2000.\n\nThe Quiet Club series (1986-2001) grew from Eno's site-specific installations that included the Place series (1985-1989). These also featured light sculptures and audio with the addition of conventional materials, such as \"tree trunks, fish bowls, ladders, rocks\". Eno used these in unconventional ways to create new and unexpected experiences and modes of engagements, offering an extension of and refuge from, everyday life.<ref>Brian Eno: Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time: Christopher Scoates pp132/136 {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nThe continually flowing non-repeating music and art of Eno's installations mitigate against [[habituation]] to the work and maintain the visitors' engagement with it. \"One of the things I enjoy about my shows is...lots of people sitting quietly watching something that has no story, few recognisable images and changes very slowly. It's somewhere between the experience of painting, cinema, music and meditation...I dispute the assumption that everyone's attention span is getting shorter: I find people are begging for experiences that are longer and slower, less \"dramatic\" and more sensual.\" <ref>{Brian Eno Visual Music p.135 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}}</ref> Tanya Zimbardo writing on New Urban Spaces Series 4. \"Compact Forest Proposal\" for SF MOMA (2001) confirms: \"During the first presentation of this work, as part of the exhibition 010101: Art in Technological Times at SFMOMA in 2001, visitors often spent considerable time in this dreamlike space.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/publication/soundtracks/brian-eno/|title=Brian Eno|website=SFMOMA|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Eno's work, both art and music are released from their normal constraints. The music set up to randomly reconfigure is modal and abstract rather than tonal, and so the listener is freed from expectations set up by Western tonal harmonic conventions.<ref>The Dynamics of Harmony: Pratt. {{ISBN|9780198790204}}</ref> The artworks in their continual slowly shifting combinations of colour (and in the case of 77 Million Paintings image re-configurations) themselves offer a continually engaging immersive experience through their unfolding fields of light.\n\n====77 Million Paintings====\nDevelopments in computer technology meant that the experience of Eno's unending non-repeatable generative art and music was no longer only possible in the public spaces of his exhibitions. With software developer and programmer Jake Dowie, Eno created a generative art/music installation '[[77 Million Paintings]]' for the domestic environment. Developed for both PC and Mac, the process is explained by Nick Robertson in the accompanying booklet. \"One way to approach this idea is to imagine that you have a large box full of painted components and you are allowed to blindly take out between one and four of these at any time and overlay them to make a complete painting. The selection of the elements and their duration in the painting is variable and arbitrarily determined\u2026\" <ref name=\"auto2\">Painting By Numbers, Nick Robertson, 77 Million Paintings HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nMost (nearly all) of the visual 'elements' were hand-painted by Eno onto glass slides, creating an organic heart to the work. Some of the slides had formed his earlier 'Natural Selections' exhibition projected onto the windows of the [[Triennale]] in Milan. (1990). This exhibition marked the beginning of Eno's site specific installations that re-defined spaces on a large scale.<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music The Aesthetics of Time. Christopher Scoates. ISBN P. 124</ref>\n\nFor the Triennale exhibition, Eno with Rolf Engel and Roland Blum at Atelier Marktgraph, used new 'dataton' technology that could be programmed to control the fade up and out times of the light sources.<ref>My Light Years by Brian Eno. 77 Million Paintings (accompanying booklet)HNDVD 1521</ref> But, unlike the software developed for '77 Million', this was clumsy and limited the practical realisation of Eno's vision.\n\nWith the computer programmed to randomly select a combination of up to four images of different durations, the on screen painting continually reconfigures as each image slowly dissolves whilst another appears. The painting will be different for every viewer in every situation, uniquely defining each moment. Eno likens his role in creating this piece to one of a gardener planting seeds. And like a gardener he watches to see how they grow, waiting to see if further intervention is necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/brian_eno-composers-as-gardeners|title=Composers as Gardeners|website=Edge.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> In the liner notes Nick Robertson explains: \"Every user will buy exactly the same pack of 'seeds' but they will all grow in different ways and into distinct paintings, the vast majority of which, the artist himself has not even seen. \u2026The original in art is no longer solely bound up in the physical object, but rather in the way the piece lives and grows.\"<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAlthough designed for the domestic environment, 77 million paintings has been (and continues to be) exhibited in multi-screen installations across the world. It has also been projected onto architectural structures, including the sails of the [[Sydney Opera House]] (2009), [[Carioca Aqueduct]] (The Arcos Di Lapa) Brazil (2012) and the giant [[Lovell Telescope]] at the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] (2016). During an exhibition at Fabrica Brighton, (2010) the orthopaedic surgeon Robin Turner noticed the calming effect the work had on the visitors.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Turner asked Eno to provide a version for the Montefiore hospital in Hove. Since then 77 Million and Eno's latest \"Light Boxes\" have been commissioned for use in hospitals.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n====Montefiore Hospital Installations====\nIn 2013, Eno created two permanent light and sound installations at Montefiore Hospital in Hove, East Sussex, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-22189774|title=Brian Eno branches out into hospital work|first=Jane|last=Dreaper|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=3 May 2017|website=Bbc.com}}</ref> In the hospital's reception area \"77 Million Paintings for Montefiore\" consists of eight plasma monitors mounted on the wall in a diagonally radiating flower-like pattern. They display an evolving collage of coloured patterns and shapes whilst Eno's generative ambient music plays discreetly in the background. The other aptly named \"Quiet Room for Montefiore\" (available for patients, visitors and staff) is a space set apart for meditative reflection. It is a moderately sized room with three large panels displaying dissolves of subtle colours in patterns that are reminiscent of Mondrian paintings. The environment brings Eno's ambient music into focus and facilitates the visitors' cognitive drift, freeing them to contemplate or relax.\n\n====Spore====\nEno composed most of the music for the [[Electronic Arts]] video game [[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]] (2008), assisted by his long-term collaborator, the musician and programmer [[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]]. Much of the music is generative and responsive to the player's position within the game.\n\n====iOS apps====\nInspired by possibilities presented to Eno and Peter Chilvers whilst working together on the generative soundtrack for the video game ''Spore'' (2008), the two began to release generative music in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App]] format. They set up the website generativemusic.com and created generative music applications for the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]], and [[iPad]]:\n\n* 2008 \u2013 [[Bloom (software)|''Bloom'']]\n* 2009 \u2013 ''Trope''\n* 2012 \u2013 ''Scape''\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Reflection''\n\nIn 2009, Peter Chilvers and Sandra O'Neill also created an App entitled ''Air'' (released through generativemusic.com as well) \u2013 based on concepts developed by Eno in his ''Ambient 1: Music for Airports'' album.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/10/review-brian-en.html |title=Eno and Chilvers Release Sweet Music App for iPhone &#124, Listening Post |journal=Wired |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Reflection====\nThe generative version of ''Reflection'' is the fourth iOS App created by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers: of generativemusic.com. Unlike other Apps they released ''Reflection'' provides no real options other than Play/Pause \u2013 later, in its initial update, Airplay and Sleep Timer options were added. As Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price. For those who'd bought the app at a higher price, Eno and Chilvers provided links to a free download of a four track album called 'Sisters' (each track with a 15:14 duration). The following appears on the app's Apple iTunes page:\n\n{{Quote|text=As a result of the Brexit-related fall in value of the British pound Apple have increased the prices of all apps sold in the UK by 25%. While we always intended REFLECTION to be a premium priced app, we feel this increase makes it too expensive, so we will take the hit in order to keep the British price to the consumer at its original level.\n\nIn other territories this decision will translate into a reduced price for the app.\n\nAs a thank you to everyone who has supported the REFLECTION app, we are adding a free surprise downloadable gift to it for a limited time.

I wanted also that this music would unfold differently all the time \u2013 'like sitting by a river': it's always the same river, but it's always changing. But recordings \u2013 whether vinyl, cassette or CD \u2013 are limited in length, and replay identically each time you listen to them. So in the past I was limited to making the systems which make the music, but then recording 30 minutes or an hour and releasing that. Reflection in its album form \u2013 on vinyl or CD \u2013 is like this. But the app by which Reflection is produced is not restricted: it creates an endless and endlessly changing version of the piece of music.\n\nThe creation of a piece of music like this falls into three stages: the first is the selection of sonic materials and a musical mode \u2013 a constellation of musical relationships. These are then patterned and explored by a system of algorithms which vary and permutate the initial elements I feed into them, resulting in a constantly morphing stream (or river) of music. The third stage is listening. Once I have the system up and running I spend a long time \u2013 many days and weeks in fact \u2013 seeing what it does and fine-tuning the materials and sets of rules that run the algorithms. It's a lot like gardening: you plant the seeds and then you keep tending to them until you get a garden you like.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brianenomusic/posts/1516385288375657|title=Brian Eno|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe version of ''Reflection'' available on the fixed formats (CD, Vinyl and download File) consists of two (joined) excerpts from the ''Reflection'' app. This was revealed in Brian's interview with Philip Sherburne:\n\n{{Quote|text=[Philip Sherburne] Given the infinite nature of the Reflection project, was it difficult to select the 54-minute chunk that became the album?\n\n[Brian Eno] Yes, it was quite interesting doing that. When you're running it as an ephemeral piece, you have quite different considerations. If there is something that is a bit doubtful or odd, you think, OK, that's just in the nature of the piece and now it's passed and we're somewhere else. Whereas if you're thinking of it as a record that people are going to listen to again and again, what philosophy do you take? Choose just a random amount of time? Could have done that. Just do several of them and fix them together? Is that faking it? These are very interesting philosophical questions.\n\n[Philip Sherburne] Which approach did you follow?\n\n[Brian Eno] A hybrid approach. I generated 11 pieces of the length I'd set the piece to be and I had them all in my iTunes on random shuffle, so I would be listening at night, doing other things, and as one ran through, I would think, That was a nice one, I particularly like the second half. So then I would make a note. I did this for quite a few evenings. There were two that I really liked. On one, the last 40 minutes of it were lovely, and on another, the first 25 minutes of it were really nice. So I thought, This is a studio, I'm making a record. I'll edit them together! It was like the birth of rock'n'roll. I'm allowed to do that! It's not cheating. It was quite a bit of jiggery-pokery to find a place I could do it, but the result is two pieces stuck together. |author=Philip Sherburne / Brian Eno |source=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/10023-a-conversation-with-brian-eno-about-ambient-music/|title=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music \u2013 Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n===Artworks: Light Boxes===\nEno's \"light boxes\" utilise advances in LED technology that has enabled him to re-imagine his ziggurat light paintings - and early light boxes as featured in [[Kite Stories]] (1999) - for the domestic environment. The light boxes feature slowly changing combinations of colour fields that draw attention differently to the shapes outlined by delineating structures within. As the paintings slowly evolve each passing moment is defined differently, drawing the viewer's focus into the present moment. The writer and cultural essayist Michael Bracewell writes that the viewer \"is also encouraged to engage with a generative sensor/aesthetic experience that reflects the ever-changing moods and randomness of life itself\". He likens Eno's art to \"Matisse or Rothko at their most enfolding.\" <ref>Brian Eno - Light Music: Shedding Light. Michael Bracewell.

They remain in permanent display in both private and public spaces. Recognised for their therapeutic contemplative benefits, Eno's 'light paintings' have been commissioned for specially dedicated places of reflection including in Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the Montefiore Hospital in Hove and a three and a half metre lightbox for the sanctuary room in the Macmillan Horizon Centre in Brighton.\n\n===Obscure Records===\nEno started the Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The first group of three releases included his own composition, ''[[Discreet Music]]'', and the now-famous ''The Sinking of the Titanic'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet]]'' (1971) by [[Gavin Bryars]]. The second side of ''Discreet Music'' consisted of several versions of [[Canon in D|Pachelbel's Canon]], the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage and to which he applied various algorithmic transformations, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a [[tape loop]] system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds in some of his collaborations with Fripp, most notably on ''Evening Star''. Ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Michael Nyman]], and [[John Cage]].\n\n===Other work===\n[[File:Nigel_Osborne_&_Brian_Eno_at_Mostar_1994-95.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Professor [[Nigel Osborne]] and Brian Eno leading music workshops, Pavarotti centre, Bosnia 1995.<ref name = \"foodoflove\">Nickalls, Susan.

He did, however, eventually appear on stage as a performing member of the group, usually flamboyantly costumed.

Critic [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]] writes that the song is \"a near punk attack of riffing guitars and clattering percussion, 'Third Uncle' could, in other hands, be a heavy metal anthem, albeit one whose lyrical content would tongue-tie the most slavish air guitarist.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dave |url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t821132|pure_url=yes}} |title=All Music review |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThese four albums were remastered and reissued in 2004 by [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]'s [[Astralwerks]] label. Due to Eno's decision not to add any extra tracks of the original material, a handful of tracks originally issued as singles have not been reissued, including the single mix of \"King's Lead Hat\", the title of which is an [[anagram]] of \"[[Talking Heads]]\", whilst \"Seven Deadly Finns\" and \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" were included on the [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] ''Eno Box II: Vocal''.\n\nDuring this period, Eno also played three dates with [[Phil Manzanera]] in the band [[801 (band)|801]], a \"[[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]\" that performed more or less reworked selections from albums by Eno, Manzanera, and [[Quiet Sun (band)|Quiet Sun]], as well as covers of songs by [[The Beatles]] (\"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\") and [[The Kinks]] (\"[[You Really Got Me]]\").\n\nIn 1967, Eno developed a [[delay (audio effect)|tape delay]] system. The technique involved two [[Revox]] tape recorders set up side by side, with the tape unspooling from the first deck being carried over to the second deck to be spooled.  This enabled sound recorded on the first deck to be played back by the second deck at a time delay that varied with the distance between the two decks and the speed of the tape (typically a few seconds). Working with [[Robert Fripp]] (from [[King Crimson]]) the pair used this system in their collaboration ''[[(No Pussyfooting)]]'' (1973).<ref name=\"BBCEquatorialStars\">{{cite web|title = BBC \u2013 Experimental Review \u2013 Fripp Eno, The Equatorial Stars | publisher = BBC| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/qqzf/ |date=5 July 2004|author=Marsh, Peter|accessdate = 8 June 2008 }}</ref> Subsequently, Fripp referred to this method as \"[[Frippertronics]]\". In 1975, Fripp and Eno released a second album, ''[[Evening Star (Fripp & Eno album)|Evening Star]]'', and played several live shows in Europe.\n\nEno was a prominent member of the performance art-classical orchestra the [[Portsmouth Sinfonia]]&nbsp;\u2013 having started playing clarinet with them in 1972. In 1973, he produced the orchestra's first album ''The Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays the Popular Classics'' (released in March 1974) and in 1974, he produced the live album ''Hallelujah! The Portsmouth Sinfonia Live at the Royal Albert Hall'', a recording of their infamous May 1974 concert (released in October 1974). In addition to producing both albums, Eno performed in the orchestra on both recordings playing the clarinet. Eno also deployed the orchestra's famously dissonant string section on his second solo album ''Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)''. The orchestra at this time included other musicians whose solo work he would subsequently release on his Obscure label including [[Gavin Bryars]] and [[Michael Nyman]]. That year he also composed music for the album ''[[Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy]]'', with [[Kevin Ayers]], to accompany the poet [[Lady June|June Campbell Cramer]].\n\n==== Ambient music ====\n{{Main|Ambient music}}\nEno released a number of eclectic ambient electronic and acoustic albums. He coined the term \"ambient music\",<ref>{Prendergast, ''The Ambient Century'': p.93}</ref> which is designed to modify the listener's perception of the surrounding environment. In the liner notes accompanying [[Ambient 1: Music for Airports|''Ambient 1: Music for Airports'']], Eno wrote: \"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.\"<ref>{(PVC7908(AMB001)}</ref>\n\nEno was hit by a taxi while crossing the street in January 1975 and spent several weeks recuperating at home. His girlfriend brought him an old record of harp music, which he lay down to listen to. He realized that he had set the amplifier to a very low volume, and one channel of the stereo was not working, but he lacked the energy to get up and correct it. \"This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music \u2013 as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and sound of the rain were parts of the ambience.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/how-brian-eno-created-a-quiet-revolution-in-music/|title=How Brian Eno created a quiet revolution in music|work=The Telegraph|access-date=21 October 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nEno's first work of ambient music was ''[[Discreet Music]]'' (1975), again created with an elaborate tape-delay methodology which he diagrammed on the back cover of the LP; it is considered the landmark album of the genre. This was followed by his ''Ambient'' series: ''[[Music for Airports]] (Ambient 1)'', ''[[The Plateaux of Mirror]] (Ambient 2)'' featuring Harold Budd on keyboard, ''[[Day of Radiance]] (Ambient 3)'' with American composer [[Laraaji]] playing zither and hammered dulcimer, and ''[[On Land]] (Ambient 4)'').\n\n===1980s===\n\nIn 1980, Eno provided a film score for [[Herbert Vesely]]'s ''[[Egon Schiele \u2013 Exzess und Bestrafung]]'', also known as ''Egon Schiele \u2013 Excess and Punishment''. The ambient-style score was an unusual choice for an historical piece, but it worked effectively with the film's themes of sexual obsession and death.\n\nBefore Eno made ''On Land,'' [[Robert Quine]] played him [[Miles Davis]]' \"[[Get Up With It|He Loved Him Madly]]\" (1974). Eno stated in the liner notes for ''On Land,'' \"Teo Macero's revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the \"spacious\" quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini's 1973 film ''Amarcord'', it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/onland-txt.html |title=''Ambient 4: On Land'' 1986 release notes |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980 to 1981, during which time Eno travelled to [[Ghana]] for a festival of West African music, he was collaborating with [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] of [[Talking Heads]]. Their album [[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'']], was built around radio broadcasts Eno collected whilst living in the [[United States]], along with sampled music recordings from around the world transposed over music predominantly inspired by African and [[Middle East]]ern rhythms.\n\nIn 1983, Eno collaborated with his brother, [[Roger Eno]], and [[Daniel Lanois]] on the album ''[[Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks]]'' that had been commissioned by Al Reinert for his film ''[[For All Mankind]]'' (1989).<ref>{{cite news|first1=John L.|last1=Walters|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Pop review: Brian Eno's Apollo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/22/brian-eno-apollo-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Brian Eno explains Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/08/apollo-11-moon-brian-eno|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Tracks from the album were subsequently used in several other films, including ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/soundtrack|title=Trainspotting (1996)|accessdate=16 January 2018|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nIn September 1992, Eno released ''[[Nerve Net]]'', an album utilising heavily syncopated rhythms with contributions from several former collaborators including Fripp, [[Benmont Tench]], [[Robert Quine]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]. This album was a last-minute substitution for ''My Squelchy Life'', which contained more pop oriented material, with Eno on vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20032-brian-eno-nerve-netthe-shutov-assemblynerolithe-drop/|title=Brian Eno: Nerve Net/The Shutov Assembly/Neroli/The Drop Album Review - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> Several tracks from ''My Squelchy Life'' later appeared on 1993's retrospective box set ''Eno Box II: Vocals,'' and the entire album was eventually released in 2014 as part of an expanded re-release of ''Nerve Net.'' Eno also released ''[[The Shutov Assembly]]'' in 1992, recorded between 1985 and 1990. This album embraces [[atonality]] and abandons most conventional concepts of [[Mode (music)|modes]], [[Scale (music)|scales]] and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. Emancipated from the constant attraction towards the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] that underpins the Western [[tonal music|tonal tradition]], the gradually shifting music originally eschewed any conventional instrumentation, save for treated keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/me_intr3.html#q2|title=Brian Eno interviewed by Michael Engelbrecht|website=Music.hyperreal.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, Eno worked increasingly with self-generating musical systems, the results of which he called [[generative music]]. This allows the listener to hear music that slowly unfolds in almost infinite non-repeating combinations of sound.<ref>The Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music pp118-119 Ed. Nick Collins ({{ISBN|9780521688659}})</ref> In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated that it would take almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. Eno achieves this through the blending of several independent musical tracks of varying length. Each track features different musical elements and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again re-configuring differently with the other tracks. He has presented this music in his own art and sound installations and those in collaboration with other artists, including ''[[I Dormienti]] (The Sleepers)'', ''[[Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace \u2013 The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg|Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace]],'' ''[[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]],'' ''[[The Quiet Room]],'' and ''Music for Prague.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/music-time-and-long-term-thinking-brian-eno-expands-the-vocabulary-of-human-feeling-98e0fbad5950|title=Brian Eno Expands the Vocabulary of Human Feeling|first=The Long Now|last=Foundation|date=30 November 2017|website=Medium.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of Eno's better-known collaborations was with the members of [[U2]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and several other artists in a group called Passengers. They produced the 1995 album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]],'' which reached No. 76 on the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and No. 12 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It featured a single, \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\", which reached number 6 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/miss%20sarajevo/|title=miss+sarajevo {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> This collaboration is chronicled in Eno's book ''[[A Year with Swollen Appendices]],'' a diary published in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Eno scored the six-part fantasy television series ''[[Neverwhere]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115288/fullcredits|title=Neverwhere (TV Mini-Series 1996\u2013 )|accessdate=8 December 2017|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2004, Fripp and Eno recorded another ambient music collaboration album, ''[[The Equatorial Stars]]''.\n\nEno returned in June 2005 with ''[[Another Day on Earth]]'', his first major album since ''[[Wrong Way Up]]'' (with [[John Cale]]) to prominently feature vocals (a trend he continued with ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]''). The album differs from his 1970s solo work due to the impact technological advances on musical production, evident in its semi-electronic production.\n\nIn early 2006, Eno collaborated with David Byrne again, for the reissue of ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' in celebration of the influential album's 25th anniversary. Eight previously unreleased tracks recorded during the initial sessions in 1980/81, were added to the album.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6382-david-byrne/\n| title = Interview: David Byrne\n| last = Dahlen\n| first = Chris\n| date = 17 July 2006\n| work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>\nAn unusual interactive marketing strategy was employed for its re-release, the album's promotional website features the ability for anyone to officially and legally download the [[multitrack recording|multi-tracks]] of two songs from the album, \"A Secret Life\" and \"Help Me Somebody\". This allowed listeners to [[remix]] and upload new mixes of these tracks to the website for others to listen and rate them.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno Profile Long Now Foundation 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Eno at the [[Long Now Foundation]], 26 June 2006]]\nIn late 2006, Eno released ''[[77 Million Paintings]]'', a program of generative video and music specifically for home computers. As its title suggests, there is a possible combination of 77 million paintings where the viewer will see different combinations of video slides prepared by Eno each time the program is launched. Likewise, the accompanying music is generated by the program so that it's almost certain the listener will never hear the same arrangement twice. The second edition of \"77 Million Paintings\" featuring improved morphing and a further two layers of sound was released on 14 January 2008. In June 2007, when commissioned in the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]], San Francisco, California, [[Annabeth Robinson]] (AngryBeth Shortbread) recreated ''77 Million Paintings'' in [[Second Life]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Author|first=Unknown|title=77-million-paintings-brian-eno|url=http://longnow.org/events/02007/jun/29/77-million-paintings-brian-eno/|work=77 Million Paintings|publisher=The Long Now Foundation|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Eno's music was featured in a [[Ecstasy (2007 film)|movie adaption]] of [[Irvine Welsh]]'s best-selling collection ''[[Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance]]''. He also appeared playing keyboards in ''[[Voila (album)|Voila]]'', [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s solo album sung entirely in French.\n\nAlso in 2007, Eno contributed a composition titled \"Grafton Street\" to [[Dido (singer)|Dido's]] third album, ''[[Safe Trip Home]]'', released in November 2008.<ref name=\"qmag\">Aizlewood, John.

He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 [[BRIT Awards]].\n\nEno describes himself as a \"non-musician\", using the term \"treatments\" to describe his modification of the sound of musical instruments, and to separate his role from that of the traditional instrumentalist.

His methods were recognised at the time (mid-1970s) as unique, so much so that on [[Genesis (band)|Genesis's]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', he is credited with 'Enossification'; on [[Robert Wyatt]]'s ''[[Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard]]'' with a ''Direct inject anti-jazz raygun'' and on [[John Cale]]'s [[Island Records|Island]] albums as simply being \"Eno\".\n\nEno has contributed to recordings by artists as varied as [[Nico]], Robert Calvert, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Zvuki Mu]], in various capacities such as use of his studio/synthesiser/electronic treatments, vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and as just being 'Eno'. In 1984, he (amongst others) composed and performed the \"Prophecy Theme\" for the [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''; the rest of the [[Dune (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was composed and performed by the group [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. Eno produced performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]]'s ''[[Bright Red]]'' album, and also composed for it.

Also in 2008, he worked with [[Grace Jones]] on her album ''[[Hurricane (Grace Jones album)|Hurricane]]'', credited for \"production consultation\" and as a member of the band, playing keyboards, treatments and background vocals. He worked on the twelfth studio album by [[U2]], again with Lanois, titled ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]''. It was recorded in Morocco, the South of France and [[Dublin]] and released in Europe on 27 February 2009.\n\nIn 2011, Eno and Coldplay reunited and Eno contributed \"enoxification\" and additional composition on Coldplay's fifth studio album ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]'', released on 24 October of that year.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno's musical web.jpg|thumb|Eno's connections to other progressive rock music artists]]\n\n===The Microsoft Sound===\nIn 1994, [[Microsoft]] designers [[Mark Malamud]] and Erik Gavriluk approached Eno to compose music for the [[Windows 95]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/intel-microsoft-research-in-motion-apple/5/25/2010/id/28465?refresh=1|title=Who Created The Windows Start-Up Sound?|last=Rohrlich|first=Justin|date=25 May 2010|work=[[Minyanville]]'s Wall Street|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> The result was the six-second [[Booting|start-up]] music-sound of the Windows 95 [[operating system]], \"The Microsoft Sound\".

He started experimenting with the medium of video in 1978. Eno describes the first video camera he received, which would initially become his main tool for creating ambient video and light installations:\n\n\"One afternoon while I was working in the studio with [[Talking Heads]], the roadie from [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], working in an adjacent studio, came in and asked whether anyone wanted to buy some video equipment. I'd never really thought much about video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was, at that time, quite exotic.\"<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). ''77 Million Paintings'' \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref>\n\nThe [[Panasonic]] industrial camera Eno received had significant [[design flaws]] preventing the camera from sitting upright without the assistance of a tripod. This led to his works being filmed in vertical format, requiring the television set to be flipped on its side to view it in the proper orientation.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref> The pieces Eno produced with this method, such as ''Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan'' (1980) and ''[[Thursday Afternoon]]'' (1984) (accompanied by the album of the same title), were labelled as 'Video Paintings.' He explained the genre title in the music magazine NME:\n\n\"I was delighted to find this other way of using video because at last here's video which draws from another source, which is painting&nbsp;... I call them 'video paintings' because if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/nme85.html#Thursday |title=NME: Proxy Music |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |date=9 November 1985 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThese works presented Eno with the opportunity to expand his ambient aesthetic into a visual form, manipulating the medium of video to produce something not present in the normal television experience. His video works were shown around the world in exhibitions in New York and Tokyo, as well as released on the compilation 14 Video Paintings in 2005.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 5.</ref>\n\nEno continued his video experimentation through the 80s, 90s and 2000s, leading to further experimentation with the television as a malleable light source and informing his generative works such as [[77 Million Paintings]] in 2006.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 6\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Generative music===\nEno gives the example of [[wind chime]]s. He says that these systems and the creation of them have been a focus of his since he was a student: \"I got interested in the idea of music that could make itself, in a sense, in the mid 1960s really, when I first heard composers like [[Terry Riley]], and when I first started playing with tape recorders.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/appsblog/2012/sep/26/brian-eno-scape-ipad-apps|title=Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers talk Scape, iPad apps and generative music|first=Stuart|last=Dredge|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=3 May 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\nInitially Eno began to experiment with tape loops to create [[generative music]] systems. With the advent of CDs he developed systems to make music of indeterminate duration using several discs of material that he'd specifically recorded so that they would work together musically when driven by random playback.\n\nIn 1995, he began working with the company Intermorphic to create generative music through utilising programmed algorithms. The collaboration with Intermorphic led Eno to release ''Generative Music 1'' - which requires Intermorphic's ''Koan Player'' software for PC. The Koan software made it possible for generative music to be experienced in the domestic environment for the first time.\n\n====Generative Music 1====\nIn 1996, Eno collaborated in developing the SSEYO [[Koan (program)|Koan]] generative music software system (by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of Intermorphic) that he used in composing ''Generative Music 1''\u2014only playable on the Koan generative music system. Further music releases using Koan software include: ''Wander'' (2001) and ''Dark Symphony'' (2007)\u2014both include works by Eno, and those of other artists (including SSEYO's Tim Cole).\n\n====Released excerpts====\nEno started to release excerpts of results from his 'generative music' systems as early as 1975 with the album ''Discreet Music''. Then again in 1978 with ''Music for Airports'':\n\n{{Quote|text=Music for Airports, at least one of the pieces on there, is structurally very, very simple. There are sung notes, sung by three women and my self. One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long [recorded tape] loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank's studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable \u2013 they are not likely to come back into sync again. So this is the piece moving along in time. Your experience of the piece of course is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements. The basic elements in that particular piece never change. They stay the same. But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety. In fact it's about eight minutes long on that record, but I did have a thirty minute version which I would bore friends who would listen to it. The thing about pieces like this of course is that they are actually of almost infinite length if the numbers involved are complex enough. They simply don't ever re-configure in the same way again. This is music for free in a sense. The considerations that are important, then, become questions of how the system works and most important of all what you feed into the system. |author=Brian Eno |source=Generative Music: A talk delivered in San Francisco, June 8, 1996<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html|title=Generative Music \u2013 Brian Eno \u2013 In Motion Magazine|website=Inmotionmagazine.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe list below consists of albums, soundtracks and downloadable files that contain excerpts from some of Eno's generative music explorations:\n{{div col}}\n\n* 1970 \u2013 Berlin Horse [Film Short]\n* 1975 \u2013 Discreet Music\n* 1975 \u2013 Evening Star (Fripp & Eno)\n* 1978 \u2013 Ambient 1: Music For Airports\n* 1981 \u2013 Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan [Installation Video]\n* 1982 \u2013 Ambient 4: On Land\n* 1983 \u2013 Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1983 \u2013 Music For Films II (Eno, Lanois & R Eno) [exclusive to 'Working Backwards' Box Set]\n* 1984 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon [Installation Video]\n* 1985 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon\n* 1988 \u2013 Music For Films III (Various Artists)\n* 1989 \u2013 Textures (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1989 \u2013 For All Mankind [Documentary Soundtrack]\n* 1992 \u2013 The Shutov Assembly\n* 1993 \u2013 Neroli (Thinking Music Part IV)\n* 1994 \u2013 Glitterbug [Original Soundtrack]\n* 1996 \u2013 Neverwhere [BBC TV Mini-Series Soundtrack]\n* 1997 \u2013 Contra 1.2\n* 1997 \u2013 Lightness\n* 1998 \u2013 Music for Prague\n* 1999 \u2013 I Dormienti\n* 1999 \u2013 Kite Stories\n* 2000 \u2013 Music For Civic Recovery Centre\n* 2001 \u2013 Compact Forest Proposal\n* 2003 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume I\n* 2004 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume II\n* 2012 \u2013 Lux\n* 2013 \u2013 CAM [Web \u2013 the book 'Brian Eno: Visual Music' includes a Download Code]\n* 2014 \u2013 The Shutov Bonus Material ['Shutov Assembly' Bonus CD]\n* 2014 \u2013 New Space Music ['Neroli' Bonus CD]\n* 2016 \u2013 The Ship\n* 2016 \u2013 Reflection\n* 2017 \u2013 Sisters [Web Download]\n* 2018 \u2013 Music for Installations [Box Set]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.enoshop.co.uk/BrianEnoMusicForInstallations | title=Brian Eno Releases 'Music for Installations' on May 4th (2018)|website=Enoshop.co.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\nSeveral of the released excerpts (listed above) originated as, or are derivative of, soundtracks Eno created for art installations.

Ross writes in the programme notes to Matrix 44 in 1981: \"In a series of painterly video installations first shown in 1979, Eno explored the notion of environmental ambiance. Eno proposes a use for music and video that is antithetical to behavior control-oriented \"Muzak\" in that it induces and invites the viewer to enter a meditative, detached state, rather than serve as an operant conditioner for work-force efficiency. His underlying strategy is to create works which provide natural levels of variety and redundancy which bring attention to, rather than mimic, essential characteristics of the natural environment. Eno echoes Matisse's stated desire that his art serve as an armchair for the weary businessman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu/exhibition/44|title=BAMPFA - Art Exhibitions - Brian Eno / MATRIX 44|website=Archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarly installations benefitted from breakthroughs in video technology that inspired Eno to use the TV screen as a monitor and enabled him to experiment with the opposite of the fast-moving narratives typical of TV to create evolving images with an almost imperceptible rate of change. \"2 Fifth Avenue\", (\"a linear four-screen installation with music from Music For Airports\") resulted from Eno shooting \"the view from his apartment window: without&nbsp;... intervention,\" recording \"what was in front of the camera for an unspecified period of time&nbsp;... In a simple but crude form of experimental post production, the colour controls of the monitors on which the work was shown were adjusted to wash out the picture, producing a high-contrast black and white image in which colour appeared only in the darkest areas.&nbsp;... Eno manipulated colour as though painting, observing: 'video for me is a way of configuring light, just as painting is a way of configuring paint.'\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music. Christopher Scoates pp.116\u2013117 {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}</ref>\n\nFrom the outset, Eno's video works, were \"more in the sphere of paintings than of cinema\".<ref name=\"auto1\">My Light Years Brian Eno accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref> The author and artist [[John Coulthart]] called Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan (1980\u201381), which incorporated music from [[Ambient 4: On Land]], \"The first ambient film.\" He explains: \"Eno filmed several static views of New York and its drifting cloudscape from his thirteenth-floor apartment in 1980\u201381. The low-grade equipment&nbsp;... give[s] the images a hazy, impressionistic quality. Lack of a tripod meant filming with the camera lying on its side so the tape had to be re-viewed with a television monitor also turned on its side.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/2013/07/05/mistaken-memories-of-mediaeval-manhattan/|title=Mistaken Memories Of Mediaeval Manhattan|date=5 July 2013|website=Johncoulthart.com|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref> And turning the TV on its side, says David A.

TV was actually the most controllable light source that had ever been invented \u2013 because you could precisely specify the movement and behaviour of several million points of coloured light on a surface. The fact that this prodigious possibility had almost exclusively been used to reproduce figurative images in the service of narratives pointed to evolution of the medium from the theatre and cinema. What I thought was that this machine, which pumped out highly controllable light, was actually the first synthesizer, and that its use as an imager-retailer represented a subset of its possible range.\" <ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P121. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nTurning the TV on its back, Eno played video colour fields of differing lengths of time that would slowly re-combine in different configurations. Placing ziggurats (3 dimensional constructions) of different lengths and sizes on top of the screens that defined each separate colour field, these served to project the internal light source upward. \"The light from it was tangible as though caught in a cloud of vapour. Its slowly changing hues and striking colour collisions were addictive. We sat watching for ages, transfixed by this totally new experience of light as a physical presence.\"<ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P122. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nCalling these light sculptures Crystals (first shown in Boston in 1983), Eno further developed them for the Pictures of Venice exhibition at Gabriella Cardazzo's Cavallino Gallery (Venice,1985). Placing plexiglass on top of the structures he found that these further diffused the light so the shapes outlined through this surface appeared to be described differently in the slowly changing fields of light.<ref>My Light Years Brian Eno np accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nBy positioning sound sources in different places and different heights in the exhibition room Eno intended that the music would be something listened to from the inside rather than the outside. For the [[I Dormienti]] show in 1999 that featured sculptures of sleeping figures by [[Mimmo Paladino]] in the middle of the circular room, Eno placed speakers in each of the 12 tunnels running from it.\n\nEnvisioning the speakers themselves as instruments, led to Eno's 'speaker flowers' becoming a feature of many installations, including at the Museo dell' Ara Pacis (Rome, 2008), again with Mimmo Paladino and 'Speaker Flowers and Lightboxes' at [[Castello Svevo]] in Trani (Italy 2017). Re-imagining the speaker as a flower with a voice that could be heard as it moved in the breeze, he made 'bunches' of them, \"sculptural objects [that]&nbsp;... consist of tiny chassis speakers attached to tall metal stands that sway in response to the sound they emit.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106131601/http://www.jamesputnam.org.uk/httpwww.jamesputnam.org.ukinv_exhibition_26.html] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The first version of these were shown at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]](1984).\n\nSince ''[[On Land]]'' (1982), Eno has sought to blur the boundaries between music and non-music and incorporates environmental sounds into his work. He treats synthesised and recorded sounds for specific effects.<ref>''Brian Eno : Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time'',  Christopher Scoates, pp. 135\ufffd\ufffd-137, {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the antithesis of 20th century [[shock art]], Eno's works create environments that are: \"Envisioned as extensions of everyday life while offering a refuge from its stresses.\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music p.132 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref> Creating a space to reflect was a stated aim in Eno's Quiet Club series of installations that have shown across the world, and include [[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]] at the [[David Toop]] curated Sonic Boom festival at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in 2000.\n\nThe Quiet Club series (1986-2001) grew from Eno's site-specific installations that included the Place series (1985-1989). These also featured light sculptures and audio with the addition of conventional materials, such as \"tree trunks, fish bowls, ladders, rocks\". Eno used these in unconventional ways to create new and unexpected experiences and modes of engagements, offering an extension of and refuge from, everyday life.<ref>Brian Eno: Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time: Christopher Scoates pp132/136 {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nThe continually flowing non-repeating music and art of Eno's installations mitigate against [[habituation]] to the work and maintain the visitors' engagement with it. \"One of the things I enjoy about my shows is...lots of people sitting quietly watching something that has no story, few recognisable images and changes very slowly. It's somewhere between the experience of painting, cinema, music and meditation...I dispute the assumption that everyone's attention span is getting shorter: I find people are begging for experiences that are longer and slower, less \"dramatic\" and more sensual.\" <ref>{Brian Eno Visual Music p.135 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}}</ref> Tanya Zimbardo writing on New Urban Spaces Series 4. \"Compact Forest Proposal\" for SF MOMA (2001) confirms: \"During the first presentation of this work, as part of the exhibition 010101: Art in Technological Times at SFMOMA in 2001, visitors often spent considerable time in this dreamlike space.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/publication/soundtracks/brian-eno/|title=Brian Eno|website=SFMOMA|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Eno's work, both art and music are released from their normal constraints. The music set up to randomly reconfigure is modal and abstract rather than tonal, and so the listener is freed from expectations set up by Western tonal harmonic conventions.<ref>The Dynamics of Harmony: Pratt. {{ISBN|9780198790204}}</ref> The artworks in their continual slowly shifting combinations of colour (and in the case of 77 Million Paintings image re-configurations) themselves offer a continually engaging immersive experience through their unfolding fields of light.\n\n====77 Million Paintings====\nDevelopments in computer technology meant that the experience of Eno's unending non-repeatable generative art and music was no longer only possible in the public spaces of his exhibitions. With software developer and programmer Jake Dowie, Eno created a generative art/music installation '[[77 Million Paintings]]' for the domestic environment. Developed for both PC and Mac, the process is explained by Nick Robertson in the accompanying booklet. \"One way to approach this idea is to imagine that you have a large box full of painted components and you are allowed to blindly take out between one and four of these at any time and overlay them to make a complete painting. The selection of the elements and their duration in the painting is variable and arbitrarily determined\u2026\" <ref name=\"auto2\">Painting By Numbers, Nick Robertson, 77 Million Paintings HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nMost (nearly all) of the visual 'elements' were hand-painted by Eno onto glass slides, creating an organic heart to the work. Some of the slides had formed his earlier 'Natural Selections' exhibition projected onto the windows of the [[Triennale]] in Milan. (1990). This exhibition marked the beginning of Eno's site specific installations that re-defined spaces on a large scale.<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music The Aesthetics of Time. Christopher Scoates. ISBN P. 124</ref>\n\nFor the Triennale exhibition, Eno with Rolf Engel and Roland Blum at Atelier Marktgraph, used new 'dataton' technology that could be programmed to control the fade up and out times of the light sources.<ref>My Light Years by Brian Eno. 77 Million Paintings (accompanying booklet)HNDVD 1521</ref> But, unlike the software developed for '77 Million', this was clumsy and limited the practical realisation of Eno's vision.\n\nWith the computer programmed to randomly select a combination of up to four images of different durations, the on screen painting continually reconfigures as each image slowly dissolves whilst another appears. The painting will be different for every viewer in every situation, uniquely defining each moment. Eno likens his role in creating this piece to one of a gardener planting seeds. And like a gardener he watches to see how they grow, waiting to see if further intervention is necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/brian_eno-composers-as-gardeners|title=Composers as Gardeners|website=Edge.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> In the liner notes Nick Robertson explains: \"Every user will buy exactly the same pack of 'seeds' but they will all grow in different ways and into distinct paintings, the vast majority of which, the artist himself has not even seen. \u2026The original in art is no longer solely bound up in the physical object, but rather in the way the piece lives and grows.\"<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAlthough designed for the domestic environment, 77 million paintings has been (and continues to be) exhibited in multi-screen installations across the world. It has also been projected onto architectural structures, including the sails of the [[Sydney Opera House]] (2009), [[Carioca Aqueduct]] (The Arcos Di Lapa) Brazil (2012) and the giant [[Lovell Telescope]] at the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] (2016). During an exhibition at Fabrica Brighton, (2010) the orthopaedic surgeon Robin Turner noticed the calming effect the work had on the visitors.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Turner asked Eno to provide a version for the Montefiore hospital in Hove.

They display an evolving collage of coloured patterns and shapes whilst Eno's generative ambient music plays discreetly in the background. The other aptly named \"Quiet Room for Montefiore\" (available for patients, visitors and staff) is a space set apart for meditative reflection. It is a moderately sized room with three large panels displaying dissolves of subtle colours in patterns that are reminiscent of Mondrian paintings. The environment brings Eno's ambient music into focus and facilitates the visitors' cognitive drift, freeing them to contemplate or relax.\n\n====Spore====\nEno composed most of the music for the [[Electronic Arts]] video game [[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]] (2008), assisted by his long-term collaborator, the musician and programmer [[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]]. Much of the music is generative and responsive to the player's position within the game.\n\n====iOS apps====\nInspired by possibilities presented to Eno and Peter Chilvers whilst working together on the generative soundtrack for the video game ''Spore'' (2008), the two began to release generative music in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App]] format. They set up the website generativemusic.com and created generative music applications for the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]], and [[iPad]]:\n\n* 2008 \u2013 [[Bloom (software)|''Bloom'']]\n* 2009 \u2013 ''Trope''\n* 2012 \u2013 ''Scape''\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Reflection''\n\nIn 2009, Peter Chilvers and Sandra O'Neill also created an App entitled ''Air'' (released through generativemusic.com as well) \u2013 based on concepts developed by Eno in his ''Ambient 1: Music for Airports'' album.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/10/review-brian-en.html |title=Eno and Chilvers Release Sweet Music App for iPhone &#124, Listening Post |journal=Wired |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Reflection====\nThe generative version of ''Reflection'' is the fourth iOS App created by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers: of generativemusic.com. Unlike other Apps they released ''Reflection'' provides no real options other than Play/Pause \u2013 later, in its initial update, Airplay and Sleep Timer options were added. As Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price. For those who'd bought the app at a higher price, Eno and Chilvers provided links to a free download of a four track album called 'Sisters' (each track with a 15:14 duration). The following appears on the app's Apple iTunes page:\n\n{{Quote|text=As a result of the Brexit-related fall in value of the British pound Apple have increased the prices of all apps sold in the UK by 25%. While we always intended REFLECTION to be a premium priced app, we feel this increase makes it too expensive, so we will take the hit in order to keep the British price to the consumer at its original level.\n\nIn other territories this decision will translate into a reduced price for the app.\n\nAs a thank you to everyone who has supported the REFLECTION app, we are adding a free surprise downloadable gift to it for a limited time. To access it, simply update REFLECTION in the App Store and follow the instructions when you open the app on your device. The download will be available until 28th February [2017].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brianenomusic/posts/1580788841935301|title=Brian Eno|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref> and the App's Apples iTunes page<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brian-eno-reflection/id1180524479?mt=8|title=Brian Eno : Reflection on the App Store|website=App Store|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nPrevious to the updates for the App, the iTunes page used the following from Eno. \n{{Quote|text=Reflection is the most recent of my Ambient experiments and represents the most sophisticated of them so far.\n\nMy original intention with Ambient music was to make endless music, music that would be there as long as you wanted it to be. I wanted also that this music would unfold differently all the time \u2013 'like sitting by a river': it's always the same river, but it's always changing. But recordings \u2013 whether vinyl, cassette or CD \u2013 are limited in length, and replay identically each time you listen to them. So in the past I was limited to making the systems which make the music, but then recording 30 minutes or an hour and releasing that. Reflection in its album form \u2013 on vinyl or CD \u2013 is like this. But the app by which Reflection is produced is not restricted: it creates an endless and endlessly changing version of the piece of music.\n\nThe creation of a piece of music like this falls into three stages: the first is the selection of sonic materials and a musical mode \u2013 a constellation of musical relationships. These are then patterned and explored by a system of algorithms which vary and permutate the initial elements I feed into them, resulting in a constantly morphing stream (or river) of music. The third stage is listening. Once I have the system up and running I spend a long time \u2013 many days and weeks in fact \u2013 seeing what it does and fine-tuning the materials and sets of rules that run the algorithms. It's a lot like gardening: you plant the seeds and then you keep tending to them until you get a garden you like.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brianenomusic/posts/1516385288375657|title=Brian Eno|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe version of ''Reflection'' available on the fixed formats (CD, Vinyl and download File) consists of two (joined) excerpts from the ''Reflection'' app. This was revealed in Brian's interview with Philip Sherburne:\n\n{{Quote|text=[Philip Sherburne] Given the infinite nature of the Reflection project, was it difficult to select the 54-minute chunk that became the album?\n\n[Brian Eno] Yes, it was quite interesting doing that. When you're running it as an ephemeral piece, you have quite different considerations. If there is something that is a bit doubtful or odd, you think, OK, that's just in the nature of the piece and now it's passed and we're somewhere else. Whereas if you're thinking of it as a record that people are going to listen to again and again, what philosophy do you take? Choose just a random amount of time? Could have done that. Just do several of them and fix them together? Is that faking it? These are very interesting philosophical questions.\n\n[Philip Sherburne] Which approach did you follow?\n\n[Brian Eno] A hybrid approach. I generated 11 pieces of the length I'd set the piece to be and I had them all in my iTunes on random shuffle, so I would be listening at night, doing other things, and as one ran through, I would think, That was a nice one, I particularly like the second half. So then I would make a note. I did this for quite a few evenings. There were two that I really liked. On one, the last 40 minutes of it were lovely, and on another, the first 25 minutes of it were really nice. So I thought, This is a studio, I'm making a record. I'll edit them together! It was like the birth of rock'n'roll. I'm allowed to do that! It's not cheating. It was quite a bit of jiggery-pokery to find a place I could do it, but the result is two pieces stuck together. |author=Philip Sherburne / Brian Eno |source=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/10023-a-conversation-with-brian-eno-about-ambient-music/|title=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music \u2013 Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n===Artworks: Light Boxes===\nEno's \"light boxes\" utilise advances in LED technology that has enabled him to re-imagine his ziggurat light paintings - and early light boxes as featured in [[Kite Stories]] (1999) - for the domestic environment. The light boxes feature slowly changing combinations of colour fields that draw attention differently to the shapes outlined by delineating structures within. As the paintings slowly evolve each passing moment is defined differently, drawing the viewer's focus into the present moment. The writer and cultural essayist Michael Bracewell writes that the viewer \"is also encouraged to engage with a generative sensor/aesthetic experience that reflects the ever-changing moods and randomness of life itself\". He likens Eno's art to \"Matisse or Rothko at their most enfolding.\" <ref>Brian Eno - Light Music: Shedding Light. Michael Bracewell.

They remain in permanent display in both private and public spaces. Recognised for their therapeutic contemplative benefits, Eno's 'light paintings' have been commissioned for specially dedicated places of reflection including in Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the Montefiore Hospital in Hove and a three and a half metre lightbox for the sanctuary room in the Macmillan Horizon Centre in Brighton.\n\n===Obscure Records===\nEno started the Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The first group of three releases included his own composition, ''[[Discreet Music]]'', and the now-famous ''The Sinking of the Titanic'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet]]'' (1971) by [[Gavin Bryars]]. The second side of ''Discreet Music'' consisted of several versions of [[Canon in D|Pachelbel's Canon]], the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage and to which he applied various algorithmic transformations, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a [[tape loop]] system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds in some of his collaborations with Fripp, most notably on ''Evening Star''. Ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Michael Nyman]], and [[John Cage]].\n\n===Other work===\n[[File:Nigel_Osborne_&_Brian_Eno_at_Mostar_1994-95.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Professor [[Nigel Osborne]] and Brian Eno leading music workshops, Pavarotti centre, Bosnia 1995.<ref name = \"foodoflove\">Nickalls, Susan.
