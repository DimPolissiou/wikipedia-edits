Young populations are associated with a ratio of dependents to producers: a high proportion of the population under age 16 puts pressure on resources. A 'youth bulge' of those in the 16-30 bracket creates a different set of problems.\n\nA large population of adolescents entering the labor force and electorate strains at the seams of the economy and polity, which were designed for smaller populations. This creates unemployment and alienation unless new opportunities are created quickly enough - in which case a 'demographic dividend' accrues because productive workers outweigh young and elderly dependents. Yet the 16-30 age range is associated with risk-taking, especially among males.\n\nIn general, youth bulges in developing countries are associated with higher unemployment and, as a result, a heightened risk of violence and political instability.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Huntington | first1 = Samuel P | year = 1996 | title = The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. | url = https://archive.org/details/clashofciviliza00hunt | url-access = registration | location = New York, NY|publisher= Simon and Schuster }}; {{cite journal | authorlink=Henrik Urdal |last1=Urdal|first1= Henrik|year= 2006| title = A Clash of Generations?

Young populations are associated with a ratio of dependents to producers: a high proportion of the population under age 16 puts pressure on resources. A 'youth bulge' of those in the 16-30 bracket creates a different set of problems.\n\nA large population of adolescents entering the labor force and electorate strains at the seams of the economy and polity, which were designed for smaller populations. This creates unemployment and alienation unless new opportunities are created quickly enough - in which case a 'demographic dividend' accrues because productive workers outweigh young and elderly dependents. Yet the 16-30 age range is associated with risk-taking, especially among males.\n\nIn general, youth bulges in developing countries are associated with higher unemployment and, as a result, a heightened risk of violence and political instability.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Huntington | first1 = Samuel P | year = 1996 | title = The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. | url = https://archive.org/details/clashofciviliza00hunt | url-access = registration | location = New York, NY|publisher= Simon and Schuster }}; {{cite journal | authorlink=Henrik Urdal |last1=Urdal|first1= Henrik|year= 2006| title = A Clash of Generations?

In recent times prison reform ideas include greater access to [[legal counsel]] and [[family]], [[conjugal visits]], proactive security against violence, and implementing [[house arrest]] with assistive technology.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Prison populations.png|thumb|right|Prison populations of various countries in 2008]]\nPrisons have only been used as the primary punishment for criminal acts in the last few centuries. Far more common earlier were various types of [[corporal punishment]], [[public humiliation]], [[Unfree labour|penal bondage]], and [[banishment]] for more severe offenses, as well as [[capital punishment]].\n\nThe concept of incarceration was presented circa 1750 as a more humane form of punishment than the aforementioned corporal and capital punishment. They originally was designed as a way for criminals to participate in religious self-reflection and self-reform as a form of penance, hence the term penitentiary.<ref>Davis, Angela Y. \"Imprisonment and Reform\" ''Dimensions of Culture 2: Justice'', edited by Dr. Amanda Solomon, Dr. Megan Strom, and Dr. Emily Johnson, Cognella, 2019, pp. 95-102.</ref>\n\nPrisons contained both felons and debtors \u2013 the latter of which were allowed to bring in wives and children. The jailer made his money by charging the inmates for food and drink and legal services and the whole system was rife with corruption.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} One reform of the sixteenth century had been the establishment of the ''London [[Bridewell]]'' as a [[house of correction]] for women and children. This was the only place any medical services were provided.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====18th century====\nDuring the eighteenth century, British justice used a wide variety of measures to punish crime, including fines, the pillory and whipping. Transportation to The United States of America was often offered, until 1776, as an alternative to the death penalty, which could be imposed for many offenses including pilfering. When they ran out of prisons in 1776 they used old sailing vessels which came to be called ''hulks'' as places of temporary confinement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe most notable reformer was [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] who, having visited several hundred prisons across England and Europe, beginning when he was high sheriff of Bedfordshire, published ''The State of the Prisons'' in 1777.<ref>\n{{citation |title=The State of the Prisons in England and Wales with an account of some foreign prisons|author=John Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EhNAAAAYAAJ|year=1777}}\n</ref> He was particularly appalled to discover prisoners who had been acquitted but were still confined because they couldn't pay the jailer's fees. He proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell with separate sections for women felons, men felons, young offenders and debtors. The prison reform charity, the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]], takes its name from John Howard.\n\nThe [[Penitentiary Act]] which passed in 1779 following his agitation introduced solitary confinement, religious instruction and a labor regime and proposed two state penitentiaries, one for men and one for women. These were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France and jails remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed in the next few years provided magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms and eventually in 1815 jail fees were abolished.\n\nQuakers such as [[Elizabeth Fry]] continued to publicize the dire state of prisons as did [[Charles Dickens]] in his novels ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' and ''[[Little Dorrit (novel)|Little Dorrit]]'' about the [[Marshalsea]]. [[Samuel Romilly]] managed to repeal the death penalty for theft in 1806, but repealing it for other similar offences brought in a political element that had previously been absent. The Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, founded in 1816, supported both the [[Panopticon]] for the design of prisons and the use of the [[treadwheel]] as a means of hard labor. By 1824, 54 prisons had adopted this means of discipline.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=97}}</ref> Robert Peel's [[Gaols Act 1823|Gaols Act]] of 1823 attempted to impose uniformity in the country but local prisons remained under the control of magistrates until the Prison Act of 1877.\n\n====19th century====\nThe American [[separate system]] attracted the attention of some reformers and led to the creation of [[Millbank Prison]] in 1816 and [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville prison]] in 1842. By now the end of transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was in sight and [[Joshua Jebb]] set an ambitious program of prison building with one large prison opening per year. The main principles were separation and hard labour for serious crimes, using treadwheels and cranks. However, by the 1860s public opinion was calling for harsher measures in reaction to an increase in crime which was perceived to come from the 'flood of criminals' released under the penal servitude system. The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel [[Edmund Frederick du Cane]], was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of 'hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed'.<ref>{{harvnb|Fox|1952|p=46}}</ref> In 1877 he encouraged [[Disraeli]]'s government to remove all prisons from local government and held a fi rm grip on the prison system till his forced retirement in 1895. He also established a tradition of secrecy which lasted till the 1970s so that even magistrates and investigators were unable to see the insides of prisons.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=153}}</ref> By the 1890s the prison population was over 20,000.\n\n====1877-1914 ====\nThe British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison livelihoods. The reforms were controversial and contested. In 1877-1914 era a series of major  legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system. In 1877, the previously localized prisons were nationalized in the Home Office under a Prison Commission. The Prison Act of 1898 enabled the Home Secretary to and multiple reforms on his own initiative, without going through the politicized process of Parliament. The Probation of Offenders Act of 1907 introduced a new  probation system that drastically cut down the prison population, while providing a mechanism for transition back to normal life. The Criminal Justice Administration Act of 1914 required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines. Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced  solely  for that reason. The Borstal system after 1908 was organized to reclaim young offenders, and the Children Act of 1908 prohibited imprisonment under age 14, and strictly limited that of ages 14 to 16. The principal reformer was Sir [[Evelyn Ruggles-Brise]]. the chair of the Prison Commission.<ref>R.C.K. Ensor. \u2018\u2019 England 1870-1914\u2019\u2019 (1937) pp 520-21.</ref><ref>J.W.

He took the view that central government should break the cycle of offending and imprisonment by establishing a new type of reformatory, that was called ''[[Borstal]]'' after the village in [[Kent]] which housed the first one. The movement reached its peak after the first world war when [[Alexander Paterson (penologist)|Alexander Paterson]] became commissioner, delegating authority and encouraging personal responsibility in the fashion of the [[Public school (UK)|English Public school]]: cellblocks were designated as 'houses' by name and had a ''[[housemaster]]''. Cross-country walks were encouraged, and no one ran away. Prison populations remained at a low level until after the second world war when Paterson died and the movement was unable to update itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=157\u2013161}}</ref>  Some aspects of Borstal found their way into the main prison system, including [[open prison]]s and housemasters, renamed ''assistant governors'' and many Borstal-trained prison officers used their experience in the wider service. But in general the prison system in the twentieth century remained in Victorian buildings which steadily became more and more overcrowded with inevitable results.\n\n===United States===\nIn colonial America, punishments were severe. The Massachusetts assembly in 1736 ordered that a thief, on first conviction, be fined or whipped. The second time he was to pay [[treble damages]], sit for an hour upon the gallows platform with a noose around his neck and then be carted to the whipping post for thirty stripes. For the third offense he was to be hanged.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=113}}</ref> But the implementation was haphazard as there was no effective police system and judges wouldn't convict if they believed the punishment was excessive. The local jails mainly held men awaiting trial or punishment and those in debt.\n\nIn the aftermath of independence most states amended their criminal punishment statutes. Pennsylvania eliminated the death penalty for robbery and burglary in 1786, and in 1794 retained it only for first degree murder. Other states followed and in all cases the answer to what alternative penalties should be imposed was incarceration. Pennsylvania turned its old jail at Walnut Street into a state prison. New York built Newgate state prison in Greenwich Village and other states followed. But by 1820 faith in the efficacy of legal reform had declined as statutory changes had no discernible effect on the level of crime and the prisons, where prisoners shared large rooms and booty including alcohol, had become riotous and prone to escapes.\n\nIn response, New York developed the [[Auburn system]] in which prisoners were confined in separate cells and prohibited from talking when eating and working together, implementing it at [[Auburn State Prison]] and [[Sing Sing]] at [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]]. The aim of this was [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]]: the reformers talked about the penitentiary serving as a model for the family and the school and almost all the states adopted the plan (though Pennsylvania went even further in separating prisoners). The system's fame spread and visitors to the U.S. to see the prisons included [[de Tocqueville]] who wrote [[Democracy in America]] as a result of his visit.\n\nHowever, by the 1860s, overcrowding became the rule of the day, partly because of the long sentences given for violent crimes, despite increasing severity inside the prison and often cruel methods of gagging and restraining prisoners. An increasing proportion of prisoners were new immigrants. As a result of a tour of prisons in 18 states, [[Enoch Wines]] and [[Theodore William Dwight|Theodore Dwight]] produced a monumental report describing the flaws in the existing system and proposing remedies.<ref>\n{{citation |title=Report on the Prisons and Reformatories of the United States and Canada|author1=Enoch Wines|author2=Theodore Dwight|year=1867|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-mgzeGoepoC}}\n</ref> Their critical finding was that not one of the state prisons in the United States was seeking the reformation of its inmates as a primary goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=172}}</ref> They set out an agenda for reform which was endorsed by a ''National Congress'' in [[Cincinnati]] in 1870. These ideas were put into practice in the [[Elmira Reformatory]] in New York in 1876 run by [[Zebulon Brockway]]. At the core of the design was an educational program which included general subjects and vocational training for the less capable. Instead of fixed sentences, prisoners who did well could be released early.\n\nBut by the 1890s, Elmira had twice as many inmates as it was designed for and they were not only the first offenders between 16 and 31 for which the program was intended. Although it had a number of imitators in different states, it did little to halt the deterioration of the country's prisons which carried on a dreary life of their own. In the southern states, in which blacks made up more than 75% of the inmates, there was ruthless exploitation in which the states leased prisoners as chain gangs to entrepreneurs who treated them worse than slaves. By the 1920s drug use in prisons was also becoming a problem.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, psychiatric interpretations of social deviance were gaining a central role in criminology and policy making. By 1926, 67 prisons employed psychiatrists and 45 had psychologists. The language of medicine was applied in an attempt to \"cure\" offenders of their criminality. In fact, little was known about the causes of their behaviour and prescriptions were not much different from the earlier reform methods.<ref name=\"morris178\">{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=178}}</ref> A system of probation was introduced, but often used simply as an alternative to suspended sentences, and the probation officers appointed had little training, and their caseloads numbered several hundred making assistance or surveillance practically impossible. At the same time they could revoke the probation status without going through another trial or other proper process.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=182}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, [[Thomas Mott Osborne]] became chairman of a commission for the reform of the New York prison system and introduced a ''[[Mutual Welfare League]]'' at Auburn with a committee of 49 prisoners appointed by secret ballot from the 1400 inmates. He also removed the striped dress uniform at Sing Sing and introduced recreation and movies. Progressive reform resulted in the \"Big House\" by the late twenties \u2013 prisons averaging 2,500 men with professional management designed to eliminate the abusive forms of corporal punishment and prison labor prevailing at the time.\n\nThe American prison system was shaken by a series of riots in the early 1950s triggered by deficiencies of prison facilities, lack of hygiene or medical care, poor food quality, and guard brutality. In the next decade all these demands were recognized as rights by the courts.<ref name=\"morris178\"/> In 1954, the ''American Prison Association'' changed its name to the ''[[American Correctional Association]]'' and the rehabilitative emphasis was formalized in the 1955 [[United Nations]] [[Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]].\n\nSince the 1960s the prison population in the US has risen steadily, even during periods where the crime rate has fallen. This is partly due to profound changes in sentencing practices due to a denunciation of lenient policies in the late sixties and early seventies and assertions that rehabilitative purposes do not work. As a consequence sentencing commissions started to establish minimum as well as maximum [[sentencing guidelines]], which have reduced the discretion of parole authorities and also reduced parole supervision of released prisoners.  Another factor that contributed to the increase of incarcerations was the Reagan administration's \"War On Drugs\" in the 1980s. This War increased money spent on lowering the number of illegal drugs in the United States. As a result, drug arrests increased and prisons became increasingly more crowded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/war-on-drugs-prisons-infographic_n_4914884.html|title=Just How Much The War On Drugs Impacts Our Overcrowded Prisons, In One Chart|first=Kathleen|last=Miles|date=10 March 2014|via=Huff Post}}</ref> The rising rising prison population was made up disproportionately of African American with 90% of those sentenced to prison for drug offense in Illinois in 2002.<ref>Alexander, Michelle. \"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness.\" ''Dimensions of Culture 2: Justice, Edited by Dr. Amanda Solomon, Dr. Megan Strom, and Dr. Emily Johnston, Cognella, 2019, pp. 89-94.''</ref> By 2010, the United States had more prisoners than any other country and a greater percentage of its population was in prison than in any other country in the world. \"Mass incarceration\" became a serious social and economic problem, as each of the 2.3 million American prisoners costs an average of about $25,000 per year. Recidivism remained high, and useful programs were often cut during the recession of 2009\u20132010. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Plata]]'' upheld the release of thousands of California prisoners due to California's inability to provide constitutionally mandated levels of healthcare.\n\nIn 2015 a bipartisan effort was launched by [[Koch family foundations]], the [[ACLU]], the [[Center for American Progress]], [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]], the [[Coalition for Public Safety]], and the [[John D. and Catherine T.

The more modern use grew from the prison [[workhouse]] (known as the [[Rasphuis]]) from 1600 in Holland. The house was normally managed by a married couple, the 'father' and 'mother', usually with a work master and discipline master. The inmates, or [[journeymen]], often spent their time on spinning, weaving and fabricating cloths and their output was measured and those who exceeded the minimum received a small sum of money with which they could buy extras from the indoor father.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=68\u201372}}</ref>\n\nAn exception to the rule of forced labor were those inmates whose families could not look after them and paid for them to be in the workhouse. From the later 17th century private institutions for the insane, called the ''beterhuis'', developed to meet this need.\n\nIn Hamburg a different pattern occurred with the ''spinhaus'' in 1669, to which only infamous criminals were admitted. This was paid by the public treasury and the pattern spread in eighteenth-century Germany. In France the use of [[galley slave|galley servitude]] was most common until galleys were abolished in 1748. After this the condemned were put to work in naval [[arsenal]]s doing heavy work. Confinement originated from the ''h\u00f4pitaux g\u00e9n\u00e9raux'' which were mostly asylums, though in Paris they included many convicts, and persisted up till the [[French revolution|revolution]].\n\nThe use of capital punishment and [[judicial torture]] declined during the eighteenth century and imprisonment came to dominate the system, although reform movements started almost immediately. Many countries were committed to the goal as a financially self-sustaining institution and the organization was often subcontracted to entrepreneurs, though this created its own tensions and abuse. By the mid nineteenth century several countries initiated experiments in allowing the prisoners to choose the trades in which they were to be apprenticed. The growing amount of [[recidivism]] in the latter half of the nineteenth century led a number of [[criminologist]]s to argue that \"imprisonment did not, and could not fulfill its original ideal of treatment aimed at reintegrating the offender into the community\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=210}}</ref> Belgium led the way in introducing the [[suspended sentence]] for first-time offenders in 1888, followed by France in 1891 and most other countries in the next few years. [[Parole]] had been introduced on an experimental basis in France in the 1830s, with laws for juveniles introduced in 1850, and Portugal began to use it for adult criminals from 1861. The parole system introduced in France in 1885 made use of a strong private patronage network. Parole was approved throughout Europe at the [[International Prison Congress]] of 1910. As a result of these reforms the prison populations of many European countries halved in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nExceptions to this trend included France and Italy between the world wars, when there was a huge increase in the use of imprisonment. The National Socialist state in Germany used it as an important tool to rid itself of its enemies as crime rates rocketed as a consequence of new categories of criminal behavior. Russia, which had only started to reform its penal and judicial system in 1860 by abolishing corporal punishment, continued the use of exile with hard labor as a punishment and this was increased to a new level of brutality under [[Joseph Stalin]], despite early reforms by the [[Bolsheviks]].\n\nPostwar reforms stressed the need for the state to tailor punishment to the individual convicted criminal. In 1965, Sweden enacted a new criminal code emphasizing non-institutional alternatives to punishment including conditional sentences, [[probation]] for first-time offenders and the more extensive use of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]]. The use of probation caused a dramatic decline in the number women serving long-term sentences: in France the number fell from 5,231 in 1946 to 1,121 in 1980. Probation spread to most European countries though the level of surveillance varies. In the Netherlands, religious and philanthropic groups are responsible for much of the probationary care. The Dutch government invests heavily in correctional personnel, having 3,100 for 4,500 prisoners in 1959.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=218\u2013222}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite these reforms, numbers in prison started to grow again after the 1960s even in countries committed to non-custodial policies.\n\n==Theories of Incarceration and Reform==\n\n===Retribution, vengeance and retaliation===\nThis is founded on the \"[[eye for an eye]], tooth for a tooth\" incarceration philosophy, which essentially states that if one person harms another, then equivalent harm should be done to them. One goal here is to prevent [[vigilantism]], gang or clan warfare, and other actions by those who have an unsatisfied need to \"get even\" for a crime against them, their family, or their group. It is, however, difficult to determine how to equate different types of \"harm\". A literal case is where a murderer is punished with the death penalty, the argument being \"justice demands a life for a life\". One criticism of long term prison sentences and other methods for achieving justice is that such \"warehousing\" of criminals is rather expensive, this argument notwithstanding the fact that the multiple incarceration appeals of a death penalty case often exceed the price of the \"warehousing\" of the criminal in question.\nYet another facet of this debate disregards the financial cost for the most part. The argument regarding warehousing rests, in this case, upon the theory that any punishment considered respectful of human rights should not include imprisoning humans for life without a chance of release\u2014that even death is morally and ethically a higher road than no-parole prison sentences.\n\n===Deterrence===\nThe criminal is used as a \"threat to themselves and others\". By subjecting prisoners to harsh conditions, authorities hope to convince them to avoid future criminal behavior and to exemplify for others the rewards for avoiding such behavior; that is, the fear of punishment will win over whatever benefit or pleasure the illegal activity might bring. The deterrence model frequently goes far beyond \"an eye for an eye\", exacting a more severe punishment than would seem to be indicated by the crime. [[Torture]] has been used in the past as a deterrent, as has the public embarrassment and discomfort of [[stocks]], and, in religious communities, [[ex-communication]]. [[Execution (legal)|Executions]], particularly gruesome ones (such as hanging or beheading), often for petty offenses, are further examples of attempts at deterrence. One criticism of the deterrence model is that criminals typically have a rather short-term orientation, and the possibility of long-term consequences is of little importance to them. Also, their quality of life may be so horrific that any treatment within the criminal justice system (which is compatible with human rights law) will only be seen as an improvement over their previous situation. There used to be many European Monks who disagreed with the containment of the mentally ill, and their ethics had a strong influence on Dorothea Dix's mission to find a proper way to care for the challenged people.\n\n===Rehabilitation, reform and correction===\n(\"Reform\" here refers to reform of the individual, not the reform of the penal system.) The goal is to \"repair\" the deficiencies in the individual and return them as productive members of society. Education, work skills, [[deferred gratification]], treating others with respect, and self-discipline are stressed. Younger criminals who have committed fewer and less severe crimes are most likely to be successfully reformed. \"Reform schools\" and \"boot camps\" are set up according to this model. One criticism of this model is that criminals are rewarded with training and other items which would not have been available to them had they not committed a crime. <!--(this statement could be worded better-->\n\nPrior to its closing in late 1969, Eastern State Penitentiary, then known as State Correctional Institution, Philadelphia, had established a far reaching program of voluntary group therapy with the goal of having all inmates in the prison involved. From 1967 when the plan was initiated, the program appears to have been successful as many inmates did volunteer for group therapy. An interesting aspect was that the groups were to be led by two therapists, one from the psychology or social work department and a second from one of the officers among the prison guard staff.<ref>{{cite book |last = Bernard| first = Mazie| title = Prison Manifesto: Recollections of a Queer Psychologist Working in a Maximum Security Prison | publisher = Bernard Mazie | year = 2005| isbn =978-0-9769715-0-4}}</ref>\n\n===Removal from society===\nThe goal here is simply to keep criminals away from potential victims, thus reducing the number of crimes they can commit. The criticism{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} of this model is that others increase the number and severity of crimes they commit to make up for the \"vacuum\" left by the removed criminal. For example, incarcerating a [[drug dealer]] will result in an unmet demand for drugs at that locale, and an existing or new drug dealer will then appear, to fill the void. This new drug dealer may have been innocent of any crimes before this opportunity, or may have been guilty of less serious crimes, such as being a look-out for the previous drug dealer.\n\n===Restitution or repayment===\nPrisoners are forced to repay their \"debt\" to society. Unpaid or low pay work is common in many prisons, often to the benefit of the community. In some countries prisons operate as labour camps. Critics say that the repayment model gives government an economic incentive to send more people to prison. In corrupt or authoritarian regimes, such as the former Soviet Union under the control of Joseph Stalin, many citizens are sentenced to forced labour for minor breaches of the law, simply because the government requires the labour camps as a source of income. [[Community service]] is increasingly being used as an alternative to prison for petty criminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/a/anderson-justice.html |title=New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref>\n\n===Reduction in immediate costs===\nGovernment and prison officials also have the goal of minimizing short-term costs.\n\n:'''In wealthy societies:'''\n:This calls for keeping prisoners placated by providing them with things like television and conjugal visits. Inexpensive measures like these prevent prison assaults and riots which in turn allow the number of guards to be minimized. Providing the quickest possible parole and/or release also reduces immediate costs to the prison system (although these may very well increase long term costs to the prison system and society due to [[recidivism]]). The ultimate way to reduce immediate costs is to eliminate prisons entirely and use fines, community service, and other sanctions (like the loss of a driver's license or the right to vote) instead. Executions at first would appear to limit costs, but, in most wealthy societies, the long appeals process for death sentences (and associated legal costs) make them quite expensive. Note that this goal may conflict with a number of goals for criminal justice systems.\n\n:'''In poor societies:'''\n\n:Poor societies, which lack the resources to imprison criminals for years, frequently use execution in place of imprisonment, for severe crimes. Less severe crimes, such as theft, might be dealt with by less severe physical means, such as amputation of the hands. When long term imprisonment is used in such societies, it may be a virtual death sentence, as the lack of food, sanitation, and medical care causes widespread disease and death, in such prisons.\n\nSome of the goals of criminal justice are compatible with one another, while others are in conflict. In the history of prison reform, the harsh treatment, torture, and executions used for deterrence first came under fire as a violation of [[human rights]]. The salvation goal, and methods, were later attacked as violations of the individual's [[freedom of religion]]. This led to further reforms aimed principally at reform/correction of the individual, removal from society, and reduction of immediate costs. The perception that such reforms sometimes denied victims justice then led to further changes.\n\n==Advocacy Work==\n[[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] is now widely regarded as the founding father of prison reform, having travelled extensively visiting prisons across [[Europe]] in the 1770s and 1780s. Also, the great social reformer [[Jonas Hanway]] promoted \"''solitude in imprisonment'', with proper profitable labor and a spare diet\".<ref>Hanway, Jonas (1776) [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC38681714&id=8VNtvyCNiRYC&pg=PA4&dq=%22jonas+Hanway%22 Solitude in Imprisonment: With Proper Profitable Labour and a Spare Diet, the Most Humane and...] J.

Elizabeth Fry visited prisons and suggested basic human rights for prisoners, such as [[privacy]] and teaching prisoners a trade. Fry was particularly concerned with [[women's rights]]. Parliament, coming to realize that a significant portion of prisoners had come to commit crimes as a result of mental illness, passed the [[County Asylums Act 1808|County Asylums Act (1808)]]. This made it possible for [[Justice of the Peace]] in each county to build and run their own pauper asylums.\n\n''\"Whereas the practice of confining such lunatics and other insane persons as are chargeable to their respective parishes in Gaols, Houses of Correction, Poor Houses and Houses of Industry, is highly dangerous and inconvenient\"''<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Roberts, Andrew \n |title=''Table of Statutes'' \n |work=The asylums index \n |publisher=Middlesex University, London, England \n |year=1981 \n |url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/Law.htm#48Geo3c96 \n |accessdate=2006-09-26 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904062428/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/Law.htm \n |archivedate=2006-09-04 \n |url-status=dead \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThere is contemporary research on the use of volunteers by governments to help ensure the fair and humane detention of prisoners.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Roffee|first=James A.|date=2017-01-01|title=Accountability and Oversight of State Functions: Use of Volunteers to Monitor Equality and Diversity in Prisons in England and Wales|journal=SAGE Open|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2158244017690792|doi=10.1177/2158244017690792|issn=2158-2440}}</ref> Research suggests that volunteers can be effective to ensure oversight of state functions and ensure accountability, however, they must be given tasks appropriately and well trained.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===United States===\n{{see also|History of United States prison systems}}\n[[File:Johnny Cash-Nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Johnny Cash]] advocated prison reform at his July 1972 meeting with United States President [[Richard Nixon]].]]\nIn the 1800s, [[Dorothea Dix]] toured prisons in the U.S. and all over Europe looking at the conditions of the mentally handicapped. Her ideas led to a mushroom effect of asylums all over the United States in the mid-19th-century. [[Linda Gilbert]] established 22 prison libraries of from 1,500 to 2,000 volumes each, in six states.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn the early 1900s [[Samuel June Barrows]] was a leader in prison reform. President Cleveland appointed him International Prison Commissioner for the U.S. in 1895, and in 1900 Barrows became Secretary of the Prison Association of New York and held that position until his death on April 21, 1909. A Unitarian pastor, Barrows used his influence as editor of the Unitarian ''[[Christian Register]]'' to speak at meetings of the National Conference of Charities and Correction, the National International Prison Congresses, and the Society for International Law. As the International Prison Commissioner for the U.S., he wrote several of today's most valuable documents of American penological literature, including \"Children's Courts in the United States\" and \"The Criminal Insane in the United States and in Foreign Countries\". As a House representative, Barrows was pivotal in the creation of the International Prison Congress and became its president in 1905. In his final role, as Secretary of the Prison Association of New York, he dissolved the association's debt, began issuing annual reports, drafted and ensured passage of New York's first probation law, assisted in the implementation of a federal Parole Law, and promoted civil service for prison employees. Moreover, Barrows advocated improved prison structures and methods, traveling in 1907 around the world to bring back detailed plans of 36 of the best prisons in 14 different countries. In 1910 the National League of Volunteer Workers, nicknamed the \"Barrows League\" in his memory, formed in New York as a group dedicated to helping released prisoners and petitioning for better prison conditions.\n\n[[Zebulon Brockway]] in ''Fifty Years of Prison Service'' outlined an ideal prison system: Prisoners should support themselves in prison though industry, in anticipation of supporting themselves outside prison; outside businesses and labor must not interfere; indeterminate sentences were required, making prisoners earn their release with constructive behavior, not just the passage of time; and education and a Christian culture should be imparted. Nevertheless, opposition to prison industries, the [[Prison\u2013industrial complex|prison-industrial complex]], and labor increased. Finally, U.S. law prohibited the transport of prison-made goods across state lines. Most prison-made goods today are only for government use\u2014but the state and federal governments are not required to meet their needs from prison industries. Although nearly every prison reformer in history believed prisoners should work usefully, and several prisons in the 1800s were profitable and self-supporting, most American prisoners today do not have productive jobs in prison.<ref>''[http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2008/one20in20100pdf.pdf One in 100: Behind Bars in America]'', 2008, [[Pew Center]]'s Public Safety Performance Project @ pewcenteronthestates; Stephen Garvey, \"Freeing Prisoners' Labor,\" 50 ''[[Stanford Law Review]]'' 339, 343 (1\u20131998); John Dewar Gleissner, ''Prison & Slavery \u2013 A Surprising Comparison'', Outskirts Press, 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Kim Kardashian|Kim Kardashian-West]] has fought for prison reform, notably visiting the White House to visit President Donald Trump in on May 30, 2018.

Far more common earlier were various types of [[corporal punishment]], [[public humiliation]], [[Unfree labour|penal bondage]], and [[banishment]] for more severe offenses, as well as [[capital punishment]].\n\nThe concept of incarceration was presented circa 1750 as a more humane form of punishment than the aforementioned corporal and capital punishment. They originally was designed as a way for criminals to participate in religious self-reflection and self-reform as a form of penance, hence the term penitentiary.<ref>Davis, Angela Y. \"Imprisonment and Reform\" ''Dimensions of Culture 2: Justice'', edited by Dr. Amanda Solomon, Dr. Megan Strom, and Dr. Emily Johnson, Cognella, 2019, pp. 95-102.</ref>\n\nPrisons contained both felons and debtors \u2013 the latter of which were allowed to bring in wives and children. The jailer made his money by charging the inmates for food and drink and legal services and the whole system was rife with corruption.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} One reform of the sixteenth century had been the establishment of the ''London [[Bridewell]]'' as a [[house of correction]] for women and children. This was the only place any medical services were provided.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====18th century====\nDuring the eighteenth century, British justice used a wide variety of measures to punish crime, including fines, the pillory and whipping. Transportation to The United States of America was often offered, until 1776, as an alternative to the death penalty, which could be imposed for many offenses including pilfering. When they ran out of prisons in 1776 they used old sailing vessels which came to be called ''hulks'' as places of temporary confinement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe most notable reformer was [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] who, having visited several hundred prisons across England and Europe, beginning when he was high sheriff of Bedfordshire, published ''The State of the Prisons'' in 1777.<ref>\n{{citation |title=The State of the Prisons in England and Wales with an account of some foreign prisons|author=John Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EhNAAAAYAAJ|year=1777}}\n</ref> He was particularly appalled to discover prisoners who had been acquitted but were still confined because they couldn't pay the jailer's fees. He proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell with separate sections for women felons, men felons, young offenders and debtors. The prison reform charity, the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]], takes its name from John Howard.\n\nThe [[Penitentiary Act]] which passed in 1779 following his agitation introduced solitary confinement, religious instruction and a labor regime and proposed two state penitentiaries, one for men and one for women. These were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France and jails remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed in the next few years provided magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms and eventually in 1815 jail fees were abolished.\n\nQuakers such as [[Elizabeth Fry]] continued to publicize the dire state of prisons as did [[Charles Dickens]] in his novels ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' and ''[[Little Dorrit (novel)|Little Dorrit]]'' about the [[Marshalsea]]. [[Samuel Romilly]] managed to repeal the death penalty for theft in 1806, but repealing it for other similar offences brought in a political element that had previously been absent. The Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, founded in 1816, supported both the [[Panopticon]] for the design of prisons and the use of the [[treadwheel]] as a means of hard labor. By 1824, 54 prisons had adopted this means of discipline.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=97}}</ref> Robert Peel's [[Gaols Act 1823|Gaols Act]] of 1823 attempted to impose uniformity in the country but local prisons remained under the control of magistrates until the Prison Act of 1877.\n\n====19th century====\nThe American [[separate system]] attracted the attention of some reformers and led to the creation of [[Millbank Prison]] in 1816 and [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville prison]] in 1842. By now the end of transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was in sight and [[Joshua Jebb]] set an ambitious program of prison building with one large prison opening per year. The main principles were separation and hard labour for serious crimes, using treadwheels and cranks. However, by the 1860s public opinion was calling for harsher measures in reaction to an increase in crime which was perceived to come from the 'flood of criminals' released under the penal servitude system. The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel [[Edmund Frederick du Cane]], was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of 'hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed'.<ref>{{harvnb|Fox|1952|p=46}}</ref> In 1877 he encouraged [[Disraeli]]'s government to remove all prisons from local government and held a firm grip on the prison system till his forced retirement in 1895. He also established a tradition of secrecy which lasted till the 1970s so that even magistrates and investigators were unable to see the insides of prisons.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=153}}</ref> By the 1890s the prison population was over 20,000.\n\n====1877-1914 ====\nThe British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison livelihoods. The reforms were controversial and contested. In 1877-1914 era a series of major  legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system. In 1877, the previously localized prisons were nationalized in the Home Office under a Prison Commission. The Prison Act of 1898 enabled the Home Secretary to and multiple reforms on his own initiative, without going through the politicized process of Parliament. The Probation of Offenders Act of 1907 introduced a new  probation system that drastically cut down the prison population, while providing a mechanism for transition back to normal life. The Criminal Justice Administration Act of 1914 required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines. Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced  solely  for that reason. The Borstal system after 1908 was organized to reclaim young offenders, and the Children Act of 1908 prohibited imprisonment under age 14, and strictly limited that of ages 14 to 16. The principal reformer was Sir [[Evelyn Ruggles-Brise]]. the chair of the Prison Commission.<ref>R.C.K. Ensor. \u2018\u2019 England 1870-1914\u2019\u2019 (1937) pp 520-21.</ref><ref>J.W.

He took the view that central government should break the cycle of offending and imprisonment by establishing a new type of reformatory, that was called ''[[Borstal]]'' after the village in [[Kent]] which housed the first one. The movement reached its peak after the first world war when [[Alexander Paterson (penologist)|Alexander Paterson]] became commissioner, delegating authority and encouraging personal responsibility in the fashion of the [[Public school (UK)|English Public school]]: cellblocks were designated as 'houses' by name and had a ''[[housemaster]]''. Cross-country walks were encouraged, and no one ran away. Prison populations remained at a low level until after the second world war when Paterson died and the movement was unable to update itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=157\u2013161}}</ref>  Some aspects of Borstal found their way into the main prison system, including [[open prison]]s and housemasters, renamed ''assistant governors'' and many Borstal-trained prison officers used their experience in the wider service. But in general the prison system in the twentieth century remained in Victorian buildings which steadily became more and more overcrowded with inevitable results.\n\n===United States===\nIn colonial America, punishments were severe. The Massachusetts assembly in 1736 ordered that a thief, on first conviction, be fined or whipped. The second time he was to pay [[treble damages]], sit for an hour upon the gallows platform with a noose around his neck and then be carted to the whipping post for thirty stripes. For the third offense he was to be hanged.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=113}}</ref> But the implementation was haphazard as there was no effective police system and judges wouldn't convict if they believed the punishment was excessive. The local jails mainly held men awaiting trial or punishment and those in debt.\n\nIn the aftermath of independence most states amended their criminal punishment statutes. Pennsylvania eliminated the death penalty for robbery and burglary in 1786, and in 1794 retained it only for first degree murder. Other states followed and in all cases the answer to what alternative penalties should be imposed was incarceration. Pennsylvania turned its old jail at Walnut Street into a state prison. New York built Newgate state prison in Greenwich Village and other states followed. But by 1820 faith in the efficacy of legal reform had declined as statutory changes had no discernible effect on the level of crime and the prisons, where prisoners shared large rooms and booty including alcohol, had become riotous and prone to escapes.\n\nIn response, New York developed the [[Auburn system]] in which prisoners were confined in separate cells and prohibited from talking when eating and working together, implementing it at [[Auburn State Prison]] and [[Sing Sing]] at [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]]. The aim of this was [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]]: the reformers talked about the penitentiary serving as a model for the family and the school and almost all the states adopted the plan (though Pennsylvania went even further in separating prisoners). The system's fame spread and visitors to the U.S. to see the prisons included [[de Tocqueville]] who wrote [[Democracy in America]] as a result of his visit.\n\nHowever, by the 1860s, overcrowding became the rule of the day, partly because of the long sentences given for violent crimes, despite increasing severity inside the prison and often cruel methods of gagging and restraining prisoners. An increasing proportion of prisoners were new immigrants. As a result of a tour of prisons in 18 states, [[Enoch Wines]] and [[Theodore William Dwight|Theodore Dwight]] produced a monumental report describing the flaws in the existing system and proposing remedies.<ref>\n{{citation |title=Report on the Prisons and Reformatories of the United States and Canada|author1=Enoch Wines|author2=Theodore Dwight|year=1867|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-mgzeGoepoC}}\n</ref> Their critical finding was that not one of the state prisons in the United States was seeking the reformation of its inmates as a primary goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=172}}</ref> They set out an agenda for reform which was endorsed by a ''National Congress'' in [[Cincinnati]] in 1870. These ideas were put into practice in the [[Elmira Reformatory]] in New York in 1876 run by [[Zebulon Brockway]]. At the core of the design was an educational program which included general subjects and vocational training for the less capable. Instead of fixed sentences, prisoners who did well could be released early.\n\nBut by the 1890s, Elmira had twice as many inmates as it was designed for and they were not only the first offenders between 16 and 31 for which the program was intended. Although it had a number of imitators in different states, it did little to halt the deterioration of the country's prisons which carried on a dreary life of their own. In the southern states, in which blacks made up more than 75% of the inmates, there was ruthless exploitation in which the states leased prisoners as chain gangs to entrepreneurs who treated them worse than slaves. By the 1920s drug use in prisons was also becoming a problem.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, psychiatric interpretations of social deviance were gaining a central role in criminology and policy making. By 1926, 67 prisons employed psychiatrists and 45 had psychologists. The language of medicine was applied in an attempt to \"cure\" offenders of their criminality. In fact, little was known about the causes of their behaviour and prescriptions were not much different from the earlier reform methods.<ref name=\"morris178\">{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=178}}</ref> A system of probation was introduced, but often used simply as an alternative to suspended sentences, and the probation officers appointed had little training, and their caseloads numbered several hundred making assistance or surveillance practically impossible. At the same time they could revoke the probation status without going through another trial or other proper process.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|p=182}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, [[Thomas Mott Osborne]] became chairman of a commission for the reform of the New York prison system and introduced a ''[[Mutual Welfare League]]'' at Auburn with a committee of 49 prisoners appointed by secret ballot from the 1400 inmates. He also removed the striped dress uniform at Sing Sing and introduced recreation and movies. Progressive reform resulted in the \"Big House\" by the late twenties \u2013 prisons averaging 2,500 men with professional management designed to eliminate the abusive forms of corporal punishment and prison labor prevailing at the time.\n\nThe American prison system was shaken by a series of riots in the early 1950s triggered by deficiencies of prison facilities, lack of hygiene or medical care, poor food quality, and guard brutality. In the next decade all these demands were recognized as rights by the courts.<ref name=\"morris178\"/> In 1954, the ''American Prison Association'' changed its name to the ''[[American Correctional Association]]'' and the rehabilitative emphasis was formalized in the 1955 [[United Nations]] [[Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]].\n\nSince the 1960s the prison population in the US has risen steadily, even during periods where the crime rate has fallen. This is partly due to profound changes in sentencing practices due to a denunciation of lenient policies in the late sixties and early seventies and assertions that rehabilitative purposes do not work. As a consequence sentencing commissions started to establish minimum as well as maximum [[sentencing guidelines]], which have reduced the discretion of parole authorities and also reduced parole supervision of released prisoners.  Another factor that contributed to the increase of incarcerations was the Reagan administration's \"War On Drugs\" in the 1980s. This War increased money spent on lowering the number of illegal drugs in the United States. As a result, drug arrests increased and prisons became increasingly more crowded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/war-on-drugs-prisons-infographic_n_4914884.html|title=Just How Much The War On Drugs Impacts Our Overcrowded Prisons, In One Chart|first=Kathleen|last=Miles|date=10 March 2014|via=Huff Post}}</ref> The rising rising prison population was made up disproportionately of African American with 90% of those sentenced to prison for drug offense in Illinois in 2002.<ref>Alexander, Michelle. \"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness.\" ''Dimensions of Culture 2: Justice, Edited by Dr. Amanda Solomon, Dr. Megan Strom, and Dr. Emily Johnston, Cognella, 2019, pp. 89-94.''</ref> By 2010, the United States had more prisoners than any other country and a greater percentage of its population was in prison than in any other country in the world. \"Mass incarceration\" became a serious social and economic problem, as each of the 2.3 million American prisoners costs an average of about $25,000 per year. Recidivism remained high, and useful programs were often cut during the recession of 2009\u20132010. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Plata]]'' upheld the release of thousands of California prisoners due to California's inability to provide constitutionally mandated levels of healthcare.\n\nIn 2015 a bipartisan effort was launched by [[Koch family foundations]], the [[ACLU]], the [[Center for American Progress]], [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]], the [[Coalition for Public Safety]], and the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]] to more seriously address criminal justice reform in the United States.<ref name=rtody>{{cite web| title =Koch brothers join Obama in advocating US prison reform| work =Russian Today| date =Jul 17, 2015| url =https://www.rt.com/usa/310128-koch-brothers-obama-prisons/}}</ref><ref name=tAtl>{{cite web| last =Ball| first =Molly| title =Do the Koch Brothers Really Care About Criminal-Justice Reform?| work =The Atlantic| date =Mar 3, 2015| url =https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/do-the-koch-brothers-really-care-about-criminal-justice-reform/386615/}}</ref><ref name=dbeast>{{cite web| last =Mak| first =Tim| title =Koch Bros to Bankroll Prison Reform| work =The Daily Beast| date =Jan 13, 2015| url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/13/koch-bros-to-bankroll-prison-reform.html}}</ref> The Kochs and their partners, are combatting the systemic overcriminalization and overincarceration of citizens from primarily low-income and minority communities.<ref name=wapos>{{cite web| last =Horwitz| first =Sari| title =Unlikely Allies| work =Washington Post| date =Aug 15, 2015| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/08/15/clemency-the-issue-that-obama-and-the-koch-brothers-actually-agree-on/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2015/1020/Congress-s-big-bipartisan-success-that-might-be-just-beginning |title=Congress's big, bipartisan success that might be just beginning | work=Christian Science Monitor | date=Oct 20, 2015 | author=Gass Henry}}</ref> The group of reformers is working to reduce recidivism rates and diminish barriers faced by rehabilitated persons seeking new employment in the work force.

The more modern use grew from the prison [[workhouse]] (known as the [[Rasphuis]]) from 1600 in Holland. The house was normally managed by a married couple, the 'father' and 'mother', usually with a work master and discipline master. The inmates, or [[journeymen]], often spent their time on spinning, weaving and fabricating cloths and their output was measured and those who exceeded the minimum received a small sum of money with which they could buy extras from the indoor father.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=68\u201372}}</ref>\n\nAn exception to the rule of forced labor were those inmates whose families could not look after them and paid for them to be in the workhouse. From the later 17th century private institutions for the insane, called the ''beterhuis'', developed to meet this need.\n\nIn Hamburg a different pattern occurred with the ''spinhaus'' in 1669, to which only infamous criminals were admitted. This was paid by the public treasury and the pattern spread in eighteenth-century Germany. In France the use of [[galley slave|galley servitude]] was most common until galleys were abolished in 1748. After this the condemned were put to work in naval [[arsenal]]s doing heavy work. Confinement originated from the ''h\u00f4pitaux g\u00e9n\u00e9raux'' which were mostly asylums, though in Paris they included many convicts, and persisted up till the [[French revolution|revolution]].\n\nThe use of capital punishment and [[judicial torture]] declined during the eighteenth century and imprisonment came to dominate the system, although reform movements started almost immediately. Many countries were committed to the goal as a financially self-sustaining institution and the organization was often subcontracted to entrepreneurs, though this created its own tensions and abuse. By the mid nineteenth century several countries initiated experiments in allowing the prisoners to choose the trades in which they were to be apprenticed. The growing amount of [[recidivism]] in the latter half of the nineteenth century led a number of [[criminologist]]s to argue that \"imprisonment did not, and could not fulfill its original ideal of treatment aimed at reintegrating the offender into the community\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=210}}</ref> Belgium led the way in introducing the [[suspended sentence]] for first-time offenders in 1888, followed by France in 1891 and most other countries in the next few years. [[Parole]] had been introduced on an experimental basis in France in the 1830s, with laws for juveniles introduced in 1850, and Portugal began to use it for adult criminals from 1861. The parole system introduced in France in 1885 made use of a strong private patronage network. Parole was approved throughout Europe at the [[International Prison Congress]] of 1910. As a result of these reforms the prison populations of many European countries halved in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nExceptions to this trend included France and Italy between the world wars, when there was a huge increase in the use of imprisonment. The National Socialist state in Germany used it as an important tool to rid itself of its enemies as crime rates rocketed as a consequence of new categories of criminal behavior. Russia, which had only started to reform its penal and judicial system in 1860 by abolishing corporal punishment, continued the use of exile with hard labor as a punishment and this was increased to a new level of brutality under [[Joseph Stalin]], despite early reforms by the [[Bolsheviks]].\n\nPostwar reforms stressed the need for the state to tailor punishment to the individual convicted criminal. In 1965, Sweden enacted a new criminal code emphasizing non-institutional alternatives to punishment including conditional sentences, [[probation]] for first-time offenders and the more extensive use of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]]. The use of probation caused a dramatic decline in the number women serving long-term sentences: in France the number fell from 5,231 in 1946 to 1,121 in 1980. Probation spread to most European countries though the level of surveillance varies. In the Netherlands, religious and philanthropic groups are responsible for much of the probationary care. The Dutch government invests heavily in correctional personnel, having 3,100 for 4,500 prisoners in 1959.<ref>{{harvnb|Morris|Rothman|1995|pp=218\u2013222}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite these reforms, numbers in prison started to grow again after the 1960s even in countries committed to non-custodial policies.\n\n==Theories of Incarceration and Reform==\n\n===Retribution, vengeance and retaliation===\nThis is founded on the \"[[eye for an eye]], tooth for a tooth\" incarceration philosophy, which essentially states that if one person harms another, then equivalent harm should be done to them. One goal here is to prevent [[vigilantism]], gang or clan warfare, and other actions by those who have an unsatisfied need to \"get even\" for a crime against them, their family, or their group. It is, however, difficult to determine how to equate different types of \"harm\". A literal case is where a murderer is punished with the death penalty, the argument being \"justice demands a life for a life\". One criticism of long term prison sentences and other methods for achieving justice is that such \"warehousing\" of criminals is rather expensive, this argument notwithstanding the fact that the multiple incarceration appeals of a death penalty case often exceed the price of the \"warehousing\" of the criminal in question.\nYet another facet of this debate disregards the financial cost for the most part. The argument regarding warehousing rests, in this case, upon the theory that any punishment considered respectful of human rights should not include imprisoning humans for life without a chance of release\u2014that even death is morally and ethically a higher road than no-parole prison sentences.\n\n===Deterrence===\nThe criminal is used as a \"threat to themselves and others\". By subjecting prisoners to harsh conditions, authorities hope to convince them to avoid future criminal behavior and to exemplify for others the rewards for avoiding such behavior; that is, the fear of punishment will win over whatever benefit or pleasure the illegal activity might bring. The deterrence model frequently goes far beyond \"an eye for an eye\", exacting a more severe punishment than would seem to be indicated by the crime. [[Torture]] has been used in the past as a deterrent, as has the public embarrassment and discomfort of [[stocks]], and, in religious communities, [[ex-communication]]. [[Execution (legal)|Executions]], particularly gruesome ones (such as hanging or beheading), often for petty offenses, are further examples of attempts at deterrence. One criticism of the deterrence model is that criminals typically have a rather short-term orientation, and the possibility of long-term consequences is of little importance to them. Also, their quality of life may be so horrific that any treatment within the criminal justice system (which is compatible with human rights law) will only be seen as an improvement over their previous situation. There used to be many European Monks who disagreed with the containment of the mentally ill, and their ethics had a strong influence on Dorothea Dix's mission to find a proper way to care for the challenged people.\n\n===Rehabilitation, reform and correction===\n(\"Reform\" here refers to reform of the individual, not the reform of the penal system.) The goal is to \"repair\" the deficiencies in the individual and return them as productive members of society. Education, work skills, [[deferred gratification]], treating others with respect, and self-discipline are stressed. Younger criminals who have committed fewer and less severe crimes are most likely to be successfully reformed. \"Reform schools\" and \"boot camps\" are set up according to this model. One criticism of this model is that criminals are rewarded with training and other items which would not have been available to them had they not committed a crime. <!--(this statement could be worded better-->\n\nPrior to its closing in late 1969, Eastern State Penitentiary, then known as State Correctional Institution, Philadelphia, had established a far reaching program of voluntary group therapy with the goal of having all inmates in the prison involved. From 1967 when the plan was initiated, the program appears to have been successful as many inmates did volunteer for group therapy. An interesting aspect was that the groups were to be led by two therapists, one from the psychology or social work department and a second from one of the officers among the prison guard staff.<ref>{{cite book |last = Bernard| first = Mazie| title = Prison Manifesto: Recollections of a Queer Psychologist Working in a Maximum Security Prison | publisher = Bernard Mazie | year = 2005| isbn =978-0-9769715-0-4}}</ref>\n\n===Removal from society===\nThe goal here is simply to keep criminals away from potential victims, thus reducing the number of crimes they can commit. The criticism{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} of this model is that others increase the number and severity of crimes they commit to make up for the \"vacuum\" left by the removed criminal. For example, incarcerating a [[drug dealer]] will result in an unmet demand for drugs at that locale, and an existing or new drug dealer will then appear, to fill the void. This new drug dealer may have been innocent of any crimes before this opportunity, or may have been guilty of less serious crimes, such as being a look-out for the previous drug dealer.\n\n===Restitution or repayment===\nPrisoners are forced to repay their \"debt\" to society. Unpaid or low pay work is common in many prisons, often to the benefit of the community. In some countries prisons operate as labour camps. Critics say that the repayment model gives government an economic incentive to send more people to prison. In corrupt or authoritarian regimes, such as the former Soviet Union under the control of Joseph Stalin, many citizens are sentenced to forced labour for minor breaches of the law, simply because the government requires the labour camps as a source of income. [[Community service]] is increasingly being used as an alternative to prison for petty criminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/a/anderson-justice.html |title=New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref>\n\n===Reduction in immediate costs===\nGovernment and prison officials also have the goal of minimizing short-term costs.\n\n:'''In wealthy societies:'''\n:This calls for keeping prisoners placated by providing them with things like television and conjugal visits. Inexpensive measures like these prevent prison assaults and riots which in turn allow the number of guards to be minimized. Providing the quickest possible parole and/or release also reduces immediate costs to the prison system (although these may very well increase long term costs to the prison system and society due to [[recidivism]]). The ultimate way to reduce immediate costs is to eliminate prisons entirely and use fines, community service, and other sanctions (like the loss of a driver's license or the right to vote) instead. Executions at first would appear to limit costs, but, in most wealthy societies, the long appeals process for death sentences (and associated legal costs) make them quite expensive. Note that this goal may conflict with a number of goals for criminal justice systems.\n\n:'''In poor societies:'''\n\n:Poor societies, which lack the resources to imprison criminals for years, frequently use execution in place of imprisonment, for severe crimes. Less severe crimes, such as theft, might be dealt with by less severe physical means, such as amputation of the hands. When long term imprisonment is used in such societies, it may be a virtual death sentence, as the lack of food, sanitation, and medical care causes widespread disease and death, in such prisons.\n\nSome of the goals of criminal justice are compatible with one another, while others are in conflict. In the history of prison reform, the harsh treatment, torture, and executions used for deterrence first came under fire as a violation of [[human rights]]. The salvation goal, and methods, were later attacked as violations of the individual's [[freedom of religion]]. This led to further reforms aimed principally at reform/correction of the individual, removal from society, and reduction of immediate costs. The perception that such reforms sometimes denied victims justice then led to further changes.\n\n==Advocacy Work==\n[[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] is now widely regarded as the founding father of prison reform, having travelled extensively visiting prisons across [[Europe]] in the 1770s and 1780s. Also, the great social reformer [[Jonas Hanway]] promoted \"''solitude in imprisonment'', with proper profitable labor and a spare diet\".<ref>Hanway, Jonas (1776) [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC38681714&id=8VNtvyCNiRYC&pg=PA4&dq=%22jonas+Hanway%22 Solitude in Imprisonment: With Proper Profitable Labour and a Spare Diet, the Most Humane and...] J.

Elizabeth Fry visited prisons and suggested basic human rights for prisoners, such as [[privacy]] and teaching prisoners a trade. Fry was particularly concerned with [[women's rights]]. Parliament, coming to realize that a significant portion of prisoners had come to commit crimes as a result of mental illness, passed the [[County Asylums Act 1808|County Asylums Act (1808)]]. This made it possible for [[Justice of the Peace]] in each county to build and run their own pauper asylums.\n\n''\"Whereas the practice of confining such lunatics and other insane persons as are chargeable to their respective parishes in Gaols, Houses of Correction, Poor Houses and Houses of Industry, is highly dangerous and inconvenient\"''<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Roberts, Andrew \n |title=''Table of Statutes'' \n |work=The asylums index \n |publisher=Middlesex University, London, England \n |year=1981 \n |url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/Law.htm#48Geo3c96 \n |accessdate=2006-09-26 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904062428/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/Law.htm \n |archivedate=2006-09-04 \n |url-status=dead \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThere is contemporary research on the use of volunteers by governments to help ensure the fair and humane detention of prisoners.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Roffee|first=James A.|date=2017-01-01|title=Accountability and Oversight of State Functions: Use of Volunteers to Monitor Equality and Diversity in Prisons in England and Wales|journal=SAGE Open|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2158244017690792|doi=10.1177/2158244017690792|issn=2158-2440}}</ref> Research suggests that volunteers can be effective to ensure oversight of state functions and ensure accountability, however, they must be given tasks appropriately and well trained.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===United States===\n{{see also|History of United States prison systems}}\n[[File:Johnny Cash-Nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Johnny Cash]] advocated prison reform at his July 1972 meeting with United States President [[Richard Nixon]].]]\nIn the 1800s, [[Dorothea Dix]] toured prisons in the U.S. and all over Europe looking at the conditions of the mentally handicapped. Her ideas led to a mushroom effect of asylums all over the United States in the mid-19th-century. [[Linda Gilbert]] established 22 prison libraries of from 1,500 to 2,000 volumes each, in six states.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn the early 1900s [[Samuel June Barrows]] was a leader in prison reform. President Cleveland appointed him International Prison Commissioner for the U.S. in 1895, and in 1900 Barrows became Secretary of the Prison Association of New York and held that position until his death on April 21, 1909. A Unitarian pastor, Barrows used his influence as editor of the Unitarian ''[[Christian Register]]'' to speak at meetings of the National Conference of Charities and Correction, the National International Prison Congresses, and the Society for International Law. As the International Prison Commissioner for the U.S., he wrote several of today's most valuable documents of American penological literature, including \"Children's Courts in the United States\" and \"The Criminal Insane in the United States and in Foreign Countries\". As a House representative, Barrows was pivotal in the creation of the International Prison Congress and became its president in 1905. In his final role, as Secretary of the Prison Association of New York, he dissolved the association's debt, began issuing annual reports, drafted and ensured passage of New York's first probation law, assisted in the implementation of a federal Parole Law, and promoted civil service for prison employees. Moreover, Barrows advocated improved prison structures and methods, traveling in 1907 around the world to bring back detailed plans of 36 of the best prisons in 14 different countries. In 1910 the National League of Volunteer Workers, nicknamed the \"Barrows League\" in his memory, formed in New York as a group dedicated to helping released prisoners and petitioning for better prison conditions.\n\n[[Zebulon Brockway]] in ''Fifty Years of Prison Service'' outlined an ideal prison system: Prisoners should support themselves in prison though industry, in anticipation of supporting themselves outside prison; outside businesses and labor must not interfere; indeterminate sentences were required, making prisoners earn their release with constructive behavior, not just the passage of time; and education and a Christian culture should be imparted. Nevertheless, opposition to prison industries, the [[Prison\u2013industrial complex|prison-industrial complex]], and labor increased. Finally, U.S. law prohibited the transport of prison-made goods across state lines. Most prison-made goods today are only for government use\u2014but the state and federal governments are not required to meet their needs from prison industries. Although nearly every prison reformer in history believed prisoners should work usefully, and several prisons in the 1800s were profitable and self-supporting, most American prisoners today do not have productive jobs in prison.<ref>''[http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2008/one20in20100pdf.pdf One in 100: Behind Bars in America]'', 2008, [[Pew Center]]'s Public Safety Performance Project @ pewcenteronthestates; Stephen Garvey, \"Freeing Prisoners' Labor,\" 50 ''[[Stanford Law Review]]'' 339, 343 (1\u20131998); John Dewar Gleissner, ''Prison & Slavery \u2013 A Surprising Comparison'', Outskirts Press, 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Kim Kardashian|Kim Kardashian-West]] has fought for prison reform, notably visiting the White House to visit President Donald Trump in on May 30, 2018.

This is a program that loads the Linux kernel into the computer's [[main memory]], by being executed by the computer when it is turned on and after the [[firmware]] initialization is performed.\n* An [[init]] program, such as the traditional [[sysvinit]] and the newer [[systemd]], [[OpenRC]] and [[Upstart (software)|Upstart]]. This is the first [[Process (computing)|process]] launched by the Linux kernel, and is at the root of the process tree: in other terms, all processes are launched through init. It starts processes such as system services and login prompts (whether graphical or in terminal mode).\n* [[Library (computing)|Software libraries]], which contain code that can be used by running processes. On Linux systems using [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]]-format executable files, the [[dynamic linker]] that manages use of dynamic libraries is known as [[ld-linux.so]]. If the system is set up for the user to compile software themselves, [[header file]]s will also be included to describe the [[Application binary interface|interface]] of installed libraries. Besides the most commonly used software library on Linux systems, the [[GNU C Library]] (glibc), there are numerous other libraries, such as [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] and [[Mesa (computer graphics)|Mesa]].\n** [[C standard library]] is the library needed to run [[C (programming language)|C programs]] on a computer system, with the GNU C Library being the standard. For embedded systems, alternatives such as the [[musl]], [[EGLIBC]] (a glibc fork once used by Debian) and [[uClibc]] (which was designed for [[uClinux]]) have been developed, although the last two are no longer maintained. Android uses its own C library, [[Bionic (software)|Bionic]].\n* Basic Unix commands, with GNU coreutils being the standard implementation. Alternatives exist for embedded systems, such as the copyleft [[BusyBox]], and the BSD-licensed [[Toybox]].\n* [[Widget toolkit]]s are the libraries used to build [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) for software applications. Numerous widget toolkits are available, including [[GTK]] and [[Clutter (software)|Clutter]] developed by the [[GNOME project]], [[Qt (software)|Qt]] developed by the [[Qt Project]] and led by [[Digia]], and [[Enlightenment Foundation Libraries]] (EFL) developed primarily by the [[Enlightenment (software)|Enlightenment]] team.\n* A [[package manager|package management system]], such as [[dpkg]] and [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]]. Alternatively packages can be compiled from binary or source [[Tar (computing)|tarballs]].\n* User interface programs such as command shells or windowing environments.\n\n=== User interface ===\nThe [[user interface]], also known as the [[shell (computing)|shell]], is either a [[command-line interface]] (CLI), a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), or controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for [[embedded systems]]. For desktop systems, the default user interface is usually graphical, although the CLI is commonly available through [[terminal emulator]] windows or on a separate [[virtual console (PC)|virtual console]].\n\nCLI shells are text-based user interfaces, which use text for both input and output. The dominant shell used in Linux is the [[Bourne-Again Shell]] (bash), originally developed for the [[GNU project]]. Most low-level Linux components, including various parts of the [[Userland (computing)|userland]], use the CLI exclusively. The CLI is particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks and provides very simple [[inter-process communication]].\n\nOn desktop systems, the most popular user interfaces are the [[GUI shell]]s, packaged together with extensive [[desktop environment]]s, such as [[KDE Plasma 5|KDE Plasma]], [[GNOME desktop|GNOME]], [[MATE (software)|MATE]], [[Cinnamon (desktop environment)|Cinnamon]], [[LXDE]], [[Elementary OS|Pantheon]] and [[Xfce]], though a variety of additional user interfaces exist. Most popular user interfaces are based on the [[X Window System]], often simply called \"X\". It provides [[network transparency]] and permits a graphical application running on one system to be displayed on another where a user may interact with the application; however, certain extensions of the X Window System are not capable of working over the network.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://lwn.net/Articles/553415/ |title = The Wayland Situation: Facts About X vs. Wayland (Phoronix) |date = June 8, 2013 |accessdate = October 11, 2013 |publisher = [[LWN.net]] |author = Jake Edge |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131022030529/http://lwn.net/Articles/553415/ |archivedate = October 22, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Several X display servers exist, with the reference implementation, [[X.Org Server]], being the most popular.\n\nSeveral types of [[window manager]]s exist for X11, including [[Tiling window manager|tiling]], [[Dynamic window manager|dynamic]], [[stacking window manager|stacking]] and [[compositing window manager|compositing]]. Window managers provide means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows, and interact with the X Window System. Simpler [[X window manager]]s such as [[dwm]], [[ratpoison]], [[i3wm]], or herbstluftwm provide a [[Minimalism (computing)|minimalist]] functionality, while more elaborate window managers such as [[FVWM]], [[Enlightenment (software)|Enlightenment]] or [[Window Maker]] provide more features such as a built-in [[taskbar]] and [[theme (computing)|themes]], but are still lightweight when compared to desktop environments. Desktop environments include window managers as part of their standard installations, such as [[Mutter (window manager)|Mutter]] (GNOME), [[KWin]] (KDE) or [[Xfwm]] (xfce), although users may choose to use a different window manager if preferred.\n\n[[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] is a display server protocol intended as a replacement for the X11 protocol; {{As of|2014|lc=yes}}, it has not received wider adoption. Unlike X11, Wayland does not need an external window manager and compositing manager. Therefore, a Wayland compositor takes the role of the display server, window manager and compositing manager.

The fact that the software licenses explicitly permit redistribution, however, provides a basis for larger-scale projects that collect the software produced by stand-alone projects and make it available all at once in the form of a Linux distribution.\n\nMany Linux distributions manage a remote collection of system software and application software packages available for download and installation through a network connection. This allows users to adapt the operating system to their specific needs. Distributions are maintained by individuals, loose-knit teams, volunteer organizations, and commercial entities. A distribution is responsible for the default configuration of the installed Linux kernel, general system security, and more generally integration of the different software packages into a coherent whole. Distributions typically use a [[package manager]] such as [[Advanced Packaging Tool|apt]], [[Yellowdog Updater, Modified|yum]], [[zypper]], [[Pacman (package manager)|pacman]] or [[Portage (software)|portage]] to install, remove, and update all of a system's software from one central location.\n\n=== Community ===\n{{See also|Free software community|Linux User Group}}\n\nA distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities. Some vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis, [[Debian]] being a well-known example. Others maintain a community version of their commercial distributions, as [[Red Hat]] does with [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]], and [[SUSE]] does with [[openSUSE]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://getfedora.org/|title=Get Fedora|website=getfedora.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opensuse.org/|title=The makers' choice for sysadmins, developers and desktop users.|last=design|first=Cynthia Sanchez: front-end and UI, Zvezdana Marjanovic: graphic|website=openSUSE|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>\n\nIn many cities and regions, local associations known as [[Linux User Group]]s (LUGs) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software. They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations, training, technical support, and operating system installation to new users. Many Internet communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most distributions and free software / open-source projects have [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] chatrooms or [[newsgroup]]s. [[Online forum]]s are another means for support, with notable examples being [[LinuxQuestions.org]] and the various distribution specific support and community forums, such as ones for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]. Linux distributions host [[mailing list]]s; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list.\n\nThere are several technology websites with a Linux focus. Print magazines on Linux often bundle [[cover disk]]s that carry software or even complete Linux distributions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/dvd/ | title=Linux Format DVD contents | author=[[Linux Format]] | accessdate=January 17, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080808113845/http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/dvd/|archivedate=August 8, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linux-magazine.com/resources/current_issue | title=Current Issue | author=linux-magazine.com | accessdate=January 17, 2008 | authorlink=Linux Magazine | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110033853/http://www.linux-magazine.com/resources/current_issue | archivedate=January 10, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Linux distributions are generally available without charge, several large corporations sell, support, and contribute to the development of the components of the system and of [[free software]]. An analysis of the Linux kernel showed 75 percent of the code from December 2008 to January 2010 was developed by programmers working for corporations, leaving about 18 percent to volunteers and 7% unclassified.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://apcmag.com/linux-now-75-corporate.htm | title=75% of Linux code now written by paid developers | work=[[APC (magazine)|APC]] | accessdate=January 22, 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122015736/http://apcmag.com/linux-now-75-corporate.htm | archivedate=January 22, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Major corporations that provide contributions include [[Dell]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Sun Microsystems]] (now part of Oracle) and [[Nokia]]. A number of corporations, notably Red Hat, [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]] and [[SUSE]], have built a significant business around Linux distributions.\n\nThe [[free software licenses]], on which the various software packages of a distribution built on the Linux kernel are based, explicitly accommodate and encourage commercialization; the relationship between a Linux distribution as a whole and individual vendors may be seen as [[symbiosis|symbiotic]]. One common [[business model]] of commercial suppliers is charging for support, especially for business users. A number of companies also offer a specialized business version of their distribution, which adds proprietary support packages and tools to administer higher numbers of installations or to simplify administrative tasks.\n\nAnother business model is to give away the software in order to sell hardware. This used to be the norm in the computer industry, with operating systems such as [[CP/M]], [[Apple DOS]] and versions of [[Mac OS]] prior to 7.6 freely copyable (but not modifiable). As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic, as the OS would run on any manufacturer's computer that shared the same architecture.\n\n=== Programming on Linux ===\nLinux distributions support dozens of [[programming language]]s. The original development tools used for building both Linux applications and operating system programs are found within the [[GNU toolchain]], which includes the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC) and the [[GNU Build System]]. Amongst others, GCC provides compilers for [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]] and [[Fortran]]. Many programming languages have a cross-platform reference implementation that supports Linux, for example [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]], [[Python programming language|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], Go, [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]. First released in 2003, the [[LLVM]] project provides an alternative cross-platform open-source compiler for many languages. [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] compilers for Linux include the [[Intel C++ Compiler]], [[Sun Studio (software)|Sun Studio]], and IBM XL [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] Compiler. [[BASIC]] in the form of [[Visual Basic]] is supported in such forms as [[Gambas]], [[FreeBASIC]], and [[XBasic]], and in terms of terminal programming or [[QuickBASIC]] or [[Turbo BASIC]] programming in the form of [[QB64]].\n\nA common feature of Unix-like systems, Linux includes traditional specific-purpose programming languages targeted at [[script (computing)|scripting]], text processing and system configuration and management in general. Linux distributions support [[shell scripts]], [[awk]], [[sed]] and [[make (software)|make]]. Many programs also have an embedded programming language to support configuring or programming themselves. For example, [[regular expressions]] are supported in programs like [[grep]] and [[locate (Unix)|locate]], the traditional Unix [[Mail Transfer Agent|MTA]] [[Sendmail]] contains its own [[Turing complete]] scripting system, and the advanced text editor [[GNU Emacs]] is built around a general purpose [[Emacs Lisp|Lisp]] interpreter.\n\nMost distributions also include support for [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]], [[Python programming language|Python]] and other [[dynamic programming language|dynamic languages]]. While not as common, Linux also supports [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (via [[Mono (software)|Mono]]), [[Vala (programming language)|Vala]], and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]. [[Guile (programming language)|Guile Scheme]] acts as an [[extension language]] targeting the [[GNU]] system utilities, seeking to make the conventionally small, [[static typing|static]], [[compiler|compiled]] [[C (programming language)|C]] programs of [[Unix philosophy|Unix design]] rapidly and dynamically extensible via an elegant, [[functional programming|functional]] high-level scripting system; many GNU programs can be compiled with optional Guile [[language binding|bindings]] to this end. A number of [[Java Virtual Machine]]s and development kits run on Linux, including the original Sun Microsystems JVM ([[HotSpot]]), and IBM's J2SE RE, as well as many open-source projects like [[Kaffe]] and [[JikesRVM]].\n\n[[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] are popular [[desktop environment]]s and provide a framework for developing applications. These projects are based on the [[GTK]] and [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] [[widget toolkit]]s, respectively, which can also be used independently of the larger framework. Both support a wide variety of languages. There are a number of [[Integrated development environment]]s available including [[Anjuta]], [[Code::Blocks]], [[CodeLite]], [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[Geany]], [[ActiveState Komodo]], [[KDevelop]], [[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]], [[MonoDevelop]], [[NetBeans]], and [[Qt Creator]], while the long-established editors [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]], [[GNU nano|nano]] and [[Emacs]] remain popular.<ref>{{cite web | first = Joe | last = Brockmeier | title = A survey of Linux Web development tools | url = http://programming.linux.com/programming/05/10/03/1828224.shtml?tid=63&tid=47 | accessdate = December 16, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019021449/http://programming.linux.com/programming/05/10/03/1828224.shtml?tid=63&tid=47 | archivedate = October 19, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Hardware support ==\n[[File:Linux kernel ubiquity.svg|thumb|right|upright=2.25|Linux is ubiquitously found on various types of hardware.]]\n{{See also|List of Linux-supported computer architectures}}\n\nThe Linux kernel is a widely [[porting|ported]] operating system kernel, available for devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers; it runs on a highly diverse range of [[computer architecture]]s, including the hand-held [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[iPAQ]] and the [[IBM]] [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] [[IBM System z9|System z9]] or [[IBM System z10|System z10]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.freeos.com/articles/4737/ | title = If I could re-write Linux | first = Prakash | last = Advani | date = February 8, 2004 | accessdate = January 23, 2007 | publisher = freeos.com | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070123143037/http://www.freeos.com/articles/4737/ | archivedate = January 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Specialized distributions and kernel forks exist for less mainstream architectures; for example, the [[ELKS]] kernel [[fork (software development)|fork]] can run on [[Intel 8086]] or [[Intel 80286]] [[16-bit]] microprocessors, while the [[\u00b5Clinux]] kernel fork may run on systems without a [[memory management unit]].

It is also possible to run applications written for [[Android OS|Android]] on other versions of Linux using [[Anbox]].\n\n==== Components and installation ====\nBesides externally visible components, such as [[X window manager]]s, a non-obvious but quite central role is played by the programs hosted by [[freedesktop.org]], such as [[D-Bus]] or [[PulseAudio]]; both major desktop environments (GNOME and KDE) include them, each offering graphical front-ends written using the corresponding toolkit ([[GTK]] or [[Qt (framework)|Qt]]). A [[display server]] is another component, which for the longest time has been communicating in the X11 display server protocol with its clients; prominent software talking X11 includes the [[X.Org Server]] and [[Xlib]]. Frustration over the cumbersome X11 core protocol, and especially over its numerous extensions, has led to the creation of a new display server protocol, [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]].\n\nInstalling, updating and removing software in Linux is typically done through the use of package managers such as the [[Synaptic Package Manager]], [[PackageKit]], and [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified|Yum Extender]]. While most major Linux distributions have extensive repositories, often containing tens of thousands of packages, not all the software that can run on Linux is available from the official repositories. Alternatively, users can install packages from unofficial repositories, download pre-compiled packages directly from websites, or compile the source code by themselves. All these methods come with different degrees of difficulty; compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new Linux users, but it is hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to Linux.\n\n<gallery width=\"180px\" height=\"120\" caption=\"Samples of graphical desktop interfaces\">\nFile:GNOME 3.32.1.png|[[GNOME]]\nFile:KDE Plasma 5.16.png|[[KDE Plasma 5]]\nFile:Cinnamon 4.2.3 screenshot.png|[[Cinnamon (Desktop Environment)|Cinnamon]]\nFile:Ubuntu Mate 18.04.1 with MATE 1.20.1.png|[[Mate desktop|Mate]]\nFile:Scrivania di elementary OS 5.0 Juno.png|[[Pantheon (desktop environment)|Pantheon]]\nFile:Budgie Desktop Environment.png|[[Budgie (desktop environment)|Budgie]]\nFile:XFCE-4.12-Desktop-standard.png|[[Xfce]]\nFile:Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop.png|[[Unity (user interface)|Unity]] (discontinued)\nFile:Lubuntu 13.04 English.png|[[LXDE]]\nFile:LXQt 0.10 - Ambiance.png|[[LXQt]]\nFile:I3-gaps-wiki.png|[[i3 (window manager)|i3-gaps]]\nFile:E17 bw screenshot.png|[[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]]\nFile:Fluxbox.png|[[Fluxbox]]\nFile:Sugar-home-view-0.82.jpg|[[Sugar (desktop environment)|Sugar]]\nFile:Screenshot of Trinity Desktop Environment (TDE) R14.0.5 Development.png|[[Trinity (desktop environment)|Trinity]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Netbooks ===\nLinux distributions have also become popular in the [[netbook]] market, with many devices such as the [[Asus Eee PC]] and [[Aspire One|Acer Aspire One]] shipping with customized Linux distributions installed.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/28/netbooks-sales | title=Are netbooks losing their shine? | accessdate=June 2, 2010 | location=London | date=May 28, 2009 | work=The Guardian | first=Jack | last=Schofield | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221110306/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/28/netbooks-sales | archivedate=December 21, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Google announced its [[Chrome&nbsp;OS]] as a minimal Linux-based operating system, using the [[Chrome browser]] as the main user interface.

There are two main methods for creating a specialized Linux distribution: building from scratch or from a general-purpose distribution as a base. The distributions often used for this purpose include [[Debian]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] (which is itself based on Debian), [[Arch Linux]], [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], and [[Slackware]]. In contrast, Linux distributions built from scratch do not have general-purpose bases; instead, they focus on the [[JeOS]] philosophy by including only necessary components and avoiding [[System resource|resource]] overhead caused by components considered redundant in the distribution's use cases.\n\n==== Home theater PC ====\nA [[home theater PC]] (HTPC) is a PC that is mainly used as an entertainment system, especially a [[home theater system]]. It is normally connected to a television, and often an additional audio system.\n\n[[OpenELEC]], a Linux distribution that incorporates the media center software [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]], is an OS tuned specifically for an HTPC. Having been built from the ground up adhering to the JeOS principle, the OS is very lightweight and very suitable for the confined usage range of an HTPC.\n\nThere are also special editions of Linux distributions that include the [[MythTV]] media center software, such as [[Mythbuntu]], a special edition of Ubuntu.\n\n==== Digital security ====\n[[Kali Linux]] is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed for [[digital forensics]] and [[penetration test]]ing. It comes preinstalled with several software applications for penetration testing and identifying [[Exploit (computer security)|security exploits]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://docs.kali.org/introduction/what-is-kali-linux|title = What is Kali Linux?|accessdate = June 13, 2014|website = Kali Linux|publisher = |url-status=live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140527164453/http://docs.kali.org/introduction/what-is-kali-linux|archivedate = May 27, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The Ubuntu derivative [[BackBox]] provides pre-installed security and network analysis tools for ethical hacking. <br />The Arch-based [[BlackArch]] includes over 2100 tools for pentesting and security researching.<ref name=\"blackarch\">{{cite web|url=https://blackarch.org/index.html|title=BlackArch Linux - Penetration Testing Distribution|last=|first=|date=|website=BlackArch Linux|accessdate=April 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are many Linux distributions created with privacy, secrecy, network anonymity and information security in mind, including [[Tails (operating system)|Tails]], [[Tin Hat Linux]] and [[Tinfoil Hat Linux]]. [[Lightweight Portable Security]] is a distribution based on Arch Linux and developed by the [[United States Department of Defense]]. [[Tor-ramdisk]] is a minimal distribution created solely to host the network anonymity software [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].\n\n==== System rescue ====\nLinux [[Live CD]] sessions have long been used as a tool for recovering data from a broken computer system and for repairing the system. Building upon that idea, several Linux distributions tailored for this purpose have emerged, most of which use [[GParted]] as a partition editor, with additional data recovery and system repair software:\n* [[Gparted live|GParted Live]]{{snd}} a Debian-based distribution developed by the GParted project.\n* [[Parted Magic]]{{snd}} a commercial Linux distribution.\n* [[SystemRescueCD]]{{snd}} an Arch-based distribution with support for editing Windows [[Windows Registry|registry]].\n\n==== In space ====\n[[SpaceX]] uses multiple redundant [[:Category:Avionics computers|flight computers]] in a [[fault-tolerant design]] in its [[Falcon&nbsp;9]] rocket. Each Merlin engine is controlled by three [[Voting logic|voting]] computers, with two physical processors per computer that constantly check each other's operation. Linux is not inherently fault-tolerant (no operating system is, as it is a function of the whole system including the hardware), but the flight computer software makes it so for its purpose.<ref name=aw20121118/> For flexibility, [[commercial off-the-shelf]] parts and system-wide \"radiation-tolerant\" design are used instead of [[radiation hardened]] parts.<ref name=aw20121118>{{cite news|last=Svitak |first=Amy |title=Dragon's \"Radiation-Tolerant\" Design |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog%3a04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&plckPostId=Blog%3a04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post%3aa8b87703-93f9-4cdf-885f-9429605e14df |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=November 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203204735/http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog%3A04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&plckPostId=Blog%3A04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post%3Aa8b87703-93f9-4cdf-885f-9429605e14df |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> {{As of|July 2019}}, SpaceX has conducted over [[List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches|76 launches]] of the Falcon&nbsp;9 since 2010, out of which all but one have successfully delivered their primary payloads to the intended [[orbit]], and plans to use it to transport astronauts to the [[International Space Station]].\n\nWindows was deployed as the operating system on non-mission critical laptops used on the space station, but it was later replaced with Linux.

They also include tools for administering and building school computer labs and computer-based classrooms, such as the [[Linux Terminal Server Project]] (LTSP).\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Instant WebKiosk]] and [[Webconverger]] are browser-based Linux distributions often used in web [[Interactive kiosk|kiosks]] and [[digital signage]]. [[Thinstation]] is a minimalist distribution designed for [[thin client]]s. [[Rocks Cluster Distribution]] is tailored for [[HPCC|high-performance computing clusters]].\n\nThere are general-purpose Linux distributions that target a specific audience, such as users of a specific language or geographical area. Such examples include [[Ubuntu Kylin]] for Chinese language users and BlankOn targeted at Indonesians. Profession-specific distributions include [[Ubuntu Studio]] for media creation and [[DNALinux]] for [[bioinformatics]]. There is also a Muslim-oriented distribution of the name [[Sabily]] that consequently also provides some Islamic tools. Certain organizations use slightly specialized Linux distributions internally, including [[GendBuntu]] used by the French [[National Gendarmerie]], [[Goobuntu]] used internally by Google, and [[Astra Linux]] developed specifically for the Russian army.\n\n== Market share and uptake ==\n{{Main|Linux adoption}}\n{{See also|Usage share of operating systems}}\n\nMany quantitative studies of [[free software|free]]/open-source software focus on topics including market share and reliability, with numerous studies specifically examining Linux.<ref>{{cite web | first = David A | last = Wheeler | url = http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html | title = Why Open Source Software/Free Software (OSS/FS)?

This is a program that loads the Linux kernel into the computer's [[main memory]], by being executed by the computer when it is turned on and after the [[firmware]] initialization is performed.\n* An [[init]] program, such as the traditional [[sysvinit]] and the newer [[systemd]], [[OpenRC]] and [[Upstart (software)|Upstart]]. This is the first [[Process (computing)|process]] launched by the Linux kernel, and is at the root of the process tree: in other terms, all processes are launched through init. It starts processes such as system services and login prompts (whether graphical or in terminal mode).\n* [[Library (computing)|Software libraries]], which contain code that can be used by running processes. On Linux systems using [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]]-format executable files, the [[dynamic linker]] that manages use of dynamic libraries is known as [[ld-linux.so]]. If the system is set up for the user to compile software themselves, [[header file]]s will also be included to describe the [[Application binary interface|interface]] of installed libraries. Besides the most commonly used software library on Linux systems, the [[GNU C Library]] (glibc), there are numerous other libraries, such as [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] and [[Mesa (computer graphics)|Mesa]].\n** [[C standard library]] is the library needed to run [[C (programming language)|C programs]] on a computer system, with the GNU C Library being the standard. For embedded systems, alternatives such as the [[musl]], [[EGLIBC]] (a glibc fork once used by Debian) and [[uClibc]] (which was designed for [[uClinux]]) have been developed, although the last two are no longer maintained. Android uses its own C library, [[Bionic (software)|Bionic]].\n* Basic Unix commands, with GNU coreutils being the standard implementation. Alternatives exist for embedded systems, such as the copyleft [[BusyBox]], and the BSD-licensed [[Toybox]].\n* [[Widget toolkit]]s are the libraries used to build [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) for software applications. Numerous widget toolkits are available, including [[GTK]] and [[Clutter (software)|Clutter]] developed by the [[GNOME project]], [[Qt (software)|Qt]] developed by the [[Qt Project]] and led by [[Digia]], and [[Enlightenment Foundation Libraries]] (EFL) developed primarily by the [[Enlightenment (software)|Enlightenment]] team.\n* A [[package manager|package management system]], such as [[dpkg]] and [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]]. Alternatively packages can be compiled from binary or source [[Tar (computing)|tarballs]].\n* User interface programs such as command shells or windowing environments.\n\n=== User interface ===\nThe [[user interface]], also known as the [[shell (computing)|shell]], is either a [[command-line interface]] (CLI), a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), or controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for [[embedded systems]]. For desktop systems, the default user interface is usually graphical, although the CLI is commonly available through [[terminal emulator]] windows or on a separate [[virtual console (PC)|virtual console]].\n\nCLI shells are text-based user interfaces, which use text for both input and output. The dominant shell used in Linux is the [[Bourne-Again Shell]] (bash), originally developed for the [[GNU project]]. Most low-level Linux components, including various parts of the [[Userland (computing)|userland]], use the CLI exclusively. The CLI is particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks and provides very simple [[inter-process communication]].\n\nOn desktop systems, the most popular user interfaces are the [[GUI shell]]s, packaged together with extensive [[desktop environment]]s, such as [[KDE Plasma 5|KDE Plasma]], [[GNOME desktop|GNOME]], [[MATE (software)|MATE]], [[Cinnamon (desktop environment)|Cinnamon]], [[LXDE]], [[Elementary OS|Pantheon]] and [[Xfce]], though a variety of additional user interfaces exist. Most popular user interfaces are based on the [[X Window System]], often simply called \"X\". It provides [[network transparency]] and permits a graphical application running on one system to be displayed on another where a user may interact with the application; however, certain extensions of the X Window System are not capable of working over the network.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://lwn.net/Articles/553415/ |title = The Wayland Situation: Facts About X vs. Wayland (Phoronix) |date = June 8, 2013 |accessdate = October 11, 2013 |publisher = [[LWN.net]] |author = Jake Edge |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131022030529/http://lwn.net/Articles/553415/ |archivedate = October 22, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Several X display servers exist, with the reference implementation, [[X.Org Server]], being the most popular.\n\nSeveral types of [[window manager]]s exist for X11, including [[Tiling window manager|tiling]], [[Dynamic window manager|dynamic]], [[stacking window manager|stacking]] and [[compositing window manager|compositing]]. Window managers provide means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows, and interact with the X Window System. Simpler [[X window manager]]s such as [[dwm]], [[ratpoison]], [[i3wm]], or herbstluftwm provide a [[Minimalism (computing)|minimalist]] functionality, while more elaborate window managers such as [[FVWM]], [[Enlightenment (software)|Enlightenment]] or [[Window Maker]] provide more features such as a built-in [[taskbar]] and [[theme (computing)|themes]], but are still lightweight when compared to desktop environments. Desktop environments include window managers as part of their standard installations, such as [[Mutter (window manager)|Mutter]] (GNOME), [[KWin]] (KDE) or [[Xfwm]] (xfce), although users may choose to use a different window manager if preferred.\n\n[[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] is a display server protocol intended as a replacement for the X11 protocol; {{As of|2014|lc=yes}}, it has not received wider adoption. Unlike X11, Wayland does not need an external window manager and compositing manager. Therefore, a Wayland compositor takes the role of the display server, window manager and compositing manager.

The fact that the software licenses explicitly permit redistribution, however, provides a basis for larger-scale projects that collect the software produced by stand-alone projects and make it available all at once in the form of a Linux distribution.\n\nMany Linux distributions manage a remote collection of system software and application software packages available for download and installation through a network connection. This allows users to adapt the operating system to their specific needs. Distributions are maintained by individuals, loose-knit teams, volunteer organizations, and commercial entities. A distribution is responsible for the default configuration of the installed Linux kernel, general system security, and more generally integration of the different software packages into a coherent whole. Distributions typically use a [[package manager]] such as [[Advanced Packaging Tool|apt]], [[Yellowdog Updater, Modified|yum]], [[zypper]], [[Pacman (package manager)|pacman]] or [[Portage (software)|portage]] to install, remove, and update all of a system's software from one central location.\n\n=== Community ===\n{{See also|Free software community|Linux User Group}}\n\nA distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities. Some vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis, [[Debian]] being a well-known example. Others maintain a community version of their commercial distributions, as [[Red Hat]] does with [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]], and [[SUSE]] does with [[openSUSE]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://getfedora.org/|title=Get Fedora|website=getfedora.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opensuse.org/|title=The makers' choice for sysadmins, developers and desktop users.|last=design|first=Cynthia Sanchez: front-end and UI, Zvezdana Marjanovic: graphic|website=openSUSE|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>\n\nIn many cities and regions, local associations known as [[Linux User Group]]s (LUGs) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software. They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations, training, technical support, and operating system installation to new users. Many Internet communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most distributions and free software / open-source projects have [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] chatrooms or [[newsgroup]]s. [[Online forum]]s are another means for support, with notable examples being [[LinuxQuestions.org]] and the various distribution specific support and community forums, such as ones for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]. Linux distributions host [[mailing list]]s; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list.\n\nThere are several technology websites with a Linux focus. Print magazines on Linux often bundle [[cover disk]]s that carry software or even complete Linux distributions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/dvd/ | title=Linux Format DVD contents | author=[[Linux Format]] | accessdate=January 17, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080808113845/http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/dvd/|archivedate=August 8, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linux-magazine.com/resources/current_issue | title=Current Issue | author=linux-magazine.com | accessdate=January 17, 2008 | authorlink=Linux Magazine | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110033853/http://www.linux-magazine.com/resources/current_issue | archivedate=January 10, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Linux distributions are generally available without charge, several large corporations sell, support, and contribute to the development of the components of the system and of [[free software]]. An analysis of the Linux kernel showed 75 percent of the code from December 2008 to January 2010 was developed by programmers working for corporations, leaving about 18 percent to volunteers and 7% unclassified.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://apcmag.com/linux-now-75-corporate.htm | title=75% of Linux code now written by paid developers | work=[[APC (magazine)|APC]] | accessdate=January 22, 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122015736/http://apcmag.com/linux-now-75-corporate.htm | archivedate=January 22, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Major corporations that provide contributions include [[Dell]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Sun Microsystems]] (now part of Oracle) and [[Nokia]]. A number of corporations, notably Red Hat, [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]] and [[SUSE]], have built a significant business around Linux distributions.\n\nThe [[free software licenses]], on which the various software packages of a distribution built on the Linux kernel are based, explicitly accommodate and encourage commercialization; the relationship between a Linux distribution as a whole and individual vendors may be seen as [[symbiosis|symbiotic]]. One common [[business model]] of commercial suppliers is charging for support, especially for business users. A number of companies also offer a specialized business version of their distribution, which adds proprietary support packages and tools to administer higher numbers of installations or to simplify administrative tasks.\n\nAnother business model is to give away the software in order to sell hardware. This used to be the norm in the computer industry, with operating systems such as [[CP/M]], [[Apple DOS]] and versions of [[Mac OS]] prior to 7.6 freely copyable (but not modifiable). As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic, as the OS would run on any manufacturer's computer that shared the same architecture.\n\n=== Programming on Linux ===\nLinux distributions support dozens of [[programming language]]s. The original development tools used for building both Linux applications and operating system programs are found within the [[GNU toolchain]], which includes the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC) and the [[GNU Build System]]. Amongst others, GCC provides compilers for [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]] and [[Fortran]]. Many programming languages have a cross-platform reference implementation that supports Linux, for example [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]], [[Python programming language|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], Go, [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]. First released in 2003, the [[LLVM]] project provides an alternative cross-platform open-source compiler for many languages. [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] compilers for Linux include the [[Intel C++ Compiler]], [[Sun Studio (software)|Sun Studio]], and IBM XL [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] Compiler. [[BASIC]] in the form of [[Visual Basic]] is supported in such forms as [[Gambas]], [[FreeBASIC]], and [[XBasic]], and in terms of terminal programming or [[QuickBASIC]] or [[Turbo BASIC]] programming in the form of [[QB64]].\n\nA common feature of Unix-like systems, Linux includes traditional specific-purpose programming languages targeted at [[script (computing)|scripting]], text processing and system configuration and management in general. Linux distributions support [[shell scripts]], [[awk]], [[sed]] and [[make (software)|make]]. Many programs also have an embedded programming language to support configuring or programming themselves. For example, [[regular expressions]] are supported in programs like [[grep]] and [[locate (Unix)|locate]], the traditional Unix [[Mail Transfer Agent|MTA]] [[Sendmail]] contains its own [[Turing complete]] scripting system, and the advanced text editor [[GNU Emacs]] is built around a general purpose [[Emacs Lisp|Lisp]] interpreter.\n\nMost distributions also include support for [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]], [[Python programming language|Python]] and other [[dynamic programming language|dynamic languages]]. While not as common, Linux also supports [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (via [[Mono (software)|Mono]]), [[Vala (programming language)|Vala]], and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]. [[Guile (programming language)|Guile Scheme]] acts as an [[extension language]] targeting the [[GNU]] system utilities, seeking to make the conventionally small, [[static typing|static]], [[compiler|compiled]] [[C (programming language)|C]] programs of [[Unix philosophy|Unix design]] rapidly and dynamically extensible via an elegant, [[functional programming|functional]] high-level scripting system; many GNU programs can be compiled with optional Guile [[language binding|bindings]] to this end. A number of [[Java Virtual Machine]]s and development kits run on Linux, including the original Sun Microsystems JVM ([[HotSpot]]), and IBM's J2SE RE, as well as many open-source projects like [[Kaffe]] and [[JikesRVM]].\n\n[[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] are popular [[desktop environment]]s and provide a framework for developing applications. These projects are based on the [[GTK]] and [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] [[widget toolkit]]s, respectively, which can also be used independently of the larger framework. Both support a wide variety of languages. There are a number of [[Integrated development environment]]s available including [[Anjuta]], [[Code::Blocks]], [[CodeLite]], [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[Geany]], [[ActiveState Komodo]], [[KDevelop]], [[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]], [[MonoDevelop]], [[NetBeans]], and [[Qt Creator]], while the long-established editors [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]], [[GNU nano|nano]] and [[Emacs]] remain popular.<ref>{{cite web | first = Joe | last = Brockmeier | title = A survey of Linux Web development tools | url = http://programming.linux.com/programming/05/10/03/1828224.shtml?tid=63&tid=47 | accessdate = December 16, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019021449/http://programming.linux.com/programming/05/10/03/1828224.shtml?tid=63&tid=47 | archivedate = October 19, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Hardware support ==\n[[File:Linux kernel ubiquity.svg|thumb|right|upright=2.25|Linux is ubiquitously found on various types of hardware.]]\n{{See also|List of Linux-supported computer architectures}}\n\nThe Linux kernel is a widely [[porting|ported]] operating system kernel, available for devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers; it runs on a highly diverse range of [[computer architecture]]s, including the hand-held [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[iPAQ]] and the [[IBM]] [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] [[IBM System z9|System z9]] or [[IBM System z10|System z10]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.freeos.com/articles/4737/ | title = If I could re-write Linux | first = Prakash | last = Advani | date = February 8, 2004 | accessdate = January 23, 2007 | publisher = freeos.com | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070123143037/http://www.freeos.com/articles/4737/ | archivedate = January 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Specialized distributions and kernel forks exist for less mainstream architectures; for example, the [[ELKS]] kernel [[fork (software development)|fork]] can run on [[Intel 8086]] or [[Intel 80286]] [[16-bit]] microprocessors, while the [[\u00b5Clinux]] kernel fork may run on systems without a [[memory management unit]].

It is also possible to run applications written for [[Android OS|Android]] on other versions of Linux using [[Anbox]].\n\n==== Components and installation ====\nBesides externally visible components, such as [[X window manager]]s, a non-obvious but quite central role is played by the programs hosted by [[freedesktop.org]], such as [[D-Bus]] or [[PulseAudio]]; both major desktop environments (GNOME and KDE) include them, each offering graphical front-ends written using the corresponding toolkit ([[GTK]] or [[Qt (framework)|Qt]]). A [[display server]] is another component, which for the longest time has been communicating in the X11 display server protocol with its clients; prominent software talking X11 includes the [[X.Org Server]] and [[Xlib]]. Frustration over the cumbersome X11 core protocol, and especially over its numerous extensions, has led to the creation of a new display server protocol, [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]].\n\nInstalling, updating and removing software in Linux is typically done through the use of package managers such as the [[Synaptic Package Manager]], [[PackageKit]], and [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified|Yum Extender]]. While most major Linux distributions have extensive repositories, often containing tens of thousands of packages, not all the software that can run on Linux is available from the official repositories. Alternatively, users can install packages from unofficial repositories, download pre-compiled packages directly from websites, or compile the source code by themselves. All these methods come with different degrees of difficulty; compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new Linux users, but it is hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to Linux.\n\n<gallery width=\"180px\" height=\"120\" caption=\"Samples of graphical desktop interfaces\">\nFile:GNOME 3.32.1.png|[[GNOME]]\nFile:KDE Plasma 5.16.png|[[KDE Plasma 5]]\nFile:Cinnamon 4.2.3 screenshot.png|[[Cinnamon (Desktop Environment)|Cinnamon]]\nFile:Ubuntu Mate 18.04.1 with MATE 1.20.1.png|[[Mate desktop|Mate]]\nFile:Scrivania di elementary OS 5.0 Juno.png|[[Pantheon (desktop environment)|Pantheon]]\nFile:Budgie Desktop Environment.png|[[Budgie (desktop environment)|Budgie]]\nFile:XFCE-4.12-Desktop-standard.png|[[Xfce]]\nFile:Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop.png|[[Unity (user interface)|Unity]] (discontinued)\nFile:Lubuntu 13.04 English.png|[[LXDE]]\nFile:LXQt 0.10 - Ambiance.png|[[LXQt]]\nFile:I3-gaps-wiki.png|[[i3 (window manager)|i3-gaps]]\nFile:E17 bw screenshot.png|[[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]]\nFile:Fluxbox.png|[[Fluxbox]]\nFile:Sugar-home-view-0.82.jpg|[[Sugar (desktop environment)|Sugar]]\nFile:Screenshot of Trinity Desktop Environment (TDE) R14.0.5 Development.png|[[Trinity (desktop environment)|Trinity]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Netbooks ===\nLinux distributions have also become popular in the [[netbook]] market, with many devices such as the [[Asus Eee PC]] and [[Aspire One|Acer Aspire One]] shipping with customized Linux distributions installed.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/28/netbooks-sales | title=Are netbooks losing their shine? | accessdate=June 2, 2010 | location=London | date=May 28, 2009 | work=The Guardian | first=Jack | last=Schofield | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221110306/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/28/netbooks-sales | archivedate=December 21, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Google announced its [[Chrome&nbsp;OS]] as a minimal Linux-based operating system, using the [[Chrome browser]] as the main user interface.

There are two main methods for creating a specialized Linux distribution: building from scratch or from a general-purpose distribution as a base. The distributions often used for this purpose include [[Debian]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] (which is itself based on Debian), [[Arch Linux]], [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], and [[Slackware]]. In contrast, Linux distributions built from scratch do not have general-purpose bases; instead, they focus on the [[JeOS]] philosophy by including only necessary components and avoiding [[System resource|resource]] overhead caused by components considered redundant in the distribution's use cases.\n\n==== Home theater PC ====\nA [[home theater PC]] (HTPC) is a PC that is mainly used as an entertainment system, especially a [[home theater system]]. It is normally connected to a television, and often an additional audio system.\n\n[[OpenELEC]], a Linux distribution that incorporates the media center software [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]], is an OS tuned specifically for an HTPC. Having been built from the ground up adhering to the JeOS principle, the OS is very lightweight and very suitable for the confined usage range of an HTPC.\n\nThere are also special editions of Linux distributions that include the [[MythTV]] media center software, such as [[Mythbuntu]], a special edition of Ubuntu.\n\n==== Digital security ====\n[[Kali Linux]] is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed for [[digital forensics]] and [[penetration test]]ing. It comes preinstalled with several software applications for penetration testing and identifying [[Exploit (computer security)|security exploits]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://docs.kali.org/introduction/what-is-kali-linux|title = What is Kali Linux?|accessdate = June 13, 2014|website = Kali Linux|publisher = |url-status=live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140527164453/http://docs.kali.org/introduction/what-is-kali-linux|archivedate = May 27, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The Ubuntu derivative [[BackBox]] provides pre-installed security and network analysis tools for ethical hacking. <br />The Arch-based [[BlackArch]] includes over 2100 tools for pentesting and security researching.<ref name=\"blackarch\">{{cite web|url=https://blackarch.org/index.html|title=BlackArch Linux - Penetration Testing Distribution|last=|first=|date=|website=BlackArch Linux|accessdate=April 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are many Linux distributions created with privacy, secrecy, network anonymity and information security in mind, including [[Tails (operating system)|Tails]], [[Tin Hat Linux]] and [[Tinfoil Hat Linux]]. [[Lightweight Portable Security]] is a distribution based on Arch Linux and developed by the [[United States Department of Defense]]. [[Tor-ramdisk]] is a minimal distribution created solely to host the network anonymity software [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].\n\n==== System rescue ====\nLinux [[Live CD]] sessions have long been used as a tool for recovering data from a broken computer system and for repairing the system. Building upon that idea, several Linux distributions tailored for this purpose have emerged, most of which use [[GParted]] as a partition editor, with additional data recovery and system repair software:\n* [[Gparted live|GParted Live]]{{snd}} a Debian-based distribution developed by the GParted project.\n* [[Parted Magic]]{{snd}} a commercial Linux distribution.\n* [[SystemRescueCD]]{{snd}} an Arch-based distribution with support for editing Windows [[Windows Registry|registry]].\n\n==== In space ====\n[[SpaceX]] uses multiple redundant [[:Category:Avionics computers|flight computers]] in a [[fault-tolerant design]] in its [[Falcon&nbsp;9]] rocket. Each Merlin engine is controlled by three [[Voting logic|voting]] computers, with two physical processors per computer that constantly check each other's operation. Linux is not inherently fault-tolerant (no operating system is, as it is a function of the whole system including the hardware), but the flight computer software makes it so for its purpose.<ref name=aw20121118/> For flexibility, [[commercial off-the-shelf]] parts and system-wide \"radiation-tolerant\" design are used instead of [[radiation hardened]] parts.<ref name=aw20121118>{{cite news|last=Svitak |first=Amy |title=Dragon's \"Radiation-Tolerant\" Design |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog%3a04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&plckPostId=Blog%3a04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post%3aa8b87703-93f9-4cdf-885f-9429605e14df |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=November 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203204735/http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog%3A04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&plckPostId=Blog%3A04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post%3Aa8b87703-93f9-4cdf-885f-9429605e14df |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> {{As of|July 2019}}, SpaceX has conducted over [[List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches|76 launches]] of the Falcon&nbsp;9 since 2010, out of which all but one have successfully delivered their primary payloads to the intended [[orbit]], and plans to use it to transport astronauts to the [[International Space Station]].\n\nWindows was deployed as the operating system on non-mission critical laptops used on the space station, but it was later replaced with Linux.

They also include tools for administering and building school computer labs and computer-based classrooms, such as the [[Linux Terminal Server Project]] (LTSP).\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Instant WebKiosk]] and [[Webconverger]] are browser-based Linux distributions often used in web [[Interactive kiosk|kiosks]] and [[digital signage]]. [[Thinstation]] is a minimalist distribution designed for [[thin client]]s. [[Rocks Cluster Distribution]] is tailored for [[HPCC|high-performance computing clusters]].\n\nThere are general-purpose Linux distributions that target a specific audience, such as users of a specific language or geographical area. Such examples include [[Ubuntu Kylin]] for Chinese language users and BlankOn targeted at Indonesians. Profession-specific distributions include [[Ubuntu Studio]] for media creation and [[DNALinux]] for [[bioinformatics]]. There is also a Muslim-oriented distribution of the name [[Sabily]] that consequently also provides some Islamic tools. Certain organizations use slightly specialized Linux distributions internally, including [[GendBuntu]] used by the French [[National Gendarmerie]], [[Goobuntu]] used internally by Google, and [[Astra Linux]] developed specifically for the Russian army.\n\n== Market share and uptake ==\n{{Main|Linux adoption}}\n{{See also|Usage share of operating systems}}\n\nMany quantitative studies of [[free software|free]]/open-source software focus on topics including market share and reliability, with numerous studies specifically examining Linux.<ref>{{cite web | first = David A | last = Wheeler | url = http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html | title = Why Open Source Software/Free Software (OSS/FS)?

The current house was built in 1859 by [[George Layman|George Layman Jr.]], one year after the original house built in 1837 by his father, George Layman Sr., was destroyed by fire. The dairy and kitchen survived the fire because they were separate from the house. Stables and a blacksmith workshop were later additions to the farm. In the 1870s, when the lack of a school in Wonnerup was an issue for the local residents, George Layman Jr. donated land near Wonnerup House for a school, which was built in 1873. In 1885 a teacher's house was constructed. The precinct was purchased by the [[National Trust of Australia]] in 1971 and opened to the public in 1973.\n\nThe name Wonnerup comes from the Nyungar term.

Van Diemen's Land was initially a [[penal colony]], but became a colony in its own right in 1824.

The current house was built in 1859 by [[George Layman|George Layman Jr.]], one year after the original house built in 1837 by his father, George Layman Sr., was destroyed by fire. The dairy and kitchen survived the fire because they were separate from the house. Stables and a blacksmith workshop were later additions to the farm. In the 1870s, when the lack of a school in Wonnerup was an issue for the local residents, George Layman Jr. donated land near Wonnerup House for a school, which was built in 1873. In 1885 a teacher's house was constructed. The precinct was purchased by the [[National Trust of Australia]] in 1971 and opened to the public in 1973.\n\nThe name Wonnerup comes from the Nyungar term.

The event, consisting of an eponymous [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and numerous tie-in books, involves the return of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] and the subsequent war between the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[X-Men]]. The 12-issue twice-monthly series was first published in April 2012, and features a storyline by [[Jason Aaron]], [[Brian Michael Bendis]], [[Ed Brubaker]], [[Jonathan Hickman]] and [[Matt Fraction]], with a rotating team of artists including [[John Romita Jr.]], [[Olivier Coipel]] and [[Adam Kubert]].\n\nThe event was preceded by the four-issue limited series ''Avengers: X-Sanction'' by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Ed McGuinness]] and ''Avengers vs. X-Men #0''. ''Avengers vs. X-Men'' also ties into the limited series ''AVX: VS'', described as \"the fight book\" which expands upon many of the one-on-one battles featured in the main series, the [[digital comics|digital series]]; ''Avengers vs. X-Men: Infinite'', and into a number of [[ongoing series]] including ''Avengers'', ''[[Avengers Academy]]'', ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'', ''[[Secret Avengers]]'', ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (comics)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' and ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]''.

The series focuses on the return of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]], the cosmic entity of death and rebirth, as it looks for its new host, believed to be the teenage mutant [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], who will possess all of its power. [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and the other X-Men want to protect her and prepare her as if she's to be the mutant savior, while [[Captain America]] and the Avengers want her handed over to them so they can figure out what to do with her and keep the world safe from a potentially deadly fate. Brubaker described the series as \"...one of those legendary ideas: What if the Avengers fought the X-Men?\". Marvel's [[editor-in-chief]] [[Axel Alonso]] said \"You've got two populations whose motivations are simple and understandable and defensible. That's part of the beauty of this.

In the series, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] learns something's going to happen to his daughter, Hope Summers, and he has been tipped off that the Avengers are responsible. So he targets them one by one starting with their leader, Captain America. Loeb said \"It's a story about a father and what he's willing to do in order to protect his family.

Bendis wrote ''[[Avengers: Disassembled]]'', where Scarlet Witch lost control of her magical powers and turned on the Avengers which led to the alternate-reality event series, ''[[House of M]]'' and her depowering of most of the mutant population. Bendis said in the series, \"[Scarlet Witch is] faced with a situation that could either redeem her, which would be crazy awesome, or make things worse, depending on the choices she makes and the sides she takes and the moments she chooses to interact with the story... Now Hope [Summers] is the same way but there's kind of a flip: She has everything to lose. There is something elegant in the way she's been told forever and ever, 'You're meant for something, you're meant for this, do what you're supposed to do.'

Hope Summers decides to live as a normal teenager, while Iron Man and [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]] search for Magneto to no avail.

At the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, Magik informs Storm of Colossus's whereabouts, while Hope adjusts to life at a normal high school but still feels the need to search for Cable. In prison, Cyclops easily defeats his three attackers, due to his martial arts training, and rejects an offer to break him out, choosing instead to remain a political prisoner and not becoming a common criminal.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Gillen, Kieron |penciller=Eaton, Scot |inker=Hennessy, Andrew |colorist=Charalampidis, Jim |title=AVX: Consequences |issue=3 |date=October 2012 |publisher=Marvel Comics |id=}}</ref>\n\nStorm locates Colossus in Siberia, but decides not to turn him in because of the guilt he is suffering. Magneto arrives shortly afterwards and informs Storm, that he also has decided to leave Colossus alone. In prison, Cyclops allows Iron Man to study him for remaining effects of the Phoenix Force. As he is leaving, Jake is murdered by other inmates, prompting Cyclops to take up the earlier offer to break him out of prison.<ref>{{cite comic |writer=Gillen, Kieron |penciller=Brooks, Mark |inker=Brooks, Mark; Hennessy, Andrew |colorist=Charalampidis, Jim |title=AVX: Consequences |issue=4 |date=October 2012 |publisher=Marvel Comics |id=}}</ref>\n\nMagneto, Magik and Danger break Cyclops out of prison but not before Cyclops has Magik send Jake's murderers to limbo and has Danger disfigure the warden's face.

In response, Baby Steve assembles his fellow Avengers while Baby Scott brings together his team of X-Babies and the two teams fight in the middle of the street. After a series of turnovers, the Phoenix appears and demands that Baby Scott return Bucky Bear to Baby Steve. When he refuses, the Phoenix causes a giant explosion. The next morning, Baby Steve's parents find him sleeping peacefully with Bucky Bear, except now there is a giant hole in his room and a crater in the middle of the street.<ref>''A-Babies vs. X-Babies'' #1</ref>\n\n===''What If?''===\nAs the Phoenix Force heads towards Earth, the Guardians of the Galaxy manage to send a warning before they are destroyed by it. Having received the warning, The Avengers send a team into space as a first line of defense, while others go to Utopia to take Hope Summers, the intended host of the Phoenix Force, into custody. Upon arrival, Magneto, Hope, Namor and Storm discuss the situation with the Avengers. After a heated exchange, Wolverine attacks Namor and fatally injures Storm in the process. In retaliation, Magneto brings down the Avengers helicarrier.<ref>''What if? AVX'' #1</ref>\n\nAs the helicarrier falls, Hope, Magneto and Emma Frost leave to intercept the Phoenix Force on the Moon. In space, Thor manages to wound the Phoenix Force and it offers the remaining Avengers its gift but then senses Hope and merges with her instead, transforming Hope into Phoenix.<ref>''What if?

After Emma warns X-Men and The Avengers, Black Panther attempts an unsuccessful suicide attack on Hope and Magneto. Hope kills Emma for her betrayal and sends a meteor shower to Earth, destroying major cities. Hope and Magneto then confront the other X-Men, offering to spare their lives if they join them.<ref>''What if? AVX'' #3</ref>\n\nThe X-Men and The Avengers attack Hope and Magneto. As the battle continues, the power starts overwhelming Hope and she begs Magneto for help. Magneto kills Hope and the power transfers to him. However, Wolverine manages to stab Magneto in the brain, killing him instantly. As all the others die, Wolverine is saved by Jean Grey, who returns as the White Phoenix.

The event, consisting of an eponymous [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and numerous tie-in books, involves the return of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] and the subsequent war between the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[X-Men]]. The 12-issue twice-monthly series was first published in April 2012, and features a storyline by [[Jason Aaron]], [[Brian Michael Bendis]], [[Ed Brubaker]], [[Jonathan Hickman]] and [[Matt Fraction]], with a rotating team of artists including [[John Romita Jr.]], [[Olivier Coipel]] and [[Adam Kubert]].\n\nThe event was preceded by the four-issue limited series ''Avengers: X-Sanction'' by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Ed McGuinness]] and ''Avengers vs. X-Men #0''. ''Avengers vs. X-Men'' also ties into the limited series ''AVX: VS'', described as \"the fight book\" which expands upon many of the one-on-one battles featured in the main series, the [[digital comics|digital series]]; ''Avengers vs. X-Men: Infinite'', and into a number of [[ongoing series]] including ''Avengers'', ''[[Avengers Academy]]'', ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'', ''[[Secret Avengers]]'', ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (comics)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' and ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]''. The event was succeeded by the limited series ''AvX: Consequences''.\n\nDespite receiving mixed reviews from critics, ''Avengers vs. X-Men'' was a commercial success that topped the comic-book sales charts from April to October 2012. The repercussions of the storyline resulted in the new status quos of the [[Marvel Universe]] presented in the company's [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch initiative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/19008/marvel_now |title=Marvel NOW! |last=Morse |first=Ben |date=5 July 2012 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |accessdate=7 August 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BlCSSS3e?url=http://marvel.com/news/story/19008/marvel_now |archive-date=28 October 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nIn December 2011, Marvel Comics announced the launch of ''Avengers vs. X-Men'', a 12-issue twice-monthly series featuring writers [[Brian Michael Bendis]], [[Jason Aaron]], [[Ed Brubaker]], [[Jonathan Hickman]] and [[Matt Fraction]], debuting in April 2012. The series focuses on the return of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]], the cosmic entity of death and rebirth, as it looks for its new host, believed to be the teenage mutant [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], who will possess all of its power.

In response, Baby Steve assembles his fellow Avengers while Baby Scott brings together his team of X-Babies and the two teams fight in the middle of the street. After a series of turnovers, the Phoenix appears and demands that Baby Scott return Bucky Bear to Baby Steve. When he refuses, the Phoenix causes a giant explosion. The next morning, Baby Steve's parents find him sleeping peacefully with Bucky Bear, except now there is a giant hole in his room and a crater in the middle of the street.<ref>''A-Babies vs. X-Babies'' #1</ref>\n\n===''What If?''===\nAs the Phoenix Force heads towards Earth, the Guardians of the Galaxy manage to send a warning before they are destroyed by it. Having received the warning, The Avengers send a team into space as a first line of defense, while others go to Utopia to take Hope Summers, the intended host of the Phoenix Force, into custody. Upon arrival, Magneto, Hope, Namor and Storm discuss the situation with the Avengers. After a heated exchange, Wolverine attacks Namor and fatally injures Storm in the process. In retaliation, Magneto brings down the Avengers helicarrier.<ref>''What if? AVX'' #1</ref>\n\nAs the helicarrier falls, Hope, Magneto and Emma Frost leave to intercept the Phoenix Force on the Moon. In space, Thor manages to wound the Phoenix Force and it offers the remaining Avengers its gift but then senses Hope and merges with her instead, transforming Hope into Phoenix.<ref>''What if? AVX'' #2</ref>\n\nOnce the transformation is complete, Hope sends The Avengers back to Earth while she considers her options. Magneto convinces Hope that humans are a threat, over Emma's protests. After Emma warns X-Men and The Avengers, Black Panther attempts an unsuccessful suicide attack on Hope and Magneto. Hope kills Emma for her betrayal and sends a meteor shower to Earth, destroying major cities. Hope and Magneto then confront the other X-Men, offering to spare their lives if they join them.<ref>''What if? AVX'' #3</ref>\n\nThe X-Men and The Avengers attack Hope and Magneto. As the battle continues, the power starts overwhelming Hope and she begs Magneto for help. Magneto kills Hope and the power transfers to him. However, Wolverine manages to stab Magneto in the brain, killing him instantly. As all the others die, Wolverine is saved by Jean Grey, who returns as the White Phoenix. Jean takes Wolverine into a time bubble and together they watch as life is slowly restored.<ref>''What if?
