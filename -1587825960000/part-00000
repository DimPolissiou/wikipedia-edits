He publicly spoke out against renowned scientists [[Qian Xuesen]], condemning the latter's support for Qigong-related research. He advocated for a stronger role for state control in science.

In the interview He stated that the progression of history, more 'advanced' forms of thinking will always replace 'backward' forms, and asserted that TCM is 'backward'. He called the fundamental system of TCM, i.e., the belief in [[yin-yang]] and [[Wu Xing]] (Five phases), totally \"unscientific.\" He said that the increased adoption of modern medicine vis-a-vis TCM is evidence that the latter is going to be eventually 'eliminated' from practice.

He called the fundamental system of TCM, i.e., the belief in [[yin-yang]] and [[Wu Xing]] (Five phases), totally \"unscientific.\" He said that the increased adoption of modern medicine vis-a-vis TCM is evidence that the latter is going to be eventually 'eliminated' from practice.

In the original trilogy, he is a mentor to [[Luke Skywalker]], to whom he introduces the ways of the [[Jedi]]. After sacrificing himself in a duel against [[Darth Vader]], Kenobi guides Luke alongside [[Yoda]] in his fight against the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. In the prequel trilogy, set decades earlier, he is initially a Padawan (apprentice) to [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and later the mentor and friend to Luke's father Anakin, who falls to the [[dark side of the Force]] and becomes Vader. The character briefly appears in the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] as a disembodied voice, speaking to [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]]. He is frequently featured as a main character in various other ''Star Wars'' media.\n\nGuinness' performance as Obi-Wan in the original [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']] (1977){{EpIV}} earned him a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], the only acting nomination for a ''Star Wars'' film. McGregor's performance as the character in the prequels received praise as well, considered to be among the highlights of the usually criticized trilogy. McGregor is set to return as Kenobi in an untitled web series on [[Disney+]] centered on the character that takes place some years after ''Revenge of the Sith'' and prior to ''A New Hope''.

Leia asks him to deliver R2-D2 and the plans safely to the planet [[Alderaan]] in order to help the [[Rebel Alliance]].\n\nObi-Wan reveals to Luke his true identity and explains that he is a [[Jedi]], a member of an ancient group of [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]]-sensitive warriors. He explains that the Jedi were hunted down and exterminated by the Empire with help from his former apprentice, [[Darth Vader]] (portrayed by [[David Prowse]], voiced by [[James Earl Jones]]), the apparent killer of Luke's father. He gives Luke his father's [[lightsaber]] and asks him to accompany him to Alderaan and take up Jedi training. Luke, at first, declines; but after finding that his aunt [[Beru Lars|Beru]] ([[Shelagh Fraser]]) and uncle [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Phil Brown (actor)|Phil Brown]]) have been killed by [[Imperial stormtroopers]], he realizes he must go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan and to train as a Jedi.\n\nAt the settlement of [[Mos Eisley]], Obi-Wan [[Jedi mind trick|uses the Force]] to trick Imperial troops into letting them through a military checkpoint. They enter a local [[cantina]] and meet smuggler [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) alongside the Wookiee [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]). Obi-Wan and Luke make a deal to travel to Alderaan aboard their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. During the mission, Obi-Wan begins instructing Luke in lightsaber combat. He suddenly becomes worried and tells Luke of \"a great disturbance in the Force\". Emerging from hyperspace, the group discovers that the planet [[Alderaan]] has been destroyed by the Empire.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' then encounters an Imperial [[TIE Fighter]]. They chase the TIE fighter to the Death Star, and subsequently get caught in the space station's tractor beam. On board the Death Star, Obi-Wan ventures through and disables tractor beam, but not before long, Darth Vader confronts him, and they engage in a lightsaber duel. Obi-Wan uses the duel to distract Vader as Luke, Leia, Han and Chewbacca escape to the ''Falcon''. Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down and his body mysteriously vanishes the moment he dies. At the climax of the film, during the [[Battle of Yavin|Rebel attack on the Death Star]], Obi-Wan speaks to Luke through the Force to help him destroy the Imperial station.\n\nIn ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Obi-Wan Kenobi appears several times as a [[Force ghost|spirit]] through the Force. On the ice planet [[Hoth]], he appears to instruct Luke to go to the planet [[Dagobah]] to find the exiled Jedi Master [[Yoda]] ([[Frank Oz]]). Despite Yoda's skepticism, Obi-Wan convinces his old master to continue Luke's training. Obi-Wan appears later to beseech Luke not to leave Dagobah to try to rescue his friends on Cloud City, although Luke ignores this advice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back.html |title=Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back Script at IMSDb |publisher=Imdsb.com |date= |accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', Obi-Wan again appears to Luke after Yoda's death on Dagobah. Obi-Wan acknowledges that Darth Vader is indeed Luke's father, revealed by Vader himself in the previous film and confirmed by Yoda on his deathbed, and also reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister. He urges Luke to confront and defeat Vader; Luke once more rejects his advice. After the Rebels destroy the second Death Star and defeat the Empire, Obi-Wan appears at the celebration on [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]], alongside the spirits of Yoda and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker ([[Sebastian Shaw (actor)|Sebastian Shaw]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi.html |title=Star Wars: Return of the Jedi Script at IMSDb |publisher=Imsdb.com |date=1981-12-01 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref>\n\n====Prequel trilogy (1999\u20132005)====\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'', set 32 years before the original 1977 film, a 25-year-old Obi-Wan Kenobi appears as a Padawan of Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] ([[Liam Neeson]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Phantom Menace Script |url=http://www.blueharvest.net/scoops/pm-script.shtml |website=Blueharvest.net |accessdate=October 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918054250/http://www.blueharvest.net/scoops/pm-script.shtml |archivedate=September 18, 2008 |df= }}</ref>{{efn|Some fans have pointed out that Obi-Wan's age in the prequels contradicts his elderly appearance in the original trilogy.

Anakin Skywalker, by now a Jedi Knight, remains Obi-Wan's partner, and the two have become war heroes and best friends. The film opens with the two on a rescue mission to save the kidnapped [[Palpatine|Supreme Chancellor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) from cyborg Separatist commander [[General Grievous]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]) onboard his cruiser. Dooku duels the Jedi once again, knocking Obi-Wan unconscious; while Obi-Wan is out cold, Anakin defeats Dooku and reluctantly executes him on Palpatine's orders. Soon after returning to Coruscant, Obi-Wan travels to planet [[Utapau (Star Wars)|Utapau]] to track down Grievous.\n\nAfter finding the Separatist encampment, Obi-Wan fights Grievous and kills him with an abandoned blaster. When Palpatine\u2014who is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the mastermind of the war\u2014issues [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]] to have the clone troopers turn on the Jedi, Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes, rendezvousing with Yoda and Senator [[Bail Organa]] ([[Jimmy Smits]]) of Alderaan aboard Organa's ship, ''[[Tantive IV]]''. Returning to Coruscant, he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the [[Jedi Temple]] has been killed. After sending a beacon to all surviving Jedi to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding, a distraught Obi-Wan watches security footage revealing that it was Anakin\u2014who is now Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader\u2014who led the chaos. Yoda says that he will confront Sidious, and charges Obi-Wan with battling Anakin. Obi-Wan is loath to fight his best friend, but reluctantly accepts when Yoda says that Anakin no longer exists, having been \u201cconsumed\u201d by Vader.\n\nObi-Wan visits Padm\u00e9 to question of Anakin's whereabouts, and realizes that Anakin is her husband and the father of her unborn child. When Padm\u00e9 sets out to the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]] to confront her husband herself, Obi-Wan secretly stows away aboard her ship. After they arrive on Mustafar, Obi-Wan reveals himself and confronts his longtime apprentice, who accuses Padm\u00e9 and Obi-Wan of conspiring against him and uses the dark side to choke Padm\u00e9 into unconsciousness. After a long and ferocious lightsaber duel, Obi-Wan defeats Anakin by severing his legs and left arm; as Anakin is immolated and mutilated by the bank of a lava river, Obi-Wan takes his former friend's lightsaber and leaves Mustafar with C-3PO, R2-D2, and a fainted Padm\u00e9. Unbeknownst to Obi-Wan, Anakin is rescued by Palpatine and reconstructed into the cyborg as first seen in the original trilogy.\n\nObi-Wan takes Padm\u00e9 to the asteroid Polis Massa, where she dies after giving birth to twins Luke and Leia.

The ''Jedi Apprentice'' books follow his adventures as Qui-Gon's Padawan. Notable events in the series include battling the Dark Jedi Xanatos and going on his first independent mission. The ''Jedi Quest'' books detail his adventures with Anakin in the years leading up to ''Attack of the Clones''.\n\nHis heroism just before and during the Clone Wars is portrayed in novels such as ''[[Outbound Flight]]'', ''[[The Approaching Storm]]'', and ''[[The Cestus Deception]]''.\n\nObi-Wan's life between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''A New Hope'' is portrayed mostly in [[Jude Watson]]'s ''[[The Last of the Jedi]]'' series. Set roughly a year after the fall of the Republic, the series follows Obi-Wan as he seeks out possible survivors of the [[Great Jedi Purge]], most notably Anakin's former rival, Ferus Olin. The books also portray Obi-Wan adjusting to life as a hermit on Tatooine and quietly watching over Luke. He also discovers that Vader is still alive after seeing him on the Holonet, the galaxy's official news source.\n\nObi-Wan appears in the final chapter of ''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]'', set just after the events in ''Revenge of the Sith'', in which he learns that Vader survived their duel on Mustafar.\n\nObi-Wan appears in spirit form in many novels set after ''Return of the Jedi''. In ''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'', he appears to Luke to warn him about the threat presented by the Ssi-ruuk; in ''[[The Lost City of the Jedi]]'', he guides Luke to the titular city on [[Yavin IV]]; in ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'', meanwhile, he bids farewell to Luke, explaining that he must abandon his spiritual form to \"move on\" to a new, higher plane of [[consciousness]]. Before parting, Luke says that Obi-Wan was like a father to him, and Obi-Wan replies that he loved Luke like a son.\n\n====Video games====\nObi-Wan Kenobi appears in several video games. He is a playable character in all four ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Video Game|Lego Star Wars]]'' [[video game]]s, as well as ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Battlefront II]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron|Renegade Squadron]]''. He is also the lead character in ''[[Star Wars: Obi-Wan]]''. The older version is only playable in ''[[Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]]'' and ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (video game)|Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' multiplayer mode and [[Death Star]] bonus mission ''[[Star Wars: Renegade Squadron]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'' in multiplayer mode and the droid [[PROXY]] disguises as him. He also appears in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 Jedi Alliance]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Power Battles]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 Lightsaber Duels]]'' as a playable character. He is also playable in the strategy game ''Star Wars: Empire at War''. He is a playable character in ''Disney Infinity 3.0''. Kenobi is also a playable character as part of the Clone Wars season for ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Alex |last=Kane|title=Obi-Wan Kenobi, General Grievous, Anakin Skywalker Coming to \u2018Battlefront II\u2019 |url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/clone-wars-battlefront-ii-1202838716/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC.]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 9, 2018 |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/star-wars/255307/star-wars-battlefront-2-new-clone-wars-content-and-heroes-coming-to-game |title=Star Wars Battlefront 2: New Clone Wars Content and Heroes Coming to Game |website=[[Den of Geek]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|location=New York City|date=June 9, 2018 |access-date=June 10, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n====Comic books====\nIssue #24 of Marvel's [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|1977 ''Star Wars'' comic]] depicts Obi-Wan during the time of the Republic.\n\nVarious [[Dark Horse Comics]] works utilize Kenobi, including [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)#Comics|several set during the Clone Wars]]. In ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' (1998\u20132006), Obi-Wan fights the Separatists during the Clone Wars. Among other notable storylines, he is kidnapped and tortured by Asajj Ventress before being rescued by Anakin (\"Hate & Fear\"), and apprehends corrupted Jedi Master [[Quinlan Vos]] (\"The Dreadnaughts of Rendili\"). Throughout the series, he grows increasingly wary of Palpatine's designs on the Republic and his influence on Anakin.\n\nIn the non-canon story \"Old Wounds\", published in ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'' (2005) and set a few years after the events of ''Revenge of the Sith'', Obi-Wan confronts Darth Maul on Tatooine to protect Luke. The duel ends when Owen Lars shoots and kills Maul; he then warns Obi-Wan to stay away from his nephew. Through the Force, Obi-Wan reassures Luke that he will be there for him when needed.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nThe character is loosely inspired by General Makabe Rokur\u014dta, a character from [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', played by [[Toshiro Mifune]] (whom series creator [[George Lucas]] also considered casting as Obi-Wan).<ref>{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Enk|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/seven-samurai-star-toshiro-mifune-face-darth-vader-202128282.html|title='Seven Samurai' star Toshiro Mifune: The would-be face of Darth Vader?|website=[[Yahoo.com]]|date=January 14, 2013|accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine parodied the original film under the title ''Star Roars'' and included a character named 'Oldie Von Moldie', a grizzled 97-year-old whose lightsaber runs on an extension cord. The [[Shanghai]] [[nightclub]] shown in the beginning of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' is called \"Club Obi Wan\" (Lucas wrote both the ''Star Wars'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series). A real bar/club by this name existed in the [[Xihai District, Beijing|Xihai]] district of [[Beijing]], [[China]] but closed in the summer of 2010. ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'' episode \"Star Koopa\" (a spoof of ''Star Wars'') also had its own parody of Obi-Wan called 'Obi-Wan Toadi', and the live-action segment \"Zenned Out Mario\" featured a parody called \"Obi-Wan Cannoli\". The 1998 ''[[Animaniacs]]'' episode \"Star Warners\" (which spoofed ''Star Wars'') featured [[Slappy Squirrel]] portraying a parody of Obi-Wan as 'Slappy Wanna Nappy'. In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]\", Obi-Wan Kenobi is parodied by the character [[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]. In the short film ''[[Thumb Wars]]'', Obi-Wan is parodied as the character \"Oobedoob Benubi\". In the film, his full name is 'Oobedoob Scooby-Doobi Benubi, the silliest name in the galaxy.' In the 1977 ''Star Wars'' parody ''[[Hardware Wars]]'', Obi-Wan is parodied by the character \"Augie Ben Doggie\".\n\nThe [[TV Tropes]] website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheObiWan |title=The Obi Wan - Television Tropes & Idioms |publisher=[[TV Tropes]] |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2010}}</ref> uses Obi-Wan's name for the [[Elderly martial arts master|archetype mentor figure]].\n\nGuinness received an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] nomination for his portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nIn the parody song \"[[The Saga Begins]]\", released approximately one month after the release of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'', [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] sings a humorous summary of the plot of that film from Obi-Wan's perspective, to the tune of the song \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\".\n\nIn 2003, the [[American Film Institute]] selected Obi-Wan Kenobi as the [[AFI's 100 Years\u2026100 Heroes and Villains|37th greatest movie hero of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains |publisher=afi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807135547/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df= }}</ref> He was also listed as [[IGN]]'s third greatest ''Star Wars'' character,<ref>{{cite web|title=Obi-Wan Kenobi is #3.|url=https://www.ign.com/star-wars-characters/3.html|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=San Francisco, California|accessdate=December 6, 2010}}</ref> as well as one of [[UGO Networks]]'s favorite heroes of all time.<ref name=\"UGO Heroes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/best-heroes-of-all-time?page=7 |title=Best Heroes of All Time |author=UGO Team |date=January 21, 2010 |work=[[UGO Networks]] |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221015640/http://www.ugo.com/games/best-heroes-of-all-time?page=7 |archivedate=February 21, 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the Council of the Commune Lubicz in [[Poland]] passed a resolution giving the name \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" to one of the streets in [[Grabowiec, Toru\u0144 County|Grabowiec]], a small village near [[Toru\u0144]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWpWR56qtwc|title=Gerald Home and Lucasfilm's letter to BFSW|publisher=YouTube|date=2008-05-13|accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref> The street was named in 2005.

In the later-released [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]], a younger version of the character serves as one of the main [[protagonist]]s alongside [[Anakin Skywalker]] and is portrayed by Scottish actor [[Ewan McGregor]]. In the original trilogy, he is a mentor to [[Luke Skywalker]], to whom he introduces the ways of the [[Jedi]]. After sacrificing himself in a duel against [[Darth Vader]], Kenobi guides Luke alongside [[Yoda]] in his fight against the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. In the prequel trilogy, set decades earlier, he is initially a Padawan (apprentice) to [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and later the mentor and friend to Luke's father Anakin, who falls to the [[dark side of the Force]] and becomes Vader. The character briefly appears in the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] as a disembodied voice, speaking to [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]]. He is frequently featured as a main character in various other ''Star Wars'' media.\n\nGuinness' performance as Obi-Wan in the original [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']] (1977){{EpIV}} earned him a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], the only acting nomination for a ''Star Wars'' film. McGregor's performance as the character in the prequels received praise as well, considered to be among the highlights of the usually criticized trilogy. McGregor is set to return as Kenobi in an untitled web series on [[Disney+]] centered on the character that takes place some years after ''Revenge of the Sith'' and prior to ''A New Hope''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Skywalker saga===\n{{main|Skywalker saga}}\n\n====Original trilogy (1977\u20131983)====\n[[File:Star Wars and the Power of Costume July 2018 02 (Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi robes from Episode IV).jpg|thumb|Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi robes from ''Episode IV'']]\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi is first introduced in the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''{{EpIV}} living as a [[hermit]] by the name of Ben Kenobi on the planet [[Tatooine]].{{efn|In an early draft of the film, his first meeting with Luke is lifted directly from ''[[The Hobbit]]'', acknowledging [[Gandalf]] as a source of inspiration.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Chris|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|year=2015|publisher=Performing Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uG0uCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT96|page=96}}</ref>}} The family of [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) purchases two droids, [[C-3PO]] ([[Anthony Daniels]]) and [[R2-D2]] ([[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]]), the former of whom is able to speak English to communicate with Luke, while the latter can only communicate through beeps understood only by C-3PO. C-3PO explains to Luke that R2-D2 claims to have belonged to a man named Obi-Wan Kenobi, although C-3PO does not remember this and does not know what R2-D2 is talking about. Luke, recognizing the surname, makes the connection to Ben Kenobi, and begins to wonder if the two are related, or the same person. When Luke and C-3PO travel the desert in search of the lost [[R2-D2]], Obi-Wan rescues them from a band of [[Tusken Raider]]s. At Obi-Wan's home, the now-found R2-D2 plays a recording of [[Princess Leia]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]) saying that R2-D2 contains the plans for the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire's]] superweapon: the [[Death Star]]. Leia asks him to deliver R2-D2 and the plans safely to the planet [[Alderaan]] in order to help the [[Rebel Alliance]].\n\nObi-Wan reveals to Luke his true identity and explains that he is a [[Jedi]], a member of an ancient group of [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]]-sensitive warriors. He explains that the Jedi were hunted down and exterminated by the Empire with help from his former apprentice, [[Darth Vader]] (portrayed by [[David Prowse]], voiced by [[James Earl Jones]]), the apparent killer of Luke's father. He gives Luke his father's [[lightsaber]] and asks him to accompany him to Alderaan and take up Jedi training. Luke, at first, declines; but after finding that his aunt [[Beru Lars|Beru]] ([[Shelagh Fraser]]) and uncle [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Phil Brown (actor)|Phil Brown]]) have been killed by [[Imperial stormtroopers]], he realizes he must go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan and to train as a Jedi.\n\nAt the settlement of [[Mos Eisley]], Obi-Wan [[Jedi mind trick|uses the Force]] to trick Imperial troops into letting them through a military checkpoint. They enter a local [[cantina]] and meet smuggler [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) alongside the Wookiee [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]). Obi-Wan and Luke make a deal to travel to Alderaan aboard their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. During the mission, Obi-Wan begins instructing Luke in lightsaber combat. He suddenly becomes worried and tells Luke of \"a great disturbance in the Force\". Emerging from hyperspace, the group discovers that the planet [[Alderaan]] has been destroyed by the Empire.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' then encounters an Imperial [[TIE Fighter]]. They chase the TIE fighter to the Death Star, and subsequently get caught in the space station's tractor beam. On board the Death Star, Obi-Wan ventures through and disables tractor beam, but not before long, Darth Vader confronts him, and they engage in a lightsaber duel. Obi-Wan uses the duel to distract Vader as Luke, Leia, Han and Chewbacca escape to the ''Falcon''. Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down and his body mysteriously vanishes the moment he dies. At the climax of the film, during the [[Battle of Yavin|Rebel attack on the Death Star]], Obi-Wan speaks to Luke through the Force to help him destroy the Imperial station.\n\nIn ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Obi-Wan Kenobi appears several times as a [[Force ghost|spirit]] through the Force. On the ice planet [[Hoth]], he appears to instruct Luke to go to the planet [[Dagobah]] to find the exiled Jedi Master [[Yoda]] ([[Frank Oz]]). Despite Yoda's skepticism, Obi-Wan convinces his old master to continue Luke's training. Obi-Wan appears later to beseech Luke not to leave Dagobah to try to rescue his friends on Cloud City, although Luke ignores this advice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back.html |title=Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back Script at IMSDb |publisher=Imdsb.com |date= |accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', Obi-Wan again appears to Luke after Yoda's death on Dagobah. Obi-Wan acknowledges that Darth Vader is indeed Luke's father, revealed by Vader himself in the previous film and confirmed by Yoda on his deathbed, and also reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister. He urges Luke to confront and defeat Vader; Luke once more rejects his advice.

Their ship is damaged in the escape, causing the hyperdrive generator to malfunction, and they land on Tatooine, where they discover the nine-year-old slave [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] ([[Jake Lloyd]]).

When Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan storms in to duel Maul, who nearly kills him. However, Obi-Wan manages to turn the tables and defeat Maul, slicing him in half and sending him plunging down a vast reactor shaft. He promises to fulfill Qui-Gon's dying wish of training Anakin as a Jedi, with or without the Council's blessing.

Over the years, Anakin has grown powerful but somewhat arrogant, and believes that Obi-Wan is \"holding him back.\" After they save Padm\u00e9, now a senator, from an assassination attempt, Obi-Wan goes on a solo mission to trace the would-be assassins involved to the planet [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. He learns of a [[Clone trooper|massive clone army]] that the planet's inhabitants are building for the Republic.

Anakin Skywalker, by now a Jedi Knight, remains Obi-Wan's partner, and the two have become war heroes and best friends. The film opens with the two on a rescue mission to save the kidnapped [[Palpatine|Supreme Chancellor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) from cyborg Separatist commander [[General Grievous]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]) onboard his cruiser. Dooku duels the Jedi once again, knocking Obi-Wan unconscious; while Obi-Wan is out cold, Anakin defeats Dooku and reluctantly executes him on Palpatine's orders. Soon after returning to Coruscant, Obi-Wan travels to planet [[Utapau (Star Wars)|Utapau]] to track down Grievous.\n\nAfter finding the Separatist encampment, Obi-Wan fights Grievous and kills him with an abandoned blaster. When Palpatine\u2014who is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the mastermind of the war\u2014issues [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]] to have the clone troopers turn on the Jedi, Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes, rendezvousing with Yoda and Senator [[Bail Organa]] ([[Jimmy Smits]]) of Alderaan aboard Organa's ship, ''[[Tantive IV]]''. Returning to Coruscant, he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the [[Jedi Temple]] has been killed. After sending a beacon to all surviving Jedi to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding, a distraught Obi-Wan watches security footage revealing that it was Anakin\u2014who is now Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader\u2014who led the chaos. Yoda says that he will confront Sidious, and charges Obi-Wan with battling Anakin. Obi-Wan is loath to fight his best friend, but reluctantly accepts when Yoda says that Anakin no longer exists, having been \u201cconsumed\u201d by Vader.\n\nObi-Wan visits Padm\u00e9 to question of Anakin's whereabouts, and realizes that Anakin is her husband and the father of her unborn child. When Padm\u00e9 sets out to the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]] to confront her husband herself, Obi-Wan secretly stows away aboard her ship. After they arrive on Mustafar, Obi-Wan reveals himself and confronts his longtime apprentice, who accuses Padm\u00e9 and Obi-Wan of conspiring against him and uses the dark side to choke Padm\u00e9 into unconsciousness. After a long and ferocious lightsaber duel, Obi-Wan defeats Anakin by severing his legs and left arm; as Anakin is immolated and mutilated by the bank of a lava river, Obi-Wan takes his former friend's lightsaber and leaves Mustafar with C-3PO, R2-D2, and a fainted Padm\u00e9. Unbeknownst to Obi-Wan, Anakin is rescued by Palpatine and reconstructed into the cyborg as first seen in the original trilogy.\n\nObi-Wan takes Padm\u00e9 to the asteroid Polis Massa, where she dies after giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. Afterwards, Yoda instructs Obi-Wan to deliver Luke to Anakin\u2019s stepbrother [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Joel Edgerton]]) and his wife [[Beru Lars|Beru]] ([[Bonnie Piesse]]) at the moisture farm on Tatooine, and reveals that Qui-Gon's spirit has returned to teach him to become one with the Force after death.

The ''Jedi Apprentice'' books follow his adventures as Qui-Gon's Padawan. Notable events in the series include battling the Dark Jedi Xanatos and going on his first independent mission. The ''Jedi Quest'' books detail his adventures with Anakin in the years leading up to ''Attack of the Clones''.\n\nHis heroism just before and during the Clone Wars is portrayed in novels such as ''[[Outbound Flight]]'', ''[[The Approaching Storm]]'', and ''[[The Cestus Deception]]''.\n\nObi-Wan's life between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''A New Hope'' is portrayed mostly in [[Jude Watson]]'s ''[[The Last of the Jedi]]'' series. Set roughly a year after the fall of the Republic, the series follows Obi-Wan as he seeks out possible survivors of the [[Great Jedi Purge]], most notably Anakin's former rival, Ferus Olin. The books also portray Obi-Wan adjusting to life as a hermit on Tatooine and quietly watching over Luke. He also discovers that Vader is still alive after seeing him on the Holonet, the galaxy's official news source.\n\nObi-Wan appears in the final chapter of ''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]'', set just after the events in ''Revenge of the Sith'', in which he learns that Vader survived their duel on Mustafar.\n\nObi-Wan appears in spirit form in many novels set after ''Return of the Jedi''. In ''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'', he appears to Luke to warn him about the threat presented by the Ssi-ruuk; in ''[[The Lost City of the Jedi]]'', he guides Luke to the titular city on [[Yavin IV]]; in ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'', meanwhile, he bids farewell to Luke, explaining that he must abandon his spiritual form to \"move on\" to a new, higher plane of [[consciousness]]. Before parting, Luke says that Obi-Wan was like a father to him, and Obi-Wan replies that he loved Luke like a son.\n\n====Video games====\nObi-Wan Kenobi appears in several video games. He is a playable character in all four ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Video Game|Lego Star Wars]]'' [[video game]]s, as well as ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Battlefront II]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron|Renegade Squadron]]''. He is also the lead character in ''[[Star Wars: Obi-Wan]]''. The older version is only playable in ''[[Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]]'' and ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (video game)|Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' multiplayer mode and [[Death Star]] bonus mission ''[[Star Wars: Renegade Squadron]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'' in multiplayer mode and the droid [[PROXY]] disguises as him. He also appears in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 Jedi Alliance]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Power Battles]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 Lightsaber Duels]]'' as a playable character. He is also playable in the strategy game ''Star Wars: Empire at War''. He is a playable character in ''Disney Infinity 3.0''. Kenobi is also a playable character as part of the Clone Wars season for ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Alex |last=Kane|title=Obi-Wan Kenobi, General Grievous, Anakin Skywalker Coming to \u2018Battlefront II\u2019 |url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/clone-wars-battlefront-ii-1202838716/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC.]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 9, 2018 |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/star-wars/255307/star-wars-battlefront-2-new-clone-wars-content-and-heroes-coming-to-game |title=Star Wars Battlefront 2: New Clone Wars Content and Heroes Coming to Game |website=[[Den of Geek]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|location=New York City|date=June 9, 2018 |access-date=June 10, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n====Comic books====\nIssue #24 of Marvel's [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|1977 ''Star Wars'' comic]] depicts Obi-Wan during the time of the Republic.\n\nVarious [[Dark Horse Comics]] works utilize Kenobi, including [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)#Comics|several set during the Clone Wars]]. In ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' (1998\u20132006), Obi-Wan fights the Separatists during the Clone Wars. Among other notable storylines, he is kidnapped and tortured by Asajj Ventress before being rescued by Anakin (\"Hate & Fear\"), and apprehends corrupted Jedi Master [[Quinlan Vos]] (\"The Dreadnaughts of Rendili\"). Throughout the series, he grows increasingly wary of Palpatine's designs on the Republic and his influence on Anakin.\n\nIn the non-canon story \"Old Wounds\", published in ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'' (2005) and set a few years after the events of ''Revenge of the Sith'', Obi-Wan confronts Darth Maul on Tatooine to protect Luke. The duel ends when Owen Lars shoots and kills Maul; he then warns Obi-Wan to stay away from his nephew. Through the Force, Obi-Wan reassures Luke that he will be there for him when needed.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nThe character is loosely inspired by General Makabe Rokur\u014dta, a character from [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', played by [[Toshiro Mifune]] (whom series creator [[George Lucas]] also considered casting as Obi-Wan).<ref>{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Enk|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/seven-samurai-star-toshiro-mifune-face-darth-vader-202128282.html|title='Seven Samurai' star Toshiro Mifune: The would-be face of Darth Vader?|website=[[Yahoo.com]]|date=January 14, 2013|accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine parodied the original film under the title ''Star Roars'' and included a character named 'Oldie Von Moldie', a grizzled 97-year-old whose lightsaber runs on an extension cord. The [[Shanghai]] [[nightclub]] shown in the beginning of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' is called \"Club Obi Wan\" (Lucas wrote both the ''Star Wars'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series). A real bar/club by this name existed in the [[Xihai District, Beijing|Xihai]] district of [[Beijing]], [[China]] but closed in the summer of 2010. ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'' episode \"Star Koopa\" (a spoof of ''Star Wars'') also had its own parody of Obi-Wan called 'Obi-Wan Toadi', and the live-action segment \"Zenned Out Mario\" featured a parody called \"Obi-Wan Cannoli\". The 1998 ''[[Animaniacs]]'' episode \"Star Warners\" (which spoofed ''Star Wars'') featured [[Slappy Squirrel]] portraying a parody of Obi-Wan as 'Slappy Wanna Nappy'. In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]\", Obi-Wan Kenobi is parodied by the character [[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]. In the short film ''[[Thumb Wars]]'', Obi-Wan is parodied as the character \"Oobedoob Benubi\". In the film, his full name is 'Oobedoob Scooby-Doobi Benubi, the silliest name in the galaxy.'

{"title_page": "GNSS software-defined receiver", "text_new": "{{short description|GNSS receiver implemented in software}}\n{{distinguish|GNSS navigation software}}\nA '''software GNSS receiver''' is a [[Satellite navigation|Global Navigation Satellite System]] (GNSS) receiver that has been designed and implemented using [[software-defined radio]].\n\nA GNSS receiver, in general, is an electronic device that receives and digitally processes the signals from a navigation satellite constellation in order to provide position, velocity and time (of the receiver).\n\nGNSS receivers have been traditionally implemented in hardware: a ''hardware GNSS receiver'' is conceived as a dedicated chip that have been designed and built (from the very beginning) with the only purpose of being a GNSS receiver.\n\nIn a software GNSS receiver, all digital processing is performed by a general purpose [[microprocessor]]. In this approach, a small amount of inexpensive hardware is still needed, known as the ''[[RF front end|frontend]]'', that digitizes the signal from the satellites. The microprocessor can then work on this ''raw'' digital stream to implement the GNSS functionality.\n\n== Hardware vs. software GNSS receivers==\nWhen comparing ''hardware'' vs ''software'' GNSS receivers, a number of pros and cons can be found for each approach:\n**URL: https://www.malikanser.com\n* Hardware GNSS receivers are in general more efficient from the point of view of both computational load and power consumption since they have been designed in a highly specialized way with the only purpose of implementing the GNSS processing.\n* Software GNSS receivers allow a huge flexibility: many features of the receiver can be modified just through software. This provides the receiver with adaptive capabilities, depending on the user's needs and working conditions. In addition, the receiver can be easily upgraded via software.<ref>[http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/receiver-design/real-time-software-receivers-8812 Real-Time Software Receivers]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, GPS World, September 1, 2009 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Farine, Marcel Baracchi-Frei, Gr\u00e9goire Waelchli, Cyril Botteron</ref>\n* Under some assumptions, Software GNSS receivers can be more profitable for some applications, as long as sufficient computational power is available (and can be shared among multiple applications). For example, the microprocessor of a [[smartphone]] can be used to provide GNSS navigation with the only need of including a frontend (instead of a full, more expensive, hardware receiver).\n\nCurrently, most of the GNSS receiver market is still ''hardware''. However, there already exist operational solutions based on the software approach able to run on low-cost microprocessors. Software GNSS receivers are expected to increase their market share or even take over in the near future, following the development of the computational capabilities of the microprocessors ([[Moore's law]]).\n\n== Comparison of implementations ==\n:''This comparison is strictly about GNSS SDR; please do not include general GNSS positioning and mapping software.''\n{{Needs

For example, the microprocessor of a [[smartphone]] can be used to provide GNSS navigation with the only need of including a frontend (instead of a full, more expensive, hardware receiver).\n\nCurrently, most of the GNSS receiver market is still ''hardware''. However, there already exist operational solutions based on the software approach able to run on low-cost microprocessors. Software GNSS receivers are expected to increase their market share or even take over in the near future, following the development of the computational capabilities of the microprocessors ([[Moore's law]]).\n\n== Comparison of implementations ==\n:''This comparison is strictly about GNSS SDR; please do not include general GNSS positioning and mapping software.''\n{{Needs
