Her sister is the author Melanie Challenger.\n\nExhibited across the UK and internationally, she's been an invited speaker at the [[Women of the World Festival|Women Of The World Festival]], [[University of the Arts London|UAL]], [[Royal Holloway, University of London|RHUL]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], Oxford and Cambridge Universities. She has made documentary for the BBC,'My Male Muse' with poet Clare Pollard being chosen for Radio 4's 'Pick of the Year'. In 2017, she was invited to deliver the David Vilaseca Memorial Lecture at [[Royal Holloway University]]. After this lecture she was appointed a member of the Advisory Committee for the Centre of Visual Cultures at Royal Holloway.\n\n== Work ==\n\nChallenger's first solo show was '''The Tamsynettes''' at Transition Gallery run by [[Cathy Lomax]] in [[Bethnal Green]] in March 2010. This is an ongoing work looking at stylised layers of beauty through mapping her corporeal deterioration over the course of her lifetime. '''The Tamsynettes yr 2''' was shown as part of the [[Beaconsfield]] ([[Vauxhall]], London) show 'Fraternise-the Salon' in May 2011, showing alongside [[Tracey Emin]], [[Franko B]], [[Damien Hirst]], [[Mark Wallinger]] and [[Sarah Lucas]] amongst others.\n\nIn 2006, she began developing the idea for '''400 Women'''. Politically concerned with [[gender violence]], '''400 Women''' began for Challenger when she visited [[Mexico]] in 2006 and is focused on the murdered and missing women of Juarez (see [[Female homicides in Ciudad Juarez]]). Challenger brought together a critical mass of nearly 200 international artists including [[Maggi Hambling]], [[Paula Rego]], [[Zoe Laughlin]] and [[Celia Paul]] to address issues of mortality and the capacity of art to imagine the dead, violence and trauma, with the aim of re-personalising the individual from a statistic.\n\nThe show premiered in November 2010 at [[Shoreditch Town Hall]] Basement space, London, supported by the [[Arts Council]] and [[Amnesty International]]. The site-specific installation was subsequently selected as part of the [[Edinburgh Art Festival]] 2011. '''400 Women''' continues to tour internationally.\n\nIn 2012 Challenger was invited to contribute to a new protest book in conjunction with [[Pussy Riot]] that was published by [[Rough Trade Records]], '''Let's Start A Pussy Riot'''. She was one of several contributors including [[Yoko Ono]], [[Judy Chicago]], [[Carolee Schneemann]] and several rock and punk musicians. Challenger was the only artist to produce a new sculptural work for the book which consists of a highly coloured fully operational ducking stool, shown as a precursor work to '''Monoculture'''.\n\nFrom June 2012 \u2013 February 2013, Challenger was in residence at [[Beaconsfield (gallery)|Beaconsfield Gallery]] BAW in London under the curatorial direction of David Crawforth and Naomi Siderfin, where she began exploring cultural homogeneity and the '[[selfie]]' portrait through her project '''Monoculture'''.\n\nIn February 2013, '''Monoculture''' show premiered at Beaconsfield and consisted of new large scale sculptural works that explore the relationship between [[social media]], [[sexuality]] and [[self image|self-representation]]. The work was recommended by the [[Contemporary Art Society]] in April 2013.

Notable layers include:<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsYrrNiqAs</ref>\n\n===API===\n[[API]], or Application programming interface, is an interface or protocol that allows for communication across different parts of the software. Fyne has a self-documenting API that is also extensible resulting in the ability for each developer to create custom tools unique to their project that will mesh with Fyne itself.\n\n===Vector Graphics===\nThe use of [[vector graphics]] to paint the UI provides a method of adapting to different device and display sizes without losing image fidelity. This allows the programmer to only need to create the UI once and it will look as expected on any device.\n\n===Hierarchy===\n====Canvas====\nCanvas contains all of the contents of a window ranging from the full screen to a group of CanvasObjects.\n\n====CanvasObject====\nCanvasObjects are what actually get rendered on screen such as Text, Rectangle, Line. The objects store size, position and color information for the rendering process.\n\n===Container===\nContainers are groups of CanvasObjects, each container can specify a layout which will contain the sizing and position of its child components. Layouts help the developer arrange components in a manner that response to the container or window size, with several layout types provided including Border, Center, and Grid.\n\n====Widget====\nAll of the components of a window in a CanvasObject are widgets that contain standard user interface elements. Fyne widgets include but are not limited to UI basics such as: Button, Check, Form, Hyperlink, Label, TabContainer, and Toolbar. Basic UI widgets ensure that standard aspects of GUI interactivity act in a predictable and expected way across applications. This helps improve quality of programs while assisting the programmer by removing the need for them to create these tools themself.\n\n===Packages===\nAll components of Fyne are split into packages and then connected via the API to create a final GUI application. In addition to the canvas, layout, and widget packages, notable packages include:\n* App package which is the main entry point for the app which manages understanding the type of device the application is running on and ensures the code will run as expected on that device.\n* Test package enabling [[test-driven development]] to validate the GUI itself functions as expected.\n\n==Use==\nThe largest project currently using the Fyne toolkit is the FyneDesk project, a complete desktop environment for Linux.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/fyne-io/desktop/ |title = A full desktop environment for Linux/Unix using Fyne: Fyne-io/Desktop|date = 2020-02-24}}</ref>\n\nThere are many other applications being built using the toolkit, those that are open source can be found in an application listing<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://apps.fyne.io/ | title=Home}}</ref> website managed by the project.\n\nMany businesses are using the Fyne toolkit to quickly add a graphical user interface to command line tools which they have already built using Go.\n\n==Releases==\n\n* 1.2 -

Despite its appearance, it is not a plant; it is a [[heterokont]]. Giant kelp is common along the coast of the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], from [[Baja California]] north to southeast [[Alaska]], and is also found in the southern oceans near [[South America]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. Individual algae may grow to more than {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=off|-1}} long at a rate of as much as {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on|0}} per day. Giant kelp grows in dense stands known as [[kelp forest]]s, which are home to many marine animals that depend on the algae for food or shelter. The primary commercial product obtained from giant kelp is [[alginate]], but humans also harvest this species on a limited basis for use directly as food, as it is rich in [[iodine]], [[potassium]], and other minerals. It can be used in cooking in many of the ways other sea vegetables are used, and particularly serves to add flavor to bean dishes.\n\n==Description==\n''M. pyrifera'' is the largest of all [[algae]]. The stage of the life cycle that is usually seen is the [[sporophyte]], which is perennial and individuals persist for many years. Individuals may grow to up to {{convert|50|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} long or more. The kelp often grows even longer than the distance from the bottom to the surface as it will grow in a diagonal direction due to the ocean current pushing against the kelp.<ref name=\"Hoek 1995\">Hoek ''et al.'' 1995, p. 201</ref> The stalks arise from a [[holdfast]] and branch three or four times from near the base. Blades develop at irregular intervals along the stipe, with a single [[pneumatocyst]] (gas bladder) at the base of each blade.<ref name=\"Kain 91\">Kain 1991</ref>\n\nA related and similar-looking, but smaller species, ''[[Macrocystis integrifolia|M. integrifolia]]'', grows to only to {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. It is found on intertidal rocks or shallow subtidal rocks along the [[Pacific]] coast of [[North America]] ([[British Columbia]] to [[California]]) and South America.<ref name=\"Abbott 76\">Abbott & Hollenberg 1976</ref><ref>[[AlgaeBase]]: [http://www.algaebase.org/search/species/detail/?species_id=4882&sk=0&from=results Species: Macrocystis integrifolia]</ref> In New Zealand ''M. pyrifera'' is found on the in subtidal zone of southern North Island, the South Island, Chatham, Stewart, Bounty, Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=New Zealand seaweeds : an illustrated guide|last=Nelson|first=W.

To establish itself, a young kelp produces one or two primary blades, and begins a rudimentary [[holdfast]], which serves to anchor the plant to the rocky bottom. As the kelp grows, additional blades develop from the growing tip, while the holdfast enlarges and may entirely cover the rock to which it is attached.\n\nGrowth occurs with lengthening of the [[stipe (botany)|stipe]] (central stalk), and splitting of the blades.

Despite its appearance, it is not a plant; it is a [[heterokont]]. Giant kelp is common along the coast of the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], from [[Baja California]] north to southeast [[Alaska]], and is also found in the southern oceans near [[South America]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. Individual algae may grow to more than {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=off|-1}} long at a rate of as much as {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on|0}} per day. Giant kelp grows in dense stands known as [[kelp forest]]s, which are home to many marine animals that depend on the algae for food or shelter. The primary commercial product obtained from giant kelp is [[alginate]], but humans also harvest this species on a limited basis for use directly as food, as it is rich in [[iodine]], [[potassium]], and other minerals. It can be used in cooking in many of the ways other sea vegetables are used, and particularly serves to add flavor to bean dishes.\n\n==Description==\n''M. pyrifera'' is the largest of all [[algae]]. The stage of the life cycle that is usually seen is the [[sporophyte]], which is perennial and individuals persist for many years. Individuals may grow to up to {{convert|50|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} long or more. The kelp often grows even longer than the distance from the bottom to the surface as it will grow in a diagonal direction due to the ocean current pushing against the kelp.<ref name=\"Hoek 1995\">Hoek ''et al.'' 1995, p. 201</ref> The stalks arise from a [[holdfast]] and branch three or four times from near the base. Blades develop at irregular intervals along the stipe, with a single [[pneumatocyst]] (gas bladder) at the base of each blade.<ref name=\"Kain 91\">Kain 1991</ref>\n\nA related and similar-looking, but smaller species, ''[[Macrocystis integrifolia|M. integrifolia]]'', grows to only to {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. It is found on intertidal rocks or shallow subtidal rocks along the [[Pacific]] coast of [[North America]] ([[British Columbia]] to [[California]]) and South America.<ref name=\"Abbott 76\">Abbott & Hollenberg 1976</ref><ref>[[AlgaeBase]]: [http://www.algaebase.org/search/species/detail/?species_id=4882&sk=0&from=results Species: Macrocystis integrifolia]</ref> In New Zealand ''M. pyrifera'' is found on the in subtidal zone of southern North Island, the South Island, Chatham, Stewart, Bounty, Antipodes, Auckland and Campbell Islands.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=New Zealand seaweeds : an illustrated guide|last=Nelson|first=W.

To establish itself, a young kelp produces one or two primary blades, and begins a rudimentary [[holdfast]], which serves to anchor the plant to the rocky bottom. As the kelp grows, additional blades develop from the growing tip, while the holdfast enlarges and may entirely cover the rock to which it is attached.\n\nGrowth occurs with lengthening of the [[stipe (botany)|stipe]] (central stalk), and splitting of the blades. At the growing tip is a single blade, at the base of which develop small gas bladders along one side. As the bladders and stipe grow, small tears develop in the attached blade. Once the tears have completed, each bladder supports a single separate blade along the stipe, with the bladders and their blades attached at irregular intervals.<ref name=\"Mondragon and Mondragon 03\">Mondragon & Mondragon 2003</ref><ref name=\"Prescott\">Prescott 1968, pp.226-227</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n''M. pyrifera'' is found in [[North America]] ([[Alaska]] to [[California]]), [[South America]], [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]], and [[southern Australia]].<ref>[[AlgaeBase]]: [http://www.algaebase.org/search/species/detail/?species_id=4427 Species: Macrocystis pyrifera]</ref> It thrives in cooler waters where the ocean water temperature remains below {{convert|70|F|C|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"Davis p.21\"/> The species is also found near [[Tristan da Cunha]] in the Mid-South Atlantic Ocean.\n\nWhere the bottom is rocky and affords places for it to anchor, giant kelp forms extensive [[kelp bed]]s with large \"floating canopies\".<ref name=\"Abbott 76\"/> When present in large numbers, giant kelp forms [[kelp forest]]s that are home to many marine species that depend upon the kelp directly for food and shelter, or indirectly as a hunting ground for prey.

Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

The pain may be described as a tearing, stabbing, or sharp sensation. About 17% of individuals feel the pain migrate as the dissection extends down the aorta. The location of pain is associated with the location of the dissection.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} [[Anterior]] chest pain is associated with dissections involving the ascending aorta, while interscapular back pain is associated with descending aortic dissections. If the pain is [[pleurisy|pleuritic]] in nature, it may suggest acute [[pericarditis]] caused by bleeding into the [[Pericardium|sac surrounding the heart]]. This is a particularly dangerous eventuality, suggesting that acute [[pericardial tamponade]] may be imminent.

The blood pressure is quite variable at presentation with acute AD. It tends to be higher in individuals with a distal dissection. In individuals with a proximal AD, 36% present with hypertension, while 25% present with [[hypotension]]. Proximal AD tends to be associated with weakening of the vascular wall due to [[cystic medial degeneration]].

It is usually associated with pericardial tamponade, severe aortic insufficiency, or rupture of the aorta. Accurate measurement of the blood pressure is important. Pseudohypotension (falsely low blood-pressure measurement) may occur due to involvement of the [[brachiocephalic artery]] (supplying the right arm) or the [[subclavian artery|left subclavian artery]] (supplying the left arm).\n\n===Aortic insufficiency===\n[[Aortic insufficiency]] (AI) occurs in half to two-thirds of ascending AD, and the diastolic [[heart sounds|heart murmur]] of aortic insufficiency is audible in about 32% of proximal dissections. The intensity (loudness) of the murmur depends on the blood pressure and may be inaudible in the event of low blood pressure.\n\nMultiple causes exist for AI in the setting of ascending AD. The dissection may dilate the annulus of the [[aortic valve]], preventing the leaflets of the valve from coapting. The dissection may extend into the aortic root and detach the aortic valve leaflets. Alternatively, following an extensive intimal tear, the intimal flap may prolapse into the [[left ventricular outflow tract]], causing intimal [[intussusception (blood vessel growth)|intussusception]] into the aortic valve, thereby preventing proper valve closure.\n\n===Myocardial infarction===\n[[Myocardial infarction|Heart attack]] occurs in 1\u20132% of aortic dissections. Infarction is caused by involvement of the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]], which supply the heart with oxygenated blood, in the dissection. The right coronary artery is involved more commonly than the left coronary artery. If the myocardial infarction is treated with [[thrombolytic]] therapy, the mortality increases to over 70%, mostly due to bleeding into the pericardial sac, causing [[cardiac tamponade]].\n\n===Pleural effusion===\nA [[pleural effusion]] (fluid collection in the space between the [[lung]]s and the chest wall or [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]]) can be due to either blood from a transient rupture of the aorta or fluid due to an inflammatory reaction around the aorta. If a pleural effusion were to develop due to AD, it is more commonly in the left hemithorax rather than the right hemithorax.\n\n==Causes==\nAortic dissection is associated with [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) and many [[connective tissue]] disorders. [[Vasculitis]] ([[inflammation]] of an artery) is rarely associated with aortic dissection. It can also be the result of chest trauma. About 72 to 80% of individuals who present with an aortic dissection have a previous history of hypertension. Illicit drug use with stimulants such as [[cocaine]] and [[methamphetamine]] is also a modifiable risk factor for AD.<ref name=\"Lech2017\"/><ref name=\"pmid25657055\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stankowski RV, Kloner RA, Rezkalla SH |title=Cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use |journal=Trends Cardiovasc.

About 18% of individuals who present with an acute aortic dissection have a history of open-heart surgery. Individuals who have undergone aortic valve replacement for [[aortic insufficiency]] are at particularly high risk because aortic insufficiency causes increased blood flow in the ascending aorta.

The intima is in direct contact with the blood inside the vessel, and mainly consists of a layer of [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] on a [[basement membrane]]; the media contains connective and muscle tissue, and the vessel is protected on the outside by the adventitia, comprising connective tissue.<ref name=Hiratzka2010/>\n\nIn an aortic dissection, blood penetrates the intima and enters the media layer. The high pressure rips the [[biological tissue|tissue]] of the media apart along the laminated plane splitting the inner two-thirds and the outer one-third of the media apart.<ref name=Seidensticker2008>Das M., Mahnken A.H. and Wildberger J.E., \u201cDual Energy: CTA Aorta\u201d in Seidensticker P.R. and Hofmann L.K.

Dissections that propagate towards the iliac bifurcation (with the flow of blood) are called anterograde dissections and those that propagate towards the aortic root (opposite of the flow of blood) are called retrograde dissections. The initial tear is usually within 100&nbsp;mm of the [[aortic valve]], so a retrograde dissection can easily compromise the pericardium leading to a hemopericardium. Anterograde dissections may propagate all the way to the iliac bifurcation of the aorta, rupture the aortic wall, or recanalize into the intravascular lumen leading to a double-barrel aorta. The double-barrel aorta relieves the pressure of blood flow and reduces the risk of rupture. Rupture leads to hemorrhaging into a body cavity, and prognosis depends on the area of rupture. Retroperitoneal and pericardial ruptures are both possible.\n\n[[File:Aortic dissection (1) Victoria blue-HE.jpg|thumb|Histopathological image of dissecting aneurysm of thoracic aorta in a patient without evidence of Marfan syndrome: The damaged aorta was surgically removed and replaced by artificial vessel, Victoria blue & HE stain.]]\nThe initiating event in an aortic dissection is a tear in the intimal lining of the aorta. Due to the high pressures in the aorta, blood enters the media at the point of the tear.  The force of the blood entering the media causes the tear to extend. It may extend proximally (closer to the heart) or distally (away from the heart) or both. The blood travels through the media, creating a [[pseudoaneurysm|false lumen]] (the true lumen is the normal conduit of blood in the aorta). Separating the false lumen from the true lumen is a layer of intimal tissue known as the intimal flap.\n\nThe vast majority of aortic dissections originate with an intimal tear in either the [[ascending aorta]] (65%), the [[aortic arch]] (10%), or just distal to the [[ligamentum arteriosum]] in the [[Descending aorta|descending thoracic aorta]] (20%).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}\n\nAs blood flows down the false lumen, it may cause secondary tears in the intima. Through these secondary tears, the blood can re-enter the true lumen.\n\nWhile it is not always clear why an intimal tear may occur, quite often it involves degeneration of the [[collagen]] and [[elastin]] that make up the media. This is known as [[cystic medial necrosis]] and is most commonly associated with Marfan syndrome and is also associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n\nIn about 13% of aortic dissections, no evidence of an intimal tear is found. In these cases, the inciting event is thought to be an intramural [[hematoma]] (caused by bleeding within the media). Since no direct connection exists between the true lumen and the false lumen in these cases, diagnosing an aortic dissection by [[#Aortogram|aortography]] is difficult if the cause is an intramural hematoma. An aortic dissection secondary to an intramural hematoma should be treated the same as one caused by an intimal tear.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nBecause of the varying symptoms of aortic dissection, the diagnosis is sometimes difficult to make. Concern should be increased in those with low blood pressure, neurological problems, and an unequal pulses.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ohle|first1=R|last2=Kareemi|first2=HK|last3=Wells|first3=G|last4=Perry|first4=JJ|title=Clinical Examination for Acute Aortic Dissection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=Academic Emergency Medicine|volume=25|issue=4|pages=397\u2013412|date=18 December 2017|doi=10.1111/acem.13360|pmid=29265487}}</ref>\n\nWhile taking a good history from the individual may be strongly suggestive of an aortic dissection, the diagnosis cannot always be made by history and physical signs alone.  Often, the diagnosis is made by visualization of the intimal flap on a diagnostic imaging test. Common tests used to diagnose an aortic dissection include a [[CT scan]] of the chest with iodinated contrast material and a [[transesophageal echocardiogram]]. The proximity of the aorta to the [[esophagus]] allows the use of [[high-frequency ultrasound|higher-frequency ultrasound]] for better anatomical images. Other tests that may be used include an aortogram or magnetic resonance angiogram of the aorta.  Each of these tests has pros and cons, and they do not have equal sensitivities and specificities in the diagnosis of aortic dissection.\n\nIn general, the imaging technique chosen is based on the pretest likelihood of the diagnosis, availability of the testing modality, patient stability, and the sensitivity and specificity of the test.\n[[File:Diagnostic Algorithm of aortic dissection.png|thumb|Diagnostic Algorithm of aortic dissection]]\n\n===D-dimer===\nA measurement of blood [[D-dimer]] level may be useful in diagnostic evaluation.

Classically, new widening of the [[mediastinum]] on radiograph is of moderate [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] for detecting an ascending aortic dissection; however, this finding is of low [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]], as many other conditions can cause apparent widening of the mediastinum.\n\nThere are several other associated radiographic findings:\n* The \"calcium sign\" describes an apparent separation of the intimal calcification from the outer aortic margin by greater than 10&nbsp;mm.\n* [[Pleural effusion]]s, more commonly in descending aortic dissections, and typically left sided.\n* Other: obliteration of the [[aortic knob]], depression of the left mainstem bronchus, loss of the paratracheal stripe, and tracheal deviation.\nImportantly, about 12 to 20% of aortic dissections are not detectable by chest radiograph; therefore, a \"normal\" chest radiograph does not rule out aortic dissection. If there is high clinical suspicion, a more sensitive imaging test ([[Computed tomography angiography|CT angiogram]], [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MR angiography]], or [[Transesophageal echocardiogram|transesophageal echo]]) may be warranted.\n\n===Computed tomography===\n[[Computed tomography angiography]] is a fast, noninvasive test that gives an accurate three-dimensional view of the aorta. These images are produced by taking rapid, thin-cut slices of the chest and abdomen, and combining them in the computer to create cross-sectional slices. To delineate the aorta to the accuracy necessary to make the proper diagnosis, an iodinated contrast material is injected into a peripheral vein. Contrast is injected and the scan performed using a [[bolus tracking]] method. This type of scan is timed to an injection to capture the contrast as it enters the aorta. The scan then follows the contrast as it flows through the vessel. It has a sensitivity of 96 to 100% and a specificity of 96 to 100%. Disadvantages include the need for iodinated contrast material and the inability to diagnose the site of the intimal tear.\n<gallery>\nFile:DissectionCT.png|CT with contrast demonstrating aneurysmal dilation and a dissection of the ascending aorta (type A Stanford)\nFile:Descending (Type B Stanford) Aortic Dissection.PNG|Chest CT with descending (type B Stanford) aortic dissection (red circle)\nFile:Dissection2018WithPericardial.jpg|Type A dissection with pericardial effusion as a result.\n</gallery>\n\n===MRI===\n[[File:AoDiss MRT.jpg|thumb|[[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of an aortic dissection<br/>''1'' Aorta descendens with dissection<br/>''2'' Aorta isthmus]]\n[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is also used for the detection and assessment of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 98%. An MRI examination of the aorta produces a three-dimensional reconstruction of the aorta, allowing the physician to determine the location of the intimal tear and the involvement of branch vessels, and to locate any secondary tears. It is a noninvasive test, does not require the use of iodinated contrast material, and can detect and quantitate the degree of aortic insufficiency.\n\nThe disadvantage of the MRI scan in the face of aortic dissection is that it may be available only in larger hospitals, and the scan is relatively time-consuming, which could be dangerous in people who are already very unwell. Due to the high-intensity magnetic fields used during MRI, it cannot be used on individuals with metallic implants. In addition, some individuals experience [[claustrophobia]] while surrounded by the MRI magnet.\n\n===Ultrasound===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Aortic dissection - Echocardiogram - Longitudinal view.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Aortic dissection - Echocardiogram - Longitudinal view - Color.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = An [[echocardiogram]] displaying the true [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] and false lumen of an aortic dissection: In the image to the left, the intimal flap can be seen separating the two lumens.

It has become the preferred imaging modality for suspected aortic dissection. It is a relatively noninvasive test, requiring the individual to swallow the echocardiography probe. It is especially good in the evaluation of AI in the setting of ascending aortic dissection, and to determine whether the ostia (origins) of the coronary arteries are involved. While many institutions give sedation during transesophageal echocardiography for added patient comfort, it can be performed in cooperative individuals without the use of sedation. Disadvantages of TEE include the inability to visualize the distal ascending aorta (the beginning of the [[aortic arch]]), and the descending abdominal aorta that lies below the [[stomach]].

One such classification is based on chronicity and labels aortic dissections as hyperacute (<24 hours duration), acute (2\u20137 days), subacute (8\u201330 days), and chronic (>30 days).<ref name=\"Lech2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Lech|first1=C|last2=Swaminathan|first2=A|title=Abdominal Aortic Emergencies|journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America|date=November 2017|volume=35|issue=4|pages=847\u201367|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2017.07.003|pmid=28987432}}</ref> The systems commonly in use are based on either the anatomy of the dissection or the duration of onset of symptoms prior to presentation. The Stanford system is used more commonly now, as it is more attuned to the management of the patient.\n\n====DeBakey====\nThe DeBakey system, named after cardiothoracic surgeon [[Michael E. DeBakey]], is an anatomical description of the aortic dissection. It categorizes the dissection based on where the original intimal tear is located and the extent of the dissection (localized to either the ascending aorta or descending aorta or involves both the ascending and descending aorta.<ref name=DeBakey1965/>\n*'''Type I''' \u2013 originates in ascending aorta, and propagates at least to the aortic arch and often beyond it distally. It is most often seen in patients less than 65 years of age and is the most lethal form of the disease. \n*'''Type II''' \u2013 originates in the ascending aorta and is confined to it.\n*'''Type III''' \u2013 originates in the descending aorta and rarely extends proximally, but will extend distally. It most often occurs in elderly patients with [[atherosclerosis]] and hypertension.\n\n====Stanford====\nThe Stanford classification is divided into two groups, A and B, depending on whether the ascending aorta is involved.<ref name=Daily1970/>\n*'''A''' \u2013 involves the ascending aorta and/or aortic arch, and possibly the descending aorta. The tear can originate in the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, or more rarely, in the descending aorta. It includes DeBakey types I and II.\n*'''B''' \u2013 involves the descending aorta or the arch (distal to the left subclavian artery), without the involvement of the ascending aorta. It includes DeBakey type III.\n\nThe Stanford classification is useful as it follows clinical practice, as type A ascending aortic dissections generally require primary surgical treatment, whereas type B dissections generally are treated medically as initial treatment with surgery reserved for any complications.\n\nThe reason for surgical repair of type A dissections is that ascending aortic dissections often involve the aortic valve, which, having lost its suspensory support, telescopes down into the aortic root, resulting in aortic incompetence. The valve must be resuspended in order to be reseated, as well as to repair or prevent coronary artery injury. Also, the area of dissection is removed and replaced with a Dacron graft to prevent further dissection from occurring. However, type B dissections are not improved, from a mortality point of view, by the operation, unless leaking, rupture, or compromise to other organs, e.g. kidneys, occurs.\n\n==Prevention==\nAmong the recognized risk factors for aortic dissection, hypertension, [[Dyslipidemia|abnormally high levels of lipids (such as cholesterol) in the blood]], and smoking tobacco are considered preventable risk factors.<ref name=Lancet2016/>\n\nRepair of an enlargement of the ascending aorta from an aneurysm or previously unrecognized and untreated aortic dissections is recommended when greater than {{convert|6|cm|1|abbr=on}} in size to decrease the risk of dissection. Repair may be recommended when greater than {{convert|4.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} in size if the person has one of the several connective-tissue disorders or a family history of a ruptured aorta.\n\n==Management==\nIn an acute dissection, treatment choice depends on its location. For Stanford type A (ascending aortic) dissection, surgical management is superior to medical management.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} For uncomplicated Stanford type B (distal aortic) dissections (including abdominal aortic dissections), medical management is preferred over surgery.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Complicated Stanford type B aortic dissections require surgical intervention after initiation of medical therapy.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe risk of death due to aortic dissection is highest in the first few hours after the dissection begins, and decreases afterward. Because of this, the therapeutic strategies differ for the treatment of an acute dissection compared to a chronic dissection. An acute dissection is one in which the individual presents within the first two weeks. If the individual has managed to survive this window period, his prognosis is improved. About 66% of all dissections present in the acute phase. Individuals who present two weeks after the onset of the dissection are said to have chronic aortic dissections.  These individuals have been self-selected as survivors of the acute episode and can be treated with medical therapy as long as they are stable.\n\n===Medication===\nAortic dissection generally presents as a hypertensive emergency, and the prime consideration of medical management is to decrease the [[shear force|shear stress]] in the aortic wall (dP/dt (force of ejection of blood from the [[left ventricle]])) by decreasing blood pressure and the heart rate. The target blood pressure should be a [[mean arterial pressure]] (MAP) of 60 to 75 [[mmHg]], or the lowest blood pressure tolerated. Initial decreases should be by about 20%.<ref name=White2013/> The target heart rate is less than 65 beats per minute. Long-term blood pressure control is required for every person who has experienced aortic dissection.\n\n[[Beta blockers]] are the first-line treatment for patients with acute and chronic aortic dissection. In acute dissection, fast-acting agents which can be given intravenously and have doses that are easier to adjust (such as [[esmolol]], [[propranolol]], or [[labetalol]]) are preferred. Vasodilators such as [[sodium nitroprusside]] can be considered for people with ongoing high blood pressure, but they should never be used alone, as they often stimulate a [[reflex tachycardia|reflexive increase in the heart rate]].\n\n[[Calcium channel blocker]]s can be used in the treatment of aortic dissection, particularly if a contraindication to the use of beta blockers exists.  The calcium channel blockers typically used are [[verapamil]] and [[diltiazem]], because of their combined vasodilator and negative [[inotropic]] effects.\n\nIf the individual has refractory hypertension (persistent hypertension on the maximum doses of three different classes of antihypertensive agents), an involvement of the renal arteries in the aortic dissection plane should be considered.\n\n===Surgical===\nIndications for the surgical treatment of aortic dissection include an acute proximal aortic dissection and an acute distal aortic dissection with one or more complications.  Complications include compromise of a vital organ, rupture or impending rupture of the aorta, retrograde dissection into the ascending aorta. These are more common with a history of Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n\nThe objective in the surgical management of aortic dissection is to resect (remove) the most severely damaged segments of the aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and any secondary tears along the vessel). While excision of the intimal tear may be performed, it does not significantly change mortality.\n\nThe particular treatment used depends on the segment or segments of aorta involved. Some treatments are:\n* [[Open aortic surgery]] with replacement of the damaged section of aorta with a tube graft (often made of [[Dacron]]) when no damage to the [[aortic valve]] is seen\n* [[Bentall procedure]] \u2014 replacement of the damaged section of aorta and replacement of the aortic valve\n* [[David procedure]] \u2014 replacement of the damaged section of aorta and reimplantation of the aortic valve\n* [[TEVAR|Thoracic endovascular aortic repair]], a minimally invasive surgical procedure usually combined with on-going medical management\n* Replacement of the damaged section of aorta with a sutureless [[vascular ring connector]]-reinforced Dacron graft: The vascular ring connector is a titanic ring used as a stent in the vascular graft to achieve a quick, blood-sealed, and sutureless anastomosis. Two furrows on the surface of the ring are for fixation of the vascular graft and the aorta. The tapes used to tie against the ring provide a larger contact surface area than the traditional stitches, thus it provides stronger anastomosis and better surgical results.\n\nA number of comorbid conditions increase the surgical risk of repair of an aortic dissection.  These conditions include the following:\n* Prolonged preoperative evaluation (increased length of time prior to surgery)\n* Advanced age\n* Comorbid disease states (e.g.: [[coronary artery disease]])\n* Aneurysm leakage\n* [[Cardiac tamponade]]\n* [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]]\n* Past history of myocardial infarction <!-- or CVA -->\n* History of [[kidney failure]] (either acute or chronic kidney failure)\n\n===Follow-up===\n[[File:TypeBdisectionlumonclosed.png|thumb|Closure of the lumen of a Type B aortic dissection following medical management]]\nThe long-term follow-up in individuals who survive aortic dissection involves strict blood pressure control.  The relative risk of late rupture of an [[aortic aneurysm]] is 10 times higher in individuals who have uncontrolled hypertension, compared to individuals with a systolic pressure below 130 mmHg.\n\nThe risk of death is highest in the first two years after the acute event, and individuals should be followed closely during this time period. About 29% of late deaths following surgery are due to rupture of either a dissecting aneurysm or another aneurysm. In addition, a 17% to 25% incidence exists of new aneurysm formation, typically due to dilatation of the residual false lumen. These new aneurysms are more likely to rupture, due to their thinner walls.\n\nSerial imaging of the aorta is suggested, with MRI being the preferred imaging technique.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nEstablishing the incidence of aortic dissection has been difficult because many cases are only diagnosed after death (which may have been attributed to another cause), and is often initially misdiagnosed. Aortic dissection affects an estimated 2.0\u20133.5 people per every 100,000 every year. Studies from Sweden suggest that the incidence of aortic dissection may be rising.<ref name=Olsson2006>{{cite journal | author1 = Olsson Ch. | author2 = Thelin S. | author3 = St\u00e5hle E. | author4 = Ekbom A. | author5 = Granath F. | year = 2006 | title = Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection.

Proximal AD tends to be associated with weakening of the vascular wall due to [[cystic medial degeneration]].

It is usually associated with pericardial tamponade, severe aortic insufficiency, or rupture of the aorta. Accurate measurement of the blood pressure is important. Pseudohypotension (falsely low blood-pressure measurement) may occur due to involvement of the [[brachiocephalic artery]] (supplying the right arm) or the [[subclavian artery|left subclavian artery]] (supplying the left arm).\n\n===Aortic insufficiency===\n[[Aortic insufficiency]] (AI) occurs in half to two-thirds of ascending AD, and the diastolic [[heart sounds|heart murmur]] of aortic insufficiency is audible in about 32% of proximal dissections. The intensity (loudness) of the murmur depends on the blood pressure and may be inaudible in the event of low blood pressure.\n\nMultiple causes exist for AI in the setting of ascending AD. The dissection may dilate the annulus of the [[aortic valve]], preventing the leaflets of the valve from coapting. The dissection may extend into the aortic root and detach the aortic valve leaflets. Alternatively, following an extensive intimal tear, the intimal flap may prolapse into the [[left ventricular outflow tract]], causing intimal [[intussusception (blood vessel growth)|intussusception]] into the aortic valve, thereby preventing proper valve closure.\n\n===Myocardial infarction===\n[[Myocardial infarction|Heart attack]] occurs in 1\u20132% of aortic dissections. Infarction is caused by involvement of the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]], which supply the heart with oxygenated blood, in the dissection. The right coronary artery is involved more commonly than the left coronary artery. If the myocardial infarction is treated with [[thrombolytic]] therapy, the mortality increases to over 70%, mostly due to bleeding into the pericardial sac, causing [[cardiac tamponade]].\n\n===Pleural effusion===\nA [[pleural effusion]] (fluid collection in the space between the [[lung]]s and the chest wall or [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]]) can be due to either blood from a transient rupture of the aorta or fluid due to an inflammatory reaction around the aorta. If a pleural effusion were to develop due to AD, it is more commonly in the left hemithorax rather than the right hemithorax.\n\n==Causes==\nAortic dissection is associated with [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) and many [[connective tissue]] disorders. [[Vasculitis]] ([[inflammation]] of an artery) is rarely associated with aortic dissection. It can also be the result of chest trauma. About 72 to 80% of individuals who present with an aortic dissection have a previous history of hypertension. Illicit drug use with stimulants such as [[cocaine]] and [[methamphetamine]] is also a modifiable risk factor for AD.<ref name=\"Lech2017\"/><ref name=\"pmid25657055\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stankowski RV, Kloner RA, Rezkalla SH |title=Cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use |journal=Trends Cardiovasc.

About 18% of individuals who present with an acute aortic dissection have a history of open-heart surgery. Individuals who have undergone aortic valve replacement for [[aortic insufficiency]] are at particularly high risk because aortic insufficiency causes increased blood flow in the ascending aorta.

The intima is in direct contact with the blood inside the vessel, and mainly consists of a layer of [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] on a [[basement membrane]]; the media contains connective and muscle tissue, and the vessel is protected on the outside by the adventitia, comprising connective tissue.<ref name=Hiratzka2010/>\n\nIn an aortic dissection, blood penetrates the intima and enters the media layer. The high pressure rips the [[biological tissue|tissue]] of the media apart along the laminated plane splitting the inner two-thirds and the outer one-third of the media apart.<ref name=Seidensticker2008>Das M., Mahnken A.H. and Wildberger J.E., \u201cDual Energy: CTA Aorta\u201d in Seidensticker P.R. and Hofmann L.K.

Dissections that propagate towards the iliac bifurcation (with the flow of blood) are called anterograde dissections and those that propagate towards the aortic root (opposite of the flow of blood) are called retrograde dissections. The initial tear is usually within 100&nbsp;mm of the [[aortic valve]], so a retrograde dissection can easily compromise the pericardium leading to a hemopericardium. Anterograde dissections may propagate all the way to the iliac bifurcation of the aorta, rupture the aortic wall, or recanalize into the intravascular lumen leading to a double-barrel aorta. The double-barrel aorta relieves the pressure of blood flow and reduces the risk of rupture. Rupture leads to hemorrhaging into a body cavity, and prognosis depends on the area of rupture. Retroperitoneal and pericardial ruptures are both possible.\n\n[[File:Aortic dissection (1) Victoria blue-HE.jpg|thumb|Histopathological image of dissecting aneurysm of thoracic aorta in a patient without evidence of Marfan syndrome: The damaged aorta was surgically removed and replaced by artificial vessel, Victoria blue & HE stain.]]\nThe initiating event in an aortic dissection is a tear in the intimal lining of the aorta. Due to the high pressures in the aorta, blood enters the media at the point of the tear.  The force of the blood entering the media causes the tear to extend. It may extend proximally (closer to the heart) or distally (away from the heart) or both. The blood travels through the media, creating a [[pseudoaneurysm|false lumen]] (the true lumen is the normal conduit of blood in the aorta). Separating the false lumen from the true lumen is a layer of intimal tissue known as the intimal flap.\n\nThe vast majority of aortic dissections originate with an intimal tear in either the [[ascending aorta]] (65%), the [[aortic arch]] (10%), or just distal to the [[ligamentum arteriosum]] in the [[Descending aorta|descending thoracic aorta]] (20%).{{Clarify|date=April 2018}}\n\nAs blood flows down the false lumen, it may cause secondary tears in the intima. Through these secondary tears, the blood can re-enter the true lumen.\n\nWhile it is not always clear why an intimal tear may occur, quite often it involves degeneration of the [[collagen]] and [[elastin]] that make up the media. This is known as [[cystic medial necrosis]] and is most commonly associated with Marfan syndrome and is also associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n\nIn about 13% of aortic dissections, no evidence of an intimal tear is found. In these cases, the inciting event is thought to be an intramural [[hematoma]] (caused by bleeding within the media). Since no direct connection exists between the true lumen and the false lumen in these cases, diagnosing an aortic dissection by [[#Aortogram|aortography]] is difficult if the cause is an intramural hematoma. An aortic dissection secondary to an intramural hematoma should be treated the same as one caused by an intimal tear.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nBecause of the varying symptoms of aortic dissection, the diagnosis is sometimes difficult to make. Concern should be increased in those with low blood pressure, neurological problems, and an unequal pulses.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ohle|first1=R|last2=Kareemi|first2=HK|last3=Wells|first3=G|last4=Perry|first4=JJ|title=Clinical Examination for Acute Aortic Dissection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=Academic Emergency Medicine|volume=25|issue=4|pages=397\u2013412|date=18 December 2017|doi=10.1111/acem.13360|pmid=29265487}}</ref>\n\nWhile taking a good history from the individual may be strongly suggestive of an aortic dissection, the diagnosis cannot always be made by history and physical signs alone.  Often, the diagnosis is made by visualization of the intimal flap on a diagnostic imaging test. Common tests used to diagnose an aortic dissection include a [[CT scan]] of the chest with iodinated contrast material and a [[transesophageal echocardiogram]]. The proximity of the aorta to the [[esophagus]] allows the use of [[high-frequency ultrasound|higher-frequency ultrasound]] for better anatomical images. Other tests that may be used include an aortogram or magnetic resonance angiogram of the aorta.  Each of these tests has pros and cons, and they do not have equal sensitivities and specificities in the diagnosis of aortic dissection.\n\nIn general, the imaging technique chosen is based on the pretest likelihood of the diagnosis, availability of the testing modality, patient stability, and the sensitivity and specificity of the test.\n\n===D-dimer===\nA measurement of blood [[D-dimer]] level may be useful in diagnostic evaluation.

Classically, new widening of the [[mediastinum]] on radiograph is of moderate [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] for detecting an ascending aortic dissection; however, this finding is of low [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]], as many other conditions can cause apparent widening of the mediastinum.\n\nThere are several other associated radiographic findings:\n* The \"calcium sign\" describes an apparent separation of the intimal calcification from the outer aortic margin by greater than 10&nbsp;mm.\n* [[Pleural effusion]]s, more commonly in descending aortic dissections, and typically left sided.\n* Other: obliteration of the [[aortic knob]], depression of the left mainstem bronchus, loss of the paratracheal stripe, and tracheal deviation.\nImportantly, about 12 to 20% of aortic dissections are not detectable by chest radiograph; therefore, a \"normal\" chest radiograph does not rule out aortic dissection. If there is high clinical suspicion, a more sensitive imaging test ([[Computed tomography angiography|CT angiogram]], [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MR angiography]], or [[Transesophageal echocardiogram|transesophageal echo]]) may be warranted.\n\n===Computed tomography===\n[[Computed tomography angiography]] is a fast, noninvasive test that gives an accurate three-dimensional view of the aorta. These images are produced by taking rapid, thin-cut slices of the chest and abdomen, and combining them in the computer to create cross-sectional slices. To delineate the aorta to the accuracy necessary to make the proper diagnosis, an iodinated contrast material is injected into a peripheral vein. Contrast is injected and the scan performed using a [[bolus tracking]] method. This type of scan is timed to an injection to capture the contrast as it enters the aorta. The scan then follows the contrast as it flows through the vessel. It has a sensitivity of 96 to 100% and a specificity of 96 to 100%. Disadvantages include the need for iodinated contrast material and the inability to diagnose the site of the intimal tear.\n<gallery>\nFile:DissectionCT.png|CT with contrast demonstrating aneurysmal dilation and a dissection of the ascending aorta (type A Stanford)\nFile:Descending (Type B Stanford) Aortic Dissection.PNG|Chest CT with descending (type B Stanford) aortic dissection (red circle)\nFile:Dissection2018WithPericardial.jpg|Type A dissection with pericardial effusion as a result.\n</gallery>\n\n===MRI===\n[[File:AoDiss MRT.jpg|thumb|[[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of an aortic dissection<br/>''1'' Aorta descendens with dissection<br/>''2'' Aorta isthmus]]\n[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is also used for the detection and assessment of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 98%. An MRI examination of the aorta produces a three-dimensional reconstruction of the aorta, allowing the physician to determine the location of the intimal tear and the involvement of branch vessels, and to locate any secondary tears. It is a noninvasive test, does not require the use of iodinated contrast material, and can detect and quantitate the degree of aortic insufficiency.\n\nThe disadvantage of the MRI scan in the face of aortic dissection is that it may be available only in larger hospitals, and the scan is relatively time-consuming, which could be dangerous in people who are already very unwell. Due to the high-intensity magnetic fields used during MRI, it cannot be used on individuals with metallic implants. In addition, some individuals experience [[claustrophobia]] while surrounded by the MRI magnet.\n\n===Ultrasound===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Aortic dissection - Echocardiogram - Longitudinal view.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Aortic dissection - Echocardiogram - Longitudinal view - Color.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = An [[echocardiogram]] displaying the true [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] and false lumen of an aortic dissection: In the image to the left, the intimal flap can be seen separating the two lumens.

It has become the preferred imaging modality for suspected aortic dissection. It is a relatively noninvasive test, requiring the individual to swallow the echocardiography probe. It is especially good in the evaluation of AI in the setting of ascending aortic dissection, and to determine whether the ostia (origins) of the coronary arteries are involved. While many institutions give sedation during transesophageal echocardiography for added patient comfort, it can be performed in cooperative individuals without the use of sedation. Disadvantages of TEE include the inability to visualize the distal ascending aorta (the beginning of the [[aortic arch]]), and the descending abdominal aorta that lies below the [[stomach]]. A TEE may be technically difficult to perform in individuals with esophageal strictures or [[esophageal varices|varices]].\n<gallery>\nFile:Aortic dissection E00249 (CardioNetworks ECHOpedia).webm|Aortic dissection with an intramural hematoma as seen on TEE\nFile:UOTW 17 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|Type A aortic dissection<ref name=UOTW17>{{cite web|title=UOTW #17 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-17/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=12 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509073340/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-17/|archivedate=9 May 2017}}</ref>\nFile:UOTW 17 - Ultrasound of the Week 2.webm|Type A aortic dissection<ref name=UOTW17/>\nFile:UOTW 55 - Ultrasound of the Week 4.webm|Dissection of both the thoracic and abdominal aorta<ref name=UOTW55>{{cite web|title=UOTW #55 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-55/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=8 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509143304/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-55/|archivedate=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nFile:UOTW 55 - Ultrasound of the Week 3.webm|Dissection of both the thoracic and abdominal aorta<ref name=UOTW55/>\n</gallery>\n\n===Aortogram===\n{{Main|Aortography}}\nAn aortogram involves placement of a catheter in the aorta and injection of contrast material while taking X-rays of the aorta.

One such classification is based on chronicity and labels aortic dissections as hyperacute (<24 hours duration), acute (2\u20137 days), subacute (8\u201330 days), and chronic (>30 days).<ref name=\"Lech2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Lech|first1=C|last2=Swaminathan|first2=A|title=Abdominal Aortic Emergencies|journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America|date=November 2017|volume=35|issue=4|pages=847\u201367|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2017.07.003|pmid=28987432}}</ref> The systems commonly in use are based on either the anatomy of the dissection or the duration of onset of symptoms prior to presentation. The Stanford system is used more commonly now, as it is more attuned to the management of the patient.\n\n====DeBakey====\nThe DeBakey system, named after cardiothoracic surgeon [[Michael E. DeBakey]], is an anatomical description of the aortic dissection. It categorizes the dissection based on where the original intimal tear is located and the extent of the dissection (localized to either the ascending aorta or descending aorta or involves both the ascending and descending aorta.<ref name=DeBakey1965/>\n*'''Type I''' \u2013 originates in ascending aorta, and propagates at least to the aortic arch and often beyond it distally. It is most often seen in patients less than 65 years of age and is the most lethal form of the disease. \n*'''Type II''' \u2013 originates in the ascending aorta and is confined to it.\n*'''Type III''' \u2013 originates in the descending aorta and rarely extends proximally, but will extend distally. It most often occurs in elderly patients with [[atherosclerosis]] and hypertension.\n\n====Stanford====\nThe Stanford classification is divided into two groups, A and B, depending on whether the ascending aorta is involved.<ref name=Daily1970/>\n*'''A''' \u2013 involves the ascending aorta and/or aortic arch, and possibly the descending aorta. The tear can originate in the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, or more rarely, in the descending aorta. It includes DeBakey types I and II.\n*'''B''' \u2013 involves the descending aorta or the arch (distal to the left subclavian artery), without the involvement of the ascending aorta. It includes DeBakey type III.\n\nThe Stanford classification is useful as it follows clinical practice, as type A ascending aortic dissections generally require primary surgical treatment, whereas type B dissections generally are treated medically as initial treatment with surgery reserved for any complications.\n\nThe reason for surgical repair of type A dissections is that ascending aortic dissections often involve the aortic valve, which, having lost its suspensory support, telescopes down into the aortic root, resulting in aortic incompetence. The valve must be resuspended in order to be reseated, as well as to repair or prevent coronary artery injury. Also, the area of dissection is removed and replaced with a Dacron graft to prevent further dissection from occurring. However, type B dissections are not improved, from a mortality point of view, by the operation, unless leaking, rupture, or compromise to other organs, e.g. kidneys, occurs.\n\n==Prevention==\nAmong the recognized risk factors for aortic dissection, hypertension, [[Dyslipidemia|abnormally high levels of lipids (such as cholesterol) in the blood]], and smoking tobacco are considered preventable risk factors.<ref name=Lancet2016/>\n\nRepair of an enlargement of the ascending aorta from an aneurysm or previously unrecognized and untreated aortic dissections is recommended when greater than {{convert|6|cm|1|abbr=on}} in size to decrease the risk of dissection. Repair may be recommended when greater than {{convert|4.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} in size if the person has one of the several connective-tissue disorders or a family history of a ruptured aorta.\n\n==Management==\nIn an acute dissection, treatment choice depends on its location. For Stanford type A (ascending aortic) dissection, surgical management is superior to medical management.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} For uncomplicated Stanford type B (distal aortic) dissections (including abdominal aortic dissections), medical management is preferred over surgery.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Complicated Stanford type B aortic dissections require surgical intervention after initiation of medical therapy.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe risk of death due to aortic dissection is highest in the first few hours after the dissection begins, and decreases afterward. Because of this, the therapeutic strategies differ for the treatment of an acute dissection compared to a chronic dissection. An acute dissection is one in which the individual presents within the first two weeks. If the individual has managed to survive this window period, his prognosis is improved. About 66% of all dissections present in the acute phase. Individuals who present two weeks after the onset of the dissection are said to have chronic aortic dissections.  These individuals have been self-selected as survivors of the acute episode and can be treated with medical therapy as long as they are stable.\n\n===Medication===\nAortic dissection generally presents as a hypertensive emergency, and the prime consideration of medical management is to decrease the [[shear force|shear stress]] in the aortic wall (dP/dt (force of ejection of blood from the [[left ventricle]])) by decreasing blood pressure and the heart rate. The target blood pressure should be a [[mean arterial pressure]] (MAP) of 60 to 75 [[mmHg]], or the lowest blood pressure tolerated. Initial decreases should be by about 20%.<ref name=White2013/> The target heart rate is less than 65 beats per minute. Long-term blood pressure control is required for every person who has experienced aortic dissection.\n\n[[Beta blockers]] are the first-line treatment for patients with acute and chronic aortic dissection. In acute dissection, fast-acting agents which can be given intravenously and have doses that are easier to adjust (such as [[esmolol]], [[propranolol]], or [[labetalol]]) are preferred. Vasodilators such as [[sodium nitroprusside]] can be considered for people with ongoing high blood pressure, but they should never be used alone, as they often stimulate a [[reflex tachycardia|reflexive increase in the heart rate]].\n\n[[Calcium channel blocker]]s can be used in the treatment of aortic dissection, particularly if a contraindication to the use of beta blockers exists.  The calcium channel blockers typically used are [[verapamil]] and [[diltiazem]], because of their combined vasodilator and negative [[inotropic]] effects.\n\nIf the individual has refractory hypertension (persistent hypertension on the maximum doses of three different classes of antihypertensive agents), an involvement of the renal arteries in the aortic dissection plane should be considered.\n\n===Surgical===\nIndications for the surgical treatment of aortic dissection include an acute proximal aortic dissection and an acute distal aortic dissection with one or more complications.  Complications include compromise of a vital organ, rupture or impending rupture of the aorta, retrograde dissection into the ascending aorta. These are more common with a history of Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n\nThe objective in the surgical management of aortic dissection is to resect (remove) the most severely damaged segments of the aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and any secondary tears along the vessel). While excision of the intimal tear may be performed, it does not significantly change mortality.\n\nThe particular treatment used depends on the segment or segments of aorta involved. Some treatments are:\n* [[Open aortic surgery]] with replacement of the damaged section of aorta with a tube graft (often made of [[Dacron]]) when no damage to the [[aortic valve]] is seen\n* [[Bentall procedure]] \u2014 replacement of the damaged section of aorta and replacement of the aortic valve\n* [[David procedure]] \u2014 replacement of the damaged section of aorta and reimplantation of the aortic valve\n* [[TEVAR|Thoracic endovascular aortic repair]], a minimally invasive surgical procedure usually combined with on-going medical management\n* Replacement of the damaged section of aorta with a sutureless [[vascular ring connector]]-reinforced Dacron graft: The vascular ring connector is a titanic ring used as a stent in the vascular graft to achieve a quick, blood-sealed, and sutureless anastomosis. Two furrows on the surface of the ring are for fixation of the vascular graft and the aorta. The tapes used to tie against the ring provide a larger contact surface area than the traditional stitches, thus it provides stronger anastomosis and better surgical results.\n\nA number of comorbid conditions increase the surgical risk of repair of an aortic dissection.  These conditions include the following:\n* Prolonged preoperative evaluation (increased length of time prior to surgery)\n* Advanced age\n* Comorbid disease states (e.g.: [[coronary artery disease]])\n* Aneurysm leakage\n* [[Cardiac tamponade]]\n* [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]]\n* Past history of myocardial infarction <!-- or CVA -->\n* History of [[kidney failure]] (either acute or chronic kidney failure)\n\n===Follow-up===\n[[File:TypeBdisectionlumonclosed.png|thumb|Closure of the lumen of a Type B aortic dissection following medical management]]\nThe long-term follow-up in individuals who survive aortic dissection involves strict blood pressure control.  The relative risk of late rupture of an [[aortic aneurysm]] is 10 times higher in individuals who have uncontrolled hypertension, compared to individuals with a systolic pressure below 130 mmHg.\n\nThe risk of death is highest in the first two years after the acute event, and individuals should be followed closely during this time period. About 29% of late deaths following surgery are due to rupture of either a dissecting aneurysm or another aneurysm. In addition, a 17% to 25% incidence exists of new aneurysm formation, typically due to dilatation of the residual false lumen. These new aneurysms are more likely to rupture, due to their thinner walls.\n\nSerial imaging of the aorta is suggested, with MRI being the preferred imaging technique.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nEstablishing the incidence of aortic dissection has been difficult because many cases are only diagnosed after death (which may have been attributed to another cause), and is often initially misdiagnosed. Aortic dissection affects an estimated 2.0\u20133.5 people per every 100,000 every year. Studies from Sweden suggest that the incidence of aortic dissection may be rising.<ref name=Olsson2006>{{cite journal | author1 = Olsson Ch. | author2 = Thelin S. | author3 = St\u00e5hle E. | author4 = Ekbom A. | author5 = Granath F. | year = 2006 | title = Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection.

It forms at the confluence of the [[Biya River|Biya]] and [[Katun River]]s which have their origins in the [[Altay Mountains]]. It is the westernmost of the three great Siberian rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean (the other two being the [[Yenisei River]] and the [[Lena River]]).\n\nThe [[Gulf of Ob]] is the world's longest [[estuary]].\n\n==Names==\nThe internationally known name of the river is based on the Russian name ''\u041e\u0431\u044c'' (''Ob\u02b9'' ). Possibly from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] ''[[Ap (water)|*H\u0101\u0301p-]]'', \"river, water\" (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] ''\u00e1p-'', [[Persian language|Persian]] ''\u0101b'', [[Tajik language|Tajik]] ''ob'', and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] ''ob\u0259'', \"water\"). Katz (1990)<ref>Katz, Hartmut. Zum Flu\u00dfnamen ''Ob''. \u2014 ''Specimena Sibirica III'', pp. 93\u201395. Wien.</ref> proposes [[Komi language|Komi]] ''ob'' 'river' as the immediate source of derivation for the Russian name. Katz's proposal of a common Finno-Ugric root, loaned early on from a pre-Indo-Iranian source related to Sanskrit ''ambhas-'' 'water' is deemed improbable by R\u00e9dei (1992),<ref>R\u00e9dei, K\u00e1roly. Sz\u00f3fejt\u00e9sek. \u2014 [http://www.nytud.hu/nyk/reg/093.pdf,''Nyelvtudom\u00e1nyi K\u00f6zlemenyek'' 93], pp. 125\u2013135.</ref> who prefers to analyze this as a later loan from a descendant of the non-nasal root form ''*H\u0101\u0301p-''.\n\nThe Ob is known to the [[Khanty people]] as the ''As'' (the source of the name \"[[Ostyak]]\"), ''Yag'', ''Kolta'' and ''Yema''; to the [[Nenets people]] as the ''Kolta'' or ''Kuay''; and to the [[Siberian Tatars]] as the ''Umar'' or ''Omass''.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Operational Navigation Chart C-4, 4th edition.jpg|thumb|left|Map including the mouth of the Ob River]]\nThe Ob forms {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Biysk]] in [[Altai Krai]] at the confluence of the [[Biya River|Biya]] and [[Katun River|Katun]] rivers. Both these streams have their origin in the [[Altay Mountains]], the Biya issuing from [[Lake Teletskoye]], the Katun, {{convert|700|km|mi}} long, bursting out of a glacier on [[Mount Byelukha]].\n\nThe Ob's entire main course is within Russia, though its tributaries extend into [[Kazakhstan]], China and Mongolia. The river splits into more than one arm, especially after joining the large [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] tributary at about 69\u00b0 E. (Originating in [[China]], the Irtysh is actually longer than the Ob from source to the point of their confluence.) From the source of the Irtysh to the mouth of the Ob, the river flow is the longest in Russia at 4,248 kilometers (2,640 mi). Other noteworthy tributaries are: from the east, the [[Tom River|Tom]], [[Chulym River (Ob)|Chulym]], [[Ket River|Ket]], [[Tym River|Tym]] and [[Vakh River|Vakh]] rivers; and, from the west and south, the [[Vasyugan River|Vasyugan]], Irtysh (with the [[Ishim River|Ishim]] and [[Tobol River|Tobol]] rivers), and [[Sosva River (Sverdlovsk Oblast)|Sosva River]]s.\n\nThe Ob zigzags west and north until it reaches 55\u00b0 N, where it curves round to the northwest, and again north, wheeling finally eastwards into the [[Gulf of Ob]], a {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=off|adj=mid|-long}} bay of the [[Kara Sea]], separating the [[Yamal Peninsula]] from the [[Gyda Peninsula]].\n\nThe combined Ob-Irtysh system, the [[List of rivers by length|fourth-longest river system]] of Asia (after [[Yenisei]], and China's [[Yangzi]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] rivers), is {{convert|5410|km|mi}} long, and the area of its basin {{convert|2990000|km2|mi2}}.\nThe river basin of the Ob consists mostly of [[steppe]], [[taiga]], swamps, [[tundra]], and [[semi-desert]] topography. The floodplains of the Ob are characterized by many tributaries and lakes.\nThe Ob is ice-bound at southern [[Barnaul]] from early in November to near the end of April, and at northern [[Salekhard]], {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} above its mouth, from the end of October to the beginning of June.\nThe Ob River crosses several climatic zones. The upper Ob valley, in the south, grows grapes, melons and watermelons, whereas the lower reaches of the Ob are Arctic tundra. The most comfortable climate for the rest on the Ob are [[Biysk]], Barnaul, and [[Novosibirsk]].\n\n[[File:Yenisei Ob Kara Sea.jpg|thumb|Yenisei and Ob (right) flow into Kara Sea]]\n\n==Human use==\n[[Image:Barnaul River Port.jpg|thumb|The Ob River in [[Barnaul]]]]\n[[Image:Ob river.jpg|thumb|A section of the Ob River]]\n\nThe Ob provides irrigation, drinking water, hydroelectric energy, and fishing (the river hosts more than 50 species of fish).\nThere are several hydroelectric power plants along the Ob river, the largest being Novosibirskaya GES<ref> {{cite web|url=https://goo.gl/maps/3MCD7ru2FDN2|title=Location of Novosibirskaya GES|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=1 July 2017 }}</ref> rated at 460 MW. \n\nThe navigable waters within the Ob basin reach a total length of {{convert|15000|km|abbr=on}}.\nThe importance of navigation in the Ob basin for transportation was particularly great before the completion of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], since, despite the general south-to-north direction of the flow of Ob and most of its tributaries, the width of the Ob basin provided for (somewhat indirect) transportation in the east\u2013west direction as well. Until the early 20th century, a particularly important western river-port was\n[[Tyumen]], located on the [[Tura River]], a tributary of the [[Tobol River|Tobol]]. Reached by an extension of the [[Ekaterinburg]]-[[Perm]] railway in 1885, and thus obtaining a rail link to the [[Kama River|Kama]] and [[Volga River|Volga]] rivers in the heart of [[Russia]], Tyumen became an important railhead for some years until the railway extended further east.\nIn the eastern reaches of the Ob basin, [[Tomsk]] on the [[Tom River]] functioned as an important terminus.\n\nTyumen had its first [[steamboat]] in 1836, and steamboats have navigated the middle reaches of the Ob since 1845. The first steamboat on the Ob, Nikita Myasnikov's ''Osnova'', was launched in 1844; the early starts were difficult, and it was not until 1857 that steamboat shipping started developing in the Ob system in a serious way. Steamboats started operating on the [[Yenisei]] in 1863, on the Lena and Amur in the 1870s. \nIn 1916 there were 49 steamers on the Ob; 10 on the Yenisei.\n\nIn an attempt to extend the Ob navigable system even further, a [[Ob-Yenisei Canal|system of canals]], utilizing the [[Ket River]], {{convert|900|km|abbr=on}} long in all, was built{{by whom?|date=April 2017}} in the late 19th-century to connect the Ob with the [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], but soon abandoned as being uncompetitive with the [[Trans-Siberian Railway|railway]].\n\nThe Trans-Siberian Railway, once completed, provided for more direct, year-round transportation in the east\u2013west direction. But the Ob river-system still remained important for connecting the huge expanses of [[Tyumen Oblast]] and [[Tomsk Oblast]] with the major cities along the Trans-Siberian route, such as Novosibirsk or [[Omsk]]. In the second half of the 20th century, construction of rail links to [[Labytnangi]], [[Tobolsk]], and the oil and gas cities of [[Surgut]], and [[Nizhnevartovsk]] provided more railheads, but did not diminish the importance of the waterways for reaching places still not served by the rail.\n\nA dam built near Novosibirsk in 1956 created the then-largest artificial lake in [[Siberia]], called [[Novosibirsk Reservoir]].\n\nFrom the 1960s through 1980s, Soviet engineers and administrators contemplated a gigantic project to [[Northern river reversal|divert some of the waters of Ob and Irtysh]] to [[Kazakhstan]] and the Soviet [[Central Asia]]n republics, replenishing the [[Aral Sea]] as well. The project never left the drawing board, abandoned in 1986 for economic and environmental considerations.<ref>Douglas R.

length|seventh-longest river]]. It forms at the confluence of the [[Biya River|Biya]] and [[Katun River]]s which have their origins in the [[Altay Mountains]]. It is the westernmost of the three great Siberian rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean (the other two being the [[Yenisei River]] and the [[Lena River]]).\n\nThe [[Gulf of Ob]] is the world's longest [[estuary]].\n\n==Names==\nThe internationally known name of the river is based on the Russian name ''\u041e\u0431\u044c'' (''Ob\u02b9'' ). Possibly from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] ''[[Ap (water)|*H\u0101\u0301p-]]'', \"river, water\" (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] ''\u00e1p-'', [[Persian language|Persian]] ''\u0101b'', [[Tajik language|Tajik]] ''ob'', and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] ''ob\u0259'', \"water\"). Katz (1990)<ref>Katz, Hartmut. Zum Flu\u00dfnamen ''Ob''. \u2014 ''Specimena Sibirica III'', pp. 93\u201395. Wien.</ref> proposes [[Komi language|Komi]] ''ob'' 'river' as the immediate source of derivation for the Russian name. Katz's proposal of a common Finno-Ugric root, loaned early on from a pre-Indo-Iranian source related to Sanskrit ''ambhas-'' 'water' is deemed improbable by R\u00e9dei (1992),<ref>R\u00e9dei, K\u00e1roly. Sz\u00f3fejt\u00e9sek. \u2014 [http://www.nytud.hu/nyk/reg/093.pdf,''Nyelvtudom\u00e1nyi K\u00f6zlemenyek'' 93], pp. 125\u2013135.</ref> who prefers to analyze this as a later loan from a descendant of the non-nasal root form ''*H\u0101\u0301p-''.\n\nThe Ob is known to the [[Khanty people]] as the ''As'' (the source of the name \"[[Ostyak]]\"), ''Yag'', ''Kolta'' and ''Yema''; to the [[Nenets people]] as the ''Kolta'' or ''Kuay''; and to the [[Siberian Tatars]] as the ''Umar'' or ''Omass''.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Operational Navigation Chart C-4, 4th edition.jpg|thumb|left|Map including the mouth of the Ob River]]\nThe Ob forms {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Biysk]] in [[Altai Krai]] at the confluence of the [[Biya River|Biya]] and [[Katun River|Katun]] rivers. Both these streams have their origin in the [[Altay Mountains]], the Biya issuing from [[Lake Teletskoye]], the Katun, {{convert|700|km|mi}} long, bursting out of a glacier on [[Mount Byelukha]].\n\nThe Ob's entire main course is within Russia, though its tributaries extend into [[Kazakhstan]], China and Mongolia. The river splits into more than one arm, especially after joining the large [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] tributary at about 69\u00b0 E. (Originating in [[China]], the Irtysh is actually longer than the Ob from source to the point of their confluence.) From the source of the Irtysh to the mouth of the Ob, the river flow is the longest in Russia at 4,248 kilometers (2,640 mi). Other noteworthy tributaries are: from the east, the [[Tom River|Tom]], [[Chulym River (Ob)|Chulym]], [[Ket River|Ket]], [[Tym River|Tym]] and [[Vakh River|Vakh]] rivers; and, from the west and south, the [[Vasyugan River|Vasyugan]], Irtysh (with the [[Ishim River|Ishim]] and [[Tobol River|Tobol]] rivers), and [[Sosva River (Sverdlovsk Oblast)|Sosva River]]s.\n\nThe Ob zigzags west and north until it reaches 55\u00b0 N, where it curves round to the northwest, and again north, wheeling finally eastwards into the [[Gulf of Ob]], a {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=off|adj=mid|-long}} bay of the [[Kara Sea]], separating the [[Yamal Peninsula]] from the [[Gyda Peninsula]].\n\nThe combined Ob-Irtysh system, the [[List of rivers by length|fourth-longest river system]] of Asia (after [[Yenisei]], and China's [[Yangzi]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] rivers), is {{convert|5410|km|mi}} long, and the area of its basin {{convert|2990000|km2|mi2}}.\nThe river basin of the Ob consists mostly of [[steppe]], [[taiga]], swamps, [[tundra]], and [[semi-desert]] topography. The floodplains of the Ob are characterized by many tributaries and lakes.\nThe Ob is ice-bound at southern [[Barnaul]] from early in November to near the end of April, and at northern [[Salekhard]], {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} above its mouth, from the end of October to the beginning of June.\nThe Ob River crosses several climatic zones. The upper Ob valley, in the south, grows grapes, melons and watermelons, whereas the lower reaches of the Ob are Arctic tundra. The most comfortable climate for the rest on the Ob are [[Biysk]], Barnaul, and [[Novosibirsk]].\n\n[[File:Yenisei Ob Kara Sea.jpg|thumb|Yenisei and Ob (right) flow into Kara Sea]]\n\n==Human use==\n[[Image:Barnaul River Port.jpg|thumb|The Ob River in [[Barnaul]]]]\n[[Image:Ob river.jpg|thumb|A section of the Ob River]]\n\nThe Ob provides irrigation, drinking water, hydroelectric energy, and fishing (the river hosts more than 50 species of fish).\nThere are several hydroelectric power plants along the Ob river, the largest being Novosibirskaya GES<ref> {{cite web|url=https://goo.gl/maps/3MCD7ru2FDN2|title=Location of Novosibirskaya GES|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=1 July 2017 }}</ref> rated at 460 MW. \n\nThe navigable waters within the Ob basin reach a total length of {{convert|15000|km|abbr=on}}.\nThe importance of navigation in the Ob basin for transportation was particularly great before the completion of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], since, despite the general south-to-north direction of the flow of Ob and most of its tributaries, the width of the Ob basin provided for (somewhat indirect) transportation in the east\u2013west direction as well. Until the early 20th century, a particularly important western river-port was\n[[Tyumen]], located on the [[Tura River]], a tributary of the [[Tobol River|Tobol]]. Reached by an extension of the [[Ekaterinburg]]-[[Perm]] railway in 1885, and thus obtaining a rail link to the [[Kama River|Kama]] and [[Volga River|Volga]] rivers in the heart of [[Russia]], Tyumen became an important railhead for some years until the railway extended further east.\nIn the eastern reaches of the Ob basin, [[Tomsk]] on the [[Tom River]] functioned as an important terminus.\n\nTyumen had its first [[steamboat]] in 1836, and steamboats have navigated the middle reaches of the Ob since 1845. The first steamboat on the Ob, Nikita Myasnikov's ''Osnova'', was launched in 1844; the early starts were difficult, and it was not until 1857 that steamboat shipping started developing in the Ob system in a serious way. Steamboats started operating on the [[Yenisei]] in 1863, on the Lena and Amur in the 1870s. \nIn 1916 there were 49 steamers on the Ob; 10 on the Yenisei.\n\nIn an attempt to extend the Ob navigable system even further, a [[Ob-Yenisei Canal|system of canals]], utilizing the [[Ket River]], {{convert|900|km|abbr=on}} long in all, was built{{by whom?|date=April 2017}} in the late 19th-century to connect the Ob with the [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], but soon abandoned as being uncompetitive with the [[Trans-Siberian Railway|railway]].\n\nThe Trans-Siberian Railway, once completed, provided for more direct, year-round transportation in the east\u2013west direction. But the Ob river-system still remained important for connecting the huge expanses of [[Tyumen Oblast]] and [[Tomsk Oblast]] with the major cities along the Trans-Siberian route, such as Novosibirsk or [[Omsk]]. In the second half of the 20th century, construction of rail links to [[Labytnangi]], [[Tobolsk]], and the oil and gas cities of [[Surgut]], and [[Nizhnevartovsk]] provided more railheads, but did not diminish the importance of the waterways for reaching places still not served by the rail.\n\nA dam built near Novosibirsk in 1956 created the then-largest artificial lake in [[Siberia]], called [[Novosibirsk Reservoir]].\n\nFrom the 1960s through 1980s, Soviet engineers and administrators contemplated a gigantic project to [[Northern river reversal|divert some of the waters of Ob and Irtysh]] to [[Kazakhstan]] and the Soviet [[Central Asia]]n republics, replenishing the [[Aral Sea]] as well. The project never left the drawing board, abandoned in 1986 for economic and environmental considerations.<ref>Douglas R.
