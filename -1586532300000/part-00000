He signed with the club as a teenager in 1938 and retired in 1961, having scored 228 goals in 534 appearances (placing Liddell fourth and 12th in the respective club rankings as of August 2010). He was Liverpool's leading goalscorer in the league in eight out of nine seasons from 1949\u201350 to 1957\u201358,<ref name=\"Stat\">Keith, John (2005), pp. 302\u20135</ref> and surpassed [[Elisha Scott]]'s club record for most league appearances in 1957.\n\nWith Liverpool, Liddell won a league championship in 1947 and featured in the club's [[1950 FA Cup Final]] defeat by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at international level on 29 occasions. While serving as a [[Royal Air Force]] navigator during the [[World War II|Second World War]], Liddell continued his career by appearing in unofficial games for Liverpool and guesting for various teams in the United Kingdom and Canada. After his retirement from football, in 1961, Liddell occupied himself as a [[Justice of the Peace]] (from 1958), [[bursar]] of [[Liverpool University]], and voluntary worker. He died in 2001.\n\nPrimarily a [[Midfielder#Winger|left winger]], Liddell's versatility enabled him to play comfortably on the opposite wing and as a striker, at [[Striker (association football)|centre]] and [[inside forward]]. Liddell became noted for his strong physique, acceleration, powerful shot,<ref name=\"LFCH\">[http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/359 Profile: Billy Liddell], lfchistory.net.

Retrieved 28 April 2008.</ref> He did not originally consider football as a viable profession, eventually choosing accountancy in preference to the civil service and church. His interest in football developed at a young age, which persuaded his parents, despite financial difficulties, to buy him a pair of football boots as a Christmas present when he asked for them aged seven. Liddell's participation in organised football began at age eight when he joined his school team, which had an average age of ten.<ref name=\"Keia\"/>\n\nAs a pupil at [[Dunfermline High School, Dunfermline|Dunfermline High School]], Liddell studied chemistry, mathematics, physics, English and two other languages. He became a reluctant rugby player, under the guidance of retired Welsh international [[Ronnie Boon]], while playing football for local teams and Scotland Schoolboys.<ref name=\"Keia\"/> By the age of 16, Liddell had progressed sufficiently to earn a contract with Lochgelly Violet football club and be sought after by Liverpool, [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]], and [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. Liverpool manager [[George Kay]] became interested in signing Liddell on the recommendation of the club's Scottish halfback [[Matt Busby]], who learned of the teenager from [[Manchester City|Manchester City's]] [[Alex Herd]] while on a golf trip. Herd had forwent one of their rounds to take [[Willie McAndrew]], manager of Hamilton, to watch Liddell play for Lochgelly. When Busby queried him about his absence and Liddell, Herd told him that a contract had not been agreed because limited resources prevented Hamilton from offering Liddell the assurances his parents insisted upon.<ref name=\"Keia\"/> Instead, Liddell signed for Liverpool as an amateur on 27 July 1938<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Stats/Article/2561|title=A timeline for Liverpool Football Club - LFChistory - Stats galore for Liverpool FC!|first=|last=LFChistory.net|website=www.lfchistory.net}}</ref> and became a professional in 1939 on a weekly wage of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]3.<ref name=\"Independent\"/> Negotiations between his parents and the club guaranteed, as a pre-requisite to acceptance, that Liverpool would permit Liddell to continue his accountancy studies, be housed in suitable accommodation, and be employed part-time an accountant at a company in the club's city.<ref name=\"LFCH\"/><ref name=\"Matthews\"/><ref>Keith, John (2005), p. 11</ref>\n\nLiddell entered the [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy|youth team]] on his arrival in 1938. Before he established himself in the side, Liddell had been frustrated at the frequent rotation of players until trainer [[Bert Shelley|Albert Shelley]] advised him to be patient. An injury incurred against [[Blackburn Rovers]] threatened to end his career prematurely. He had struck his knee against concrete near the corner flag after being challenged while running with the ball. Doctors informed him of the extent of tissue damage, causing Liddell anxiety about his future. He remained in [[Blackburn]] for two weeks, living in the family home of a colleague, before returning to Liverpool to continue his recovery.<ref>Keith, John (2005), pp. 16\u20137</ref> The [[World War II|Second World War]] precluded an official debut for Liddell, as [[the Football Association]] suspended competitive football from the abandoned [[1939-40 in English football|1939\u20131940]] season and instituted a regional system in its place.<ref>Anderson, Jeff (2004), p. 48</ref> Until the cessation of hostilities in 1945, Liddell guested for various domestic sides when unavailable for Liverpool and represented select teams, including a Football Association XI and Scottish Services XI.

He signed with the club as a teenager in 1938 and retired in 1961, having scored 228 goals in 534 appearances (placing Liddell fourth and 12th in the respective club rankings as of August 2010). He was Liverpool's leading goalscorer in the league in eight out of nine seasons from 1949\u201350 to 1957\u201358,<ref name=\"Stat\">Keith, John (2005), pp. 302\u20135</ref> and surpassed [[Elisha Scott]]'s club record for most league appearances in 1957.\n\nWith Liverpool, Liddell won a league championship in 1947 and featured in the club's [[1950 FA Cup Final]] defeat by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at international level on 29 occasions. While serving as a [[Royal Air Force]] navigator during the [[World War II|Second World War]], Liddell continued his career by appearing in unofficial games for Liverpool and guesting for various teams in the United Kingdom and Canada. After his retirement from football, in 1961, Liddell occupied himself as a [[Justice of the Peace]] (from 1958), [[bursar]] of [[Liverpool University]], and voluntary worker. He died in 2001.\n\nPrimarily a [[Midfielder#Winger|left winger]], Liddell's versatility enabled him to play comfortably on the opposite wing and as a striker, at [[Striker (association football)|centre]] and [[inside forward]].

Retrieved 28 April 2008.</ref> He did not originally consider football as a viable profession, eventually choosing accountancy in preference to the civil service and church. His interest in football developed at a young age, which persuaded his parents, despite financial difficulties, to buy him a pair of football boots as a Christmas present when he asked for them aged seven. Liddell's participation in organised football began at age eight when he joined his school team, which had an average age of ten.<ref name=\"Keia\"/>\n\nAs a pupil at [[Dunfermline High School, Dunfermline|Dunfermline High School]], Liddell studied chemistry, mathematics, physics, English and two other languages. He became a reluctant rugby player, under the guidance of retired Welsh international [[Ronnie Boon]], while playing football for local teams and Scotland Schoolboys.<ref name=\"Keia\"/> By the age of 16, Liddell had progressed sufficiently to earn a contract with Lochgelly Violet football club and be sought after by Liverpool, [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]], and [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. Liverpool manager [[George Kay]] became interested in signing Liddell on the recommendation of the club's Scottish halfback [[Matt Busby]], who learned of the teenager from [[Manchester City|Manchester City's]] [[Alex Herd]] while on a golf trip. Herd had forwent one of their rounds to take [[Willie McAndrew]], manager of Hamilton, to watch Liddell play for Lochgelly. When Busby queried him about his absence and Liddell, Herd told him that a contract had not been agreed because limited resources prevented Hamilton from offering Liddell the assurances his parents insisted upon.<ref name=\"Keia\"/> Instead, Liddell signed for Liverpool as an amateur on 27 July 1938<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Stats/Article/2561|title=A timeline for Liverpool Football Club - LFChistory - Stats galore for Liverpool FC!|first=|last=LFChistory.net|website=www.lfchistory.net}}</ref> and became a professional in 1939 on a weekly wage of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]3.<ref name=\"Independent\"/> Negotiations between his parents and the club guaranteed, as a pre-requisite to acceptance, that Liverpool would permit Liddell to continue his accountancy studies, be housed in suitable accommodation, and be employed part-time an accountant at a company in the club's city.<ref name=\"LFCH\"/><ref name=\"Matthews\"/><ref>Keith, John (2005), p. 11</ref>\n\nLiddell entered the [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy|youth team]] on his arrival in 1938. Before he established himself in the side, Liddell had been frustrated at the frequent rotation of players until trainer [[Bert Shelley|Albert Shelley]] advised him to be patient. An injury incurred against [[Blackburn Rovers]] threatened to end his career prematurely. He had struck his knee against concrete near the corner flag after being challenged while running with the ball. Doctors informed him of the extent of tissue damage, causing Liddell anxiety about his future. He remained in [[Blackburn]] for two weeks, living in the family home of a colleague, before returning to Liverpool to continue his recovery.<ref>Keith, John (2005), pp. 16\u20137</ref> The [[World War II|Second World War]] precluded an official debut for Liddell, as [[the Football Association]] suspended competitive football from the abandoned [[1939-40 in English football|1939\u20131940]] season and instituted a regional system in its place.<ref>Anderson, Jeff (2004), p. 48</ref> Until the cessation of hostilities in 1945, Liddell guested for various domestic sides when unavailable for Liverpool and represented select teams, including a Football Association XI and Scottish Services XI.

This is the value of all final [[goods and services]] produced within a nation in a given year, converted at market [[exchange rate]]s to current [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], divided by the average population for the same year.\n\nThe figures presented here do not take into account differences in the [[cost of living]] in different countries, and the results vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the [[exchange rate]]s of the country's [[currency]]. Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\n\nTherefore, these figures should be used with caution. GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's [[standard of living]];<ref>{{citation |title=O'Sullivan, Arthur}}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/14/sarkozy-attacks-gdp-focus French President seeks alternatives to GDP], [[The Guardian]] 14-09-2009.<br/>{{cite web|url= http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/download/bgdp-bp-goossens.pdf |title=European Parliament, Policy Department Economic and Scientific Policy: Beyond GDP Study }}&nbsp;{{small|(1.47&nbsp;MB)}}</ref> although this is problematic because GDP per capita [[Gross domestic product#Standard of living and GDP: Wealth distribution and externalities|is not a measure of personal income]].\n\nComparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (''See'' [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]].) PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in [[international trade]], and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n\nNon-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some [[dependent territory|dependent territories]]) and states with limited international recognition (such as [[Kosovo]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Taiwan]]) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in ''italics''.\n\nNote that the Irish GDP data below is subject to material distortion by the [[Tax avoidance|tax planning]] activities of foreign multinationals in Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is over 150% of 2015 Irish GNI. To address this, in 2017 the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] created \"[[Modified gross national income|modified GNI]]\" (or GNI*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is 143% of 2015 Irish GNI*.\n\nAll data are in current [[United States dollar|United States dollars]].

This is the value of all final [[goods and services]] produced within a nation in a given year, converted at market [[exchange rate]]s to current [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], divided by the average population for the same year.\n\nThe figures presented here do not take into account differences in the [[cost of living]] in different countries, and the results vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the [[exchange rate]]s of the country's [[currency]]. Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\n\nTherefore, these figures should be used with caution. GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's [[standard of living]];<ref>{{citation |title=O'Sullivan, Arthur}}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/14/sarkozy-attacks-gdp-focus French President seeks alternatives to GDP], [[The Guardian]] 14-09-2009.<br/>{{cite web|url= http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/download/bgdp-bp-goossens.pdf |title=European Parliament, Policy Department Economic and Scientific Policy: Beyond GDP Study }}&nbsp;{{small|(1.47&nbsp;MB)}}</ref> although this is problematic because GDP per capita [[Gross domestic product#Standard of living and GDP: Wealth distribution and externalities|is not a measure of personal income]].\n\nComparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (''See'' [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]].) PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in [[international trade]], and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n\nNon-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some [[dependent territory|dependent territories]]) and states with limited international recognition (such as [[Kosovo]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Taiwan]]) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in ''italics''.\n\nNote that the Irish GDP data below is subject to material distortion by the [[Tax avoidance|tax planning]] activities of foreign multinationals in Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is over 150% of 2015 Irish GNI. To address this, in 2017 the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] created \"[[Modified gross national income|modified GNI]]\" (or GNI*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is 143% of 2015 Irish GNI*.\n\nAll data are in current [[United States dollar|United States dollars]].

The conflict killed about 250,000 people<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13729504</ref> and eventually led to the involvement of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and of the [[United Nations]]. The peace did not last long, and in 1999 the [[Second Liberian Civil War]] broke out.\n\n[[Samuel Doe]] had led a rebellion that overthrew the elected government in 1980, and in [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 held elections]] that were widely considered fraudulent. There had been one unsuccessful coup by a former military leader. In December 1989, former government minister [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] moved into the country from neighboring [[Ivory Coast]] to start an uprising meant to topple the Doe government.\n\nTaylor's forces, the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL) battled with [[Prince Johnson]]'s rebel group, the [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL) \u2013 a faction of NPFL \u2013 for control in Monrovia. In 1990, Johnson seized the capital of [[Monrovia]] and executed Doe brutally.\n\nPeace negotiations and foreign involvement led to a ceasefire in 1995 that was broken the next year before a final peace agreement and new national elections were held in 1997. Taylor was elected [[President of Liberia]] in July 1997.\n\n==Backgrong==\n[[File:Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger - Samuel K. Doe.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Samuel Doe]] with then Secretary of Defense of the United States [[Caspar W. Weinberger]] outside of the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1982.]]\n\n=== Samuel Doe takes power in coup (1980) ===\n[[Samuel Doe]] had taken power in a popular rebellion in 1980 against the Liberian Government, becoming the first Liberian President of non [[Americo-Liberian]] descent. Doe established a military regime called the [[People's Representative]] and enjoyed Liberian ethnic groups who were denied power since the founding of the country in 1847\n\nAny hope that Doe would improve the way Liberia was run was put aside as he quickly clamped down on opposition, fueled by his paranoia of a counter-coup attempt against him. As promised, Doe held [[Liberian general election, 1985|elections in 1985]] and won the presidency by just enough of a margin to avoid a runoff. However, international monitors condemned this election as fraudulent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1985/1025/olib.html|title=Fraud charged in Liberia's first one-man, one-vote election|date=1985-10-25|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-10-17|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Coup attempt by Thomas Johnson (November 1985) ===\n[[Thomas Johnson]], the former Commanding General of the Armed Forces of Liberia whom Doe had demoted and forced to flee the country, attempted to overthrow Doe's regime from neighboring [[Sierra Leone]].

''Daily Star'' 1985-11-18: 5.</ref>\n\n=== Mistreatment of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups (1985) ===\nThe Gio and Mano ethnic groups were persecuted against because they were charged with treason against the state. Thus, they were seen as inferiors to the President's own tribe, the Krahn. The mistreatment of the Gio and Mano increased the tensions in Liberia, which had already been rising due to Doe's preferential treatment of his own group.\n\n=== Charles Taylor builds insurgent forces (1985-1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], who had left Doe's government after being accused of embezzlement, assembled a group of rebels in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (mostly ethnic Gios and Manos who felt persecuted by Doe) who later became known as the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL). They invaded Nimba County on 24 December 1989. The Liberian Army retaliated against the whole population of the region, attacking unarmed civilians and burning villages. Many left as refugees for [[Guinea]] and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but opposition to Doe was inflamed. [[Prince Johnson]], an NPFL fighter, split to form his own [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] force soon after crossing the border, based on the [[Gio Tribe|Gio tribe]] and named [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL).\n\n==First Liberian Civil War (1989-1997)==\n\n=== Charles Taylor's force attacks (1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] organized and trained indigenous northerners in [[Ivory Coast]]. During Doe's regime Taylor had served in the Liberian Government's General Services Agency, acting  'as its ''de facto'' director'.<ref>Stephen Ellis, ''The Mask of Anarchy'', Hurst & Company, London, 2001, p.57, 67-68</ref> He fled to the United States in 1983 amid what Stephan Ellis describes as the 'increasingly menacing atmosphere in Monrovia' shortly before [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], Doe's chief lieutenant, fled into exile himself. Doe requested Taylor's extradition for embezzling $900,000 of Liberian government funds. Taylor was thus arrested in the United States and after sixteen months broke out of a Massachusetts jail in circumstances that are still unclear.\n\n=== Krahn vs Gio and Mano ethnic groups ===\nThe NPFL initially encountered plenty of support within Nimba County, which had endured the majority of Samuel Doe's wrath after the 1985 attempted coup. Taylor and his force of 100 rebels reentered Liberia in 1989, on Christmas Eve, thousands of Gio and Mano joined them. Doe responded by sending two AFL battalions, including the 1st Infantry Battalion,<ref>HRW, Flight from Terror, May 1990</ref> to Nimba in December 1989-January 1990,<ref>Charles Hartung, 'Peacekeeping in Liberia: ECOMOG and the Struggle for Order,' Liberian Studies Journal, Volume XXX, No.2, 2005</ref> apparently under then-Colonel Hezekiah Bowen.<ref>Mark Huband, The Liberian Civil War, p.115, 118-119</ref>\n\nThe AFL acted in a very brutal and scorched-earth fashion, which quickly alienated the local people. The rebel invasion soon pitted [[Krahn people|ethnic Krahn]] sympathetic to the Doe regime against those victimized by it, the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] and the Mano. Thousands of civilians were massacred on both sides. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes. The [[Monrovia Church massacre]] was carried out by approximately 30 ethnic Krahn government soldiers, killing 600 civilians in St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Monrovia, on 29 July 1990, the worst single atrocity of the First Liberian Civil War.<ref name=\"Bbcnews\" >{{cite news |date=12 February 2018|title=Liberian church massacre survivors seek US justice|trans-title=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42996851|language= |work=[[BBC News]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nytimes\" >{{cite news |date=31 July 1990|title=Liberia Troops Accused Of Massacre in Church|trans-title=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/world/liberia-troops-accused-of-massacre-in-church.html|language= |work=[[The New York Times]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBy May 1990 the AFL had been forced back to [[Gbarnga]], still under the control of Bowen's troops, but they lost the town to a NPFL assault on 28 May.<ref>Hubard, p.115</ref> By June 1990, Taylor's forces were laying siege to Monrovia.  In July 1990, [[Prince Yormie Johnson]] split from Taylor and formed the Independent National Patriotic Front (INPFL). The INPFL and NPFL continued their siege on Monrovia, which the AFL defended. Johnson quickly took control of parts of Monrovia prompting evacuation of foreign nationals and diplomats by the US Navy in August.\n\n=== ECOWAS intervention force (August 1990) ===\nIn August 1990, the 16-member [[ECOWAS|Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)]] agreed to deploy a joint military intervention force, the Economic Community Monitoring Group ([[ECOMOG]]), and place it under Nigerian leadership. The mission later included troops from non-ECOWAS countries, including Uganda and Tanzania. ECOMOG's objectives were to impose a cease-fire; help Liberians establish an interim government until elections could be held; stop the killing of innocent civilians; and ensure the safe evacuation of foreign nationals.\n\nECOMOG also sought to prevent the conflict from spreading into neighboring states, which share a complex history of state, economic, and ethno-linguistic social relations with Liberia. The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) attempted to persuade Doe to resign and go into exile, but despite his weak position&nbsp;\u2013 besieged in his mansion&nbsp;\u2013 he refused. [[ECOMOG]], an ECOWAS intervention force, arrived at the Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels.<ref>Adebajo, 2002, p.75</ref>\n\n=== Capture and killing of Samuel Doe (September 1990) ===\n[[File:Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia in Monrovia 1990.png|thumb|300px|[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia|INPFL]] militiamen in 1990 after taking control of much of [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nOn 9 September 1990, Doe visited the barely established, newly arrived ECOMOG headquarters in the Free Port of Maher. Stephen Ellis says,<ref>''The Mask of Anarchy'', by Stephen Ellis, 2001, p.1-9</ref> his motive was to lay a complaint that the ECOMOG commander had not paid a courtesy call to Doe, the Head of State, however, the exact circumstances that led to Doe's visit to the Free Port are still unclear. Doe had been under pressure to accept exile outside of Liberia. However, after Doe arrived, a large rebel force led by Prince Johnson's INPFL arrived at the headquarters and then attacked Doe's party. Doe was captured and taken to the INPFL's Caldwell base. He was brutally tortured before being killed and dismembered. His torture and execution was videotaped by his captors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |title=Liberia: Chronology |accessdate=2007-02-26 |last=Armon |first=Jeremy |author2=Andy Carl |year=1996 |work=Conciliation Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308142809/http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |archive-date=8 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=MASK>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Stephen|title=The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of African Civil War|origyear=1999|year=2007|publisher=Hurst & Company|location=London, UK|isbn=1850654174|pages=1\u201316}}</ref>\n\nJohnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL continued to struggle for control of Monrovia in the months that followed.  With military discipline absent and bloodshed throughout the capital region, members of ECOWAS created the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to restore order. The force comprised some 4,000 troops from [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Sierra Leone]], the [[Gambia]] and [[Guinea]]. ECOMOG succeeded in bringing Taylor and Johnson to agree to its intervention, but Taylor's forces engaged it in the port area of Monrovia.\n\n=== Peace making attempts (1990) ===\nA series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June\u2013October 1991. But the first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes failed. In November 1990, ECOWAS invited the principal Liberian players to meet in [[Banjul]], Gambia to form a government of national unity. The negotiated settlement established the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), led by [[Amos Sawyer|Dr. Amos Sawyer]], leader of the LPP. Bishop Ronald Diggs of the Liberian Council of Churches became vice president. However, Taylor's NPFL refused to attend the conference. Within days, hostilities resumed.  ECOMOG was reinforced in order to protect the interim government. Sawyer was able to establish his authority over most of Monrovia, but the rest of Liberia was in the hands of various factions of the NPFL or of local gangs.\n\n===ULIMO===\nThe [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO) was formed in June 1991 by supporters of the late [[President of Liberia|President]] [[Samuel K. Doe]] and former [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL) fighters who had taken refuge in [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. It was led by Raleigh Seekie, a deputy [[Minister of Finance]] in the Doe government.\n\nAfter fighting alongside the Sierra Leonean army against the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF), ULIMO forces entered western Liberia in September 1991. The group scored significant gains in areas held by another rebel group&nbsp;\u2013 the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL), notably around the diamond mining areas of [[Lofa County|Lofa]] and [[Bomi County|Bomi]] [[Counties of Liberia|counties]].\n\nFrom its outset, ULIMO was beset with internal divisions and the group effectively broke into two separate militias in 1994: [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction|ULIMO-J]], an ethnic [[Krahn]] faction led by General [[Roosevelt Johnson]] and [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction|ULIMO-K]], a [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]]-based faction led by [[Alhaji G.V. Kromah]].\n\nThe group was alleged to have committed serious violations of [[human rights]], both before and after its breakup.\n\n=== Attack on Monrovia (1992) ===\nPeace was still far off as both Taylor and Johnson claimed power.  ECOMOG declared an Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) with [[Amos Sawyer]] as their president, with the broad support of Johnson.  Taylor launched an assault on Monrovia on October 15, 1992, named 'Operation Octopus.'<ref>See Ellis, Mask of Anarchy, 98-99.</ref> which  may have been led by Burkina Faso soldiers.<ref>Herbert Howe, Ambiguous Order, 2005, 143.</ref> The resulting siege lasted two months.\n\nBy late December, ECOMOG had pushed the NPFL back beyond Monrovia's suburbs.\n\n===UNOMIL===\n{{main article|UNOMIL}}\nIn 1993, ECOWAS brokered a peace agreement in [[Cotonou]], Benin. Following this, on September 22, 1993, the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council established the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), to support ECOMOG in implementing this peace agreement. UNOMIL was deployed in early 1994 with 368 military observers and associated civilian personnel to monitor implementation of the Cotonou Peace Agreement, prior to elections originally planned for February/March 1994.\n\nRenewed armed hostilities broke out in May 1994 and continued, becoming especially intense in July and August. ECOMOG, and later UNOMIL, members were captured and held hostage by some factions. By mid-1994, the humanitarian situation had become disastrous, with 1.8 million Liberians in need of humanitarian assistance. Conditions continued to deteriorate, but humanitarian agencies were unable to reach many in need due to hostilities and general insecurity.\n\nFactional leaders agreed in September 1994 to the Akosombo Agreement, a supplement to the Cotonou agreement, named after the Ghanaian town where it was signed. The security situation in Liberia remained poor. In October 1994, in the face of ECOMOG funding shortfalls and a lack of will by the Liberian combatants to honor agreements to end the war, the UN Security Council reduced to about 90 the number of UNOMIL observers. It extended UNOMIL's mandate and subsequently extended it several times until September 1997.\n\nIn December 1994, the factions and other parties signed the Accra Agreement, a supplement to the Akosombo Agreement. Disagreements ensued and fighting continued.\n\n===Ceasefire (1995)===\nIn August 1995, the main factions signed an agreement largely brokered by Ghanaian President [[Jerry Rawlings]]. At a conference sponsored by ECOWAS, the United Nations and the United States, the European Union, and the [[Organization of African Unity]], Charles Taylor agreed to a cease-fire.\n\nAt the beginning of September 1995, Liberia's three principal warlords&nbsp;\u2013 Taylor, [[George Boley]] and [[Alhaji Kromah]]&nbsp;\u2013 made theatrical entrances into Monrovia. A ruling council of six members under civilian [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]] and with the three factional heads Taylor, Kromah and Boley, took control of the country preparatory to elections that were originally scheduled for 1996.\n\n=== Fighting in Monrovia (1996) ===\n[[File:National Patriotic Liberation Front fighters in Monrovia 1996.png|thumb|300px|[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]] fighters search for [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy|ULIMO]] militants in [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nHeavy fighting broke out again in April 1996. This led to the evacuation of most international [[non-governmental organization]]s and the destruction of much of Monrovia.\n\nIn August 1996, these battles were ended by the [[Abuja]] Accord in Nigeria, agreeing to [[disarmament]] and [[demobilization]] by 1997 and [[Liberia elections, 1997|elections]] in July of that year. 3 September 1996, Sankawulo is followed by [[Ruth Perry]] as chairwoman of the ruling council, who served until 2 August 1997.\n\n=== 1997 Elections ===\n{{Main|1997 Liberian general election}}\nSimultaneous elections for the [[Liberia elections, 1997#Presidential election results|presidency]] and [[Liberia elections, 1997#Legislative election results|national assembly]] were finally held in July 1997.\nIn a climate hardly conducive to free movement and security of persons, Taylor and his [[National Patriotic Party]] won an overwhelming victory against 12 other candidates.  Assisted by widespread intimidation, Taylor took 75 per cent of the presidential poll (no other candidate won more than 10 per cent) while the NPP won a similar proportion of seats in both parliamentary chambers. 2 August 1997, Ruth Perry handed power to elected president Charles Taylor.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|1998 Monrovia clashes}}\n\nIn 1997, the Liberian people elected Charles Taylor as the President after he entered the capital city, [[Monrovia]], by force. Liberians had voted for Taylor in the hope that he would end the bloodshed.  The bloodshed did slow considerably, but it did not end. Violent events flared up regularly after the putative end of the war. Taylor, furthermore, was accused of backing guerrillas in neighboring countries and funneling diamond money into arms purchases for the rebel armies he supported, and into luxuries for himself. The implicit unrest manifested during the late 1990s is emblematic in the sharp national economic decline and the prevalent sale of diamonds and timber in exchange for small arms.\n\nAfter Taylor's victory, Liberia was peaceful enough so that refugees began to return. But other leaders were forced to leave the country, and some ULIMO forces reformed as the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD). LURD began fighting in [[Lofa County]] with the aim of destabilizing the government and gaining control of the local [[diamond]] fields, leading to the [[Second Liberian Civil War]].\n\n===Impact===\nThe Liberian civil war was one of Africa's bloodiest. From 1989-1996, it claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and further displaced a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries. [[Child soldier]]s were used throughout the war.\n\nThe civil war claimed the lives of one out of every 17 people in the country, uprooted most of the rest, and destroyed a once-viable economic infrastructure.  The strife also spread to Liberia's neighbors. It helped slow democratization in West Africa at the beginning of the 1990s and destabilized a region that already was one of the world's most unsteady.\n\n==Second Liberian Civil War==\nThe [[Second Liberian Civil War]] began in 1999 and ended in October 2003, when [[ECOWAS]] intervened to stop the [[Siege of Monrovia|rebel siege]] on Monrovia and exiled Charles Taylor to Nigeria until he was arrested in 2006 and taken to [[The Hague]] for his trial. By the conclusion of the final war, more than 250,000 people had been killed and nearly 1 million displaced. Half that number remain to be repatriated in 2005, at the election of Liberia's first democratic President since the initial 1980 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of Samuel Doe.\n\nFormer president [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], who initially was a strong supporter of Charles Taylor, was inaugurated in January 2006 and the National Transitional Government of Liberia terminated its power.\n\nCharles Taylor's Trial\nCharles Taylor was sentenced to a trial in 2003, after being accused of rape and acts of sexual violence, pormoting child soldiers, and an illegal ownership of weapons. He denied these accusations but was eventually testified against by his victims. He was then senteced to 50 years in prison. \n== Lists ==\n\n===Armed groups that participated in the war===\n*[[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL)\n*[[Liberia Peace Council]] (LPC)\n*[[Lofa Defense Force]] (LDF)\n*[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL)\n**[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL)\n**[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia-Central Revolutionary Council]] (NPFL-CRC)\n*[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction]] (ULIMO-J)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction]] (ULIMO-K)\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n=== Peace agreements ===\nPeace agreements signed included the:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=94&value=#|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program}}</ref> \n*Banjul III Agreement (1990-10-24)\n*Bamako Ceasefire Agreement (1990-11-28)\n*Banjul IV Agreement (1990-12-21)\n*Lom\u00e9 Agreement (1991-02-13)\n*Yamoussoukro IV Peace Agreement (1991-10-30)\n*Geneva Agreement 1992 (1992-04-07)\n*Cotonou Peace Agreement (1993-07-25)\n*Akosombo Peace Agreement (1994-09-12)\n*Accra Agreements/Akosombo clarification agreement (1994-12-21)\n*Abuja Peace Agreement (1995-08-19)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Second Liberian Civil War]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[History of Liberia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gerdes, Felix: Civil War and State Formation: The Political Economy of War and Peace in Liberia, Frankfurt/New York: Campus Verlag & University of Chicago Press, 2013\n*Hoffman, Danny. \"The City as Barracks: Freetown, Monrovia, and the Organization of Violence in Postcolonial African Cities.\" Cultural Anthropology.

The conflict killed about 250,000 people<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13729504</ref> and eventually led to the involvement of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and of the [[United Nations]]. The peace did not last long, and in 1999 the [[Second Liberian Civil War]] broke out.\n\n[[Samuel Doe]] had led a rebellion that overthrew the elected government in 1980, and in [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 held elections]] that were widely considered fraudulent. There had been one unsuccessful coup by a former military leader. In December 1989, former government minister [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] moved into the country from neighboring [[Ivory Coast]] to start an uprising meant to topple the Doe government.\n\nTaylor's forces, the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL) battled with [[Prince Johnson]]'s rebel group, the [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL) \u2013 a faction of NPFL \u2013 for control in Monrovia. In 1990, Johnson seized the capital of [[Monrovia]] and executed Doe brutally.\n\nPeace negotiations and foreign involvement led to a ceasefire in 1995 that was broken the next year before a final peace agreement and new national elections were held in 1997. Taylor was elected [[President of Liberia]] in July 1997.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger - Samuel K. Doe.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Samuel Doe]] with then Secretary of Defense of the United States [[Caspar W. Weinberger]] outside of the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1982.]]\n\n=== Samuel Doe takes power in coup (1980) ===\n[[Samuel Doe]] had taken power in a popular rebellion in 1980 against the Liberian Government, becoming the first Liberian President of non [[Americo-Liberian]] descent. Doe established a military regime called the [[People's Representative]] and enjoyed Liberian ethnic groups who were denied power since the founding of the country in 1847\n\nAny hope that Doe would improve the way Liberia was run was put aside as he quickly clamped down on opposition, fueled by his paranoia of a counter-coup attempt against him. As promised, Doe held [[Liberian general election, 1985|elections in 1985]] and won the presidency by just enough of a margin to avoid a runoff. However, international monitors condemned this election as fraudulent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1985/1025/olib.html|title=Fraud charged in Liberia's first one-man, one-vote election|date=1985-10-25|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-10-17|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Coup attempt by Thomas Johnson (November 1985) ===\n[[Thomas Johnson]], the former Commanding General of the Armed Forces of Liberia whom Doe had demoted and forced to flee the country, attempted to overthrow Doe's regime from neighboring [[Sierra Leone]].

''Daily Star'' 1985-11-18: 5.</ref>\n\n=== Mistreatment of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups (1985) ===\nThe Gio and Mano ethnic groups were persecuted against because they were charged with treason against the state. Thus, they were seen as inferiors to the President's own tribe, the Krahn. The mistreatment of the Gio and Mano increased the tensions in Liberia, which had already been rising due to Doe's preferential treatment of his own group.\n\n=== Charles Taylor builds insurgent forces (1985-1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], who had left Doe's government after being accused of embezzlement, assembled a group of rebels in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (mostly ethnic Gios and Manos who felt persecuted by Doe) who later became known as the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL). They invaded Nimba County on 24 December 1989. The Liberian Army retaliated against the whole population of the region, attacking unarmed civilians and burning villages. Many left as refugees for [[Guinea]] and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but opposition to Doe was inflamed. [[Prince Johnson]], an NPFL fighter, split to form his own [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] force soon after crossing the border, based on the [[Gio Tribe|Gio tribe]] and named [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL).\n\n==First Liberian Civil War (1989-1997)==\n\n=== Charles Taylor's force attacks (1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] organized and trained indigenous northerners in [[Ivory Coast]]. During Doe's regime Taylor had served in the Liberian Government's General Services Agency, acting  'as its ''de facto'' director'.<ref>Stephen Ellis, ''The Mask of Anarchy'', Hurst & Company, London, 2001, p.57, 67-68</ref> He fled to the United States in 1983 amid what Stephan Ellis describes as the 'increasingly menacing atmosphere in Monrovia' shortly before [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], Doe's chief lieutenant, fled into exile himself. Doe requested Taylor's extradition for embezzling $900,000 of Liberian government funds. Taylor was thus arrested in the United States and after sixteen months broke out of a Massachusetts jail in circumstances that are still unclear.\n\n=== Krahn vs Gio and Mano ethnic groups ===\nThe NPFL initially encountered plenty of support within Nimba County, which had endured the majority of Samuel Doe's wrath after the 1985 attempted coup. Taylor and his force of 100 rebels reentered Liberia in 1989, on Christmas Eve, thousands of Gio and Mano joined them. Doe responded by sending two AFL battalions, including the 1st Infantry Battalion,<ref>HRW, Flight from Terror, May 1990</ref> to Nimba in December 1989-January 1990,<ref>Charles Hartung, 'Peacekeeping in Liberia: ECOMOG and the Struggle for Order,' Liberian Studies Journal, Volume XXX, No.2, 2005</ref> apparently under then-Colonel Hezekiah Bowen.<ref>Mark Huband, The Liberian Civil War, p.115, 118-119</ref>\n\nThe AFL acted in a very brutal and scorched-earth fashion, which quickly alienated the local people. The rebel invasion soon pitted [[Krahn people|ethnic Krahn]] sympathetic to the Doe regime against those victimized by it, the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] and the Mano. Thousands of civilians were massacred on both sides. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes. The [[Monrovia Church massacre]] was carried out by approximately 30 ethnic Krahn government soldiers, killing 600 civilians in St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Monrovia, on 29 July 1990, the worst single atrocity of the First Liberian Civil War.<ref name=\"Bbcnews\" >{{cite news |date=12 February 2018|title=Liberian church massacre survivors seek US justice|trans-title=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42996851|language= |work=[[BBC News]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nytimes\" >{{cite news |date=31 July 1990|title=Liberia Troops Accused Of Massacre in Church|trans-title=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/world/liberia-troops-accused-of-massacre-in-church.html|language= |work=[[The New York Times]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBy May 1990 the AFL had been forced back to [[Gbarnga]], still under the control of Bowen's troops, but they lost the town to a NPFL assault on 28 May.<ref>Hubard, p.115</ref> By June 1990, Taylor's forces were laying siege to Monrovia.  In July 1990, [[Prince Yormie Johnson]] split from Taylor and formed the Independent National Patriotic Front (INPFL). The INPFL and NPFL continued their siege on Monrovia, which the AFL defended. Johnson quickly took control of parts of Monrovia prompting evacuation of foreign nationals and diplomats by the US Navy in August.\n\n=== ECOWAS intervention force (August 1990) ===\nIn August 1990, the 16-member [[ECOWAS|Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)]] agreed to deploy a joint military intervention force, the Economic Community Monitoring Group ([[ECOMOG]]), and place it under Nigerian leadership. The mission later included troops from non-ECOWAS countries, including Uganda and Tanzania. ECOMOG's objectives were to impose a cease-fire; help Liberians establish an interim government until elections could be held; stop the killing of innocent civilians; and ensure the safe evacuation of foreign nationals.\n\nECOMOG also sought to prevent the conflict from spreading into neighboring states, which share a complex history of state, economic, and ethno-linguistic social relations with Liberia. The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) attempted to persuade Doe to resign and go into exile, but despite his weak position&nbsp;\u2013 besieged in his mansion&nbsp;\u2013 he refused. [[ECOMOG]], an ECOWAS intervention force, arrived at the Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels.<ref>Adebajo, 2002, p.75</ref>\n\n=== Capture and killing of Samuel Doe (September 1990) ===\n[[File:Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia in Monrovia 1990.png|thumb|300px|[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia|INPFL]] militiamen in 1990 after taking control of much of [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nOn 9 September 1990, Doe visited the barely established, newly arrived ECOMOG headquarters in the Free Port of Maher. Stephen Ellis says,<ref>''The Mask of Anarchy'', by Stephen Ellis, 2001, p.1-9</ref> his motive was to lay a complaint that the ECOMOG commander had not paid a courtesy call to Doe, the Head of State, however, the exact circumstances that led to Doe's visit to the Free Port are still unclear. Doe had been under pressure to accept exile outside of Liberia. However, after Doe arrived, a large rebel force led by Prince Johnson's INPFL arrived at the headquarters and then attacked Doe's party. Doe was captured and taken to the INPFL's Caldwell base. He was brutally tortured before being killed and dismembered. His torture and execution was videotaped by his captors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |title=Liberia: Chronology |accessdate=2007-02-26 |last=Armon |first=Jeremy |author2=Andy Carl |year=1996 |work=Conciliation Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308142809/http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |archive-date=8 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=MASK>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Stephen|title=The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of African Civil War|origyear=1999|year=2007|publisher=Hurst & Company|location=London, UK|isbn=1850654174|pages=1\u201316}}</ref>\n\nJohnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL continued to struggle for control of Monrovia in the months that followed.  With military discipline absent and bloodshed throughout the capital region, members of ECOWAS created the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to restore order. The force comprised some 4,000 troops from [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Sierra Leone]], the [[Gambia]] and [[Guinea]]. ECOMOG succeeded in bringing Taylor and Johnson to agree to its intervention, but Taylor's forces engaged it in the port area of Monrovia.\n\n=== Peace making attempts (1990) ===\nA series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June\u2013October 1991. But the first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes failed. In November 1990, ECOWAS invited the principal Liberian players to meet in [[Banjul]], Gambia to form a government of national unity. The negotiated settlement established the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), led by [[Amos Sawyer|Dr. Amos Sawyer]], leader of the LPP. Bishop Ronald Diggs of the Liberian Council of Churches became vice president. However, Taylor's NPFL refused to attend the conference. Within days, hostilities resumed.  ECOMOG was reinforced in order to protect the interim government. Sawyer was able to establish his authority over most of Monrovia, but the rest of Liberia was in the hands of various factions of the NPFL or of local gangs.\n\n===ULIMO===\nThe [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO) was formed in June 1991 by supporters of the late [[President of Liberia|President]] [[Samuel K. Doe]] and former [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL) fighters who had taken refuge in [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. It was led by Raleigh Seekie, a deputy [[Minister of Finance]] in the Doe government.\n\nAfter fighting alongside the Sierra Leonean army against the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF), ULIMO forces entered western Liberia in September 1991. The group scored significant gains in areas held by another rebel group&nbsp;\u2013 the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL), notably around the diamond mining areas of [[Lofa County|Lofa]] and [[Bomi County|Bomi]] [[Counties of Liberia|counties]].\n\nFrom its outset, ULIMO was beset with internal divisions and the group effectively broke into two separate militias in 1994: [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction|ULIMO-J]], an ethnic [[Krahn]] faction led by General [[Roosevelt Johnson]] and [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction|ULIMO-K]], a [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]]-based faction led by [[Alhaji G.V. Kromah]].\n\nThe group was alleged to have committed serious violations of [[human rights]], both before and after its breakup.\n\n=== Attack on Monrovia (1992) ===\nPeace was still far off as both Taylor and Johnson claimed power.  ECOMOG declared an Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) with [[Amos Sawyer]] as their president, with the broad support of Johnson.  Taylor launched an assault on Monrovia on October 15, 1992, named 'Operation Octopus.'<ref>See Ellis, Mask of Anarchy, 98-99.</ref> which  may have been led by Burkina Faso soldiers.<ref>Herbert Howe, Ambiguous Order, 2005, 143.</ref> The resulting siege lasted two months.\n\nBy late December, ECOMOG had pushed the NPFL back beyond Monrovia's suburbs.\n\n===UNOMIL===\n{{main article|UNOMIL}}\nIn 1993, ECOWAS brokered a peace agreement in [[Cotonou]], Benin. Following this, on September 22, 1993, the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council established the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), to support ECOMOG in implementing this peace agreement. UNOMIL was deployed in early 1994 with 368 military observers and associated civilian personnel to monitor implementation of the Cotonou Peace Agreement, prior to elections originally planned for February/March 1994.\n\nRenewed armed hostilities broke out in May 1994 and continued, becoming especially intense in July and August. ECOMOG, and later UNOMIL, members were captured and held hostage by some factions. By mid-1994, the humanitarian situation had become disastrous, with 1.8 million Liberians in need of humanitarian assistance. Conditions continued to deteriorate, but humanitarian agencies were unable to reach many in need due to hostilities and general insecurity.\n\nFactional leaders agreed in September 1994 to the Akosombo Agreement, a supplement to the Cotonou agreement, named after the Ghanaian town where it was signed. The security situation in Liberia remained poor. In October 1994, in the face of ECOMOG funding shortfalls and a lack of will by the Liberian combatants to honor agreements to end the war, the UN Security Council reduced to about 90 the number of UNOMIL observers. It extended UNOMIL's mandate and subsequently extended it several times until September 1997.\n\nIn December 1994, the factions and other parties signed the Accra Agreement, a supplement to the Akosombo Agreement. Disagreements ensued and fighting continued.\n\n===Ceasefire (1995)===\nIn August 1995, the main factions signed an agreement largely brokered by Ghanaian President [[Jerry Rawlings]]. At a conference sponsored by ECOWAS, the United Nations and the United States, the European Union, and the [[Organization of African Unity]], Charles Taylor agreed to a cease-fire.\n\nAt the beginning of September 1995, Liberia's three principal warlords&nbsp;\u2013 Taylor, [[George Boley]] and [[Alhaji Kromah]]&nbsp;\u2013 made theatrical entrances into Monrovia. A ruling council of six members under civilian [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]] and with the three factional heads Taylor, Kromah and Boley, took control of the country preparatory to elections that were originally scheduled for 1996.\n\n=== Fighting in Monrovia (1996) ===\n[[File:National Patriotic Liberation Front fighters in Monrovia 1996.png|thumb|300px|[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]] fighters search for [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy|ULIMO]] militants in [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nHeavy fighting broke out again in April 1996. This led to the evacuation of most international [[non-governmental organization]]s and the destruction of much of Monrovia.\n\nIn August 1996, these battles were ended by the [[Abuja]] Accord in Nigeria, agreeing to [[disarmament]] and [[demobilization]] by 1997 and [[Liberia elections, 1997|elections]] in July of that year. 3 September 1996, Sankawulo is followed by [[Ruth Perry]] as chairwoman of the ruling council, who served until 2 August 1997.\n\n=== 1997 Elections ===\n{{Main|1997 Liberian general election}}\nSimultaneous elections for the [[Liberia elections, 1997#Presidential election results|presidency]] and [[Liberia elections, 1997#Legislative election results|national assembly]] were finally held in July 1997.\nIn a climate hardly conducive to free movement and security of persons, Taylor and his [[National Patriotic Party]] won an overwhelming victory against 12 other candidates.  Assisted by widespread intimidation, Taylor took 75 per cent of the presidential poll (no other candidate won more than 10 per cent) while the NPP won a similar proportion of seats in both parliamentary chambers. 2 August 1997, Ruth Perry handed power to elected president Charles Taylor.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|1998 Monrovia clashes}}\n\nIn 1997, the Liberian people elected Charles Taylor as the President after he entered the capital city, [[Monrovia]], by force. Liberians had voted for Taylor in the hope that he would end the bloodshed.  The bloodshed did slow considerably, but it did not end. Violent events flared up regularly after the putative end of the war. Taylor, furthermore, was accused of backing guerrillas in neighboring countries and funneling diamond money into arms purchases for the rebel armies he supported, and into luxuries for himself. The implicit unrest manifested during the late 1990s is emblematic in the sharp national economic decline and the prevalent sale of diamonds and timber in exchange for small arms.\n\nAfter Taylor's victory, Liberia was peaceful enough so that refugees began to return. But other leaders were forced to leave the country, and some ULIMO forces reformed as the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD). LURD began fighting in [[Lofa County]] with the aim of destabilizing the government and gaining control of the local [[diamond]] fields, leading to the [[Second Liberian Civil War]].\n\n===Impact===\nThe Liberian civil war was one of Africa's bloodiest. From 1989-1996, it claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and further displaced a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries. [[Child soldier]]s were used throughout the war.\n\nThe civil war claimed the lives of one out of every 17 people in the country, uprooted most of the rest, and destroyed a once-viable economic infrastructure.  The strife also spread to Liberia's neighbors. It helped slow democratization in West Africa at the beginning of the 1990s and destabilized a region that already was one of the world's most unsteady.\n\n==Second Liberian Civil War==\nThe [[Second Liberian Civil War]] began in 1999 and ended in October 2003, when [[ECOWAS]] intervened to stop the [[Siege of Monrovia|rebel siege]] on Monrovia and exiled Charles Taylor to Nigeria until he was arrested in 2006 and taken to [[The Hague]] for his trial. By the conclusion of the final war, more than 250,000 people had been killed and nearly 1 million displaced. Half that number remain to be repatriated in 2005, at the election of Liberia's first democratic President since the initial 1980 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of Samuel Doe.\n\nFormer president [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], who initially was a strong supporter of Charles Taylor, was inaugurated in January 2006 and the National Transitional Government of Liberia terminated its power.\n\nCharles Taylor's Trial\nCharles Taylor was sentenced to a trial in 2003, after being accused of rape and acts of sexual violence, pormoting child soldiers, and an illegal ownership of weapons. He denied these accusations but was eventually testified against by his victims. He was then senteced to 50 years in prison. \n== Lists ==\n\n===Armed groups that participated in the war===\n*[[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL)\n*[[Liberia Peace Council]] (LPC)\n*[[Lofa Defense Force]] (LDF)\n*[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL)\n**[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL)\n**[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia-Central Revolutionary Council]] (NPFL-CRC)\n*[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction]] (ULIMO-J)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction]] (ULIMO-K)\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n=== Peace agreements ===\nPeace agreements signed included the:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=94&value=#|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program}}</ref> \n*Banjul III Agreement (1990-10-24)\n*Bamako Ceasefire Agreement (1990-11-28)\n*Banjul IV Agreement (1990-12-21)\n*Lom\u00e9 Agreement (1991-02-13)\n*Yamoussoukro IV Peace Agreement (1991-10-30)\n*Geneva Agreement 1992 (1992-04-07)\n*Cotonou Peace Agreement (1993-07-25)\n*Akosombo Peace Agreement (1994-09-12)\n*Accra Agreements/Akosombo clarification agreement (1994-12-21)\n*Abuja Peace Agreement (1995-08-19)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Second Liberian Civil War]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[History of Liberia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gerdes, Felix: Civil War and State Formation: The Political Economy of War and Peace in Liberia, Frankfurt/New York: Campus Verlag & University of Chicago Press, 2013\n*Hoffman, Danny. \"The City as Barracks: Freetown, Monrovia, and the Organization of Violence in Postcolonial African Cities.\" Cultural Anthropology.
