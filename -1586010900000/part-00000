He was afraid that it would overshadow the Prussian crown.\n\nSince 1867, the presidency ''([[Bundespr\u00e4sidium]])'' of the North German Confederation had been a hereditary office of the kings of Prussia. The new constitution of 1 January 1871, following Reichstag and Bundesrat decisions on 9/10 December, transformed the North German Confederation ({{lang-de|Norddeutscher Bund}}) into the German Empire ({{lang-de|Deutsches Reich}}). This empire was a [[federal monarchy]]; the emperor was head of state and [[President (government title)|president]] of the [[States of the German Empire|federated monarchs]] (the [[king]]s of [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], the [[grand duke]]s of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]], among others, as well as the principalities, duchies and of the [[City-state|free cities]] of [[Free City of Hamburg|Hamburg]], [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]).<ref name=\"Kroeschell\">[[Karl Kroeschell]]: ''Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte'', Bd. 3: ''Seit 1650'', 5.

He was afraid that it would overshadow the Prussian crown.\n\nSince 1867, the presidency ''([[Bundespr\u00e4sidium]])'' of the North German Confederation had been a hereditary office of the kings of Prussia. The new constitution of 1 January 1871, following Reichstag and Bundesrat decisions on 9/10 December, transformed the North German Confederation ({{lang-de|Norddeutscher Bund}}) into the German Empire ({{lang-de|Deutsches Reich}}). This empire was a [[federal monarchy]]; the emperor was head of state and [[President (government title)|president]] of the [[States of the German Empire|federated monarchs]] (the [[king]]s of [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], the [[grand duke]]s of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]], among others, as well as the principalities, duchies and of the [[City-state|free cities]] of [[Free City of Hamburg|Hamburg]], [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]).<ref name=\"Kroeschell\">[[Karl Kroeschell]]: ''Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte'', Bd. 3: ''Seit 1650'', 5.

Thus, the imperial crown was directly tied to the Prussian crown\u2014something Wilhelm II discovered in the aftermath of World War I. He erroneously believed that he ruled the empire in [[personal union]] with Prussia. With the war's end, he conceded that he could not remain emperor, but initially thought he could at least retain his Prussian crown.<ref name=\"WilhelmII1922\">{{cite book|author=Wilhelm II|translator=Thomas R.

The {{convert|3.43|g|gr|abbr=on|1}} {{convert|25.55|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} long boat-tail projectile's jacket is clad in [[gilding metal]]. The unhardened {{convert|1.43|g|gr|abbr=on|1}} steel (steel 10) rod penetrator core is covered by a thin [[lead]] inlay which does not fill the entire point end, leaving a hollow cavity inside the nose. The bullet is cut to length during the manufacturing process to give the correct weight. The 7N6 uses a boat-tail design to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]] and there is a small lead plug crimped in place in the base of the bullet. The lead plug, in combination with the air space at the point of the bullet, has the effect of moving the bullet's center of gravity to the rear; the hollow air space also makes the bullet's point prone to deformation when the bullet strikes anything solid, inducing yaw. The brown-[[lacquer]]ed steel case is [[Berdan primer#Berdan primer|Berdan primed]]. Its {{convert|39.37|mm|abbr=on|2}} length makes it slightly longer than the 7.62\u00d739mm case which measures exactly {{convert|38.60|mm|abbr=on|2}}. The primer has a copper cup and is sealed with a heavy red lacquer.

It was introduced into service in 1974 by the Soviet Union for use with the new [[AK-74]]. The 5.45\u00d739mm gradually supplemented, then largely replaced the [[7.62\u00d739mm]] cartridge in Soviet and [[Warsaw Pact]] service as the primary military [[service rifle]] cartridge.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Modern-rifle-cartridges-cases.jpg|thumb|left|Service rifle cartridge cases: (Left to right) [[7.62\u00d754mmR]], [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]], [[7.62\u00d739mm]], [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]], 5.45\u00d739mm.]]\n[[File:Comparison of cold war ammunition rotated.jpg|thumb|left|Service rifle cartridges loaded with projectiles: (Left to right) 7.62\u00d754mmR, 7.62\u00d751mm NATO, 7.62\u00d739mm, 5.56\u00d745mm NATO, 5.45\u00d739mm.]]\n\nThe 5.45\u00d739mm cartridge was developed in the early 1970s by a group of Soviet designers and engineers under the direction of M. Sabelnikov. Further group members were: L. I. Bulavsky, B. B. Semin, M. E. Fedorov, P. F. Sazonov, V. Volkov, V. A. Nikolaev, E. E. Zimin and P. S. Korolev. The 5.45\u00d739mm couples a sensible case volume (1.75 ml) to bore area (23.99&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>/0.2399&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>) ratio with ample space for loading relatively long slender projectiles that can provide good aerodynamic efficiency and external ballistic performance for the projectile diameter.<ref name=\"multiref1\" />\n\nThe 5.45\u00d739mm is an example of an international tendency towards relatively small-sized, lightweight, high-velocity military service cartridges. Cartridges like the 5.45\u00d739mm, [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] and Chinese [[5.8\u00d742mm DBP87|5.8\u00d742mm]] allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges, have favourable maximum [[point-blank range]] or \"battle zero\" characteristics and produce relatively low [[bolt thrust]] and [[free recoil]] impulse, favouring lightweight arms design and automatic fire accuracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/Assault.htm|title=ASSAULT RIFLES AND THEIR AMMUNITION:|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/04/09/how-much-does-your-ammunition-weigh/|title=How much does your ammo weigh?|publisher=tfb.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet original military issue '''7N6''' cartridge variant introduced in 1974 are loaded with [[Full metal jacket bullet|full metal jacket]] bullets that have a somewhat complex construction. The {{convert|3.43|g|gr|abbr=on|1}} {{convert|25.55|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} long boat-tail projectile's jacket is clad in [[gilding metal]]. The unhardened {{convert|1.43|g|gr|abbr=on|1}} steel (steel 10) rod penetrator core is covered by a thin [[lead]] inlay which does not fill the entire point end, leaving a hollow cavity inside the nose. The bullet is cut to length during the manufacturing process to give the correct weight. The 7N6 uses a boat-tail design to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]] and there is a small lead plug crimped in place in the base of the bullet. The lead plug, in combination with the air space at the point of the bullet, has the effect of moving the bullet's center of gravity to the rear; the hollow air space also makes the bullet's point prone to deformation when the bullet strikes anything solid, inducing yaw. The brown-[[lacquer]]ed steel case is [[Berdan primer#Berdan primer|Berdan primed]]. Its {{convert|39.37|mm|abbr=on|2}} length makes it slightly longer than the 7.62\u00d739mm case which measures exactly {{convert|38.60|mm|abbr=on|2}}. The primer has a copper cup and is sealed with a heavy red lacquer. The propellant charge is a ball powder with similar burning characteristics to the WC844 powder used in [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ammunition. The 7N6 cartridge weight is {{convert|10.75|g|gr|abbr=on|1}}.\n\nTests indicate the [[free recoil]] energy delivered by the 5.45\u00d739mm [[AK-74]] assault rifle is {{convert|3.39|J|ftlb|abbr=on|2}}, compared to {{convert|6.44|J|ftlb|abbr=on|2}} delivered by the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO in the [[M16 rifle|M16]] assault rifle and {{convert|7.19|J|ftlb|abbr=on|2}} delivered by the 7.62\u00d739mm in the [[AKM]] assault rifle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_9_54/ai_n27963829/|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMilitary 5.45\u00d739mm ammunition was produced in the former Soviet Union, [[GDR]] and Yugoslavia, and is produced in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania.

This resulted in the 7N6M, 7N10, 7N22, 7N24 and 7N39 variants.\n\nThe '''7N6M''' (M\u2014[[Russian language|Russian]]: ''\u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439''; ''Modernizirovanniy'' or \"modernized\") cartridge was introduced in 1987. In contrast to the original 7N6 unhardened steel rod penetrator the 7N6M rod penetrator is made of steel 65 and hardened to 60 [[Rockwell scale|HRC]]. The 7N6M {{convert|3.43|g|gr|abbr=on|1}} boat-tail bullet can penetrate a 6&nbsp;mm thick St3 steel plate at 300 m and 6Zh85T body armour at 80 m. 7N6(M) bullets have a red identification ring above the cartridge neck. The US Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory measured a [[ballistic coefficient]] (G7 BC) of 0.168 and form factor (G7 ''i'') of 0.929 for the 7N6(M) projectile, which indicates good aerodynamic efficiency and external ballistic performance for the bullet diameter.<ref>[http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/The%20Next%20Generation.htm The Case for a General-Purpose Rifle and Machine Gun Cartridge (GPC) by Anthony G Williams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109212356/http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/The%20Next%20Generation.htm |date=2014-11-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bergerbullets.com/form-factors-a-useful-analysis-tool/|title=Form Factors: A Useful Analysis Tool - Berger Bullets Blog|date=16 May 2011|publisher=}}</ref> The rounds are loaded to produce a maximal pressure of {{convert|290.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] classified the 7N6 cartridge as \"armor piercing handgun ammunition\" on 7 April 2014, and, as such, it is illegal to import from Russia to the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atf.gov/press/releases/2014/04/040714-special-advisory-test-examination-and-classification-7n6-545x39-ammunition.html|title=Test, Examination and Classification of 7N6 5.45x39 Ammunition - Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe '''7N10''' \"improved penetration\" cartridge was introduced in 1992. The 7N10 boat-tail bullet weighs {{convert|3.60|g|gr|abbr=on|1}} and the weight of the lengthened sleeker steel (high-carbon steel U12A) penetrator made of steel 70 was increased to {{convert|1.80|g|gr|abbr=on|1}} and the lead plug in front of it was discarded. The hollow cavity at the front of these projectiles was reduced significantly compared to previous 7N6(M) projectiles. \nIn 1994 the 7N10 design was improved by filling the remaining hollow cavity in the projectiles front with lead and reducing the weight of the penetrator to {{convert|1.72|g|gr|abbr=on|1}} resulting in a bullet weighing {{convert|3.62|g|gr|abbr=on|1}}. Upon impacting a hard target, soft lead is pressed sideways by the steel penetrator, tearing the jacket. It has a ballistic coefficient (G1 BC) of approximately 0.351 and (G7 BC) of approximately 0.176.\nThe 7N10 cartridge replaced the previous variants as standard Russian service round and can penetrate a 16&nbsp;mm thick St3 steel plate at 100 m and 6Zh85T body armour at 200 m.<ref name=\"Evolution of the 5.45 mm bullet\">{{cite web|url=http://grigorew.narod.ru/raznoe/kal545.htm|title=Evolution of the 5.45 mm bullet|language=Russian}}</ref> 7N10 bullets have a violet/purple identification ring above the cartridge neck.

In defence of his title, Trump lost to [[Shaun Murphy]] 3\u20136 in the first round. O'Sullivan was eligible to compete in the event, but chose not to participate; his entry was given to [[Ali Carter]], who reached the final where he played [[Stuart Bingham]]. Recovering from 5\u20137 behind, Bingham won the final 10\u20138 to claim his first Masters title. He became the oldest Masters champion at age&nbsp;43, beating the previous record set by [[Ray Reardon]] in [[1976 Masters (snooker)|1976]].\n\nIn winning the event, Bingham won [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]250,000 from a total prize pool of \u00a3725,000.

In defence of his title, Trump lost to [[Shaun Murphy]] 3\u20136 in the first round. O'Sullivan was eligible to compete in the event, but chose not to participate; his entry was given to [[Ali Carter]], who reached the final where he played [[Stuart Bingham]]. Recovering from 5\u20137 behind, Bingham won the final 10\u20138 to claim his first Masters title. He became the oldest Masters champion at age&nbsp;43, beating the previous record set by [[Ray Reardon]] in [[1976 Masters (snooker)|1976]].\n\nIn winning the event, Bingham won [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]250,000 from a total prize pool of \u00a3725,000.

In the process of dynamiting the [[lode]], he falls and breaks his leg. He saves a silver sample, climbs out of the mine and drags himself to an assay office, where he receives a silver and gold certificate [[land claim|claim]]. In 1902, [[history of oil in California through 1930|he discovers oil near Los Angeles]] and establishes a drilling company. Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the man's orphaned son. The boy, H. W., becomes his nominal business partner, allowing Daniel to present himself to potential investors as a family man.\n\nIn 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, a young man who tells him of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Daniel attempts to purchase the farm from the Sundays at a bargain price, but he is blocked by Eli, Paul's twin brother and a local evangelical preacher. In exchange for the rights to the property, Eli demands $10,000 \"for his church.\" An agreement is made and Daniel acquires all the available land in and around the Sunday property, save for one holdout: William Bandy.\n\nOil drilling commences, but soon a series of misfortunes occur: an accident kills one worker and a [[blowout (well drilling)|gas blowout]] deafens H. W. Eli blames the disasters on the well not being properly blessed. When Eli publicly demands the money still owed to him, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table that night, Eli attacks and berates his father for trusting Daniel.\n\nA man arrives at Daniel's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry. Daniel hires Henry and the two grow close. A jealous H. W. sets fire to their house, intending to kill Henry. A furious Daniel sends H. W. away to a school for the deaf in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. A representative from [[Standard Oil]] offers to buy out Daniel's local interests, but after a perceived slight, Daniel refuses and strikes a deal with [[Union Oil]] to build a pipeline to the California coast. However, Bandy's ranch remains an impediment.\n\nReminiscing about his childhood, Daniel becomes suspicious to the truth of Henry's story and confronts him one night at gunpoint. \"Henry\" confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry, who died of [[tuberculosis]], and that he impersonated Henry in hopes of gaining employment with Daniel. In a fit of rage, Daniel murders the impostor and buries his body.\n\nThe next morning, Daniel is awakened by Bandy, who knows of Daniel's crime and wants Daniel to publicly repent in Eli's church in exchange for the pipeline construction rights on his land. As part of his [[baptism]], Eli humiliates Daniel and coerces him into confessing that he abandoned his son. Some time later, as the pipeline is under construction, H. W. is reunited with Daniel and Eli leaves Little Boston for missionary work.\n\nIn 1927, H. W. marries Mary Sunday, the younger sister of Paul and Eli. He visits Daniel, who is now an extremely wealthy but [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] recluse in a large mansion. Through a [[language interpretation|sign language interpreter]], H. W. asks his father to dissolve their partnership so that he can establish his own independent drilling company in [[Mexico]]. Daniel reacts brutally, mocking H. W.'s deafness before revealing his true origins as an orphan \"bastard from a basket.\" H. W. tells Daniel he is glad that they are not related and storms out.\n\nEli visits Daniel, who is drunk in his private [[bowling alley]]. Eli, now a radio preacher, offers to sell Daniel the property rights to the Bandy ranch, as William Bandy has recently died. Daniel agrees on the condition that Eli denounce his faith and his own credibility. Eli reluctantly acquiesces, only for Daniel to then reveal that the property is now worthless because he has already drained its oil by [[slant drilling]] from neighboring wells. Shaken, Eli confesses to being in dire financial straits and to having strayed morally. Daniel taunts Eli in revenge for his own previous humiliation before chasing him around the bowling alley and eventually beats him to death with a bowling pin. Exhausted, Daniel collapses on the floor next to Eli's body and announces that he is \"finished.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Daniel Plainview\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Paul Sunday and Eli Sunday\n* [[Kevin J.

Although he had read Sinclair's ''[[The Jungle]]'', he did not know about his other works or anything about Sinclair himself. He decided to read most of Sinclair's works, and eventually read the novel ''[[Oil!]]'', which he loved. Schlosser, who found the book to be exciting and thought it would make a great film, sought out the Sinclair estate and purchased the film rights.

It was so cohesive, the way Upton Sinclair wrote about that period, and his experiences around the oil fields and these independent oilmen. That said, the book is so long that it's only the first couple hundred pages that we ended up using, because there is a certain point where he strays really far from what the original story is. We were really unfaithful to the book. That's not to say I didn't really like the book; I loved it. But there were so many other things floating around.

Daniel Day-Lewis gave the best and ballsiest performance of the past 10 years. As Daniel Plainview, a prospector who loots the land of its natural resources in silver and oil to fill his pockets and gargantuan ego, he showed us a man draining his humanity for power. And Anderson, having extended Plainview's rage from Earth to heaven in the form of a corrupt preacher (Paul Dano), managed to \"drink the milkshake\" of other risk-taking directors. If I had to stake the future of film in the next decade on one filmmaker, I'd go with PTA. Even more than ''Boogie Nights'' and ''Magnolia''\u2014his rebel cries from the 1990s\u2014''Blood'' let Anderson put technology at the service of character. The score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood was a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be. And the images captured by Robert Elswit, a genius of camera and lighting, made visual poetry out of an oil well consumed by flame. For the final word on ''Blood'', I'll quote Plainview: \"It was one goddamn hell of a show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |title=Peter Travers' 10 Best Movies of the Decade |work=Rolling Stone Magazine |date=December 10, 2009 |accessdate=December 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114150503/http://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |archivedate=January 14, 2010 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' critic [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] named ''There Will Be Blood'' the decade's best film. Phillips stated:\n<blockquote>This most eccentric and haunting of modern epics is driven by oilman Daniel Plainview, who, in the hands of actor Daniel Day-Lewis, becomes a Horatio Alger story gone horribly wrong. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the films hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel\u2014plus, what I think is the performance of the new century\u2014''There Will Be Blood'' stands alone. The more I see it, the sadder, and stranger, and more visually astounding it grows\u2014and the more it seems to say about the best and worst in the American ethos of rugged individualism. Awfully good!<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/specials/bestofthedecade/index.html |title=Best of the Decade |date=December 28, 2009 |accessdate=December 28, 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic Lisa Schwarzbaum named ''There Will Be Blood'' the decade's best film as well. In her original review, Schwarzbaum stated:\n<blockquote>Anyhow, a fierce story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American character with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men, really, including the false prophet Sunday) is only half Anderson's quest, and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to the telling itself. For a huge picture, There Will Be Blood is exquisitely intimate, almost a collection of sketches. For a long, slow movie, it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past, it's got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well down the road from Eli Sunday's church\u2014and then, much later, announce a kind of end of the world. For bleakness, the movie can't be beat\u2014nor for brilliance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20168259,00.html |title=There Will Be Blood Review |date=January 9, 2008 |accessdate=January 9, 2008}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn December 2009, the website [[Gawker.com]] determined that ''There Will Be Blood'' is film critics' consensus best film of the decade when aggregating all Best of the Decade lists, stating: \"And when the votes were all in, by a nose, ''There Will Be Blood'' stood alone at the top of the decade, its straw in the whole damn cinema's milkshake.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gawker.com/5428998/there-will-be-blood-wins-the-decade |title=There Will Be Blood Wins the Decade |work=Gawker |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203203506/http://gawker.com/5428998/there-will-be-blood-wins-the-decade |archivedate=February 3, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe list of critics who lauded ''There Will Be Blood'' in their assessments of films from the past decade include:\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n* ''[[The A.V.

In the process of dynamiting the [[lode]], he falls and breaks his leg. He saves a silver sample, climbs out of the mine and drags himself to an assay office, where he receives a silver and gold certificate [[land claim|claim]]. In 1902, [[history of oil in California through 1930|he discovers oil near Los Angeles]] and establishes a drilling company. Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the man's orphaned son. The boy, H. W., becomes his nominal business partner, allowing Daniel to present himself to potential investors as a family man.\n\nIn 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, a young man who tells him of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Daniel attempts to purchase the farm from the Sundays at a bargain price, but he is blocked by Eli, Paul's twin brother and a local evangelical preacher. In exchange for the rights to the property, Eli demands $10,000 \"for his church.\" An agreement is made and Daniel acquires all the available land in and around the Sunday property, save for one holdout: William Bandy.\n\nOil drilling commences, but soon a series of misfortunes occur: an accident kills one worker and a [[blowout (well drilling)|gas blowout]] deafens H. W. Eli blames the disasters on the well not being properly blessed. When Eli publicly demands the money still owed to him, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table that night, Eli attacks and berates his father for trusting Daniel.\n\nA man arrives at Daniel's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry. Daniel hires Henry and the two grow close. A jealous H. W. sets fire to their house, intending to kill Henry. A furious Daniel sends H. W. away to a school for the deaf in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. A representative from [[Standard Oil]] offers to buy out Daniel's local interests, but after a perceived slight, Daniel refuses and strikes a deal with [[Union Oil]] to build a pipeline to the California coast. However, Bandy's ranch remains an impediment.\n\nReminiscing about his childhood, Daniel becomes suspicious to the truth of Henry's story and confronts him one night at gunpoint. \"Henry\" confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry, who died of [[tuberculosis]], and that he impersonated Henry in hopes of gaining employment with Daniel. In a fit of rage, Daniel murders the impostor and buries his body.\n\nThe next morning, Daniel is awakened by Bandy, who knows of Daniel's crime and wants Daniel to publicly repent in Eli's church in exchange for the pipeline construction rights on his land. As part of his [[baptism]], Eli humiliates Daniel and coerces him into confessing that he abandoned his son. Some time later, as the pipeline is under construction, H. W. is reunited with Daniel and Eli leaves Little Boston for missionary work.\n\nIn 1927, H. W. marries Mary Sunday, the younger sister of Paul and Eli. He visits Daniel, who is now an extremely wealthy but [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] recluse in a large mansion. Through a [[language interpretation|sign language interpreter]], H. W. asks his father to dissolve their partnership so that he can establish his own independent drilling company in [[Mexico]]. Daniel reacts brutally, mocking H. W.'s deafness before revealing his true origins as an orphan \"bastard from a basket.\" H. W. tells Daniel he is glad that they are not related and storms out.\n\nEli visits Daniel, who is drunk in his private [[bowling alley]]. Eli, now a radio preacher, offers to sell Daniel the property rights to the Bandy ranch, as William Bandy has recently died. Daniel agrees on the condition that Eli denounce his faith and his own credibility. Eli reluctantly acquiesces, only for Daniel to then reveal that the property is now worthless because he has already drained its oil by [[slant drilling]] from neighboring wells. Shaken, Eli confesses to being in dire financial straits and to having strayed morally. Daniel taunts Eli in revenge for his own previous humiliation before chasing him around the bowling alley and eventually beats him to death with a bowling pin. Exhausted, Daniel collapses on the floor next to Eli's body and announces that he is \"finished.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Daniel Plainview\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Paul Sunday and Eli Sunday\n* [[Kevin J.

Daniel Day-Lewis gave the best and ballsiest performance of the past 10 years. As Daniel Plainview, a prospector who loots the land of its natural resources in silver and oil to fill his pockets and gargantuan ego, he showed us a man draining his humanity for power. And Anderson, having extended Plainview's rage from Earth to heaven in the form of a corrupt preacher (Paul Dano), managed to \"drink the milkshake\" of other risk-taking directors. If I had to stake the future of film in the next decade on one filmmaker, I'd go with PTA. Even more than ''Boogie Nights'' and ''Magnolia''\u2014his rebel cries from the 1990s\u2014''Blood'' let Anderson put technology at the service of character. The score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood was a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be. And the images captured by Robert Elswit, a genius of camera and lighting, made visual poetry out of an oil well consumed by flame. For the final word on ''Blood'', I'll quote Plainview: \"It was one goddamn hell of a show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |title=Peter Travers' 10 Best Movies of the Decade |work=Rolling Stone Magazine |date=December 10, 2009 |accessdate=December 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114150503/http://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |archivedate=January 14, 2010 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' critic [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] named ''There Will Be Blood'' the decade's best film. Phillips stated:\n<blockquote>This most eccentric and haunting of modern epics is driven by oilman Daniel Plainview, who, in the hands of actor Daniel Day-Lewis, becomes a Horatio Alger story gone horribly wrong. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the films hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel\u2014plus, what I think is the performance of the new century\u2014''There Will Be Blood'' stands alone.

In her original review, Schwarzbaum stated:\n<blockquote>Anyhow, a fierce story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American character with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men, really, including the false prophet Sunday) is only half Anderson's quest, and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to the telling itself. For a huge picture, There Will Be Blood is exquisitely intimate, almost a collection of sketches. For a long, slow movie, it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past, it's got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well down the road from Eli Sunday's church\u2014and then, much later, announce a kind of end of the world.
