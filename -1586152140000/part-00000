The patriotic monarchy was replaced by an [[Islamic Republic]] based on the principle of rule by Islamic jurists, (or \"''[[Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)|Velayat-e faqih]]''\"), where clerics serve as [[head of state]] and in many powerful governmental roles.  A pro-[[Western culture|Western]], pro-[[United States|American]] foreign policy was exchanged for one of \"neither east nor west\", said to rest on the three \"pillars\" of mandatory veil (''[[hijab]]'') for women, and opposition to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].<ref>[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/sadjadpour_iran_final2.pdf Reading Khamenei by Karmin Sadjadpour ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027090356/https://carnegieendowment.org/files/sadjadpour_iran_final2.pdf |date=2019-10-27 }} p.14</ref> A rapidly modernizing capitalist economy<ref>[\"Modern Iran: roots and results of revolution\", p.133, 227</ref><ref>''Iran : The Illusion of Power'' by Robert Graham, p.18, 19, 20, 83</ref> was replaced by a [[populism|populist]] and [[Islam]]ic economy and culture.\n\nThe leader of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic, [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], was Iran's [[supreme leader]] until his death in 1989.<ref name = \"Britannica\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32981  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215140348/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32981 |date=2007-12-15 }}.</ref> He was followed by [[Ali Khamenei]].\n\n==General trends==\nDuring the era of the Islamic Republic, Iran has grown from 39 million (1980) to 81.16 million (2017) people.\n\nSome things remain much as they were under the monarchy. Iran has retained its status as a major regional power\u2014it is far larger than any of its gulf neighbors, and possesses large reserves of gas and oil.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.194\">Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.194</ref> Its national cohesion brought by a long history as a nation, strong central state government and its oil export revenues have brought it \"respectable\" levels of income, literacy, college enrollment, infant mortality, and infrastructure.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.194\" /> Modern trends found under the monarchy, such as urbanization, growing enrollment in higher education<ref>which went from 155,000 in 1977 to 135,700 in 1982 (when universities reopened after cultural revolution) to a peak of 1,048,000 in 1995. from UNESCO Division of Statistics, quoted in Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.188</ref> and literacy, continued.\n\n===Politics and government===\n{{Main|Politics and Government of Iran}}\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is an Islamic [[theocracy]] headed by a [[Supreme Leader]]. Its  [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution]] was approved in 1979 and amended in 1989. [[Twelvers|Jaafari]] ([[Usuli]]) school of thought is the official religion.  It has an elected president and elected governmental bodies at the national, provincial and local levels for which all males and females from the age of 18 on up may vote, which are supervised by theocratic bodies, particularly the [[Council of Guardians]] which had veto power over who can run for parliament (or [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]]) and whether its bills can become law. Nonetheless the elected organs have more power than equivalent ones in the Shah's government.\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{Main|Iran's foreign policy}}\nFollowing the 1979 [[Iranian revolution|revolution]] in Iran, the Islamic revolutionary regime of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] dramatically reversed the pro-Western foreign policy of the regime it overthrew. Since then, Iran has oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour (promoting the Islamic revolution and struggling against non-Muslim tendencies abroad) and moves towards pragmatism (economic development and normalization of foreign relations). Khomeini's 1989 [[fatwa]] calling for the killing of British citizen [[Salman Rushdie]] for his allegedly blasphemous book, [[The Satanic Verses controversy|The Satanic Verses]], demonstrated the willingness of the Islamic revolutionaries to sacrifice trade and other ties with western countries to threaten an individual citizen of a foreign country living thousands of miles away. On the other hand, Khomeini's death in 1989 led more pragmatic policies, with Presidents [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and [[Mohammad Khatami]] leading the charge for more stable relations with the west as well as its surrounding, non-Revolutionary-Islamic neighbors\u2014i.e., [[Saudi Arabia]]. Following the 2005 election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmedinejad]], Iran has returned to more a more hardline stance, frequently antagonizing the west and its neighbors while battling for control over the region.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the revolution, the Islamic Republic [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|went to war]] against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]] after the latter launched a military offensive in the 1980s. With most foreign aid going to Iraq, Iran was forced to accept a ceasefire by 1988. Tensions with Iraq remained long after the war; it was not until the death of Saddam himself that Iran and Iraq have started improving their relations.\n\nThe Islamic Republic founded and sponsored the Lebanese group known as [[Hezbollah]]; its leaders were followers of Khomeini. The creation of Hezbollah, and its funding from Iran, was in response to the Israeli occupation of Lebanon. Since then, Hezbollah has served as both an ally and a surrogate for Iran during its conflict with America and Israel. Author [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] describes the Islamic Republic's as having \"lost most of its allure among non-Iranian Shia's,\" giving as examples the 1995 house arrest in Qom of the two sons of Grand Ayatollah Shirazi, spiritual leader of the Bahraini Shia; and the close cooperation between the Afghan Shia party Wahdat and the U.S. Army after November 2001.<ref>Roy, Olivier, ''Globalized Islam'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p.67\u201368</ref>\n\nThe Islamic Republic strongly supports the [[Palestinian state|Palestinian]] cause. Government aid goes to everything from Palestinian hospitals to arms supplies. There is vigorous media publicity, an official \"Quds (Jerusalem) Day\", and squares and streets named after Palestine crisscross Iranian cities. Some question whether the issue has domestic grassroots support, arguing that Iranians \"lack emotional and cultural ties to Palestinians,\"<ref>Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p.59</ref> or has been too costly in terms of [[opportunity cost]] compared to peaceful coexistence.<ref>One study estimates that conflict in the Middle East has cost the Iranian population a substantial fraction of per capita income in opportunity cost of foregone economic growth. [http://www.strategicforesight.com/Cost%20of%20Conflict%20-%206%20pager.pdf A report by the Asian think tank Strategic Foresight Group] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519032453/http://www.strategicforesight.com/Cost%20of%20Conflict%20-%206%20pager.pdf |date=2012-05-19 }} estimates the [[opportunity cost]] of conflict (i.e. not just the cost of arms and destruction but lack of economic growth that peaceful coexistence would have made possible) in the Middle East from 1991\u20132010 at a $12 trillion. Iran\u2019s share of the opportunity cost came to over $2.1 trillion. In other words had there been peace since 1991, the average Iranian citizen would have an estimated income of $7700 rather the $4100 that he or she will earn in 2010.</ref>\n\n===Human development===\n{{See also|Education in Iran|Health care in Iran|Bonyad}}\n[[File:Net Migration Iran.png|thumb|right|[[Net migration|Net Iranian migration]] (1979\u20132008).

On November 4, 1979, Iranian students seized the [[United States|U.S.]] embassy in [[Tehran]] holding 52 embassy employees hostage for 444 days.  The [[Carter administration]] severed diplomatic relations and imposed [[economic sanctions]] on April 7, 1980, and later that month unsuccessfully attempted a rescue that further enhanced Khomeini's prestige in Iran.  On May 24 the [[International Court of Justice]] called for the [[hostage]]s to be released.  Finally, the hostages were released 20 January 1981, by agreement of the Carter Administration, see [[Algiers Accords]] Jan. 19, 1981.  The crisis also marked the beginning of American legal action, or sanctions, that economically separated Iran from America. Sanctions blocked all property within US jurisdiction owned by the Central Bank and Government of Iran.<ref>[http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/108E16.htm History Of US Sanctions Against Iran] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010024317/http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/108E16.htm |date=2017-10-10 }} Middle East Economic Survey, 26-August-2002</ref>\n\n====Suppression of opposition====\nRevolutionary factions disagreed on the shape of the new Iran. Those who thought the Shah would be replaced by a democratic government soon found Khomeini disagreed. In early March 1979, he  announced, \"do not use this term, \u2018democratic.\u2019 That is the Western style.\"<ref>Bakhash, Shaul, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'', p. 73.</ref>\n\nIn succession the [[National Democratic Front (Iran)|National Democratic Front]] was banned in August 1979, the [[The Interim Government of Iran|provisional government]] was disempowered in November, the [[Muslim People's Republican Party]] banned in January 1980, the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] guerrillas came under attack in February 1980, a purge of universities was begun in March 1980, and leftist President [[Abolhassan Banisadr]] was impeached in June 1981.\n\nExplanations for why Khomeini supporters were successful in crushing the opposition include lack of unity in the opposition. According to Asghar Schirazi, the moderates lacked ambition and were not well organized, while the radicals (such [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] or PMOI) were \"unrealistic\" about the conservatism of the Iranian masses and unprepared to work with moderates to fight against theocracy. Moderate Islamists, such as Banisadr, were \"credulous and submissive\" towards Khomeini.<ref>Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran: politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'', London; New York: I.B. Tauris, 1997, p.293-4</ref>\n\n====Terrorist attacks====\nThe ouster of President Banisadr did not put an immediate end to the opposition but moved it to terror.  Hundreds of PMOI supporters and members were killed from 1979 to 1981, and some 3,000 were arrested,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3632 |title=The address you were looking for doesn't exist |publisher=Tkb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115114802/http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3632 |archive-date=2008-01-15 |url-status=live }}</ref> but unlike other opposition is driven underground by the regime, the PMOI was able to retaliate.\n\nOn 28 June 1981, bombs were detonated at the headquarters of the since-dissolved [[Islamic Republic Party]]. Around 70 high-ranking officials, including Chief Justice [[Mohammad Beheshti]] (who was the second most powerful figure in the revolution after Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] at the time), cabinet members, and members of parliament, were killed. The PMOI never publicly confirmed or denied any  responsibility for the deed, but only stated the attack was `a natural and necessary reaction to the regime's atrocities.` Khomeini did accuse them of responsibility and, according to BBC journalist [[Baqer Moin]], the PMOI were \"generally perceived as the culprits\" for it in Iran.<ref>Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.241</ref>  Two months later on August 30, another bomb was detonated killing President [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai|Rajai]] and Premier [[Mohammad Javad Bahonar]].  A member of the PMOI, Mas'ud Kashmiri, was announced as the perpetrator, and according to regime reports came close to killing the entire government including Khomeini.<ref>Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.242-3</ref>  The reaction following both bombings was intense with thousands of arrests and hundreds of executions of PMOI and other leftist groups,<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), p. 241\u20132.</ref> but \"assassinations of leading officials and active supporters of the regime by the PMOI were to continue for the next year or two.\"<ref>Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.243</ref>\n\n===Iran\u2013Iraq War===\n{{Main|Iran\u2013Iraq War}}\n\nThe eight-year-long [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (September 1980 \u2013 August 1988) was the most important international event for the first decade of the Islamic Republic and possibly for its history so far. It helped to strengthen the revolution although it cost Iran much in lives and treasure.\n\nShortly after the success of the revolution, revolutionary leader  [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] began calling for Islamic revolutions across the [[Islamic world|Muslim world]], including Iran's Arab neighbor Iraq,<ref>1980 April 8 \u2013 Broadcast call by Khomeini for the pious of Iraq to overthrow Saddam and his regime. Al-Dawa al-Islamiya party in Iraqi is the hoped-for catalyst to start the rebellion.

The leadership in Tehran believed that they would launch a massive Shiite uprising across the Middle East and after Iraq's defeat, march on Israel and destroy it.\n\nThe war began with [[Iraq]]'s invasion of Iran, in an attempt by Iraq's dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] to take advantage of the perceived post-revolutionary military weakness in Iran and the Revolution's unpopularity with Western governments. Much of the top leadership of Iran's once-strong Iranian military had been executed. Saddam sought to expand Iraq's access to the [[Persian Gulf]] and the oil reserves in [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]] (which also only has a substantial [[Arab]] population), and to undermine Iranian Islamic revolutionary attempts to incite the Shi'a majority of his country. Iranians also believe Saddam invaded with the encouragement of [[the United States]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and other countries.\n\nA combination of fierce resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and by early 1982 Iran regained almost all the territory lost to the invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Khomeini's stature and allowed him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce, declaring \"the regime in Baghdad must fall and must be replaced by the Islamic Republic.\"<ref>Wright, ''In the Name of God,'' (1989), p.126</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |title=Time Magazine |access-date=2008-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160926/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |archive-date=2008-05-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe war continued for another six years under the slogans `War, War until Victory,` and `The Road to Jerusalem Goes through Karbala,`<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran,'' (2008), p.175</ref> but other countries, particularly the Soviet Union gave crucial aid to Iraq. The Iraqis also used chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers. As the costs mounted and Iranian morale waned, Khomeini finally accepted a truce called for by [[Wikisource: United Nations Security Council Resolution 598|UN Security Council Resolution 598]]. By 1988, Iran was nearly bankrupted by the ruinous costs of the war and its manpower pool also exhausted. The Iranian Army in desperation began resorting to using boys as young as 14 in human wave attacks against Iraqi machine gun emplacements.

It purged women from the judiciary and secular teachers from the educational system. It removed [[Baha'i]]s from government positions, closed down Baha'i Centers, and arrested and even executed their leaders.  A strict \"Islamic code of public appearance\" was enforced\u2014men were discouraged from wearing ties, women were obliged to wear either scarf and long coats or preferably the full chador.<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.177</ref>\n\n===Economy===\nIran's economy suffered during the first decade following the revolution.

In January 1988, he issued an edict declaring that the Islamic \"Government is among the most important divine injunctions and has priority over all peripheral divine orders ... even prayers, fasting and the Hajj.\"<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini : The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.135</ref> In April of the next year he decreed a task force to revise the country's constitution to separate the post of [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] from that of Shia [[Marja'|marja]], (the `highest source of religious emulation`), since he found none of Marja to be suitable successors as none had given strong support for his policies.<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.146</ref>  The amendments were drafted and approved by the public about one month after Khomeini's death (1989 July 9).

While Leader Khamenei and the [[Council of Guardians]] generally supported these policies, in the parliament radical deputies initially had control, outnumbered Rafsanjani's \"pragmatic-conservative camp\" 90 to 160.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.155</ref>\n\nThe two groups differed strongly over economic and foreign policy, with radicals tending to support mass political participation and state control of the economy, and oppose normalization of relations with the West.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.162</ref>  Conservatives used the power to disqualify candidates from running for office to deal with this problem. \"The Council of Guardians disqualified nearly all radical candidates from the fall 1990 Assembly of Experts elections because they had failed to pass written and oral tests in Islamic jurisprudence.\"<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini''  p.173</ref> In the winter and spring of 1992 nearly one-third of the 3150 candidates for the 1992 election for the parliament were rejected, including 39 incumbents.

Although Iran criticized the invasion and supported sanctions against its neighbor, it refused any active participation in the war, not surprising given the country's anti-Western attitudes and state of exhaustion from the recent conflict with its neighbor. As a result of the war and its aftermath, more than one million [[Kurds]] crossed the Iraqi border into Iran as [[refugees]].\n\n===Economy===\n[[File: Debt service-Iran.png|thumb|right|Iran's total [[Debt service ratio|debt service]] as percent of [[Balance of payments|exports of goods services and income]] increased sixfold between 1990 and 1997.]]\nDespite the \"economy first\" focus, Iran suffered serious economic problems during the Rafsanjani era. According to economist Bijan Khajehpour, economic growth in Iran between 1989 and 1994 was \"mainly financed through the accumulation of some $30 billion in foreign debt. In 1993, the ratio of Iran's foreign debt to the country's GDP reached 38%, which was alarming.\"<ref>\"Iran\u2019s Economy: 20 years after the Islamic Revolution\" by Bijan Khajehpour,\nfrom: ''Iran at the Crossroads'',  edited by John Esposito and R.K.

The [[Iranian rial]] plummeted from 1749 to 6400 to the dollar in 1995. Unemployment reached 30%. The price of sugar, rice, and butter rose threefold, and that of bread sixfold.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\nIn part this economic downturn came from [[Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|American economic sanctions leveled in 1995]], when America suspended all trade with Iran, accusing Iran of supporting terrorist groups and attempting to develop [[nuclear weapons]]. The sanctions, in turn, may be traceable to the earlier [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage crisis]] and the enmity of the US government which continued to see Iran as a major regional threat both to America and Israel.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\n===Birth control===\n{{Main|Family planning in Iran}}\nA new policy regarded as a success of the new government was its promotion of birth control.

In mid-2004 Iran began resuming the processing of [[nuclear fuel]] as part of its plan to achieve self-sufficiency in civilian nuclear power production, stating that the negotiations with [[European Union]] nations had failed to bring access to the advanced [[nuclear technology]] that was promised. The action was denounced by the United States as one which would give Iran the capability to develop nuclear weapons. The [[IAEA]] said that there was no [[evidence]] that Iran was seeking to develop such arms. However, the IAEA also called for Iran to abandon its plans to produce [[enriched uranium]]. In November 2004, Iran agreed to suspend [[uranium enrichment]] but subsequently indicated that it would not be held to the suspension if the negotiations the [[European Union|EU]] nations failed.\n\nDuring an October 2013 meeting, however, Iran agreed, in negotiations with several Western European nations, to toughen international inspections of its nuclear installations.<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40094.pdf \"Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program: Tehran\u2019s Compliance with International Obligations\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507202756/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40094.pdf |date=2017-05-07 }} Congressional Research Service, 4 April 2017.</ref> Nonetheless, the international community continued to express concerns over Iran's nuclear program.

Its  [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution]] was approved in 1979 and amended in 1989. [[Twelvers|Jaafari]] ([[Usuli]]) school of thought is the official religion.  It has an elected president and elected governmental bodies at the national, provincial and local levels for which all males and females from the age of 18 on up may vote, which are supervised by theocratic bodies, particularly the [[Council of Guardians]] which had veto power over who can run for parliament (or [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]]) and whether its bills can become law. Nonetheless the elected organs have more power than equivalent ones in the Shah's government.\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{Main|Iran's foreign policy}}\nFollowing the 1979 [[Iranian revolution|revolution]] in Iran, the Islamic revolutionary regime of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] dramatically reversed the pro-Western foreign policy of the regime it overthrew. Since then, Iran has oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour (promoting the Islamic revolution and struggling against non-Muslim tendencies abroad) and moves towards pragmatism (economic development and normalization of foreign relations). Khomeini's 1989 [[fatwa]] calling for the killing of British citizen [[Salman Rushdie]] for his allegedly blasphemous book, [[The Satanic Verses controversy|The Satanic Verses]], demonstrated the willingness of the Islamic revolutionaries to sacrifice trade and other ties with western countries to threaten an individual citizen of a foreign country living thousands of miles away. On the other hand, Khomeini's death in 1989 led more pragmatic policies, with Presidents [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and [[Mohammad Khatami]] leading the charge for more stable relations with the west as well as its surrounding, non-Revolutionary-Islamic neighbors\u2014i.e., [[Saudi Arabia]]. Following the 2005 election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmedinejad]], Iran has returned to more a more hardline stance, frequently antagonizing the west and its neighbors while battling for control over the region.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the revolution, the Islamic Republic [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|went to war]] against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]] after the latter launched a military offensive in the 1980s. With most foreign aid going to Iraq, Iran was forced to accept a ceasefire by 1988. Tensions with Iraq remained long after the war; it was not until the death of Saddam himself that Iran and Iraq have started improving their relations.\n\nThe Islamic Republic founded and sponsored the Lebanese group known as [[Hezbollah]]; its leaders were followers of Khomeini. The creation of Hezbollah, and its funding from Iran, was in response to the Israeli occupation of Lebanon. Since then, Hezbollah has served as both an ally and a surrogate for Iran during its conflict with America and Israel. Author [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] describes the Islamic Republic's as having \"lost most of its allure among non-Iranian Shia's,\" giving as examples the 1995 house arrest in Qom of the two sons of Grand Ayatollah Shirazi, spiritual leader of the Bahraini Shia; and the close cooperation between the Afghan Shia party Wahdat and the U.S. Army after November 2001.<ref>Roy, Olivier, ''Globalized Islam'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p.67\u201368</ref>\n\nThe Islamic Republic strongly supports the [[Palestinian state|Palestinian]] cause. Government aid goes to everything from Palestinian hospitals to arms supplies. There is vigorous media publicity, an official \"Quds (Jerusalem) Day\", and squares and streets named after Palestine crisscross Iranian cities. Some question whether the issue has domestic grassroots support, arguing that Iranians \"lack emotional and cultural ties to Palestinians,\"<ref>Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p.59</ref> or has been too costly in terms of [[opportunity cost]] compared to peaceful coexistence.<ref>One study estimates that conflict in the Middle East has cost the Iranian population a substantial fraction of per capita income in opportunity cost of foregone economic growth.

Iran\u2019s share of the opportunity cost came to over $2.1 trillion. In other words had there been peace since 1991, the average Iranian citizen would have an estimated income of $7700 rather the $4100 that he or she will earn in 2010.</ref>\n\n===Human development===\n{{See also|Education in Iran|Health care in Iran|Bonyad}}\n[[File:Net Migration Iran.png|thumb|right|[[Net migration|Net Iranian migration]] (1979\u20132008).

Iranians also believe Saddam invaded with the encouragement of [[the United States]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and other countries.\n\nA combination of fierce resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and by early 1982 Iran regained almost all the territory lost to the invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Khomeini's stature and allowed him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce, declaring \"the regime in Baghdad must fall and must be replaced by the Islamic Republic.\"<ref>Wright, ''In the Name of God,'' (1989), p.126</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |title=Time Magazine |access-date=2008-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160926/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |archive-date=2008-05-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe war continued for another six years under the slogans `War, War until Victory,` and `The Road to Jerusalem Goes through Karbala,`<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran,'' (2008), p.175</ref> but other countries, particularly the Soviet Union gave crucial aid to Iraq. The Iraqis also used chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers. As the costs mounted and Iranian morale waned, Khomeini finally accepted a truce called for by [[Wikisource: United Nations Security Council Resolution 598|UN Security Council Resolution 598]]. By 1988, Iran was nearly bankrupted by the ruinous costs of the war and its manpower pool also exhausted. The Iranian Army in desperation began resorting to using boys as young as 14 in human wave attacks against Iraqi machine gun emplacements. Khomeini remarked that agreeing to peace with Iraq was \"like drinking poison\", but there was no other choice.<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p.285</ref>  Although neither borders nor regimes were changed<ref>''The Longest War : Iran-Iraq Military Conflict'' by Dilip Hiro, (1991), p.255</ref> the war helped to `awaken the people and to fight the problems that threaten the revolution,` according to future president [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]].<ref>Hiro, Dilip, The Longest War, Routledge, 1991, p.257</ref> An estimated 200,000 Iranians were killed<ref>IRI government estimate is 200,000 Iranian troops and civilians killed.</ref> and the war is estimated to have cost Iran $627 billion in total direct and indirect charges (in 1990 dollars).<ref>''The Longest War: Iran-Iraq Military Conflict'' by Dilip Hiro, (1991), p.250-1</ref>\n\n===Early laws of the Islamic Republic===\nThe new regime undid the Shah's old Family Protection Law, lowering the marriage age for girls back to nine and allowed husbands to divorce wives with the [[Triple talaq]], without court permission. It purged women from the judiciary and secular teachers from the educational system. It removed [[Baha'i]]s from government positions, closed down Baha'i Centers, and arrested and even executed their leaders.  A strict \"Islamic code of public appearance\" was enforced\u2014men were discouraged from wearing ties, women were obliged to wear either scarf and long coats or preferably the full chador.<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.177</ref>\n\n===Economy===\nIran's economy suffered during the first decade following the revolution. Its currency, the rial, fell from 7 to the dollar before the revolution, to 1749 to the dollar in 1989.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\">Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.185</ref>  The revolution also is said to have put an end to the influence of \"the notables\", and created a very large public sector of the economy, when the government \"nationalizing their enterprises in order to keep their employees working... the state ended up with more than 2000 factories many of them operating in the red.\"<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), (p.176)</ref>\n\n===Human Rights===\n\nIn its early years, the revolutionary regime was especially criticized for its human rights record.<ref>''Iran: imprisonment, torture, and execution of political opponents'' / Amnesty International.  Amnesty International, 1992.</ref> In the first 28 months of the Islamic Republic, between February 1979 and June 1981, revolutionary courts executed 497 political opponents as \"counterrevolutionaries\", and \"sowers of corruption on earth\" ([[Mofsed-e-filarz]]). In the next four years from June 1981 until June 1985, the courts sentenced more than 8000 opponents to death.<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions: Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran'', University of California Press, 1999, pp.124\u2013129</ref>  After a relative lull, [[1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners|thousands of political prisoners]] were executed in 1988.  Like other revolutions before it, the Iranian Revolution took a higher toll on those who had participated in the revolution than those in the regime it overthrew.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, Ervand 2008, p.181\"/>\n\n==Rafsanjani administration==\n{{See also|Rafsanjani#Presidency|l1=Rafsanjani presidency}}\n\n===Ideological changes by fatwa and constitution===\nTwo major changes in the ideological underpinnings of the Islamic Republic occurred toward the end of Khomeini's reign. In January 1988, he issued an edict declaring that the Islamic \"Government is among the most important divine injunctions and has priority over all peripheral divine orders ... even prayers, fasting and the Hajj.\"<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini : The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.135</ref> In April of the next year he decreed a task force to revise the country's constitution to separate the post of [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] from that of Shia [[Marja'|marja]], (the `highest source of religious emulation`), since he found none of Marja to be suitable successors as none had given strong support for his policies.<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.146</ref>  The amendments were drafted and approved by the public about one month after Khomeini's death (1989 July 9). They paved the way for [[Ali Khamenei]] \u2013 a long time lieutenant of Khomeini, but a relatively low ranking cleric \u2013 to be Khomeini's successor as [[Supreme Leader]],<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''History of Modern Iran'', Columbia University Press, 2008, p.183</ref> but to critics they undermined the \"intellectual foundations\" of the Islamic Republic theocracy,<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Khomeinism: Essays on the Islamic Republic'', (University of California Press, c1993). p.34-5</ref><ref name=\"WMRI\">[http://www.danielpipes.org/article/273 The Western Mind of Radical Islam by Daniel Pipes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122122142/http://www.danielpipes.org/article/273 |date=2009-01-22 }} ''First Things'', December 1995</ref> breaking \"the charismatic bond between leader and followers.\"<ref>Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'', (2001), p.3</ref>\n\n===Political struggle===\n\nThe first post-war decade in Iran has been described as a time of pragmatism, and an `economy-first` policy.<ref>Pasri, Trita, ''Treacherous Alliance: the secret dealings of Israel, Iran and the United States'', Yale University Press, 2007, p.132</ref>  According to Shirin Ebadi, \"about two years into the postwar period, the Islamic Republic quietly changed course. ... It was fairly clear by then that the [[Shia]] revolution would not be sweeping the region.\"<ref>Ebadi, Shirin, ''Iran Awakening: A Memoir of Revolution and Hope'', by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006, (p.109)</ref>\n\n[[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] was elected president shortly after Khomeini's death, and has been described as less revolutionary and \"isolationist\" than his rivals \u2014 \"economically liberal, politically authoritarian, and philosophically traditional.\"<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.153</ref> (He served from August 17, 1989, to August 1997.)   While Leader Khamenei and the [[Council of Guardians]] generally supported these policies, in the parliament radical deputies initially had control, outnumbered Rafsanjani's \"pragmatic-conservative camp\" 90 to 160.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.155</ref>\n\nThe two groups differed strongly over economic and foreign policy, with radicals tending to support mass political participation and state control of the economy, and oppose normalization of relations with the West.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.162</ref>  Conservatives used the power to disqualification candidates from running for office to deal with this problem. \"The Council of Guardians disqualified nearly all radical candidates from the fall 1990 Assembly of Experts elections because they had failed to pass written and oral tests in Islamic jurisprudence.\"<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini''  p.173</ref> In the winter and spring of 1992 nearly one-third of the 3150 candidates for the 1992 election for the parliament were rejected, including 39 incumbents. Leading radicals such as Khalkhali, Nabvi, Bayat, and Hajjat al-Islam Hadi Ghaffari were sent packing because they lacked the \"proper Islamic credentials.\"<ref name=\"Brumberg, p.175\">Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini''  p.175</ref>\n\nIn late 1992 Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Seyed [[Mohammad Khatami]] and director of the Voice and Vision Broadcasting company [[Mohammad Hashemi]] Rafsanjani (brother of the president) were both forced out. By 1994 \"hundreds of intellectuals and supposed dissidents were in prison and some had been executed.\"  These purges cleared the regime of opponents but are thought to have set the stage for the [[Iranian reform movement|reform movement]], as exiled radicals warmed to the \"liberal\" values of freedom of speech, assembly, due process, etc.<ref name=\"Brumberg, p.175\"/>\n\n===Persian Gulf War===\nIraq invaded and overran [[Kuwait]] on August 2, 1990, causing a multinational coalition of UN forces to be assembled in response. Although Iran criticized the invasion and supported sanctions against its neighbor, it refused any active participation in the war, not surprising given the country's anti-Western attitudes and state of exhaustion from the recent conflict with its neighbor. As a result of the war and its aftermath, more than one million [[Kurds]] crossed the Iraqi border into Iran as [[refugees]].\n\n===Economy===\n[[File: Debt service-Iran.png|thumb|right|Iran's total [[Debt service ratio|debt service]] as percent of [[Balance of payments|exports of goods services and income]] increased sixfold between 1990 and 1997.]]\nDespite the \"economy first\" focus, Iran suffered serious economic problems during the Rafsanjani era. According to economist Bijan Khajehpour, economic growth in Iran between 1989 and 1994 was \"mainly financed through the accumulation of some $30 billion in foreign debt. In 1993, the ratio of Iran's foreign debt to the country's GDP reached 38%, which was alarming.\"<ref>\"Iran\u2019s Economy: 20 years after the Islamic Revolution\" by Bijan Khajehpour,\nfrom: ''Iran at the Crossroads'',  edited by John Esposito and R.K. Ramazani, New York : Palgrave, 2001, p.98</ref> A lack of foreign investment along with a fall in oil prices from $20 to $12 per barrel added to this external debt, and triggered an economic recession. The [[Iranian rial]] plummeted from 1749 to 6400 to the dollar in 1995. Unemployment reached 30%. The price of sugar, rice, and butter rose threefold, and that of bread sixfold.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\nIn part this economic downturn came from [[Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|American economic sanctions leveled in 1995]], when America suspended all trade with Iran, accusing Iran of supporting terrorist groups and attempting to develop [[nuclear weapons]]. The sanctions, in turn, may be traceable to the earlier [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage crisis]] and the enmity of the US government which continued to see Iran as a major regional threat both to America and Israel.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\n===Birth control===\n{{Main|Family planning in Iran}}\nA new policy regarded as a success of the new government was its promotion of birth control. In 1989, the government, \"having previously encouraged population growth, reversed gears and declared that Islam favored families with only two children\". Birth control clinics were opened \u2013 especially for women. Condoms and pills were distributed. Subsidies to large families were cut. Sex education was introduced into the school curriculum, mandatory classes for newlyweds were held.<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.184</ref>)\n\n==Khatami administration==\n[[File:TEPIX.PNG|thumb|right|Between March 2001 and April 2003, the [[Tehran Stock Exchange|TSE index]] (Topix) bucked the trend by going up nearly 80%.<ref>The Tehran Stock Exchange: A Maverick Performer?, Middle East Economic Survey, May 23, 2005,</ref>]]\n\nThe eight years of [[Mohammad Khatami]]'s two terms as president in 1997\u20132005 are sometimes called Iran's Reform Era.<ref>Ebadi, Shirin, ''Iran Awakening : A Memoir of Revolution and Hope'', by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006, p.180</ref>\n\nKhatami based his campaign on a reform program promising a more democratic and tolerant society, promotion of civil society, the rule of law and improvement of social rights.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2267/is_2_67/ai_63787333 |title=Civil Society and the Rule of Law in the Constitutional Politics of Iran Under Khatami \u2013 Iranian president Mohammad Khatami {{!}} Social Research {{!}} Find Articles at BNET.com |access-date=2007-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315125217/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2267/is_2_67/ai_63787333 |archive-date=2007-03-15 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iranchamber.com/government/articles/civil_society_politics_iran_khatami.php |title=Civil Society and the Rule of Law in the Constitutional Politics of Iran Under Khatami \u2013Iranian president Mohammad Khatami |access-date=2007-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181614/http://www.iranchamber.com/government/articles/civil_society_politics_iran_khatami.php |archive-date=2007-09-30 |url-status=live }}</ref> This included city council elections, adherence to Iran's  constitution, freedom to criticize high ranking authorities \u2013 including the [[supreme leader]], permission to operate newspapers of a wide range of political views, reopening the embassies of all European countries, reorganizing the [[Ministry of Intelligence of Iran]] after the Iran's [[Chain murders of Iran|Chain Murders of Intellectuals]], initiating a dialogue between people of different faith inside and outside Iran, also called \"[[Dialogue Among Civilizations]].\"\n\nIran's large youth demographic (by 1995, about half of the country's 60.5 million people had not been born after the Islamic Revolution) is one of Khatami's bases of support.\n\n{{See also|Mohammad Khatami's reforms|Iranian reform movement}}\n\n===Political and cultural changes===\nAt first, the new era saw significant liberalization.

[[Iran student protests, July 1999|Prodemocracy student demonstrations]] erupted at [[Tehran University]] and other urban campuses. These were followed by a wave of counter-demonstrations by [[Social conservatism|conservative]] factions.\n\n[[Reform]]ers won a substantial victory in Feb. 2000, [[parliamentary]] elections, capturing about two-thirds of the seats, but [[Social conservatism|conservative]] elements in the government forced the closure of the reformist press. Attempts by parliament to repeal restrictive press laws were forbidden by Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]]. Despite these conditions, President Khatami was overwhelming re-elected in June 2001. Tensions between reformers in parliament and conservatives in the [[judiciary]] and the [[Guardian Council]], over both [[social]] and [[economic]] changes, increased after Khatami's reelection.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Military expenditures-Iran.png|thumb|right|Military expenditures (% GDP)]]\nKhatami worked to improve relations with other countries visiting many other countries and holding a dialogue between civilizations and encouraged foreigners to invest in Iran. He announced Iran would accept a two-state solution for Palestine if Palestinians agreed to one, relaxed restrictions on the [[Persecution of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds|Bahais]], and assured Britain Iran would not implement the fatwa against [[The Satanic Verses controversy|Salman Rushdie]].<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.189</ref> Several [[European Union]] countries began renewing economic ties with Iran in the late 1990s, and trade and investment increased. In 1998, Britain re-established diplomatic relations with Iran, broken since the 1979 revolution.  The United States loosened its economic embargo, but it continued to block more normalized relations, arguing that the country had been implicated in international terrorism and was developing a [[nuclear weapons]] capacity. In his [[State of the Union Address]], United States President [[George W. Bush]] labeled Iran, along with [[Iraq]] and [[North Korea]], as an \"[[Axis of evil]].\"\n\nTensions with the United States increased after the [[Anglo-America]]n invasion of Iraq in March 2003, as U.S. officials increasingly denounced Iran for pursuing the alleged development of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe reform era ended with the conservatives defeat of Iranian reformists in the elections of 2003, 2004 and 2005 \u2013 the local, parliamentary, and presidential elections. According to at least one observer, the reformists were defeated not so much by a growth of support for conservative Islamist policies as by division within the reformist movement and the banning of many reform candidates which discouraged pro-reform voters from voting.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.194\"/>\n\n==Ahmadinejad's administration==\n{{Main|Government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005\u20132013)}}\n{{Update|date=December 2009}}\n\n[[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was elected to the presidency twice, in [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|2005]] and [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009]].

The action was denounced by the United States as one which would give Iran the capability to develop nuclear weapons. The [[IAEA]] said that there was no [[evidence]] that Iran was seeking to develop such arms. However, the IAEA also called for Iran to abandon its plans to produce [[enriched uranium]]. In November 2004, Iran agreed to suspend [[uranium enrichment]] but subsequently indicated that it would not be held to the suspension if the negotiations the [[European Union|EU]] nations failed.\n\nDuring an October 2013 meeting, however, Iran agreed, in negotiations with several Western European nations, to toughen international inspections of its nuclear installations.<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40094.pdf \"Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program: Tehran\u2019s Compliance with International Obligations\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507202756/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40094.pdf |date=2017-05-07 }} Congressional Research Service, 4 April 2017.</ref> Nonetheless, the international community continued to express concerns over Iran's nuclear program.

He is best known for his appearances with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as '''Hugh Morrus''' and [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment]] (WWF/E) under his real name.<ref name=WWEbio/> DeMott also performed as '''Crash the Terminator''' in both [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) and [[Puroresu|Japan]].<ref name=WWEbio/> He was most recently the head trainer for WWE's [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental system]] [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] until his resignation in 2015 following allegations of misconduct, which he denied.\n\nGenerally used as a [[Job (professional wrestling)#Jobbers|jobber to the stars]] in WCW, he attained championship success during the promotion's dying days in late 2000 and early 2001, holding the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]] [[List of WWE United States Champions|twice]]. After an unsuccessful stint as a performer in WWE, DeMott retired from in-ring competition and transitioned into the role of a trainer for the company's ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'' program, on which he became known for using a rough, controversial style in handling trainees, as well as WWE's developmental territories [[Deep South Wrestling]], [[Florida Championship Wrestling]], and [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Charles DeMott II<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> was born on November 10, 1966,<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html|title=Bill DeMott|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221053236/http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html| archivedate= 21 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> He grew up in [[Paramus, New Jersey]], graduating from [[Paramus High School]] in 1983.<ref>Levine, Cecilia.

Accessed November 18, 2017. \"Oct. 10, 2015 was the day life both stopped and started for Paramus native Bill DeMott.... DeMott graduated from Paramus High School in 1983, and went on to become a pro wrestler, earning himself the title of world heavyweight champion, and more.\"</ref>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early career (1988\u20131994)===\nDeMott was trained by [[Johnny Rodz]] in his [[New York City]] wrestling school beginning in 1988. From there he began working at small independent promotions using the name Big Sweet Williams. In 1992 DeMott began wrestling for the [[American Wrestling Federation]] and started using the [[ring name|name]] Crash the Terminator. Under this name he found some success, first capturing the AWF Heavyweight title from Steve Strong in [[Puerto Rico]], before moving on to the Japanese promotion W*ING and winning their World Tag Team Championship with [[Mr. Pogo]]. In 1993, while competing in W*ING, DeMott won a 16-man tournament to be crowned their World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nWhen DeMott returned to the United States, he wrestled for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] for a short time under his Crash the Terminator name. On February 21, 1994 DeMott received a tryout match with the [[World Wrestling Federation]] at a [[Monday Night Raw]] taping at Poughkeepsie, NY. He also had matches over the next two days at taping for [[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]] and [[Wrestling Challenge]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm</ref> He then went to Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling, where won the latter promotion's World Heavyweight Championship upon winning a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]].  Crash's final ECW appearance came on May 13, 1994, in a TV victory against AJ Powers, which aired on June 7.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1995\u20132001)===\n\n====The Dungeon of Doom and The First Family (1995\u20132000)====\n{{Main|The First Family (professional wrestling)|l1=The First Family}}\nIn 1995, DeMott was signed to a [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) contract at the behest of [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] who had been impressed by him. He debuted in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]]es as The Man of Question and The Laughing Man, a strange [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that saw him wearing a singlet covered in question marks and laughing frequently. He made his television debut as a member of [[The Dungeon of Doom]] as \"The Laughing Man\" Hugh Morrus (a [[pun]] on the word humorous) on the November 18, 1995 episode of WCW Saturday Night in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignette]] inside the Dungeon, where Kevin Sullivan told his ([[kayfabe]]) father, [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Master]], that he was giving him something he never had: laughter, and that he was giving him \"the man from the Isle of Nowhere.\"\n\nUpon the dissolution of the Dungeon of Doom, Morrus was relegated to the undercard. He gained the distinction of being the first wrestler to lose a televised match to [[Bill Goldberg]] during the September 22, 1997 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''. As a part of the growing [[hardcore wrestling]] style in WCW, Morrus joined [[Jimmy Hart]]'s [[The First Family (professional wrestling)|First Family]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]]. Although the Family found success and received a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] following a victory over their rivals [[Revolution (professional wrestling)|The Revolution]], the stable was suddenly disbanded.\n\nAt this time, DeMott took some time off from WCW. He returned in early 2000, utilizing the same name and ring attire, but [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squashing]] a number of wrestlers as an angrier version of himself. The angry Morrus gimmick came to a halt when [[Vince Russo]] and [[Eric Bischoff]] took over and aimed to take WCW in a new direction.\n\n====The Misfits In Action (2000\u20132001)====\n{{Main|The Misfits In Action}}\nAfter getting on Russo's bad side (in [[kayfabe]]), Morrus was fired from his [[The New Blood|New Blood]] stable along with a number of other wrestlers. These ex-New Blood members (including [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]) formed the comedic [[The Misfits In Action|Misfits In Action]] stable, which saw its members adopt both military-themed names and attires. As the stable's leader, Morrus re-christened himself General Hugh G. Rection, and led the group in a feud against [[The Filthy Animals]].\n\nThe group's comedic nature and the workrate of some of the wrestlers made the group immediate favorites with fans. Upon the introduction of the heel [[Team Canada (WCW)|Team Canada]], the Misfits In Action immediately began feuding with Team Canada, based over the patriotism both stables had for their respective countries. As the leader of the Misfits, Rection feuded with Team Canada's leader and [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Champion]] [[Lance Storm]], with the two trading wins until Rection defeated both Storm and a [[turncoat]] [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] in a handicap match on October 29 at [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]] to win the title. Rection would soon lose the title back to Storm on the November 13 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' before defeating Storm to regain the title on November 26 at [[Mayhem (2000)|Mayhem]].\n\nAfter his feud with Storm, the next night on ''Nitro'', DeMott stood in the ring and spoke to the fans. During this segment, the WCW locker room emptied and many wrestlers from backstage stood on the entrance way clapping for DeMott; [[Bill Goldberg]] grabbed the microphone and, fondly recalling his first opponent in WCW, said \"Hey, Goldberg's streak had to start somewhere, my friend.\"\n\nAt [[WCW Sin|Sin]] on January 14, 2001, Rection lost the United States Heavyweight Title to [[Shane Douglas]]. Following the title loss, the Misfits disbanded when Rection announced that they were [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorably discharged]], which led to Rection reverting to his Hugh Morrus name while the now former Misfits briefly feuded amongst each other. DeMott would then resume his pursuit of the United States Heavyweight Title until the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) bought out WCW.\n\n===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001\u20132007)===\n\n====The Alliance (2001\u20132002)====\nWhen WCW was purchased by the WWF, DeMott signed a deal with the WWF and became part of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle under his Hugh Morrus ring name as a member of [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]. Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4, 2001 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' by attacking [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. Aside from a [[pay-per-view]] match at [[WWF Invasion|Invasion]] on July 22 where he, [[Shawn Stasiak]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] defeated [[Big Show]], [[Billy Gunn]] and [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] and an [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] match on the August 27 episode of ''Raw'' which he lost to [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] via disqualification, Morrus was relegated to wrestling on the company's secondary shows ''[[WWE Heat|Heat]]'' and ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' much like his fellow WCW alumni. In the September 29 episode of WWE Metal, Morrus made his first appearance at the show, where he takes on Billy Gunn, in a losing effort. When The Invasion ended at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] following Team Alliance's loss to Team WWF, Morrus was [[kayfabe]] fired by [[Vince McMahon]]. While off television, Morrus performed at [[house show]]s and worked in company's developmental territory [[Heartland Wrestling Association]] (HWA). During his time in the HWA, he teamed with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] to defeat [[Lance Cade]] and [[Steve Bradley]] to win the [[HWA Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Champions]] on March 12, 2002, which they lost only three days later.\n\n====SmackDown! (2002\u20132004)====\nIn April 2002, Morrus was drafted to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. He made his television return on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' alongside fellow WCW alumnus [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]] and defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] and [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]]. Morrus was soon relegated to being a mainstay on ''Jakked'' and later ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'' until late July 2002, when he was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimately]] injured in a motorcycle accident and had to take a leave of absence. During his time away, he became a trainer for the third season of ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'', WWE's [[reality television]] show.\n\nWhen he had sufficiently healed, Morrus made his return on the November 23 episode of ''Velocity'' under his real name. DeMott made his ''SmackDown!'' debut on December 5 as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], where he defeated Funaki in a [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squash]] match. The victory saw DeMott immediately receive a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that saw him squash several established wrestlers, including Funaki, [[Shannon Moore]], [[Chuck Palumbo]], [[Crash Holly]], and [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] weekly on ''SmackDown!''. However, this came to an end soon and saw DeMott relegated back to ''Velocity'' beginning in February 2003. In May, DeMott made a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] that also saw him tell [[knock-knock joke]]s as part of the turn. As the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] failed to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|get over]], he remained on ''Velocity'' while continuing to win several squash matches. DeMott wrestled his last televised match on the June 14 episode of ''Velocity'', where he defeated fellow WCW alumnus [[Chris Kanyon]]. Later that month, DeMott retired from in-ring action, citing years of knee injuries. He then moved on to become the [[color commentator]] for ''Velocity'',<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/31 31]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/31}}</ref> beginning on the November 1 episode,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_5901.shtml|title=10/11 WWE Velocity review: Bill Demott debuts on color commentary}}</ref> and remained in that position until December 11, 2004.\n\n====Deep South Wrestling (2004\u20132007)====\nWhen ''[[WWE Tough Enough#$1,000,000 Tough Enough (Season 4)|Tough Enough 4]]'' wrapped production, DeMott did not make a return to ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]''.

Nicholson described an incident where [[Drew Hankinson]] was completely naked in the ring for a long period of time and gave naked [[Professional wrestling attacks#Stink Face|stinkface]]s to [[Zack Ryder]] and [[Melissa Coates]] while DeMott held jelly donuts over their faces.

He is best known for his appearances with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as '''Hugh Morrus''' and [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment]] (WWF/E) under his real name.<ref name=WWEbio/> DeMott also performed as '''Crash the Terminator''' in both [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) and [[Puroresu|Japan]].<ref name=WWEbio/> He was most recently the head trainer for WWE's [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental system]] [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] until his resignation in 2015 following allegations of misconduct, which he denied.\n\nGenerally used as a [[Job (professional wrestling)#Jobbers|jobber to the stars]] in WCW, he attained championship success during the promotion's dying days in late 2000 and early 2001, holding the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]] [[List of WWE United States Champions|twice]]. After an unsuccessful stint as a performer in WWE, DeMott retired from in-ring competition and transitioned into the role of a trainer for the company's ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'' program, on which he became known for using a rough, controversial style in handling trainees, as well as WWE's developmental territories [[Deep South Wrestling]], [[Florida Championship Wrestling]], and [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Charles DeMott II<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> was born on November 10, 1966,<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html|title=Bill DeMott|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221053236/http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html| archivedate= 21 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> He grew up in [[Paramus, New Jersey]], graduating from [[Paramus High School]] in 1983.<ref>Levine, Cecilia.

Accessed November 18, 2017. \"Oct. 10, 2015 was the day life both stopped and started for Paramus native Bill DeMott.... DeMott graduated from Paramus High School in 1983, and went on to become a pro wrestler, earning himself the title of world heavyweight champion, and more.\"</ref>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early career (1988\u20131994)===\nDeMott was trained by [[Johnny Rodz]] in his [[New York City]] wrestling school beginning in 1988. From there he began working at small independent promotions using the name Big Sweet Williams. In 1992 DeMott began wrestling for the [[American Wrestling Federation]] and started using the [[ring name|name]] Crash the Terminator. Under this name he found some success, first capturing the AWF Heavyweight title from Steve Strong in [[Puerto Rico]], before moving on to the Japanese promotion W*ING and winning their World Tag Team Championship with [[Mr. Pogo]]. In 1993, while competing in W*ING, DeMott won a 16-man tournament to be crowned their World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nWhen DeMott returned to the United States, he wrestled for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] for a short time under his Crash the Terminator name. On February 21, 1994 DeMott received a tryout match with the [[World Wrestling Federation]] at a [[Monday Night Raw]] taping at Poughkeepsie, NY. He also had matches over the next two days at taping for [[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]] and [[Wrestling Challenge]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm</ref> He then went to Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling, where won the latter promotion's World Heavyweight Championship upon winning a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]].  Crash's final ECW appearance came on May 13, 1994, in a TV victory against AJ Powers, which aired on June 7.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1995\u20132001)===\n\n====The Dungeon of Doom and The First Family (1995\u20132000)====\n{{Main|The First Family (professional wrestling)|l1=The First Family}}\nIn 1995, DeMott was signed to a [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) contract at the behest of [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] who had been impressed by him. He debuted in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]]es as The Man of Question and The Laughing Man, a strange [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that saw him wearing a singlet covered in question marks and laughing frequently. He made his television debut as a member of [[The Dungeon of Doom]] as \"The Laughing Man\" Hugh Morrus (a [[pun]] on the word humorous) on the November 18, 1995 episode of WCW Saturday Night in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignette]] inside the Dungeon, where Kevin Sullivan told his ([[kayfabe]]) father, [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Master]], that he was giving him something he never had: laughter, and that he was giving him \"the man from the Isle of Nowhere.\"\n\nUpon the dissolution of the Dungeon of Doom, Morrus was relegated to the undercard. He gained the distinction of being the first wrestler to lose a televised match to [[Bill Goldberg]] during the September 22, 1997 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''. As a part of the growing [[hardcore wrestling]] style in WCW, Morrus joined [[Jimmy Hart]]'s [[The First Family (professional wrestling)|First Family]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]]. Although the Family found success and received a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] following a victory over their rivals [[Revolution (professional wrestling)|The Revolution]], the stable was suddenly disbanded.\n\nAt this time, DeMott took some time off from WCW. He returned in early 2000, utilizing the same name and ring attire, but [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squashing]] a number of wrestlers as an angrier version of himself. The angry Morrus gimmick came to a halt when [[Vince Russo]] and [[Eric Bischoff]] took over and aimed to take WCW in a new direction.\n\n====The Misfits In Action (2000\u20132001)====\n{{Main|The Misfits In Action}}\nAfter getting on Russo's bad side (in [[kayfabe]]), Morrus was fired from his [[The New Blood|New Blood]] stable along with a number of other wrestlers. These ex-New Blood members (including [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]) formed the comedic [[The Misfits In Action|Misfits In Action]] stable, which saw its members adopt both military-themed names and attires. As the stable's leader, Morrus re-christened himself General Hugh G. Rection, and led the group in a feud against [[The Filthy Animals]].\n\nThe group's comedic nature and the workrate of some of the wrestlers made the group immediate favorites with fans. Upon the introduction of the heel [[Team Canada (WCW)|Team Canada]], the Misfits In Action immediately began feuding with Team Canada, based over the patriotism both stables had for their respective countries. As the leader of the Misfits, Rection feuded with Team Canada's leader and [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Champion]] [[Lance Storm]], with the two trading wins until Rection defeated both Storm and a [[turncoat]] [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] in a handicap match on October 29 at [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]] to win the title. Rection would soon lose the title back to Storm on the November 13 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' before defeating Storm to regain the title on November 26 at [[Mayhem (2000)|Mayhem]].\n\nAfter his feud with Storm, the next night on ''Nitro'', DeMott stood in the ring and spoke to the fans. During this segment, the WCW locker room emptied and many wrestlers from backstage stood on the entrance way clapping for DeMott; [[Bill Goldberg]] grabbed the microphone and, fondly recalling his first opponent in WCW, said \"Hey, Goldberg's streak had to start somewhere, my friend.\"\n\nAt [[WCW Sin|Sin]] on January 14, 2001, Rection lost the United States Heavyweight Title to [[Shane Douglas]]. Following the title loss, the Misfits disbanded when Rection announced that they were [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorably discharged]], which led to Rection reverting to his Hugh Morrus name while the now former Misfits briefly feuded amongst each other. DeMott would then resume his pursuit of the United States Heavyweight Title until the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) bought out WCW.\n\n===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001\u20132007)===\n\n====The Alliance (2001\u20132002)====\nWhen WCW was purchased by the WWF, DeMott signed a deal with the WWF and became part of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle under his Hugh Morrus ring name as a member of [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]. Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4, 2001 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' by attacking [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. Aside from a [[pay-per-view]] match at [[WWF Invasion|Invasion]] on July 22 where he, [[Shawn Stasiak]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] defeated [[Big Show]], [[Billy Gunn]] and [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] and an [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] match on the August 27 episode of ''Raw'' which he lost to [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] via disqualification, Morrus was relegated to wrestling on the company's secondary shows ''[[WWE Heat|Heat]]'' and ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' much like his fellow WCW alumni. In the September 29 episode of WWE Metal, Morrus made his first appearance at the show, where he takes on Billy Gunn, in a losing effort. When The Invasion ended at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] following Team Alliance's loss to Team WWF, Morrus was [[kayfabe]] fired by [[Vince McMahon]]. While off television, Morrus performed at [[house show]]s and worked in company's developmental territory [[Heartland Wrestling Association]] (HWA). During his time in the HWA, he teamed with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] to defeat [[Lance Cade]] and [[Steve Bradley]] to win the [[HWA Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Champions]] on March 12, 2002, which they lost only three days later.\n\n====SmackDown! (2002\u20132004)====\nIn April 2002, Morrus was drafted to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. He made his television return on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' alongside fellow WCW alumnus [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]] and defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] and [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]]. Morrus was soon relegated to being a mainstay on ''Jakked'' and later ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'' until late July 2002, when he was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimately]] injured in a motorcycle accident and had to take a leave of absence. During his time away, he became a trainer for the third season of ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'', WWE's [[reality television]] show.\n\nWhen he had sufficiently healed, Morrus made his return on the November 23 episode of ''Velocity'' under his real name. DeMott made his ''SmackDown!'' debut on December 5 as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], where he defeated Funaki in a [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squash]] match. The victory saw DeMott immediately receive a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that saw him squash several established wrestlers, including Funaki, [[Shannon Moore]], [[Chuck Palumbo]], [[Crash Holly]], and [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] weekly on ''SmackDown!''. However, this came to an end soon and saw DeMott relegated back to ''Velocity'' beginning in February 2003. In May, DeMott made a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] that also saw him tell [[knock-knock joke]]s as part of the turn. As the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] failed to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|get over]], he remained on ''Velocity'' while continuing to win several squash matches.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.
