They get looked at confused, but I don't think that they're confused. I feel that they're just talented, swavey artists.

A lot of people use it as an attribute, but the real definition of swavey is a genre of music. The genre of music is the genre of fusing more than one together. I know it sounds strange, but if you ask an artist what they do they're going to say that they rap, they sing, they do rock, a lot of people are multi-talented. They get looked at confused, but I don't think that they're confused. I feel that they're just talented, swavey artists. Labels want to put you in one lane, but I feel like there are so many people are more than that and they're swavey artists.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nicekicks.com/2012/10/14/tory-lanez-talks-air-jordans-music-industry-advice-staying-swavey/|title=Tory Lanez Talks Air Jordans, Music Industry Advice & Staying Swavey &#124; Nice Kicks|date=October 14, 2012|accessdate=July 7, 2015|author=Stonebook, Ian}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n===Drake===\nIn 2010, Lanez posted a video on YouTube, challenging fellow Canadian [[rapper]] [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], to whom he was rumored to be related. The video features him denying these rumors and announcing the $10,000 challenge. While showing Drake respect, Lanez again challenged him, but only if Drake would listen to some of his tracks from his second mixtape ''Playing for Keeps''. Lanez also claimed that if Drake did not like it, he would personally give to him $10,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torylanez.wordpress.com/about/|title=Biography The Official Tory Lanez Fansite|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://drizzy.ning.com/m/discussion?id=3514281%3ATopic%3A110007|title=Tory Lanez $10,000 Challenge To Drake (Who Do Ya'll Think?)|date=March 27, 2010|author=Kevin G|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In August 2015, while appearing on the \"Sway in the Morning\" radio show on [[Shade 45]], Lanez had taken a shot at Drake, alluding to the infamous freestyle he had performed on [[Hot 97]] six years prior where he had read lyrics from his [[BlackBerry]]. In October 2015, Lanez created additional tension with the rapper when he expressed his dislike of the use of \"the 6\", a nickname for Toronto, and one that had, of course, been popularized by Drake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapdose.com/2015/10/12/tory-lanez-disses-drake-says-its-not-cool-to-call-toronto-the-6/|title=Tory Lanez Disses Drake, Says It's Not Cool To Call Toronto \"The 6\"|website=Rapdose.com|access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the lyrics of his 2016 single \"[[Summer Sixteen]]\", Drake appears to make a subliminal diss at Lanez, rapping: \"All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little.\" Many took this, and the ensuing lines, to be something off a shot taken towards Tory Lanez. Drake also took aim at [[Meek Mill]] who, in the midst of their ongoing feud, called out Drake for dissing Lanez on the song, \"[[War Pain]]\": \"Tory from the 6, you hatin\u2019 on him, Lord knows!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/drake-goes-after-meek-mill-barack-obama-and-tory-lanez-on-summer-sixteen-news.19888.html|title=Drake Goes After Meek Mill, Barack Obama & Tory Lanez On \"Summer Sixteen\"|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> In an interview with [[Revolt (TV network)|Revolt]], Tory was asked about the perceived shot. He was skeptical about whether it was aimed at him at all, he assured the press that he wouldn't be responding even if it was. \"Drake could diss me 20,000 times, and I\u2019d never diss him.

Many people thought Tory was taking shots at Drake. Tory disses Drake again in the song, \"Line Up the Flex\" with ASAP Ferg.

The tweet meant that Jacquees is in a fierce competition with every [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] artist in the game, except for [[Chris Brown]], who he says is his idol. The tweet wasn't convincing to Lanez, who responded to Jacquees with two choice emojis. Jacquees took Lanez' emoji response as an assault, and he went on to call Lanez a \"peasant\" and \"watermelon head ass\". Jacquees did, however, take the time to compliment Lanez' penmanship, though he implied that Lanez' vocal talents are not up to par with his own.

In 1923, he became of full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences<ref name=\":1\" />. In 1926, he affiliated with the [[American Society for Microbiology|Society of American Bacteriologists]]<ref name=\":0\" /> and the Lombardic Academical Society. Omelianski was one of the most gifted chessplayers in town around 1900<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n== Personal life ==\nOmelianski was married and had a doughter, Maria Vasilevna Stepanova (1901-1946, an [[Ethnography|ethnographer]])<ref name=\":1\" />. During [[World War I]], the [[Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War]], Omelianski was able to stay in Saint Petersburg, while Winogradsky (as a rich landowner) had to escape. Possibly, he was saved by his poor bourgeois ancestry and his popular commitment by publishing Russian text books and journals and lecturing in a women\u2019s college. In springtime 1927, Omelianski travelled to the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris to visit his mentor Winogradsky. There he suffered a first [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Omelianski had a second heart attack in December 1927 but could recover<ref name=\":1\" />. During a vacation in [[Gagra]] ([[Abkhazia]]) he died on April 21, 1928<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n== Impact on methanogenesis research ==\nOmelianski published only once in English on \u201caroma-producing microorganisms\u201d in the American [[Journal of Bacteriology]] in 1923<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Omelianski|first=V.

Barker had used the methodological approach of the \"Delft school of  microbiology\"<ref name=\":2\" /> developed by Barkers mentors [[Albert Kluyver]] and [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]]. In 1967, the renamed ''Methanobacterium omelianskii'' was specified as a co-culture of the ethanol-oxidizing ''S''-organism and a [[methanogen]], which uses hydrogen produced by its [[Bacteria|bacterial]] partner to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] to [[methane]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=M.

Certainly, Omelianski was one of the founding fathers of [[methanogenesis]] research and the first scientist investigating methanogenic [[fermentation]] of [[cellulose]] and [[ethanol]] systematically. He even discovered hydrogen as a product of cellulose fermentation around 1900 but, of course, did not discover the concept of syntrophic electron transfer<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n== Further Reading ==\n\n*Ackert Jr., L.

The last textbook he could finish in 1927 was \u201cShort course in general and soil microbiology\u201d (''\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438'')<ref name=\":1\" />. \n\nIn 1916, Omelianski became a corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and he was appointed to ''Doctor botanicus h. c.'' without examination in 1917. In 1923, he became of full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences<ref name=\":1\" />. In 1926, he affiliated with the [[American Society for Microbiology|Society of American Bacteriologists]]<ref name=\":0\" /> and the Lombardic Academical Society. Omelianski was one of the most gifted chessplayers in town around 1900<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n== Personal life ==\nOmelianski was married and had a doughter, Maria Vasilevna Stepanova (1901-1946, an [[Ethnography|ethnographer]])<ref name=\":1\" />. During [[World War I]], the [[Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War]], Omelianski was able to stay in Saint Petersburg, while Winogradsky (as a rich landowner) had to escape. Possibly, he was saved by his poor bourgeois ancestry and his popular commitment by publishing Russian text books and journals and lecturing in a women\u2019s college. In springtime 1927, Omelianski travelled to the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris to visit his mentor Winogradsky. There he suffered a first [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Omelianski had a second heart attack in December 1927 but could recover<ref name=\":1\" />. During a vacation in [[Gagra]] ([[Abkhazia]]) he died on April 21, 1928<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n== Impact on methanogenesis research ==\nOmelianski published only once in English on \u201caroma-producing microorganisms\u201d in the American [[Journal of Bacteriology]] in 1923<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Omelianski|first=V. L.|date=1923|title=Aroma-producing micro\u00f6rganisms|url=https://jb.asm.org/content/8/4/393.long|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=8|issue=4|pages=393\u2013419|doi=10.1128/JB.8.4.393-419.1923|via=}}</ref>. However, today his international reputation is connected to [[Microorganism|microbial]] [[methanogenesis]] in [[Syntrophy|syntrophic]] [[Cell culture|co-cultures]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schink|first=Bernhard|date=1997|title=Energetics of syntrophic cooperation in methanogenic degradation|url=https://mmbr.asm.org/content/61/2/262|journal=Microbiolgy and Molecular Biology Reviews|volume=61|issue=2|pages=262-80|via=}}</ref>. This is based on his French publication of 1916 on \"methane fermentation of ethanol\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Omelianski|first=V. L.|date=1916|title=Fermentation m\u00e9thanique de l'alcool \u00e9thylique|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb34348753q/date1916|journal=Annales de l\u2019Institut Pasteur|volume=30|pages=56-60|via=}}</ref>. Following this research, microbiologist [[Horace Barker]] isolated an [[ethanol]]-degrading microbe called ''Methanobacterium omelianskii''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=H. A.|date=1939-12-01|title=Studies upon the methane fermentation. IV.

Barker had used the methodological approach of the \"Delft school of  microbiology\"<ref name=\":2\" /> developed by Barkers mentors [[Albert Kluyver]] and [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]]. In 1967, the renamed ''Methanobacterium omelianskii'' was specified as a co-culture of the ethanol-oxidizing ''S''-organism and a [[methanogen]], which uses hydrogen produced by its [[Bacteria|bacterial]] partner to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] to [[methane]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=M.

Certainly, Omelianski was one of the founding fathers of [[methanogenesis]] research and the first scientist investigating methanogenic [[fermentation]] of [[cellulose]] and [[ethanol]] systematically. He even discovered hydrogen as a product of cellulose fermentation around 1900 but, of course, did not discover the concept of syntrophic electron transfer<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n== Further Reading ==\n\n*Ackert Jr., L.

It was initially named '''MBC {\ub274\uc6b0\uc2a4 \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c}''' due to the orthography at the time.\n\nIt was renamed to ''MBC News Park'', or \"MBC \ub274\uc2a4\uc758 \u73fe\u5834\" in 1976 ([[hangul]] for \"news on the spot\") then reverting to ''MBC Newsdesk'' in 1980.\n\n=== Musical theme ===\nIts 1980s theme song used one part of [[Fuji TV#News and information|FNN News]]' 1980s theme song and one part of [[Isao Tomita]]'s version of [[The Planets|''The Planets: Jupiter'']].\n\nIn 1991, ''MBC Newsdesk''  introduced a new theme song, composed by Lim Taek-Su. In 1993, the end of the theme was changed, and the teletype sound was replaced with [[Jean-Michel Jarre]]'s \"[[\u00c9quinoxe]] 4.\" This theme was in use from mid-1993 to mid-1997. Starting from mid-1997, the second part of the theme by Lim was played until April 16, 1998, and replaced with the ''MBC News Center'' (1989-1993) and MBC News' ending theme.   \n\nOn December 31, 1999, ''MBC Newsdesk''  adopted a new theme and a new studio. On January 1, 2001 MBC  replaced it with a remix of Lim Taek-Su's first theme. From January 7, 2001, to February 24, 2001, ''MBC Newsdesk'' reused Lim Taek-Su's original 1993 theme. On February 25, 2001, the remixes of the original theme song was released and used until 2014 (the second part was used for ending newscast from 2001-2014, and again from December 26, 2017), which the first remixed had been used until 2012, the second remix had been used until 2014.\n\n=== Studios ===\nOn January 1, 2002, Ohm Kim Young came back on the air (left the main bulletin but remained with MBC after November 8, 1996). On January 3, 2005, MBC changed their logo to an all lowercase logo (MBC lowercase with a red dot inside the b from 2005-2007) and so did the start. Ohm Kim Young left the set in 2008 for MBC president and the news team moved to a different studio from 2008-2013. The news team moved to a more high tech studio in July 2013.

An example was each base or figure represented more than one vehicle.\n\nThe Rules were originally designed for 1/87 or 1/72 scale figures, with a scale of 1 inch for each 100 yards. This changed in Volume 2 Issue 11 to 1 inch for each 50 yards. Each figure represented 9 vehicles, with the scale for infantry and artillery differing. By the last issue the scale had standardized to 4 to 6 vehicles or guns, although the infantry scale was not as clearly defined. The game-turn duration was never stated, but would have ranged from 15 minutes to 60 minutes a game-turn.\n\nThe rules allowed for combined movement and firing, as well as firing in the opposing players game turn. While the implementation of these rules concepts was basic, they represented a revolutionary step forward in micro-armor rules. The firing system consisted of cross referencing the gun and target armor to arrive at a penetration range. If the direct fire was at half this range or less two dice was used, other wise only one dice was used. No firing beyond penetration range was allowed. While not revolutionary the system was elegant and provided a surprising level of detail.

An example was each base or figure represented more than one vehicle.\n\nThe Rules were originally designed for 1/87 or 1/72 scale figures, with a scale of 1 inch for each 100 yards. This changed in Volume 2 Issue 11 to 1 inch for each 50 yards. Each figure represented 9 vehicles, with the scale for infantry and artillery differing. By the last issue the scale had standardized to 4 to 6 vehicles or guns, although the infantry scale was not as clearly defined. The game-turn duration was never stated, but would have ranged from 15 minutes to 60 minutes a game-turn.\n\nThe rules allowed for combined movement and firing, as well as firing in the opposing players game turn. While the implementation of these rules concepts was basic, they represented a revolutionary step forward in micro-armor rules. The firing system consisted of cross referencing the gun and target armor to arrive at a penetration range. If the direct fire was at half this range or less two dice was used, other wise only one dice was used. No firing beyond penetration range was allowed. While not revolutionary the system was elegant and provided a surprising level of detail. Later version introduced a percentage to kill die roll as well.\n\n=== Publication ===\nBy 1975 the rules had developed to the point that McCoy decided to publish them.

Quark pretends to have slain Kozak in self-defense so as to attract more customers with his newfound notoriety. A Klingon named D'Ghor, claiming to be Kozak's brother, accosts Quark in private and extracts the truth, but intimidates Quark into maintaining his lie because an accidental death would embarrass the family.\n\nKozak's widow, Grilka, visits Quark's bar and abducts him. Quark awakens on the Klingon homeworld of [[Qo'noS]], in the home of Kozak's family. Quark sheepishly admits that Kozak's death was an accident. Grilka's advisor explains that Kozak was the head of House Kozak. Kozak left no male heir, leaving the House of Kozak leaderless and defunct. Women are normally forbidden from leading a House, but had Kozak's death been ruled an accident, his wife would have been granted special dispensation to take over the family. Unfortunately, everyone believes that Kozak died in honorable combat. D'Ghor is not actually Kozak's brother: He is from a rival House to which the House of Kozak is heavily in debt. In desperation, Grilka forcibly marries Quark, making him the new head of Kozak's family, which legally prevents D'Ghor from seizing her property.\n\nQuark inspects the family ledgers and discovers that for several years, D'Ghor has been using financial scams to weaken the House of Kozak's assets. This is dishonorable conduct for a Klingon, and Quark exposes D'Ghor's actions before Chancellor Gowron. D'Ghor, in return, reveals Quark's lie regarding the circumstances of Kozak's death. D'Ghor challenges Quark to a duel to the death, and to everyone's astonishment Quark shows up for the fight. Quark throws his weapon to the ground, and denounces the duel as no better than an execution since Quark has no chance of winning. D'Ghor is happy to kill the unarmed Quark anyway, and moves in for the kill. Gowron, disgusted by D'Ghor's conduct, aborts the duel and discommendates D'Ghor on the spot. Gowron, after complimenting Quark for showing exceptional bravery for a Ferengi, rules that there are enough \"unusual circumstances\" to grant Grilka special dispensation to lead her House in her dead husband's stead. Quark asks the grateful Grilka for a divorce, which she happily and immediately grants.\n\nIn this episode's subplot, Keiko O'Brien feels bored and useless since she closed her school due to lack of students. Her husband Miles convinces her to go on a botanical expedition to Bajor.

Quark pretends to have slain Kozak in self-defense so as to attract more customers with his newfound notoriety. A Klingon named D'Ghor, claiming to be Kozak's brother, accosts Quark in private and extracts the truth, but intimidates Quark into maintaining his lie because an accidental death would embarrass the family.\n\nKozak's widow, Grilka, visits Quark's bar and abducts him. Quark awakens on the Klingon homeworld of [[Qo'noS]], in the home of Kozak's family. Quark sheepishly admits that Kozak's death was an accident. Grilka's advisor explains that Kozak was the head of House Kozak. Kozak left no male heir, leaving the House of Kozak leaderless and defunct. Women are normally forbidden from leading a House, but had Kozak's death been ruled an accident, his wife would have been granted special dispensation to take over the family. Unfortunately, everyone believes that Kozak died in honorable combat. D'Ghor is not actually Kozak's brother: He is from a rival House to which the House of Kozak is heavily in debt. In desperation, Grilka forcibly marries Quark, making him the new head of Kozak's family, which legally prevents D'Ghor from seizing her property.\n\nQuark inspects the family ledgers and discovers that for several years, D'Ghor has been using financial scams to weaken the House of Kozak's assets. This is dishonorable conduct for a Klingon, and Quark exposes D'Ghor's actions before Chancellor Gowron. D'Ghor, in return, reveals Quark's lie regarding the circumstances of Kozak's death. D'Ghor challenges Quark to a duel to the death, and to everyone's astonishment Quark shows up for the fight. Quark throws his weapon to the ground, and denounces the duel as no better than an execution since Quark has no chance of winning. D'Ghor is happy to kill the unarmed Quark anyway, and moves in for the kill. Gowron, disgusted by D'Ghor's conduct, aborts the duel and discommendates D'Ghor on the spot. Gowron, after complimenting Quark for showing exceptional bravery for a Ferengi, rules that there are enough \"unusual circumstances\" to grant Grilka special dispensation to lead her House in her dead husband's stead. Quark asks the grateful Grilka for a divorce, which she happily and immediately grants.\n\nIn this episode's subplot, Keiko O'Brien feels bored and useless since she closed her school due to lack of students. Her husband Miles convinces her to go on a botanical expedition to Bajor. She takes their daughter Molly with her, leaving Miles alone on the station.\n\n== Reception ==\nThis episode was noted in ''To Boldly Go: Essays on Gender and Identity in the Star Trek Universe'' for featuring Keiko as a space school teacher aboard the Deep Space Nine space station.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8GQoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT231&dq=best+miles++o'brien+episodes&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiZ25aa3ITjAhWBdt8KHexEBbsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=best%20miles%20%20o'brien%20episodes&f=false|title=To Boldly Go: Essays on Gender and Identity in the Star Trek Universe|last=Farghaly|first=Nadine|last2=Bacon|first2=Simon|date=2017-05-31|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476668536|language=en}}</ref> They note that in \"House of Quark\", she is forced to close the school, and then goes to work on a 6-month expedition to exoplanet Bajor as a botanist.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Tor.com]] called it a \"..good Ferengi episode\" and \"a good Klingon Episode\" as well as having \"intrigue\" and love stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2013/10/25/star-trek-deep-space-nine-rewatch-the-house-of-quark/|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Rewatch: \u201cThe House of Quark\u201d|last=DeCandido|first=Keith R.
