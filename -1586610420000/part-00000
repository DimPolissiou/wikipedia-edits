The latter nasal airflow problem is termed 'nasal emission',<ref name=\"Baken\">R.J. Baken, Robert F. Orlikoff. ''Clinical Measurement of Speech and Voice'' San Diego: Singular, 2000</ref> and acts to prevent the buildup of air pressure and thus prevent the normal production of the consonant.  In testing for resonance effects without the aid of technology, speech pathologists are asked to rate the speech by listening to a recorded sentence or paragraph, though there is much variability in such subjective ratings, for at least two reasons. First, the acoustic effect of a given velopharyngeal opening varies greatly depending on the degree of occlusion of the nasal passageways.  (This is the reason why a stuffy nose from an allergy or cold will sound more nasal than when the nose is clear.)  Secondly, for many persons with hypernasal speech, especially hearing impaired, there are also mispronunciations of the articulation of the vowels.  It is extremely difficult to separate the acoustic effects of hypernasality from the acoustic effects of mispronounced vowels ([http://www.ntid.rit.edu/speechlang/slpros/characteristics/training9.php examples]).  Of course, in speech training of the hearing impaired, there is little possibility of making nasality judgments aurally, and holding a finger to the side of the nose, to feel voice frequency vibration, is sometimes recommended.<ref name=\"multiple1\" />\n\n== Treatment ==\n\n=== Speech therapy ===\nIn cases of muscle weakness or cleft palate, special exercises can help to strengthen the soft palate muscles with the ultimate aim of decreasing airflow through the nose and thereby increasing intelligibility. Intelligibility requires the ability to close the nasal cavity, as all English sounds, except the [[Nasal consonant|nasal sound]]s \"m\" [{{IPAlink|m}}], \"n\" [{{IPAlink|n}}], and \"ng\" [{{IPAlink|\u014b}}], have airflow only through the mouth. Normally, by age three, a child can raise the muscles of the soft palate to close to nasal cavity.\n\nWithout the use of a technological aid, nasal emission is sometimes judged by listening for any turbulence that may be produced by the nasal airflow, as when there is a small velopharyngeal opening and there is some degree of mucous in the opening.  More directly, methods recommended include looking for the fogging of a mirror held near the nares or listening through a tube, the other end of which is held in or near a nares opening.<ref name=\"multiple1\">Kummer, A. W. [http://www.asha.org/about/publications/leader-online/archives/2006/060207/060207c.htm Resonance disorders and nasal emission: Evaluation and treatment using \"low tech\" and \"no tech\" procedures.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118233907/http://asha.org/about/publications/leader-online/archives/2006/060207/060207c.htm |date=2009-01-18 }} The ASHA Leader (2006 Feb 7) 11(2), pp. 4, 26.</ref>\n\nThere have been many attempts to use technological augmentation more than a mirror or tube to aid the speech pathologist or provide meaningful feedback to the person attempting to correct their hypernasality.  Among the more successful of these attempts, the incompleteness of velopharyngeal closure during vowels and sonorants that causes nasal resonance can be estimated and displayed for evaluation or biofeedback in speech training through the nasalance of the voice, with nasalance defined as a ratio of acoustic energy at the nostrils to that at the mouth, with some form of acoustic separation present between the mouth and nose.  In the [http://www.wevosys.com/products/lingwaves/lingwaves_nasality.html nasalance measurement system] sold by WEVOSYS, the acoustic separation is provided by a mask-tube system, [http://www.kayelemetrics.com/Product%20Info/6450/6450.htm nasalance measurement system] sold by [[Pentax|Kay-Pentax]], the acoustic separation is provided by a solid flat partition held against the upper lip, while in the system sold by [https://web.archive.org/web/20081205010711/http://www.glottal.com/Products/NVS.htm Glottal Enterprises] the acoustic separation can be by either a solid flat partition or a two-chamber mask.<ref name=\"Baken\" /><ref>{{cite journal | author = Watterson T, Lewis K, Brancamp T | date = Sep 2005 | title = Comparison of Nasalance scores obtained with the Nasometer 6200 and the Nasometer II 6400 | url = | journal = Cleft Palate Craniofac J. | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 574\u20139 | pmid = 16149843 | doi = 10.1597/04-017.1 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, devices for measuring nasalance do not measure nasal emission during pressure consonants.  Because of this, a means for measuring the degree of velopharyngeal closure in consonants is also needed.  A commercially available device for making such measurements is the [http://www.microtronics-nc.com/Perci-sar.htm Perci-Sar] system from Microtronics. The Nasality Visualization System from Glottal Enterprises allows both the measurement of Nasal Emission and Nasalance. In the presence of a [[Cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], either of these systems can be helpful in evaluating the need for an appliance or surgical intervention to close the cleft or the success of an appliance or a surgical attempt to close the cleft.\n\n==== Exercises ====\nIf a child finds it difficult to blow, pinching the nose can help regulate airflow. The child should then practice speech sounds without pinching the nose.\nThese exercises only work as treatments if hypernasality is small. Severe deviations should be treated surgically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schisis.nl/nvsca/pag.php?id=paK&item=spraak|title=Spraak en taal|language=Dutch|trans-title=Speech and Language|publisher=Nederlandse Vereniging voor Schisis en Craniofaciale Afwijkingen}}</ref>\n\n==== CPAP ====\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of traditional non-speech oral motor exercises can reduce hypernasality. Velopharyngeal closure patterns and their underlying neuromotor control may differ for speech and nonspeech activities. Therefore, the increase in velar movement through blowing, sucking, and swallowing may not transfer to speech tasks. Thus, hypernasality remains while individual speak. Kuehn proposed a new way of treatment by using a CPAP machine during speech tasks. The positive pressure provided by a CPAP machine provides resistance to strengthen velopharyngeal muscles. With nasal mask in place, an individual is asked to produce VNCV syllables and short sentences. It is believed that CPAP therapy can increase both muscle endurance as well as strength because it overloads the levator veli palatini muscle and involves a regimen with a large number of repetitions of velar elevation. Research findings proved that patients with hypernasality due to flaccid [[dysarthria]], TBI or cleft palate do eliminate hypernasality after receiving this training program.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.asel.udel.edu/icslp/cdrom/vol2/422/a422.pdf |last=Kuehn D.

The surgeon cuts through the upper layers of the back of the throat, creating a small square of tissue. This flap remains attached on one side (usually at the top). The other side is attached to (parts of) the soft palate. This ensures that the nasal cavity is partially separated from the oral cavity. When the child speaks, the remaining openings close from the side due to the narrowing of the throat caused by the muscle movements necessary for speech. In a relaxed state, the openings allow breathing through the nose.<ref name=lianne />\n\n====Sphincter pharyngoplasty====\nSphincter pharyngoplasty is mostly used for horizontal clefts of the soft palate. Two small flaps are made on the left and right side of the entrance to the nasal cavity, attached to the back of the throat. For good results, the patient must have good palatal motion, as the [[occlusive|occlusion]] of the nasal cavity is mainly carried out by muscles already existing and functioning.<ref name=lianne />\n\n==== Complications ====\nThe most common complications of the posterior pharyngeal wall flap are [[hyponasality]], nasal obstruction, [[snoring]], and [[sleep apnea]]. Rarer complications include flap separation, [[sinusitis]], postoperative bleeding, and aspiration [[pneumonia]]. Possible complications of the sphincter pharyngoplasty are snoring, nasal obstruction, difficulty blowing the nose.\n\nSome researches suggest that sphincter pharyngoplasty introduces less hyponasality and obstructive sleep symptoms than the posterior pharyngeal wall flap. Both surgeries have a favourable effect on the function of the Eustachian tube.<ref name=emedicine />\n<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sloan|first=GM|title=Posterior pharyngeal flap and sphincter pharyngoplasty: the state of the art.|journal=The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal|date=February 2000|volume=37|issue=2|pages=112\u201322|pmid=10749049|doi=10.1597/1545-1569(2000)037<0112:PPFASP>2.3.CO;2}}</ref><ref name=lianne /><ref>{{cite journal|first1=P.H.M. |last1=Spawen |first2=A.J.C. |last2=Huffstadt |first3=H.K. |last3=Schutte |first4=R.J. |last4=Ritsma |title=De invloed van chirurgische behandeling van open neusspraak op horen en spreken |language=Dutch |journal=Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde [Netherlands Journal of Medicine] |url=http://www.ntvg.nl/publicatie/de-invloed-van-chirurgische-behandeling-van-open-neusspraak-op-horen-en-spreken/volledig/print |year=1987 |volume=131 |pages=161\u20136 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222210521/http://www.ntvg.nl/publicatie/de-invloed-van-chirurgische-behandeling-van-open-neusspraak-op-horen-en-spreken/volledig/print |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rhinolalia clausa]]\n*[[Nasalization]]\n*[[Nasalance]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     =  \n|  ICD10          = R49.21 \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|784.43}} \n|  MeshID         = D014833\n}}\n\n[[Category:Speech impediments]]\n[[Category:Nasalization]]\n[[Category:Phonetics]]\n[[Category:Human voice]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Hypernasality\n| synonyms        = Hyperrhinolalia, open nasality, rhinolalia aperta\n| image           =  \n| caption         = \n| pronounce       = \n| field           =  \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n\n'''Hypernasal speech''' is a disorder that causes abnormal [[resonance]] in a human's voice due to increased [[airflow]] through the nose during speech.

The latter nasal airflow problem is termed 'nasal emission',<ref name=\"Baken\">R.J. Baken, Robert F. Orlikoff. ''Clinical Measurement of Speech and Voice'' San Diego: Singular, 2000</ref> and acts to prevent the buildup of air pressure and thus prevent the normal production of the consonant.  In testing for resonance effects without the aid of technology, speech pathologists are asked to rate the speech by listening to a recorded sentence or paragraph, though there is much variability in such subjective ratings, for at least two reasons. First, the acoustic effect of a given velopharyngeal opening varies greatly depending on the degree of occlusion of the nasal passageways.  (This is the reason why a stuffy nose from an allergy or cold will sound more nasal than when the nose is clear.)  Secondly, for many persons with hypernasal speech, especially hearing impaired, there are also mispronunciations of the articulation of the vowels.  It is extremely difficult to separate the acoustic effects of hypernasality from the acoustic effects of mispronounced vowels ([http://www.ntid.rit.edu/speechlang/slpros/characteristics/training9.php examples]).  Of course, in speech training of the hearing impaired, there is little possibility of making nasality judgments aurally, and holding a finger to the side of the nose, to feel voice frequency vibration, is sometimes recommended.<ref name=\"multiple1\" />\n\n== Treatment ==\n\n=== Speech therapy ===\nIn cases of muscle weakness or cleft palate, special exercises can help to strengthen the soft palate muscles with the ultimate aim of decreasing airflow through the nose and thereby increasing intelligibility. Intelligibility requires the ability to close the nasal cavity, as all English sounds, except the [[Nasal consonant|nasal sound]]s \"m\" [{{IPAlink|m}}], \"n\" [{{IPAlink|n}}], and \"ng\" [{{IPAlink|\u014b}}], have airflow only through the mouth. Normally, by age three, a child can raise the muscles of the soft palate to close to nasal cavity.\n\nWithout the use of a technological aid, nasal emission is sometimes judged by listening for any turbulence that may be produced by the nasal airflow, as when there is a small velopharyngeal opening and there is some degree of mucous in the opening.  More directly, methods recommended include looking for the fogging of a mirror held near the nares or listening through a tube, the other end of which is held in or near a nares opening.<ref name=\"multiple1\">Kummer, A. W. [http://www.asha.org/about/publications/leader-online/archives/2006/060207/060207c.htm Resonance disorders and nasal emission: Evaluation and treatment using \"low tech\" and \"no tech\" procedures.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118233907/http://asha.org/about/publications/leader-online/archives/2006/060207/060207c.htm |date=2009-01-18 }} The ASHA Leader (2006 Feb 7) 11(2), pp. 4, 26.</ref>\n\nThere have been many attempts to use technological augmentation more than a mirror or tube to aid the speech pathologist or provide meaningful feedback to the person attempting to correct their hypernasality.  Among the more successful of these attempts, the incompleteness of velopharyngeal closure during vowels and sonorants that causes nasal resonance can be estimated and displayed for evaluation or biofeedback in speech training through the nasalance of the voice, with nasalance defined as a ratio of acoustic energy at the nostrils to that at the mouth, with some form of acoustic separation present between the mouth and nose.  In the [http://www.wevosys.com/products/lingwaves/lingwaves_nasality.html nasalance measurement system] sold by WEVOSYS, the acoustic separation is provided by a mask-tube system, [http://www.kayelemetrics.com/Product%20Info/6450/6450.htm nasalance measurement system] sold by [[Pentax|Kay-Pentax]], the acoustic separation is provided by a solid flat partition held against the upper lip, while in the system sold by [https://web.archive.org/web/20081205010711/http://www.glottal.com/Products/NVS.htm Glottal Enterprises] the acoustic separation can be by either a solid flat partition or a two-chamber mask.<ref name=\"Baken\" /><ref>Watterson T, Lewis K, Brancamp T. \"Comparison of Nasalance scores obtained with the Nasometer 6200 and the Nasometer II 6400.\" Cleft Palate Craniofac J. 2005 Sep;42(5):574-9 {{PMID|16149843}}</ref>\n\nHowever, devices for measuring nasalance do not measure nasal emission during pressure consonants.  Because of this, a means for measuring the degree of velopharyngeal closure in consonants is also needed.  A commercially available device for making such measurements is the [http://www.microtronics-nc.com/Perci-sar.htm Perci-Sar] system from Microtronics. The Nasality Visualization System from Glottal Enterprises allows both the measurement of Nasal Emission and Nasalance. In the presence of a [[Cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], either of these systems can be helpful in evaluating the need for an appliance or surgical intervention to close the cleft or the success of an appliance or a surgical attempt to close the cleft.\n\n==== Exercises ====\nIf a child finds it difficult to blow, pinching the nose can help regulate airflow. The child should then practice speech sounds without pinching the nose.\nThese exercises only work as treatments if hypernasality is small. Severe deviations should be treated surgically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schisis.nl/nvsca/pag.php?id=paK&item=spraak|title=Spraak en taal|language=Dutch|trans-title=Speech and Language|publisher=Nederlandse Vereniging voor Schisis en Craniofaciale Afwijkingen}}</ref>\n\n==== CPAP ====\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of traditional non-speech oral motor exercises can reduce hypernasality. Velopharyngeal closure patterns and their underlying neuromotor control may differ for speech and nonspeech activities. Therefore, the increase in velar movement through blowing, sucking, and swallowing may not transfer to speech tasks. Thus, hypernasality remains while individual speak. Kuehn proposed a new way of treatment by using a CPAP machine during speech tasks. The positive pressure provided by a CPAP machine provides resistance to strengthen velopharyngeal muscles. With nasal mask in place, an individual is asked to produce VNCV syllables and short sentences. It is believed that CPAP therapy can increase both muscle endurance as well as strength because it overloads the levator veli palatini muscle and involves a regimen with a large number of repetitions of velar elevation. Research findings proved that patients with hypernasality due to flaccid [[dysarthria]], TBI or cleft palate do eliminate hypernasality after receiving this training program.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.asel.udel.edu/icslp/cdrom/vol2/422/a422.pdf |last=Kuehn D.

The surgeon cuts through the upper layers of the back of the throat, creating a small square of tissue. This flap remains attached on one side (usually at the top). The other side is attached to (parts of) the soft palate. This ensures that the nasal cavity is partially separated from the oral cavity. When the child speaks, the remaining openings close from the side due to the narrowing of the throat caused by the muscle movements necessary for speech. In a relaxed state, the openings allow breathing through the nose.<ref name=lianne />\n\n====Sphincter pharyngoplasty====\nSphincter pharyngoplasty is mostly used for horizontal clefts of the soft palate. Two small flaps are made on the left and right side of the entrance to the nasal cavity, attached to the back of the throat. For good results, the patient must have good palatal motion, as the [[occlusive|occlusion]] of the nasal cavity is mainly carried out by muscles already existing and functioning.<ref name=lianne />\n\n==== Complications ====\nThe most common complications of the posterior pharyngeal wall flap are [[hyponasality]], nasal obstruction, [[snoring]], and [[sleep apnea]]. Rarer complications include flap separation, [[sinusitis]], postoperative bleeding, and aspiration [[pneumonia]]. Possible complications of the sphincter pharyngoplasty are snoring, nasal obstruction, difficulty blowing the nose.\n\nSome researches suggest that sphincter pharyngoplasty introduces less hyponasality and obstructive sleep symptoms than the posterior pharyngeal wall flap. Both surgeries have a favourable effect on the function of the Eustachian tube.<ref name=emedicine />\n<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sloan|first=GM|title=Posterior pharyngeal flap and sphincter pharyngoplasty: the state of the art.|journal=The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal|date=February 2000|volume=37|issue=2|pages=112\u201322|pmid=10749049|doi=10.1597/1545-1569(2000)037<0112:PPFASP>2.3.CO;2}}</ref><ref name=lianne /><ref>{{cite journal|first1=P.H.M. |last1=Spawen |first2=A.J.C. |last2=Huffstadt |first3=H.K. |last3=Schutte |first4=R.J. |last4=Ritsma |title=De invloed van chirurgische behandeling van open neusspraak op horen en spreken |language=Dutch |journal=Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde [Netherlands Journal of Medicine] |url=http://www.ntvg.nl/publicatie/de-invloed-van-chirurgische-behandeling-van-open-neusspraak-op-horen-en-spreken/volledig/print |year=1987 |volume=131 |pages=161\u20136 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222210521/http://www.ntvg.nl/publicatie/de-invloed-van-chirurgische-behandeling-van-open-neusspraak-op-horen-en-spreken/volledig/print |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rhinolalia clausa]]\n*[[Nasalization]]\n*[[Nasalance]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     =  \n|  ICD10          = R49.21 \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|784.43}} \n|  MeshID         = D014833\n}}\n[[Category:Speech impediments]]\n[[Category:Nasalization]]\n[[Category:Phonetics]]\n[[Category:Human voice]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypernasal_speech"}

The Parliament continued until [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolution]] in late 1844. \n\nThe [[Parliament of the Province of Canada|Parliament of the Province]] had two chambers: the elected lower house, the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Legislative Assembly]], and the appointed upper house, the [[Legislative Council of the Province of Canada|Legislative Council]]. The first general election for the Legislative Assembly was held in April, 1841.  [[Canada East]] (formerly Lower Canada) and [[Canada West]] (formerly Upper Canada)) each had forty-two seats in the Legislative Assembly.  The members of the Legislative Council, twenty-four in number, were appointed by the British [[List_of_governors_general_of_Canada#Governors-in-Chief/Governors_General_of_the_Canadas,_1786\u20131841|Governor General]], [[Lord Sydenham]].\n\nAll sessions were held at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], Canada West, with the first session of the Parliament called on June 1841. The Parliament had three annual sessions, but then was [[Prorogation|prorogued]] for close to a year due to a political crisis in the relations between the Legislative Assembly and the Governor General.  The Parliament was dissolved in September, 1844, triggering the second general election for the Province.\n\nIn 1841, the [[District Councils Act (1841)|District Councils Act]] was passed which established a system of local government in Canada West based on district councils.

There was no single election date.  The returning officer in each electoral district chose the date for the election in their district.\n\nThe Governor General, following the policy of assimilation set out in [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|''Lord Durham's Report'']], drew boundaries and chose the location of polling stations in Canada East in anglophone areas, in an effort to favour voters of British stock and to make it more difficult for francophone voters to exercise their franchise.<ref name = CBC-1841>[https://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP7CH5PA3LE.html CBC:  ''1841 - The First Election after the Act of Union''.]</ref>\n\nThere was electoral violence during the elections.

The Parliament continued until [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolution]] in late 1844. \n\nThe [[Parliament of the Province of Canada|Parliament of the Province]] had two chambers: the elected lower house, the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Legislative Assembly]], and the appointed upper house, the [[Legislative Council of the Province of Canada|Legislative Council]]. The first general election for the Legislative Assembly was held in April, 1841.  [[Canada East]] (formerly Lower Canada) and [[Canada West]] (formerly Upper Canada)) each had forty-two seats in the Legislative Assembly.  The members of the Legislative Council, twenty-four in number, were appointed by the British [[List_of_governors_general_of_Canada#Governors-in-Chief/Governors_General_of_the_Canadas,_1786\u20131841|Governor General]], [[Lord Sydenham]].\n\nAll sessions were held at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], Canada West, with the first session of the Parliament called on June 1841. The Parliament had three annual sessions, but then was [[Prorogation|prorogued]] for close to a year due to a political crisis in the relations between the Legislative Assembly and the Governor General.  The Parliament was dissolved in September, 1844, triggering the second general election for the Province.\n\nIn 1841, the [[District Councils Act (1841)|District Councils Act]] was passed which established a system of local government in Canada West based on district councils. Prior to 1841, local affairs were dealt with by the District Court of Quarter Sessions.\n\n== First government and election ==\n\nThe Governor General, Lord Sydenham, appointed the first members to the [[Executive Council of the Province of Canada|Executive Council]] on February 13, 1841.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/politicalappoint00cotj_0/page/12 J.O. C\u00f4t\u00e9, ''Political Appointments and Elections in the Province of Canada, 1841 to 1860'' (Quebec:  St. Michel and Darveau, 1860), p. 12.]</ref>  All of the members were anglophones, with no francophones.  They were appointed as advisors to the Governor General, who continued to exercise the executive powers of the government.\n\nThe first general election for the new Legislative Assembly was held in the spring of 1841.  There was no single election date.  The returning officer in each electoral district chose the date for the election in their district.\n\nThe Governor General, following the policy of assimilation set out in [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|''Lord Durham's Report'']], drew boundaries and chose the location of polling stations in Canada East in anglophone areas, in an effort to favour voters of British stock and to make it more difficult for francophone voters to exercise their franchise.<ref name = CBC-1841>[https://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP7CH5PA3LE.html CBC:  ''1841 - The First Election after the Act of Union''.]</ref>\n\nThere was electoral violence during the elections.  In one case, the threat of riots at the polling station forced [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine]], a proponent of [[responsible government]], to withdraw his candidacy from the riding of Terrebonne in Canada East.  In response, [[Robert Baldwin]] in Canada West, also a supporter of responsible government, proposed to his father, [[William Warren Baldwin]], that they should assist Lafontaine's election.  Baldwin senior was a candidate for a riding in the Toronto area.  He withdrew his nomination to allow Lafontaine to stand for election.  Lafontaine was elected.<ref name = CBC-1841/>  This was the beginning of the Lafontaine-Baldwin alliance which ultimately led to responsible government in the Province of Canada.<ref>[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/the-friendship-that-brought-responsible-government-feature James H. Marsh, \"Editorial: Baldwin, LaFontaine and Responsible Government\", ''Canadian Encyclopedia'', January 24, 2012.]</ref>\n\nCandidates at this time would be loosely affiliated in early political parties, but party structure was not strong, and there were different party groups in Canada East and Canada West.  The election resulted in a Legislative Assembly with no single party group with a majority.\n\n== Legislative Assembly ==\n\n=== Canada East ===\n==== Members elected in the general election ====\nThe following members were elected to the Legislative Assembly from Canada East in the 1841 general election.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/politicalappoint00cotj_0/page/42 C\u00f4t\u00e9, ''Political Appointments and Elections'', pp. 43-45:  \"First Parliament.  8th April 1841 to 23rd September 1844\".]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Riding\n!Member\n!Party<ref name= party-affil>For party affiliation, see biographies of individual members: [http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/membres/notices/index.html Qu\u00e9bec Dictionary of Parliamentary Biography, from 1764 to the present].</ref> \n|-\n\n| [[Beauharnois (Province of Canada electoral district)|Beauharnois]]\n| [[John William Dunscomb|Dunscomb, John William]]{{refn|group=note|name=first|Resigned on October 8, 1842, following  appointment as Warden, Trinity House, Montreal, on July 15, 1842.<ref>[http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/deputes/dunscomb-john-william-3055/biographie.html National Assembly of Quebec:  John William Dunscomb.]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/politicalappoint00cotj_0/page/58 C\u00f4t\u00e9, ''Political Appointments and Elections'', p. 59, note (1).]</ref>}}\n| [[Ch\u00e2teau Clique|Tory]]\n|-\n\n| [[Bellechasse (Province of Canada electoral district)|Bellechasse]]\n| [[Augustin-Guillaume Ruel|Ruel, Augustin-Guillaume]]{{refn|group=note|name=second|Resigned on being appointed Registrar of the Rimouski district, January 1, 1842.<ref>[http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/deputes/ruel-augustin-guillaume-5227/biographie.html National Assembly of Quebec:  Augustin-Guillaume Ruel.]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/politicalappoint00cotj_0/page/58 C\u00f4t\u00e9, ''Political Appointments and Elections'', p. 59, note (3).]</ref>}}\n| Anti-unionist\n|-\n\n| [[Berthier (Province of Canada electoral district)|Berthier]]\n| [[David Morrison Armstrong|Armstrong, David Morrison]]\n| [[Parti canadien|Groupe Canadien-fran\u00e7ais]];

Attempting to compete with established Canadian brands like [[Woolco]] and [[Zeller's]] during a downturn in the market, it was T. Eaton's attempt to court \"buyers\", as opposed to \"shoppers\" at its Eaton's stores. Instead, the chain was generally unprofitable, cannibalizing sales from its sister stores, and misplaced, according to analysts. Intended to be a 122-store chain, it only reached 18 locations. The financial drag of the chain in the 1970s is said to have contributed to T. Eaton's significant financial problems in the 1980s.\n\n==History==\n\nIn ''The Globe and Mail'', T. Eaton Co. Ltd. President Robert Butler observed that consumers could be classified as shoppers and buyers. \"Your wife goes out to buy the groceries or a pair of hose or kiddies' underwear, but she goes out to shop for furniture, for interesting gifts, expensive dresses.\"<ref name=\"1972-07-19-GM\">{{cite news |last1=Picton |first1=John |title=Malls and shopping plazas main attractions as major retailers scramble for new sites |work=The Globe and Mail |date=19 July 1972 |location=Toronto ON |page=B5}}</ref> This insight guided both changes to their main line of stores, but also the creation of Horizon, a discount chain that the company referred to as \"convenience stores.\" It was focused on the \"buyer\" section of the market.<ref name=\"1972-07-19-GM\" />\n\nStores were to be roughly 60,000 square feet, and either located in neighbourhood malls \"or smaller communities often close to a grocery supermarket.\"<ref name=\"1972-07-19-GM\" /> The \"'fast-moving' lines of merchandise\" included clothing, \"housewares and notions, sporting goods, small and large appliances and seasonal merchandise.\"<ref name=\"1972-05-25-GM\">{{cite news |last1=Picton |first1=John |title=Eaton's to open a discount chain, 10 stores |work=The Globe and Mail |date=25 May 1972 |location=Toronto ON |page=B1}}</ref> Horizon locations would have centralized check-out counters, versus the in-department desks of the main Eaton's stores.<ref name=\"1978-10-05-TS\">{{cite news |title=Horizon gets the axe |work=The Toronto Star |date=5 October 1978 |location=Toronto ON |page=B12}}</ref>\n\nThe name Horizon \"reflects a forward-looking, contemporary life style\u2014the image these stores will project.\"<ref name=\"1972-05-25-GM\" /> This extended to the store's use of a [[barcode reader]] at checkout, which received media attention;<ref>{{cite web |last1=Geo |first1=Mario |title=Newest in cash registers is checked by John Craig Eaton, left, at opening of new T.

Attempting to compete with established Canadian brands like [[Woolco]] and [[Zeller's]] during a downturn in the market, it was T. Eaton's attempt to court \"buyers\", as opposed to \"shoppers\" at its Eaton's stores. Instead, the chain was generally unprofitable, cannibalizing sales from its sister stores, and misplaced, according to analysts. Intended to be a 122-store chain, it only reached 18 locations. The financial drag of the chain in the 1970s is said to have contributed to T. Eaton's significant financial problems in the 1980s.\n\n==History==\n\nIn ''The Globe and Mail'', T. Eaton Co. Ltd.

[[Nottingham]]'''.\n\n==Pre-history==\nThe middle Trent Valley was covered by ice sheets for large parts of the [[Paleolithic]] period between 500,000 and 10,000 years ago, and evidence of [[early human]] activity is limited to a small number of discarded stone artefacts found in glacial outwash or boulder clays.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=11}} The [[post-glacial]] warming of the climate in the [[Mesolithic]] period between 10,000BC and 4,000BC saw the Trent Valley colonised by [[hunter-gatherers]] taking advantage of the emerging mixed woodland environment.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=13}} Flintwork dating from the period has been excavated on the site of [[Nottingham Castle]], and stone tools used by hunter-gatherers have been found in areas of the city including [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[Wollaton Park]] and the site of the [[Victoria Centre]].{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|p=1}} The [[Neolithic]] period between 4,000BC and 2,000BC saw the clearance of woodland and the transition of the area towards a settled [[agriculture|agricultural]] society.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=14}} Pottery from the period has been found in [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]] and [[Holme Pierrepont]],{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|p=1}} and neolithic stone axes have been found in the city manufactured as far away as [[Great Langdale]] in the [[Lake District]] and [[Penmaenmawr]] in [[North Wales]].{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=14}} Holme Pierrepont is also the site of the area's most impressive stone age monument: an early neolithic burial monument consisting of several intercutting concentric ditches surrounding a central mound containing five shallow pits.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|pp=14-15}}\n\nAbundant evidence exists of [[bronze age]] habitation in the area, including tools and weapons found in the [[River Trent]] and other local rivers,{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|p=1}} a flat [[axe]] found in [[Edwalton]] and a looped [[palstave]] found in [[Bestwood]].{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=16}} A large hoard of bronze age metalwork was discovered during building works in Great Freeman Street in 1860,{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|p=1}} dating from the late 9th or 8th centuries BC and consisting of ten socketed axes, four bronze arrowheads, a palstave, a hollow ring and the base of a spear shaft.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=16}} A possible bronze age dwelling has been discovered in [[Clifton, Nottingham|Clifton]], including a series of oak stakes spaced about a yard apart in the river bed of the Trent and a collection of mid and late bronze age metalwork including [[spearheads]], [[rapiers]], [[sword]]s, [[knives]] and a [[dirk]].{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|pp=16-17}} Similar though less well preserved sites have been discovered in Attenborough and Holme Pierrepont.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=17}} [[Cropmarks]] indicating the [[ring ditches]] of bronze age burial sites are densely distributed across the gravel terraces around the Trent in the south of the city.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=17}} Excavation of these sites have revealed evidence of [[cremation]]s and traces of bronze age pottery, including [[urn]]s.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=17}}\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] between 700BC and AD43 saw a significant increase in the density of settlement in the area, with evidence of a large number of farming settlements encompassing both arable and pastoral agriculture, each probably occupied by a single family group.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=18}} Iron Age pottery has been found at a wide variety of sites within the city centre, including the north bailey of the Castle, Low Pavement, Fisher Gate, Halifax Place and a shallow ditch between Woolpack Lane and Barker Gate.{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|p=1}} Excavations of settlements at [[Gamston, Rushcliffe|Gamston]] provided evidence of small-scale [[pottery]] and [[textile industry|textile]] industries and extensive trading links, with [[salt]] from [[Cheshire]], pottery from [[Charnwood Forest]] and [[quern]]s from the [[Pennines]].{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=18}} The importance of the Trent as a trade route during the period has been shown by the discovery of three dugout canoes and a spoked wheel dating from the Iron Age in the gravels at Holme Pierrepont.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=19}} Iron Age ditches have been excavated at [[Nottingham Castle]] and at several sites in the [[Lace Market]], suggesting that pre-historic fortifications in these areas are possible.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|pp=18-19}}\n\nNottingham is notable for its lack of evidence of occupation during the [[Roman Britain|Roman era]].{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|pp=19-20}}{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|pp=1-2}} Although the [[Fosse Way]] was one of Britain's major [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman roads]] and passed within six miles to the south of Nottingham, there is no record of any crossing of the Trent or settlement close to the site of the modern city.{{sfn|Barley|Straw|1969|p=1}}\n\nAfter the [[Sub-Roman Britain|Roman departure]] at around 410 AD, independent [[Brython]]ic kingdoms emerged everywhere in Britain.

The Anglo-Saxon settlement developed into the English [[Borough of Nottingham]] and housed a Town Hall and Courts.

The price of coal in Nottingham is halved.\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:Nottingham Map 1831 by Staveley and Wood.jpg|thumb|Nottingham and [[Sneinton]], as they stood in 1831]]\n[[Coal gas]] was introduced in Nottinghamshire by the [[Nottingham Corporation Gas Department#Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company|Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company]] in 1821.\n\nNottingham was the first place in Britain to install high pressure constant supply mains water in 1831. This system was deployed by engineer [[Thomas Hawksley]] and the [[City of Nottingham Water Department#Trent Waterworks Company|Trent Waterworks Company]].\n\nThe [[Midland Counties Railway]] opened the first railway service between Nottingham and Derby on 4 June 1839.\n\nDuring the [[Industrial Revolution]], much of Nottingham's prosperity was founded on the [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile industry]]; in particular, Nottingham was an internationally important centre of [[lace]] manufacture. However, the rapid and poorly planned growth left Nottingham with the reputation of having the worst [[slum]]s in England.  the Government in 1844 appointed a Commission to look into the state of great towns. Thomas Hawkesley, Borough Water Engineer, testified to the Commission that he considered Nottingham to be the worst town in England. Residents of these slums rioted in 1831, in protest against the [[Duke of Newcastle]]'s opposition to the [[Reform Act 1832]], setting fire to his residence, Nottingham Castle. Businesses in other sectors founded in 19th-century Nottingham included the [[Raleigh Bicycle Company]] and [[Boots the Chemist]].\n\nNottingham was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and at that time consisted of the parishes of Nottingham St Mary, Nottingham St Nicholas and Nottingham St Peter. It was expanded in 1877 by adding the parishes of [[Basford, Nottingham|Basford]], Brewhouse Yard, [[Bulwell]], [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]], [[Sneinton]], [[Standard Hill]] and parts of the parishes of [[West Bridgford]], [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]], [[Wilford, Nottinghamshire|Wilford]] ([[North Wilford]]).\n\n[[File:Old and new trent bridges 1871.jpg|thumb|left|Old [[Trent Bridge (bridge)|Trent Bridge]] (left) pictured next to the new in 1871]]The first incinerators for waste disposal were built in [[Nottingham]] by [[Manlove, Alliott & Co.

The Chartered Institution of Wastes Management. 2007.</ref>\n\nThe first horse drawn tramcars are operated by the [[Nottingham and District Tramways Company Limited]] in 1878.\n\nIn 1889 Nottingham became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. City status was awarded as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria, being signified in a letter from the Prime Minister the [[Marquess of Salisbury]] to the Mayor, dated 18 June 1897.\n\nThe [[Great Central Railway]] opened [[Nottingham Victoria railway station]] in 1899.\n\n==20th century==\nElectric trams operated by [[Nottingham Corporation Tramways]] begin on 1 January 1901.\n\n[[Nottingham Council House]] was rebuilt between 1927 and 1929 to designs by [[Thomas Cecil Howitt]].\n\n===World War II===\nThe [[Nottingham Blitz]] was the [[Nazi German]] [[Luftwaffe]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]] on the city of Nottingham on the evenings of 8/9 May 1941 as part of a nationwide campaign to disrupt key industrial production, undermine morale and destroy factories, rail networks and infrastructure. During one air raid alone 140 people had been killed and 4,500 houses had been destroyed. Large areas of Nottingham and West Bridgford had been flattened and [[University of Nottingham|University College Nottingham]] had been damaged.\n\n===Economic decline===\nIn common with the UK textile industry as a whole, Nottingham's textile sector fell into headlong decline in the decades following the [[World War II]], as British manufacturers proved unable to compete on price or volume with output of factories in the Far East and South Asia. Very little textile manufacture now takes place in Nottingham, but the City's heyday in this sector endowed it with some fine industrial buildings in the [[Lace Market]] district. Many of these have been restored and put to new uses.\n\n==Robin Hood==\n[[Image:Robin Hood Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Robin Hood statue in Nottingham]]\n\nThe legend of [[Robin Hood]] first arose in the [[Middle Ages]]. Robin Hood is said to have lived in [[Sherwood Forest]], which extended from the north of Nottingham to the north side of [[Doncaster]], Yorkshire. Although Robin Hood is generally associated with Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, some authors (e.g. Phillips & Keatman, 1995) argue that he came from Yorkshire. Hood's main adversary was the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]. Today the office of [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] is a ceremonial position with no real jurisdiction. Whilst the accuracy of the legend is questionable, particularly the finer points, it has had a major impact on Nottingham, with Robin Hood imagery a popular choice for local businesses and many modern tourist attractions exploiting the legend. The Robin Hood Statue in Nottingham is within walking distance from the [[Old Market Square]].\n\n==Caves of Nottingham==\nThe Nottingham Caves have always formed an important part of the region, at first providing shelter and sanctuary, but growing to house thriving tanning works and in modern times becoming a tourist attraction. The caves are artificial, having been carved out of the soft [[sandstone]] rock by prospective dwellers, and have grown to become a complex network under the city. The oldest date back to 1250.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nottinghamcavessurvey.org.uk/history.htm |title=Nottingham's caves in history |accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref> The city has more manmade caves than anywhere else in the country and this whole cave network has [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] protection equal to that of [[Stonehenge]], making Nottingham Caves a site of vast importance to the [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] of the United Kingdom. Part of the network can be viewed by the [[public]] at the [[City of Caves]] attraction which is accessed from the upper mall of the [[Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]].\n\nBefore the industrial revolution, the cave network was substantially expanded and became home to a large proportion of the poorer populace, particularly those involved in the [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] industry. The majority of the caves were thought to have been used for storage by the 18th century and were still inhabited until around 1924 when the last family (the Shore family) moved out of the caves in Ilkeston road; they came into use again as [[air raid shelter]]s during [[World War II]]. A section of the cave network under the [[Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]] is now open as a tourist attraction, and some parts are still used as pub cellars.\n\nAnother section of the caves, under the castle, is still in regular use as the indoor rifle range of the [[Nottingham Rifle Club]]. In addition, [[Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem Inn]], a pub that claims to be the oldest in Britain, is partly built into the cave system below the castle and still retains access from the beer cellars to the castle through the cave inside castle rock. Although the pub's building only dates from the 16th or 17th century, the caves themselves may date to the 11th century and could have been the site of the brewhouse for the castle.\n\n==Nottingham Castle==\n[[Nottingham Castle]], founded by [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], famed through the [[Middle Ages]] as one of the country's finest strongholds, and where [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] raised the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]] in 1642 no longer exists, and has been replaced by a classical ducal palace. Of the medi\u00e6val castle only the (restored) gatehouse, and the ruined remains of some walls/foundations survive.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Nottingham]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Citation|last1=Barley|first1=M.

500,000 and 10,000 years ago, and evidence of [[early human]] activity is limited to a small number of discarded stone artefacts found in glacial outwash or boulder clays.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=11}} The [[post-glacial]] warming of the climate in the [[Mesolithic]] period between 10,000BC and 4,000BC saw the Trent Valley colonised by [[hunter-gatherers]] taking advantage of the emerging mixed woodland environment.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=13}} Flintwork dating from the period has been excavated on the site of [[Nottingham Castle]], and stone tools used by hunter-gatherers have been found in areas of the city including [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[Wollaton Park]] and the site of the [[Victoria Centre]].{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|p=1}} The [[Neolithic]] period between 4,000BC and 2,000BC saw the clearance of woodland and the transition of the area towards a settled [[agriculture|agricultural]] society.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=14}} Pottery from the period has been found in [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]] and [[Holme Pierrepont]],{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|p=1}} and neolithic stone axes have been found in the city manufactured as far away as [[Great Langdale]] in the [[Lake District]] and [[Penmaenmawr]] in [[North Wales]].{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=14}} Holme Pierrepont is also the site of the area's most impressive stone age monument: an early neolithic burial monument consisting of several intercutting concentric ditches surrounding a central mound containing five shallow pits.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|pp=14-15}}\n\nAbundant evidence exists of [[bronze age]] habitation in the area, including tools and weapons found in the [[River Trent]] and other local rivers,{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|p=1}} a flat [[axe]] found in [[Edwalton]] and a looped [[palstave]] found in [[Bestwood]].{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=16}} A large hoard of bronze age metalwork was discovered during building works in Great Freeman Street in 1860,{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|p=1}} dating from the late 9th or 8th centuries BC and consisting of ten socketed axes, four bronze arrowheads, a palstave, a hollow ring and the base of a spear shaft.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=16}} A possible bronze age dwelling has been discovered in [[Clifton, Nottingham|Clifton]], including a series of oak stakes spaced about a yard apart in the river bed of the Trent and a collection of mid and late bronze age metalwork including [[spearheads]], [[rapiers]], [[sword]]s, [[knives]] and a [[dirk]].{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|pp=16-17}} Similar though less well preserved sites have been discovered in Attenborough and Holme Pierrepont.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=17}} [[Cropmarks]] indicating the [[ring ditches]] of bronze age burial sites are densely distributed across the gravel terraces around the Trent in the south of the city.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=17}} Excavation of these sites have revealed evidence of [[cremation]]s and traces of bronze age pottery, including [[urn]]s.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=17}}\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] between 700BC and AD43 saw a significant increase in the density of settlement in the area, with evidence of a large number of farming settlements encompassing both arable and pastoral agriculture, each probably occupied by a single family group.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=18}} Iron Age pottery has been found at a wide variety of sites within the city centre, including the north bailey of the Castle, Low Pavement, Fisher Gate, Halifax Place and a shallow ditch between Woolpack Lane and Barker Gate.{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|p=1}} Excavations of settlements at [[Gamston, Rushcliffe|Gamston]] provided evidence of small-scale [[pottery]] and [[textile industry|textile]] industries and extensive trading links, with [[salt]] from [[Cheshire]], pottery from [[Charnwood Forest]] and [[quern]]s from the [[Pennines]].{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=18}} The importance of the Trent as a trade route during the period has been shown by the discovery of three dugout canoes and a spoked wheel dating from the Iron Age in the gravels at Holme Pierrepont.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|p=19}} Iron Age ditches have been excavated at [[Nottingham Castle]] and at several sites in the [[Lace Market]], suggesting that pre-historic fortifications in these areas are possible.{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|pp=18-19}}\n\nNottingham is notable for its lack of evidence of occupation during the [[Roman Britain|Roman era]].{{sfn|Dixon|Knight|Firman|1997|pp=19-20}}{{sfn|Gurnham|2010|pp=1-2}} Although the [[Fosse Way]] was one of Britain's major [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman roads]] and passed within six miles to

[[Smith's Bank]] was in Market Square.\n\n==18th century==\nThe [[Trent Navigation Company]] is formed in 1783 to improve navigation on the River Trent from Nottingham to Kingston upon Hull.\n\nThe [[Nottingham Canal]] opens in 1796. The price of coal in Nottingham is halved.\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:Nottingham Map 1831 by Staveley and Wood.jpg|thumb|Nottingham and [[Sneinton]], as they stood in 1831]]\n[[Coal gas]] was introduced in Nottinghamshire by the [[Nottingham Corporation Gas Department#Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company|Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company]] in 1821.\n\nNottingham was the first place in Britain to install high pressure constant supply mains water in 1831. This system was deployed by engineer [[Thomas Hawksley]] and the [[City of Nottingham Water Department#Trent Waterworks Company|Trent Waterworks Company]].\n\nThe [[Midland Counties Railway]] opened the first railway service between Nottingham and Derby on 4 June 1839.\n\nDuring the [[Industrial Revolution]], much of Nottingham's prosperity was founded on the [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile industry]]; in particular, Nottingham was an internationally important centre of [[lace]] manufacture. However, the rapid and poorly planned growth left Nottingham with the reputation of having the worst [[slum]]s in England.  the Government in 1844 appointed a Commission to look into the state of great towns. Thomas Hawkesley, Borough Water Engineer, testified to the Commission that he considered Nottingham to be the worst town in England. Residents of these slums rioted in 1831, in protest against the [[Duke of Newcastle]]'s opposition to the [[Reform Act 1832]], setting fire to his residence, Nottingham Castle. Businesses in other sectors founded in 19th-century Nottingham included the [[Raleigh Bicycle Company]] and [[Boots the Chemist]].\n\nNottingham was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and at that time consisted of the parishes of Nottingham St Mary, Nottingham St Nicholas and Nottingham St Peter. It was expanded in 1877 by adding the parishes of [[Basford, Nottingham|Basford]], Brewhouse Yard, [[Bulwell]], [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]], [[Sneinton]], [[Standard Hill]] and parts of the parishes of [[West Bridgford]], [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]], [[Wilford, Nottinghamshire|Wilford]] ([[North Wilford]]).\n\n[[File:Old and new trent bridges 1871.jpg|thumb|left|Old [[Trent Bridge (bridge)|Trent Bridge]] (left) pictured next to the new in 1871]]The first incinerators for waste disposal were built in [[Nottingham]] by [[Manlove, Alliott & Co.

The Chartered Institution of Wastes Management. 2007.</ref>\n\nThe first horse drawn tramcars are operated by the [[Nottingham and District Tramways Company Limited]] in 1878.\n\nIn 1889 Nottingham became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. City status was awarded as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria, being signified in a letter from the Prime Minister the [[Marquess of Salisbury]] to the Mayor, dated 18 June 1897.\n\nThe [[Great Central Railway]] opened [[Nottingham Victoria railway station]] in 1899.\n\n==20th century==\nElectric trams operated by [[Nottingham Corporation Tramways]] begin on 1 January 1901.\n\n[[Nottingham Council House]] was rebuilt between 1927 and 1929 to designs by [[Thomas Cecil Howitt]].\n\n===World War II===\nThe [[Nottingham Blitz]] was the [[Nazi German]] [[Luftwaffe]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]] on the city of Nottingham on the evenings of 8/9 May 1941 as part of a nationwide campaign to disrupt key industrial production, undermine morale and destroy factories, rail networks and infrastructure. During one air raid alone 140 people had been killed and 4,500 houses had been destroyed. Large areas of Nottingham and West Bridgford had been flattened and [[University of Nottingham|University College Nottingham]] had been damaged.\n\n===Economic decline===\nIn common with the UK textile industry as a whole, Nottingham's textile sector fell into headlong decline in the decades following the [[World War II]], as British manufacturers proved unable to compete on price or volume with output of factories in the Far East and South Asia. Very little textile manufacture now takes place in Nottingham, but the City's heyday in this sector endowed it with some fine industrial buildings in the [[Lace Market]] district. Many of these have been restored and put to new uses.\n\n==Robin Hood==\n[[Image:Robin Hood Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Robin Hood statue in Nottingham]]\n\nThe legend of [[Robin Hood]] first arose in the [[Middle Ages]]. Robin Hood is said to have lived in [[Sherwood Forest]], which extended from the north of Nottingham to the north side of [[Doncaster]], Yorkshire. Although Robin Hood is generally associated with Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, some authors (e.g. Phillips & Keatman, 1995) argue that he came from Yorkshire. Hood's main adversary was the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]. Today the office of [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] is a ceremonial position with no real jurisdiction. Whilst the accuracy of the legend is questionable, particularly the finer points, it has had a major impact on Nottingham, with Robin Hood imagery a popular choice for local businesses and many modern tourist attractions exploiting the legend. The Robin Hood Statue in Nottingham is within walking distance from the [[Old Market Square]].\n\n==Caves of Nottingham==\nThe Nottingham Caves have always formed an important part of the region, at first providing shelter and sanctuary, but growing to house thriving tanning works and in modern times becoming a tourist attraction. The caves are artificial, having been carved out of the soft [[sandstone]] rock by prospective dwellers, and have grown to become a complex network under the city. The oldest date back to 1250.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nottinghamcavessurvey.org.uk/history.htm |title=Nottingham's caves in history |accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref> The city has more manmade caves than anywhere else in the country and this whole cave network has [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] protection equal to that of [[Stonehenge]], making Nottingham Caves a site of vast importance to the [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] of the United Kingdom. Part of the network can be viewed by the [[public]] at the [[City of Caves]] attraction which is accessed from the upper mall of the [[Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]].\n\nBefore the industrial revolution, the cave network was substantially expanded and became home to a large proportion of the poorer populace, particularly those involved in the [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] industry. The majority of the caves were thought to have been used for storage by the 18th century and were still inhabited until around 1924 when the last family (the Shore family) moved out of the caves in Ilkeston road; they came into use again as [[air raid shelter]]s during [[World War II]]. A section of the cave network under the [[Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]] is now open as a tourist attraction, and some parts are still used as pub cellars.\n\nAnother section of the caves, under the castle, is still in regular use as the indoor rifle range of the [[Nottingham Rifle Club]]. In addition, [[Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem Inn]], a pub that claims to be the oldest in Britain, is partly built into the cave system below the castle and still retains access from the beer cellars to the castle through the cave inside castle rock. Although the pub's building only dates from the 16th or 17th century, the caves themselves may date to the 11th century and could have been the site of the brewhouse for the castle.\n\n==Nottingham Castle==\n[[Nottingham Castle]], founded by [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], famed through the [[Middle Ages]] as one of the country's finest strongholds, and where [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] raised the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]] in 1642 no longer exists, and has been replaced by a classical ducal palace. Of the medi\u00e6val castle only the (restored) gatehouse, and the ruined remains of some walls/foundations survive.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Nottingham]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Citation|last1=Barley|first1=M.
