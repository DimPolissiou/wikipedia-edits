He also appeared as a dancer with child star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Captain January (1936 film)|Captain January]]'' (1936). Ebsen was the original choice for the role of the Tin Man in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', but fell ill due to the aluminum dust in his makeup and was forced to drop out. He appeared with [[Maureen O'Hara]] in ''[[They Met in Argentina]]'' (1941) and [[June Havoc]] in ''[[Sing Your Worries Away]]'' (1942).  In ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961), he portrayed Doc Golightly, the much older husband of [[Audrey Hepburn]]'s character. Before his starring role in ''The Beverly Hillbillies'', Ebsen had a successful television career, the highlight of which was his role as Davy Crockett's sidekick, George Russell, in [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Davy Crockett (TV miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'' miniseries (1953&ndash;54).\n\n==Early years==\nA middle child with four sisters, Buddy Ebsen was born as Christian Ludolf Ebsen Jr., on April 2, 1908, in [[Belleville, Illinois]].<ref name=ny>{{cite news|title=Buddy Ebsen, of 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' Dies at 95|date=8 July 2003|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/08/obituaries/08EBSE.html|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=la>{{cite web|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|title=Buddy Ebsen, 95; Actor-Dancer Was Jed Clampett of 'Beverly Hillbillies'|date=8 July 2003|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/08/local/me-ebsen8|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref> His father, Christian Ludolf Ebsen Sr., was a [[Danish people|Danish]] choreographer, who once owned a dance studio and was also a physical fitness advocate, before operating a [[natatorium]] for the local school district,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicimages.com/people/article_4e042662-10ab-5fa1-9416-d5ece05f1178.html|title=Buddy Ebsen|publisher=classicimages|date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref> and his mother, Frances (n\u00e9e Wendt),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YkIaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tCMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7138,924501&dq=stroke-fatal-to-summer-visitor-rites-are-held&hl=en|\ntitle=Stroke Fatal to Summer Visitor; Rites Are Held|work=The Times-News|date=July 21, 1951 |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}</ref> was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] (specifically, [[Baltic Germans#Latvia|Latvian]]) painter.\n\nEbsen was raised in Belleville until the age of ten when his family moved to [[Palm Beach County, Florida]]. In 1920, Ebsen and his family relocated to [[Orlando, Florida]]. Ebsen and his sisters learned to dance at a dance studio his father operated in Orlando.\n\nDuring his high school years, Ebsen became a member of John M. Cheney Chapter, [[DeMolay International|Order of DeMolay]]. His involvement as a teenager led to his being recognized by DeMolay in adult life with the award of the Legion of Honor Degree, and later by induction into the DeMolay Alumni Hall of Fame.\n\nEbsen graduated from Orlando High School in 1926. Initially interested in a medical career, Ebsen attended the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]], from 1926 to 1927, and then [[Rollins College]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]], from 1927 to 1928. Family financial problems caused by the collapse of the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|Florida land boom]] forced Ebsen to leave college at age 20.\n\n==Professional career==\nEbsen left Orlando in the summer of 1928 to try his luck as a dancer in [[New York City]], arriving with only $26.75 in his pocket, and worked at a [[soda fountain]] shop. His sister [[Vilma Ebsen]] and he performed as a dance act in [[supper clubs]] and in [[vaudeville]] \u2014 they were known as \"The Baby Astaires\". On [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], the Ebsens appeared as members of the chorus in the [[musical theatre|musical]]s ''[[Whoopee!|Whoopee]]'', ''[[Flying Colors (musical)|Flying Colors]]'', and ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1934]]''. A rave review from New York columnist [[Walter Winchell]], who saw them perform in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], led to a booking at the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] in New York City, the pinnacle of the vaudeville world.\n\n===MGM signing===\n[[image:Buddy Ebsen1.jpg|right|thumb|Buddy Ebsen c. 1936]]\nIn 1935, Ebsen and his sister were approached by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for a [[screen test]]. They then signed a two-year contract, with a two-year option, for $1,500.00 per week each ({{Inflation|US|1500|1935|fmt=eq}}). After relocating to Hollywood, the siblings made their film debuts in the 1935 film ''[[Broadway Melody of 1936]]''. This was to be Vilma's only film \u2014 a contract problem prevented her making other films and she soon retired from show business.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nEbsen went on to appear in numerous films, both musicals and nonmusicals, including the 1936 ''[[Born to Dance]]'', the 1936 ''[[Captain January (1936 film)|Captain January]]'' (in which he danced with [[Shirley Temple]]),  the 1938 ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'' (with [[Judy Garland]] as his dance partner), and the 1938 ''[[The Girl of the Golden West (1938 film)|The Girl of the Golden West]]''. Ebsen partnered with actresses [[Eleanor Powell]] and [[Frances Langford]], among others, and also danced solo.\n\nEbsen was noted for his unusual, surreal dancing and singing style (for example, his contribution to the \"Swingin' the Jinx Away\" finale of ''[[Born to Dance]]''). His abilities might have been a reason filmmaker [[Walt Disney]] chose Ebsen to be filmed dancing in front of a grid as an aid to animating [[Mickey Mouse]]'s dancing in Disney's 1929 to 1939 [[Silly Symphony|Silly Symphonies]] animated short films.\n\n===''The Wizard of Oz''===\n[[File:Buddy Ebsen Tin Man.jpg|right|thumb|Ebsen as the Tin Man before being replaced by Jack Haley]]\nEbsen turned down [[Louis B. Mayer]]'s offer of an exclusive MGM contract, and Mayer warned him that he would never work in Hollywood again. Nonetheless, MGM cast him as the Scarecrow in its 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Ebsen then swapped roles with actor [[Ray Bolger]], who was originally cast as the Tin Man. Bolger wanted to play the Scarecrow, and Ebsen did not object to the change. Ebsen had recorded all of his songs as the Tin Man, attended all the rehearsals, and begun filming. However, he soon began experiencing body aches, muscle cramps, and shortness of breath, eventually leading to a lengthy  hospitalization. Doctors determined that he was suffering a reaction to the aluminum dust used in the Tin Man makeup, and he was forced to leave the production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/ozebsen.asp |title=Wizard of Oz and Buddy Ebsen |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>[[SAG-AFTRA]] ''Early Members: 1937'' {{Cite web |url=http://www.sagaftra.org/early-members-1937 |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303061728/http://www.sagaftra.org/early-members-1937 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown }} ''Frank 'Buddy' Ebsen'': \"When I was cast as the original Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz (1939), I almost disappeared over the rainbow because of the poisonous aluminum dust in my silvery make-up.

SAG, long may they wave.\"</ref> Ebsen recalled in an interview included on the 2005 DVD release of ''The Wizard of Oz'' that the MGM  studio heads did not believe that he was ill until he was ordered back to the set and was intercepted by an angry nurse.\n\nEbsen was replaced by [[Jack Haley]], with the makeup quickly changed to a safer aluminum paste. MGM did not publicize the true reason for Ebsen's departure; even Haley was not told until much later. Haley re-recorded most of Ebsen's vocals, although Ebsen's Midwestern accent can still be heard on the soundtrack during several reprises of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\", with the enunciated \"r\" in the word \"wizard\", as opposed to Haley's [[Boston accent]]. Ebsen's recording of the Tin Man's solo \"[[If I Only Had a Brain|If I Only Had a Heart]]\" is included on the deluxe edition of the film's soundtrack, while a still photo recreation of the sequence featuring shots of Ebsen as the Tin Man was included as an extra with all VHS and DVD releases of the film since 1989.

He took up sailing and became so proficient in seamanship that he taught the subject to naval officer candidates. He applied several times for a commission in the Navy in 1941, but was repeatedly turned down. The [[United States Coast Guard]] accepted his application for a commission, and he was promptly given the rank of lieutenant, junior grade. This wartime rank was one step up from the rank of ensign, the usual rank given newly appointed naval officers in peacetime. Ebsen served as damage control officer and later as executive officer on the Coast Guard-crewed Navy frigate {{USS|Pocatello|PF-9|6}}, which recorded weather at its \"weather station\" 1,500 miles west of [[Seattle]]. These patrols consisted of 30 days at sea, followed by 10 days in port at Seattle. Ebsen was honorably discharged from the Coast Guard as a lieutenant in 1946.<ref>''Stars in Blue'', James E.

Ebsen played the role of Sergeant Hunk Marriner; [[Keith Larsen]] played Rogers.\n\nIn 1960, Ebsen appeared in episodes of the television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', in the episodes \"The Pitchwagon\" and ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'', which he reprised in episodes of both series during 1962 in the roles of different characters. Ebsen also portrayed a corrupt, bloodthirsty marshal in \"El Paso Stage\", an episode of ''[[Have Gun, Will Travel]]'' broadcast in April 1961.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/shows/have-gun-will-travel/el-paso-stage-124771/cast/ \"El Paso Stage\"], ''Have Gun, Will Travel'', S04E30, originally aired April 15, 1961; ''TV.com'', CBS Interactive, Inc.

[[Robert Altman]] directed several episodes. [[Arthur O'Connell]] had played Virge Blessing in the earlier [[Bus Stop (1956 film)|film version]] on which the series was loosely based. Ebsen also appeared as \"Mr. Dave\" Browne, a homeless [[hobo]], on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' opposite [[Ron Howard]], and as Jimbo Cobb in'' [[The Twilight Zone]] ''episode \"[[The Prime Mover]]\" (season 2, episode 21) in 1961.\n\n===''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' (1961)===\nThroughout the 1950s, Ebsen performed in films, mainly Westerns.

Aside from the top-billed Ebsen, principal cast members included [[Irene Ryan]] as Jed's mother-in-law, Daisy Moses, also known as Granny; [[Max Baer Jr.]] as Jed's dimwitted nephew Jethro Bodine; [[Donna Douglas]] as Jed's only child, the curvaceous, critter-loving [[Elly May Clampett]]; [[Raymond Bailey]] as Milburn Drysdale, a bank president who oversees the Clampett fortune; and [[Nancy Kulp]] as Jane Hathaway, Drysdale's secretary.\n\nAlthough scorned by critics, ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' attracted as many as 60 million viewers between 1962 and 1971 and was several times the highest-rated series on television. The show also spawned similar Paul Henning-produced rural sitcoms such as ''[[Green Acres]]'' and ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', which were eventually linked in crossover episode arcs. ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' was still earning good ratings when it was cancelled by CBS (because programmers [[Rural purge|began shunning shows that attracted a rural audience]]). One episode, \"The Giant Jack Rabbit\", was the highest-rated half-hour on television to that time and remains{{when|date=July 2013}} the most-watched half-hour sitcom episode.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Giant Jackrabbit: What is a Beverly Hillbillies Episode Doing on the TV All Time Most Watched List?|publisher=The Retroist|url=http://www.retroist.com/2012/06/11/the-giant-jackrabbit-what-is-a-beverly-hillbillies-episode-doing-on-the-tv-all-time-most-watched-list/|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nNot all was harmonious among cast members on ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' set, especially between the politically conservative Ebsen and the more liberal Kulp.

He also appeared as a dancer with child star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Captain January (1936 film)|Captain January]]'' (1936). Ebsen was the original choice for the role of the Tin Man in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', but fell ill due to the aluminum dust in his makeup and was forced to drop out. He appeared with [[Maureen O'Hara]] in ''[[They Met in Argentina]]'' (1941) and [[June Havoc]] in ''[[Sing Your Worries Away]]'' (1942).  In ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961), he portrayed Doc Golightly, the much older husband of [[Audrey Hepburn]]'s character. Before his starring role in ''The Beverly Hillbillies'', Ebsen had a successful television career, the highlight of which was his role as Davy Crockett's sidekick, George Russell, in [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Davy Crockett (TV miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'' miniseries (1953&ndash;54).\n\n==Early years==\nA middle child with four sisters, Buddy Ebsen was born as Christian Ludolf Ebsen Jr., on April 2, 1908, in [[Belleville, Illinois]].<ref name=ny>{{cite news|title=Buddy Ebsen, of 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' Dies at 95|date=8 July 2003|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/08/obituaries/08EBSE.html|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=la>{{cite web|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|title=Buddy Ebsen, 95; Actor-Dancer Was Jed Clampett of 'Beverly Hillbillies'|date=8 July 2003|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/08/local/me-ebsen8|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref> His father, Christian Ludolf Ebsen Sr., was a [[Danish people|Danish]] choreographer, who once owned a dance studio and was also a physical fitness advocate, before operating a [[natatorium]] for the local school district,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicimages.com/people/article_4e042662-10ab-5fa1-9416-d5ece05f1178.html|title=Buddy Ebsen|publisher=classicimages|date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref> and his mother, Frances (n\u00e9e Wendt),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YkIaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tCMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7138,924501&dq=stroke-fatal-to-summer-visitor-rites-are-held&hl=en|\ntitle=Stroke Fatal to Summer Visitor; Rites Are Held|work=The Times-News|date=July 21, 1951 |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}</ref> was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] (specifically, [[Baltic Germans#Latvia|Latvian]]) painter.\n\nEbsen was raised in Belleville until the age of ten when his family moved to [[Palm Beach County, Florida]]. In 1920, Ebsen and his family relocated to [[Orlando, Florida]]. Ebsen and his sisters learned to dance at a dance studio his father operated in Orlando.\n\nDuring his high school years, Ebsen became a member of John M. Cheney Chapter, [[DeMolay International|Order of DeMolay]]. His involvement as a teenager led to his being recognized by DeMolay in adult life with the award of the Legion of Honor Degree, and later by induction into the DeMolay Alumni Hall of Fame.\n\nEbsen graduated from Orlando High School in 1926. Initially interested in a medical career, Ebsen attended the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]], from 1926 to 1927, and then [[Rollins College]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]], from 1927 to 1928. Family financial problems caused by the collapse of the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|Florida land boom]] forced Ebsen to leave college at age 20.\n\n==Professional career==\nEbsen left Orlando in the summer of 1928 to try his luck as a dancer in [[New York City]], arriving with only $26.75 in his pocket, and worked at a [[soda fountain]] shop. His sister [[Vilma Ebsen]] and he performed as a dance act in [[supper clubs]] and in [[vaudeville]] \u2014 they were known as \"The Baby Astaires\". On [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], the Ebsens appeared as members of the chorus in the [[musical theatre|musical]]s ''[[Whoopee!|Whoopee]]'', ''[[Flying Colors (musical)|Flying Colors]]'', and ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1934]]''. A rave review from New York columnist [[Walter Winchell]], who saw them perform in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], led to a booking at the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] in New York City, the pinnacle of the vaudeville world.\n\n===MGM signing===\n[[image:Buddy Ebsen1.jpg|right|thumb|Buddy Ebsen c. 1936]]\nIn 1935, Ebsen and his sister were approached by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for a [[screen test]]. They then signed a two-year contract, with a two-year option, for $1,500.00 per week each ({{Inflation|US|1500|1935|fmt=eq}}). After relocating to Hollywood, the siblings made their film debuts in the 1935 film ''[[Broadway Melody of 1936]]''. This was to be Vilma's only film \u2014 a contract problem prevented her making other films and she soon retired from show business.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nEbsen went on to appear in numerous films, both musicals and nonmusicals, including the 1936 ''[[Born to Dance]]'', the 1936 ''[[Captain January (1936 film)|Captain January]]'' (in which he danced with [[Shirley Temple]]),  the 1938 ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'' (with [[Judy Garland]] as his dance partner), and the 1938 ''[[The Girl of the Golden West (1938 film)|The Girl of the Golden West]]''. Ebsen partnered with actresses [[Eleanor Powell]] and [[Frances Langford]], among others, and also danced solo.\n\nEbsen was noted for his unusual, surreal dancing and singing style (for example, his contribution to the \"Swingin' the Jinx Away\" finale of ''[[Born to Dance]]''). His abilities might have been a reason filmmaker [[Walt Disney]] chose Ebsen to be filmed dancing in front of a grid as an aid to animating [[Mickey Mouse]]'s dancing in Disney's 1929 to 1939 [[Silly Symphony|Silly Symphonies]] animated short films.\n\n===''The Wizard of Oz''===\n[[File:Buddy Ebsen Tin Man.jpg|right|thumb|Ebsen as the Tin Man before being replaced by Jack Haley]]\nEbsen turned down [[Louis B. Mayer]]'s offer of an exclusive MGM contract, and Mayer warned him that he would never work in Hollywood again. Nonetheless, MGM cast him as the Scarecrow in its 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Ebsen then swapped roles with actor [[Ray Bolger]], who was originally cast as the Tin Man. Bolger wanted to play the Scarecrow, and Ebsen did not object to the change. Ebsen had recorded all of his songs as the Tin Man, attended all the rehearsals, and begun filming. However, he soon began experiencing body aches, muscle cramps, and shortness of breath, eventually leading to a lengthy  hospitalization. Doctors determined that he was suffering a reaction to the aluminum dust used in the Tin Man makeup, and he was forced to leave the production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/ozebsen.asp |title=Wizard of Oz and Buddy Ebsen |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>[[SAG-AFTRA]] ''Early Members: 1937'' {{Cite web |url=http://www.sagaftra.org/early-members-1937 |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303061728/http://www.sagaftra.org/early-members-1937 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown }} ''Frank 'Buddy' Ebsen'': \"When I was cast as the original Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz (1939), I almost disappeared over the rainbow because of the poisonous aluminum dust in my silvery make-up. It cost me a big medical bill. If that happened today, the Guild would have taken care of it. SAG, long may they wave.\"</ref> Ebsen recalled in an interview included on the 2005 DVD release of ''The Wizard of Oz'' that the MGM  studio heads did not believe that he was ill until he was ordered back to the set and was intercepted by an angry nurse.\n\nEbsen was replaced by [[Jack Haley]], with the makeup quickly changed to a safer aluminum paste. MGM did not publicize the true reason for Ebsen's departure; even Haley was not told until much later. Haley re-recorded most of Ebsen's vocals, although Ebsen's Midwestern accent can still be heard on the soundtrack during several reprises of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\", with the enunciated \"r\" in the word \"wizard\", as opposed to Haley's [[Boston accent]]. Ebsen's recording of the Tin Man's solo \"[[If I Only Had a Brain|If I Only Had a Heart]]\" is included on the deluxe edition of the film's soundtrack, while a still photo recreation of the sequence featuring shots of Ebsen as the Tin Man was included as an extra with all VHS and DVD releases of the film since 1989. For the rest of his life, Ebsen complained of breathing problems from his involvement in \"that damned movie\".<ref>Cox, Stephen (1988, rev. 2003).

He took up sailing and became so proficient in seamanship that he taught the subject to naval officer candidates. He applied several times for a commission in the Navy in 1941, but was repeatedly turned down. The [[United States Coast Guard]] accepted his application for a commission, and he was promptly given the rank of lieutenant, junior grade. This wartime rank was one step up from the rank of ensign, the usual rank given newly appointed naval officers in peacetime. Ebsen served as damage control officer and later as executive officer on the Coast Guard-crewed Navy frigate {{USS|Pocatello|PF-9|6}}, which recorded weather at its \"weather station\" 1,500 miles west of [[Seattle]]. These patrols consisted of 30 days at sea, followed by 10 days in port at Seattle. Ebsen was honorably discharged from the Coast Guard as a lieutenant in 1946.<ref>''Stars in Blue'', James E.

This series was a fictionalized account of [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Major Robert Rogers]], a colonial American fighter for the British in the [[French and Indian War]]. Ebsen played the role of Sergeant Hunk Marriner; [[Keith Larsen]] played Rogers.\n\nIn 1960, Ebsen appeared in episodes of the television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', in the episodes \"The Pitchwagon\" and ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'', which he reprised in episodes of both series during 1962 in the roles of different characters. Ebsen also portrayed a corrupt, bloodthirsty marshal in \"El Paso Stage\", an episode of ''[[Have Gun, Will Travel]]'' broadcast in April 1961.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/shows/have-gun-will-travel/el-paso-stage-124771/cast/ \"El Paso Stage\"], ''Have Gun, Will Travel'', S04E30, originally aired April 15, 1961; ''TV.com'', CBS Interactive, Inc.

[[Robert Altman]] directed several episodes. [[Arthur O'Connell]] had played Virge Blessing in the earlier [[Bus Stop (1956 film)|film version]] on which the series was loosely based. Ebsen also appeared as \"Mr. Dave\" Browne, a homeless [[hobo]], on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' opposite [[Ron Howard]], and as Jimbo Cobb in'' [[The Twilight Zone]] ''episode \"[[The Prime Mover]]\" (season 2, episode 21) in 1961.\n\n===''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' (1961)===\nThroughout the 1950s, Ebsen performed in films, mainly Westerns.

Aside from the top-billed Ebsen, principal cast members included [[Irene Ryan]] as Jed's mother-in-law, Daisy Moses, also known as Granny; [[Max Baer Jr.]] as Jed's dimwitted nephew Jethro Bodine; [[Donna Douglas]] as Jed's only child, the curvaceous, critter-loving [[Elly May Clampett]]; [[Raymond Bailey]] as Milburn Drysdale, a bank president who oversees the Clampett fortune; and [[Nancy Kulp]] as Jane Hathaway, Drysdale's secretary.\n\nAlthough scorned by critics, ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' attracted as many as 60 million viewers between 1962 and 1971 and was several times the highest-rated series on television. The show also spawned similar Paul Henning-produced rural sitcoms such as ''[[Green Acres]]'' and ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', which were eventually linked in crossover episode arcs. ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' was still earning good ratings when it was cancelled by CBS (because programmers [[Rural purge|began shunning shows that attracted a rural audience]]).

Said Douglas, \"They had a different view, so they had some heated discussions about that. They would go at it for weeks.\" In 1984, Kulp unsuccessfully ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] as a Democrat from [[Pennsylvania]]. To her dismay, Ebsen supported her Republican opponent, incumbent Representative [[Bud Shuster]], going so far as to tape an ad for Shuster that labeled Kulp as \"too liberal\".
