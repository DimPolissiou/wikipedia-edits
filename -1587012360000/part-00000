Moore was shot and killed by the Barrow Gang in 1932]]\nOriginally named Springtown for the natural springs that flow out of the hills the town is built upon, the current name is believed to be a corruption. Once home to a bank, theater, and pub, the town has declined over the years, both economically and in population. In the past five years,{{when|date=April 2020}} small population growth and the addition of a new caf\u00e9 have brought new life to the town. Annually in September, the Good Ole Days Festival celebrates the town's past with a parade, cookout, and concert.\n\n[[File:okterritory.png|thumb|right|350px|Oklahoma and Indian Territory, 1890s]]\nStringtown was founded{{when|date=April 2020}}  in [[Atoka County, Choctaw Nation]], a [[History of Oklahoma#Indian and Oklahoma Territories|territorial-era]] government unit that included parts of today's Atoka, Coal, Hughes, and Pittsburg counties.\n\nOn August 5, 1932, while [[Bonnie Parker]] was visiting her mother, [[Clyde Barrow]] and two associates were drinking alcohol at a dance in Stringtown (illegal under [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]). They were approached by Sheriff C. G. Maxwell and his deputy, at which time Clyde opened fire, killing deputy Eugene C. Moore. That was the first killing of a lawman by what was later known as the Barrow Gang, a total which would eventually amount to nine slain officers.\n\nIn the 1940s during [[World War II]], [[Fritz Johann Hansgirg]], the Austrian inventor of magnesium and [[heavy water]] processes was interned at the [[Internment of German Americans|U.S. alien internment camp]] located in Stringtown.\n\nIn the late 1960s, a [[tornado]] touched down in the town directly on top of the (then) recently built Community Center, now the Senior Citizens Center. The tornado was only on the ground for a few seconds, but during that time the building was almost destroyed. It was an unusual occurrence for a tornado to touch down in the town itself, given its location between two chains of steep hills.\n\nThe nearby Mack Alford State Penitentiary is a large source of employment in the county. It was an [[internment camp]] for [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Americans]] arrested as \"enemy aliens\" and later for German [[prisoner of war|POWs]] during World War II.<ref>[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Stringtown%20%28detention%20facility%29/ \"Stringtown (detention facility)\"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

On January 14, 2014, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol disbanded the Stringtown Police Department for generating too much of the city\u2019s revenue off of writing traffic tickets, a violation of the state \"speed trap\" law.<ref>\"[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/speed-trap-profits-could-come-end-small-town-new-laws/ New laws aim to put brakes on nation's speed traps]\", [[CBS News]]; retrieved May 03, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe Garside house is one of the biggest historical sites of the town, next to the Bonnie and Clyde monument. The land the Garside house sits on was allotted to Joseph and Sarah Garside and their two children in 1902. In the middle of building the house, a tornado came through the town and tore down the part of the house that had been built. The Garsides had to start over again, but in 1915 they finished a two-story house. The house and land was later purchased by E. H. Colbertson, the first white man to buy land in that area. Approximately four years ago, the house was remodeled and decorated to be a museum.\n\nThe Southwest Stone Company, also known as the Rock Crusher, is one of the biggest sources of employment in the county. The crusher moved from Chockee to Stringtown in the early 1900s. Up until that point, Stringtown had not had electricity yet. \n\nThe railroad that runs through Stringtown stretches from south Texas, takes several routes in Oklahoma and Kansas, and reaches to the northern parts of Missouri. The part that runs through Stringtown was built in 1872 and is known now as the [[Union Pacific Railroad]].\n\nStringtown was once home to a [[sawmill]] and a [[cotton gin]] that had the biggest production rate in the late 1800s. When a fire burnt the town on July 15, 1954, the sawmill and cotton gin burned down, along with half the town, including a caf\u00e9, a jailhouse, a barbershop, a bank, and a hotel. All that was left was Robert\u2019s Store and a few homes. The town never really was rebuilt after this. Today, there is a school, a church, a fire department, City Hall, Dianna\u2019s Store, and a senior citizens center.\n\nA state investigation revealed that 76 percent of the Stringtown's 2013 budget came from traffic tickets. The investigation found excessive speed trapping, and the police department was disbanded in 2014.\n\n==Government and infrastructure==\n[[Image:Stringtown Post Office.jpg|thumb|right|The old Stringtown Post Office, which was demolished early in the 1990s as it had become structurally unsound.]]\nThe [[United States Postal Service]] operates the Stringtown Post Office.<ref>\"[http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/stringtown-107-e-reba-mcentire-ave-stringtown-ok-1383770 Post Office Location - STRINGTOWN]\", [[United States Postal Service]]; retrieved November 22, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe [[Oklahoma Department of Corrections]] operates the [[Mack Alford Correctional Center]] in an [[unincorporated area]] in [[Atoka County, Oklahoma|Atoka County]], near Stringtown.<ref>\"[http://www.doc.state.ok.us/facilities/institutions/macc.htm Mack Alford Correctional Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404095358/http://www.doc.state.ok.us/facilities/institutions/macc.htm |date=2013-04-04 }}\", [[Oklahoma Department of Corrections]]; retrieved November 22, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 360\n|1930= 558\n|1940= 718\n|1950= 499\n|1960= 414\n|1970= 397\n|1980= 1047\n|1990= 366\n|2000= 396\n|2010= 410\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=399\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 396 people, 166 households, and 113 families residing in the town.

Moore was shot and killed by the Barrow Gang in 1932]]\nOriginally named Springtown for the natural springs that flow out of the hills the town is built upon, the current name is believed to be a corruption. Once home to a bank, theater, and pub, the town has declined over the years, both economically and in population. In the past five years,{{when|date=April 2020}} small population growth and the addition of a new caf\u00e9 have brought new life to the town. Annually in September, the Good Ole Days Festival celebrates the town's past with a parade, cookout, and concert.\n\nStringtown was founded{{when|date=April 2020}}  in [[Atoka County, Choctaw Nation]], a [[History of Oklahoma#Indian and Oklahoma Territories|territorial-era]] government unit that included parts of today's Atoka, Coal, Hughes, and Pittsburg counties.\n\nOn August 5, 1932, while [[Bonnie Parker]] was visiting her mother, [[Clyde Barrow]] and two associates were drinking alcohol at a dance in Stringtown (illegal under [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]). They were approached by Sheriff C. G. Maxwell and his deputy, at which time Clyde opened fire, killing deputy Eugene C. Moore. That was the first killing of a lawman by what was later known as the Barrow Gang, a total which would eventually amount to nine slain officers.\n\nIn the 1940s during [[World War II]], [[Fritz Johann Hansgirg]], the Austrian inventor of magnesium and [[heavy water]] processes was interned at the [[Internment of German Americans|U.S. alien internment camp]] located in Stringtown.\n\nIn the late 1960s, a [[tornado]] touched down in the town directly on top of the (then) recently built Community Center, now the Senior Citizens Center. The tornado was only on the ground for a few seconds, but during that time the building was almost destroyed. It was an unusual occurrence for a tornado to touch down in the town itself, given its location between two chains of steep hills.\n\nThe nearby Mack Alford State Penitentiary is a large source of employment in the county. It was an [[internment camp]] for [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Americans]] arrested as \"enemy aliens\" and later for German [[prisoner of war|POWs]] during World War II.<ref>[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Stringtown%20%28detention%20facility%29/ \"Stringtown (detention facility)\"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

On January 14, 2014, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol disbanded the Stringtown Police Department for generating too much of the city\u2019s revenue off of writing traffic tickets, a violation of the state \"speed trap\" law.<ref>\"[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/speed-trap-profits-could-come-end-small-town-new-laws/ New laws aim to put brakes on nation's speed traps]\", [[CBS News]]; retrieved May 03, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe Garside house is one of the biggest historical sites of the town, next to the Bonnie and Clyde monument. The land the Garside house sits on was allotted to Joseph and Sarah Garside and their two children in 1902. In the middle of building the house, a tornado came through the town and tore down the part of the house that had been built. The Garsides had to start over again, but in 1915 they finished a two-story house. The house and land was later purchased by E. H. Colbertson, the first white man to buy land in that area. Approximately four years ago, the house was remodeled and decorated to be a museum.\n\nThe Southwest Stone Company, also known as the Rock Crusher, is one of the biggest sources of employment in the county. The crusher moved from Chockee to Stringtown in the early 1900s. Up until that point, Stringtown had not had electricity yet. \n\nThe railroad that runs through Stringtown stretches from south Texas, takes several routes in Oklahoma and Kansas, and reaches to the northern parts of Missouri. The part that runs through Stringtown was built in 1872 and is known now as the [[Union Pacific Railroad]].\n\nStringtown was once home to a [[sawmill]] and a [[cotton gin]] that had the biggest production rate in the late 1800s. When a fire burnt the town on July 15, 1954, the sawmill and cotton gin burned down, along with half the town, including a caf\u00e9, a jailhouse, a barbershop, a bank, and a hotel. All that was left was Robert\u2019s Store and a few homes. The town never really was rebuilt after this. Today, there is a school, a church, a fire department, City Hall, Dianna\u2019s Store, and a senior citizens center.\n\nA state investigation revealed that 76 percent of the Stringtown's 2013 budget came from traffic tickets. The investigation found excessive speed trapping, and the police department was disbanded in 2014.\n\n==Government and infrastructure==\n[[Image:Stringtown Post Office.jpg|thumb|right|The old Stringtown Post Office, which was demolished early in the 1990s as it had become structurally unsound.]]\nThe [[United States Postal Service]] operates the Stringtown Post Office.<ref>\"[http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/stringtown-107-e-reba-mcentire-ave-stringtown-ok-1383770 Post Office Location - STRINGTOWN]\", [[United States Postal Service]]; retrieved November 22, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe [[Oklahoma Department of Corrections]] operates the [[Mack Alford Correctional Center]] in an [[unincorporated area]] in [[Atoka County, Oklahoma|Atoka County]], near Stringtown.<ref>\"[http://www.doc.state.ok.us/facilities/institutions/macc.htm Mack Alford Correctional Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404095358/http://www.doc.state.ok.us/facilities/institutions/macc.htm |date=2013-04-04 }}\", [[Oklahoma Department of Corrections]]; retrieved November 22, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 360\n|1930= 558\n|1940= 718\n|1950= 499\n|1960= 414\n|1970= 397\n|1980= 1047\n|1990= 366\n|2000= 396\n|2010= 410\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=399\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 396 people, 166 households, and 113 families residing in the town.

The scheme allotted up to 40% of the university placement to rural youth (primarily from Sinhalese areas). The government claimed that this was an [[affirmative action]] scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education. According to [[K.

Two years later, in 1975, all Tamil political parties merged and became known as the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF). In 1976, the first national convention of the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] was held at [[Vaddukoddai]], where the party adopted a unanimous resolution called the Vaddukodai Resolution. This resolution charged that the Sinhalese government, with the use of the constitution of 1972, had used its power to \"deprive the Tamil nation of its territory, language, citizenship, economic life, opportunities of employment and education thereby destroying all the attributes of nationhood of the Tamil people.\" The resolution further called for the \"Free, Sovereign, Secular Socialist State of TAMIL EELAM\".<ref name=Pfaffenberger1981>{{cite journal\n | author = Pfaffenberger, B.\n | year = 1981\n | title = The Cultural Dimension of Tamil Separatism in Sri Lanka\n | journal = Asian Survey\n | volume = 21\n | issue = 11\n | pages = 1145\u20131157\n | doi = 10.1525/as.1981.21.11.01p0322p\n| jstor=2643999\n}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the Vaddukodai resolution, the Tamil United Liberation Front became the first Tamil political party to run its campaign on a separatist platform.

The outcome was the District Development Councils scheme (DDC) passed in 1980. The District Development Councils scheme was based, to some extent, on decentralization of the government within a united Sri Lanka.

The region is subdivided into three sections, the North, the East where the majority of the native Tamils live, and the northern part of the Puthalam district which had a large Tamil influence in the pre-colonial times.\n\n===North===\nThe Northern province is 22 miles (35&nbsp;km) south of the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. The [[Adam's Bridge]] (Sethu Bridge) is located between the waters of the Mannar islet and the Indian mainland. The North is surrounded by the [[Gulf of Mannar]] and Palk Bay to the west, [[Palk Strait]] to the north, the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the east and the Eastern, North Central and North Western provinces to the south. It has a total area of 8,884 square kilometers (3,430.1 sq mi).\n\nIt is divided into two distinct geographic areas: [[Jaffna peninsula]] and the central [[Vanni region]].\n\nThe Jaffna peninsula has a number of bays and lagoons along its coastline and much of the coast consists of sandy beaches. A chain of both inhabited and uninhabited islands are also found along the Jaffna peninsula.\n\nThe sparsely populated Vanni region is covered in tropical forests with numerous rivers flowing through them, making agriculture and forestry the primary industry in the area. The dry-land forests house rare species of trees, such as the satinwood, ebony, ironwood, and mahogany.\n\n===East===\nThe Eastern part of the Tamil Eelam has an area of 9,996 square kilometers (3,859.5 sq mi). The Area is surrounded by land to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, and the central highlands to its west, south and southwest.\n\nThe Eastern coast is dominated by lagoons, the largest being the [[Batticaloa Lagoon]], [[Kokkilai Lagoon]], [[Upaar Lagoon]] and [[Ullackalie Lagoon]]s.\n\nMuch of the coastline has a number of inlets from the sea, making them excellent inland ports and fishing harbours. The East has a rich biodiversity and is the natural habitat to many species.\n\n==Political divisions and demographics==\n[[File:Firewood selling, Batticaloa.JPG|200 px|thumb|Fire-wood sellers in Batticaloa district]]\n\nFollowing the declaration of independence, which saw large scale movements of people in search of better economic opportunities, and the [[Sri Lankan state sponsored colonisation schemes|state sponsored Sinhalese colonization]] of Tamil territories, the demographics of the state had been heavily altered.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe three decade long [[Civil war]] that followed the anti-Tamil policies further affected the North and the East with over 80,000\u2013100,000 people estimated to have been killed and over 400,000 Tamils fleeing their homes. Many people still live in IDP camps in the North and the East and the present-day demographics of the region has been changing due to more and more Sinhalese settling in these territories.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are\n\n*Recognition of the Tamils of Sri Lanka as a distinct nationality.\n*Recognition of an identified Tamil homeland and guarantee of its territorial integrity.\n*Based on the above, recognition of the inalienable right of self-determination of the Tamil nation.\n*Recognition of the right to full citizenship and other fundamental democratic rights of all Tamils who look upon the island as their country.'\n\nFurther the alliance stands for:\n\n*The immediate lifting of the economic embargo currently in force in parts of the northeast province\n*The withdrawal of the residential and travel restrictions foisted on the Tamil nationality\n*The immediate cessation of the war being currently waged in the northeast\n\nThree of its sitting Members of the Parliament K.

The District Development Councils scheme was based, to some extent, on decentralization of the government within a united Sri Lanka.

The region is subdivided into three sections, the North, the East where the majority of the native Tamils live, and the northern part of the Puthalam district which had a large Tamil influence in the pre-colonial times.\n\n===North===\nThe Northern province is 22 miles (35&nbsp;km) south of the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. The [[Adam's Bridge]] (Sethu Bridge) is located between the waters of the Mannar islet and the Indian mainland. The North is surrounded by the [[Gulf of Mannar]] and Palk Bay to the west, [[Palk Strait]] to the north, the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the east and the Eastern, North Central and North Western provinces to the south. It has a total area of 8,884 square kilometers (3,430.1 sq mi).\n\nIt is divided into two distinct geographic areas: [[Jaffna peninsula]] and the central [[Vanni region]].\n\nThe Jaffna peninsula has a number of bays and lagoons along its coastline and much of the coast consists of sandy beaches. A chain of both inhabited and uninhabited islands are also found along the Jaffna peninsula.\n\nThe sparsely populated Vanni region is covered in tropical forests with numerous rivers flowing through them, making agriculture and forestry the primary industry in the area. The dry-land forests house rare species of trees, such as the satinwood, ebony, ironwood, and mahogany.\n\n===East===\nThe Eastern part of the Tamil Eelam has an area of 9,996 square kilometers (3,859.5 sq mi). The Area is surrounded by land to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, and the central highlands to its west, south and southwest.\n\nThe Eastern coast is dominated by lagoons, the largest being the [[Batticaloa Lagoon]], [[Kokkilai Lagoon]], [[Upaar Lagoon]] and [[Ullackalie Lagoon]]s.\n\nMuch of the coastline has a number of inlets from the sea, making them excellent inland ports and fishing harbours. The East has a rich biodiversity and is the natural habitat to many species.\n\n==Political divisions and demographics==\n[[File:Firewood selling, Batticaloa.JPG|200 px|thumb|Fire-wood sellers in Batticaloa district]]\n\nFollowing the declaration of independence, which saw large scale movements of people in search of better economic opportunities, and the [[Sri Lankan state sponsored colonisation schemes|state sponsored Sinhalese colonization]] of Tamil territories, the demographics of the state had been heavily altered.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe three decade long [[Civil war]] that followed the anti-Tamil policies further affected the North and the East with over 80,000\u2013100,000 people estimated to have been killed and over 400,000 Tamils fleeing their homes. Many people still live in IDP camps in the North and the East and the present-day demographics of the region has been changing due to more and more Sinhalese settling in these territories.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The traditional belief is that one's future is a function of what one experiences, that the new year will be better if one views auspicious joyful things as the first thing on Vishu. Therefore, Malayali's spend the day before preparing a setting, usually a tray, of auspicious items. This setting is the first thing they see when they wake up on the Vishu day.<ref name=\"Jagannathan2005p76\"/><ref name=\"Dalal2010p461\"/>\n\nThe Vishukkani setting consists of items such as<ref name=\":3\" /> [[rice]], golden [[lemon]], golden [[cucumber]], [[coconut]] cut open, jack fruit, kanmashi [[Kajal]], [[betel]] leaves, [[arecanut]], [[Aranmula kannadi|metal mirror]] (''Vaalkannadi''), golden yellow ''Konna'' flowers (''[[Cassia fistula]]'') which bloom in the season of Vishu, holy Hindu texts, coins or currency notes, oil lamp (''nilavilakku''), and an image of the Hindu god Vishnu.<ref name=\"Jagannathan2005p76\"/> Mirror in Vishukani is a symbol of seeing yourself as a part of abundance you see in the form of Kani.  \n\nThe tradition has been that one of the members of the house, typically the mom or elderly person lights up the lamps at dawn, then goes to each member of her family one by one, blindfolds and wakes each one up, walks them to the front of the setting. She then releases the blindfold so one can see the setting, and then greets the Vishu day.<ref name=\"Jagannathan2005p76\"/><ref name=\"Dalal2010p461\"/>\n\n===Vishu Sadhya===\n[[File:Vishu Sadya 2013 135212.jpg|thumb|Vishu Sadhya served in 2013.]]\nThe [[Sadhya]] (feast) is a major part of all Kerala festivals. However, special dishes called Vishu ''Kanji'', Thoran and ''Vishu katta'' are more important on the new year day. The Kanji is made of rice, coconut milk and spices. Vishu katta is a delicacy prepared from freshly harvested rice powder and coconut milk served with jaggery.<ref name=\":3\" /> For Thoran, the side dish, there are also mandatory ingredients. Other important Vishu delicacies include ''Veppampoorasam'' (a bitter preparation of [[neem]]) and ''Mampazhappulissery'' (a sour or ripe [[mango]] soup)<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vishu-delicacies/article302986.ece |title=Vishu delicacies |publisher=The Hindu |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}</ref> Even temple offerings called ''bewu bella'', include a mix of sweet jaggery, bitter neem, and other flavors.<ref name=\"Jagannathan2005p76\"/>\n\nThe mixing of sweet, salty, sour, bitter and astringent flavors for the new year Vishu meal is similar to the ''pacchadi'' food prepared on new year day such as [[Ugadi]] by Hindus in Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the  [[Indian subcontinent]]. These traditional festive recipes, that combine different flavors, are a symbolic reminder that one must expect all flavors of experiences in the coming new year, that no event or episode is wholly sweet or bitter, experiences are transitory and ephemeral, and to make the most from them.<ref name=narayanan18>{{cite journal | last=Narayanan | first=Vasudha | title=Y51K and Still Counting: Some Hindu Views of Time | journal=Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies | publisher=Butler University | volume=12 | issue=1 | year=1999| pages=17\u201318 | doi=10.7825/2164-6279.1205 | url=https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1205&context=jhcs | doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n===Vishu Padakkam===\n[[File:Crackers vishu 2.jpg|thumb|Vishu Padakkam]]\nThe word 'Padakkam' in Malayalam means firecrackers.Firecrackers are burst during Vishu the same way north Indians burst firecrackers during Diwali.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/fyi/story/vishu-2017-april-14-kerala-festival-history-legends-practices-971219-2017-04-13&ved=2ahUKEwi6jJvf_9zoAhWZA3IKHU5rBOUQFjAPegQICRAB&usg=AOvVaw0ZZ_8Po4sW0e306VO5QhEU&ampcf=1|title=Vishu 2017: History, legends, practices and all you need to know|access-date =10 April 2020}}</ref>\n===Vishukonna===\n[[File:konnamaram.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|(''[[Cassia fistula]]''), \u0d15\u0d23\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d4a\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28, Golden Shower Tree]]\nKonna (''[[Cassia fistula]]''), commonly known as golden shower is the flower of the Vishu festival.\n\n===Other customs===\n[[File:Kampithiri.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|A child playing with fireworks on Vishu]]\n[[File:Uruli festive arrangement of flowers, Malayali Hindus in Kerala.jpg|thumb|Flower arrangement in Uruli during Vishu]]\nThe tradition of buying of new clothes for the occasion of Vishu is called '''''Puthukodi '''''or'' Vishukodi.''

This setting is the first thing they see when they wake up on the Vishu day.<ref name=\"Jagannathan2005p76\"/><ref name=\"Dalal2010p461\"/>\n\nThe Vishukkani setting consists of items such as<ref name=\":3\" /> [[rice]], golden [[lemon]], golden [[cucumber]], [[coconut]] cut open, jack fruit, kanmashi [[Kajal]], [[betel]] leaves, [[arecanut]], [[Aranmula kannadi|metal mirror]] (''Vaalkannadi''), golden yellow ''Konna'' flowers (''[[Cassia fistula]]'') which bloom in the season of Vishu, holy Hindu texts, coins or currency notes, oil lamp (''nilavilakku''), and an image of the Hindu god Vishnu.<ref name=\"Jagannathan2005p76\"/> Mirror in Vishukani is a symbol of seeing yourself as a part of abundance you see in the form of Kani.  \n\nThe tradition has been that one of the members of the house, typically the mom or elderly person lights up the lamps at dawn, then goes to each member of her family one by one, blindfolds and wakes each one up, walks them to the front of the setting. She then releases the blindfold so one can see the setting, and then greets the Vishu day.<ref name=\"Jagannathan2005p76\"/><ref name=\"Dalal2010p461\"/>\n\n===Vishu Sadhya===\n[[File:Vishu Sadya 2013 135212.jpg|thumb|Vishu Sadhya served in 2013.]]\nThe [[Sadhya]] (feast) is a major part of all Kerala festivals. However, special dishes called Vishu ''Kanji'', Thoran and ''Vishu katta'' are more important on the new year day. The Kanji is made of rice, coconut milk and spices. Vishu katta is a delicacy prepared from freshly harvested rice powder and coconut milk served with jaggery.<ref name=\":3\" /> For Thoran, the side dish, there are also mandatory ingredients. Other important Vishu delicacies include ''Veppampoorasam'' (a bitter preparation of [[neem]]) and ''Mampazhappulissery'' (a sour or ripe [[mango]] soup)<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vishu-delicacies/article302986.ece |title=Vishu delicacies |publisher=The Hindu |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}</ref> Even temple offerings called ''bewu bella'', include a mix of sweet jaggery, bitter neem, and other flavors.<ref name=\"Jagannathan2005p76\"/>\n\nThe mixing of sweet, salty, sour, bitter and astringent flavors for the new year Vishu meal is similar to the ''pacchadi'' food prepared on new year day such as [[Ugadi]] by Hindus in Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the  [[Indian subcontinent]]. These traditional festive recipes, that combine different flavors, are a symbolic reminder that one must expect all flavors of experiences in the coming new year, that no event or episode is wholly sweet or bitter, experiences are transitory and ephemeral, and to make the most from them.<ref name=narayanan18>{{cite journal | last=Narayanan | first=Vasudha | title=Y51K and Still Counting: Some Hindu Views of Time | journal=Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies | publisher=Butler University | volume=12 | issue=1 | year=1999| pages=17\u201318 | doi=10.7825/2164-6279.1205 | url=https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1205&context=jhcs | doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n===Vishu Padakkam===\n[[File:Crackers vishu 2.jpg|thumb|Vishu Padakkam]]\nThe word 'Padakkam' in Malayalam means firecrackers.Firecrackers are burst during Vishu the same way north Indians burst firecrackers during Diwali.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/fyi/story/vishu-2017-april-14-kerala-festival-history-legends-practices-971219-2017-04-13&ved=2ahUKEwi6jJvf_9zoAhWZA3IKHU5rBOUQFjAPegQICRAB&usg=AOvVaw0ZZ_8Po4sW0e306VO5QhEU&ampcf=1|title=Vishu 2017: History, legends, practices and all you need to know|access-date =10 April 2020}}</ref>\n===Vishukonna===\n[[File:konnamaram.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|(''[[Cassia fistula]]''), \u0d15\u0d23\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d4a\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28, Golden Shower Tree]]\nKonna (''[[Cassia fistula]]''), commonly known as golden shower is the flower of the Vishu festival.\n\n===Other customs===\n[[File:Kampithiri.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|A child playing with fireworks on Vishu]]\n[[File:Uruli festive arrangement of flowers, Malayali Hindus in Kerala.jpg|thumb|Flower arrangement in Uruli during Vishu]]\nThe tradition of buying of new clothes for the occasion of Vishu is called '''''Puthukodi '''''or'' Vishukodi.''

It gained currency in this use in English from the work of [[sinologist]] [[Paul Demi\u00e9ville]]. His 1947 work 'Mirror of the Mind' was widely read in the U.S. It inaugurated a series by him on subitism and gradualism.<ref group=web>[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/ChanZenStudies.htm Bernard Faure, ''Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field'']</ref>{{sfn|Stein|1991|p=42}}\n\nThe Chinese term ''tun'', as used in ''tun-[[Wu (awareness)|wu]]'', translated as \"subite,\" sudden,{{sfn|Stein|1991|p=42}} has a broader meaning than \"sudden.\"{{sfn|Stein|1991|p=42}} It is more apt translated as \"in one glance,\" \"uncovered all together,\" or \"together, completely, simultaneously,\" in contrast to \"successively or being uncovered one after the other.\"{{sfn|Stein|1991|p=43}} It means that all aspects of Buddhist practice are realized, or actualized, simultaneously, and not one after another as in a gradual or linear school curriculum. Specifically, the defilements are not erased gradually, by good works, but simultaneously.{{sfn|Stein|1991|p=50, 51; 45}}{{sfn|Gomez|1991|p=71}}{{sfn|Lai|1991|p=175, 177}}{{refn|group=note|Whalen Lai notes two essential theses from [[Tao-Sheng]]: \"doing good incurs no reward\" and \"by sudden enlightenment one becomes a Buddha.\"{{sfn|Lai|1991|p=175}} Compare the famous [[Bodhidharma#Encounter with Emperor Xi\u0101o Y\u01cen \u856d\u884d|meeting of Bodhidharma with Emperor Xi\u0101o Y\u01cen]]:\n{{quote|<poem>\nEmperor Wu: \"How much karmic merit have I earned for ordaining Buddhist monks, building monasteries, having sutras copied, and commissioning Buddha images?\"\nBodhidharma: \"None.

It is important to be aware subitism can also be used in this context.\n\n==''Tun wu'' in Chinese Buddhism==\n\n===Chan===\nThe distinction between sudden and gradual awakening has its roots in Indian Buddhism.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=998}} It was first introduced in China in the beginning of the 5th century CE by [[Tao Sheng]].{{sfn|Lai|1991|p=169}} The term became of central importance in [[Chan Buddhism]], where it is used to denote the doctrinal position that [[enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], the comprehension or realization of the Buddhist teachings, happens simultaneously, and is not the fruit of a gradual accretion or realisation.\n\n====Shenhui====\nIn the 8th century the distinction became part of a struggle for influence at the Chinese court by [[Shenhui]], a student of [[Huineng]]. Hereafter \"sudden enlightenment\" became one of the hallmarks of Chan Buddhism, though the sharp distinction was softened by subsequent generations of practitioners.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}\n\nThis softening is reflected in the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' of [[Huineng]].\n{{quote|While the Patriarch was living in Bao Lin Monastery, the Grand Master Shen Xiu was preaching in Yu Quan Monastery of Jing Nan. At that time the two Schools, that of Hui Neng of the South and Shen Xiu of the North, flourished side by side. As the two Schools were distinguished from each other by the names \"Sudden\" (the South) and \"Gradual\" (the North), the question which sect they should follow baffled certain Buddhist scholars (of that time). (Seeing this), the Patriarch addressed the assembly as follows:<br/>\nSo far as the ''[[Dharma]]'' is concerned, there can be only one School. (If a distinction exists) it exists in the fact that the founder of one school is a northern man, while the other is a southerner. While there is only one ''dharma'', some disciples realize it more quickly than others. The reason why the names 'Sudden' and 'Gradual' are given is that some disciples are superior to others in mental dispositions. So far as the Dharma is concerned, the distinction of 'Sudden' and 'Gradual' does not exist.<ref group=web>[http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/huineng/huineng8.html The Sudden School and the Gradual School. Chapter VIII]</ref>}}\n\n====Rivalry between schools====\nWhile the socalled \"Southern School\" was said to place emphasis on sudden enlightenment, it also marked a shift in doctrinal basis from the ''[[La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra]]'' to the [[prajnaparamita]] tradition, especially the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]''. The La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra, which endorses the [[Buddha-nature]], emphasized purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The ''Diamond Sutra'' emphasizes [[\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101]], which \"must be realized totally or not at all\".{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26\u201328}}\n\nOnce this dichotomy was in place, it defined its own logic and rhetorics, which are also recognizable in the distinction between [[Caodong school|Caodong]] ([[S\u014dt\u014d]]) and [[Linji school|Linji]] ([[Rinzai school|Rinzai]]) schools.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=123}} But it also leads to a \"sometimes bitter and always prolix sectarian controversy between later Ch'an and [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] exegetes\".{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=234}} In the [[Huayan school#Classification of Buddhist teachings|Huayan classification of teachings]], the sudden approach was regarded inferior to the Perfect Teaching of Huayan. [[Guifeng Zongmi]], fifth patriarch of Huayan and Chan master, devised his [[Guifeng Zongmi#The Buddha's Teachings|own classification]] to counter this subordination.{{sfn|Gregory|1993}} To establish the superiority of Chan, [[Jinul]], the most important figure in the formation of [[Korean Seon]], explained the sudden approach as not pointing to mere emptiness, but to ''suchness'' or the [[dharmadhatu]].{{sfn|Buswell|1991|p=240-241}}\n\n====Later re-interpretations====\n[[Guifeng Zongmi]], fifth-generation successor to Shenhui, also softened the edge between sudden and gradual. In his analysis, sudden awakening points to seeing into one's true nature, but is to be followed by a gradual cultivation to attain [[buddhahood]].{{sfn|Gregory|1991}}\n\nThis gradual cultivation is also recognized by [[Dongshan Liangjie]], who described the [[Five Ranks]] of enlightenment]].<ref group=web>[http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/02/tozan-ryokais-verses-on-five-ranks.html The Five Ranks of Tozan]</ref> Other example of depiction of stages on the path are the [[Ten Bulls]], which detail the steps on the Path, [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|The Three Mysterious Gates]] of Linji, and the [[Hakuin Ekaku#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin Ekaku]].{{sfn|Low|2006}} This gradual cultivation is described by Chan Master Sheng Yen as follows:\n{{quote|Ch'an expressions refer to enlightenment as \"seeing your self-nature\". But even this is not enough. After seeing your self-nature, you need to deepen your experience even further and bring it into maturation. You should have enlightenment experience again and again and support them with continuous practice. Even though Ch'an says that at the time of enlightenment, your outlook is the same as of the Buddha, you are not yet a [[Buddhahood|full Buddha]].{{sfn|Yen|2006|p=54}}}}\n\n===Hua-yen===\nIn the [[Huayan school#Classification of Buddhist teachings|Fivefold Classification]] of the [[Huayan school]] and the [[Tiantai#Five Periods and Eight Teachings|Five Periods and Eight Teachings]] of the [[Tiantai|Tiantai-school]] the sudden teaching was given a high place, but still inferior to the Complete or Perfect teachings of these schools.\n\n===Korean Seon===\n[[Jinul|Chinul]], a 12th-century Korean Seon master, followed Zongmi, and also emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full Buddhahood.{{sfn|Buswell|1989|p=21}}\n\nIn contemporary Korean Seon, [[Seongcheol]] has defended the stance of \"sudden insight, sudden cultivation\".

It gained currency in this use in English from the work of [[sinologist]] [[Paul Demi\u00e9ville]]. His 1947 work 'Mirror of the Mind' was widely read in the U.S. It inaugurated a series by him on subitism and gradualism.<ref group=web>[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/ChanZenStudies.htm Bernard Faure, ''Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field'']</ref>{{sfn|Stein|1991|p=42}}\n\nThe Chinese term ''tun'', as used in ''tun-[[Wu (awareness)|wu]]'', translated as \"subite,\" sudden,{{sfn|Stein|1991|p=42}} has a broader meaning than \"sudden.\"{{sfn|Stein|1991|p=42}} It is more apt translated as \"in one glance,\" \"uncovered all together,\" or \"together, completely, simultaneously,\" in contrast to \"successively or being uncovered one after the other.\"{{sfn|Stein|1991|p=43}} It means that all aspects of Buddhist practice are realized, or actualized, simultaneously, and not one after another as in a gradual or linear school curriculum. Specifically, the defilements are not erased gradually, by good works, but simultaneously.{{sfn|Stein|1991|p=50, 51; 45}}{{sfn|Gomez|1991|p=71}}{{sfn|Lai|1991|p=175, 177}}{{refn|group=note|Whalen Lai notes two essential theses from [[Tao-Sheng]]: \"doing good incurs no reward\" and \"by sudden enlightenment one becomes a Buddha.\"{{sfn|Lai|1991|p=175}} Compare the famous [[Bodhidharma#Encounter with Emperor Xi\u0101o Y\u01cen \u856d\u884d|meeting of Bodhidharma with Emperor Xi\u0101o Y\u01cen]]:\n{{quote|<poem>\nEmperor Wu: \"How much karmic merit have I earned for ordaining Buddhist monks, building monasteries, having sutras copied, and commissioning Buddha images?\"\nBodhidharma: \"None.

It is important to be aware subitism can also be used in this context.\n\n==''Tun wu'' in Chinese Buddhism==\n\n===Chan===\nThe distinction between sudden and gradual awakening has its roots inIndian Buddhism.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=998}} It was first introduced in China in the beginning of the 5th century CE by [[Tao Sheng]].{{sfn|Lai|1991|p=169}} The term became of central importance in [[Chan Buddhism]], where it is used to denote the doctrinal position that [[enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], the comprehension or realization of the Buddhist teachings, happens simultaneously, and is not the fruit of a gradual accretion or realisation.\n\n====Shenhui====\nIn the 8th century the distinction became part of a struggle for influence at the Chinese court by [[Shenhui]], a student of [[Huineng]]. Hereafter \"sudden enlightenment\" became one of the hallmarks of Chan Buddhism, though the sharp distinction was softened by subsequent generations of practitioners.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}\n\nThis softening is reflected in the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' of [[Huineng]].\n{{quote|While the Patriarch was living in Bao Lin Monastery, the Grand Master Shen Xiu was preaching in Yu Quan Monastery of Jing Nan. At that time the two Schools, that of Hui Neng of the South and Shen Xiu of the North, flourished side by side. As the two Schools were distinguished from each other by the names \"Sudden\" (the South) and \"Gradual\" (the North), the question which sect they should follow baffled certain Buddhist scholars (of that time). (Seeing this), the Patriarch addressed the assembly as follows:<br/>\nSo far as the ''[[Dharma]]'' is concerned, there can be only one School. (If a distinction exists) it exists in the fact that the founder of one school is a northern man, while the other is a southerner. While there is only one ''dharma'', some disciples realize it more quickly than others. The reason why the names 'Sudden' and 'Gradual' are given is that some disciples are superior to others in mental dispositions. So far as the Dharma is concerned, the distinction of 'Sudden' and 'Gradual' does not exist.<ref group=web>[http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/huineng/huineng8.html The Sudden School and the Gradual School. Chapter VIII]</ref>}}\n\n====Rivalry between schools====\nWhile the socalled \"Southern School\" was said to place emphasis on sudden enlightenment, it also marked a shift in doctrinal basis from the ''[[La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra]]'' to the [[prajnaparamita]] tradition, especially the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]''. The La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra, which endorses the [[Buddha-nature]], emphasized purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The ''Diamond Sutra'' emphasizes [[\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101]], which \"must be realized totally or not at all\".{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26\u201328}}\n\nOnce this dichotomy was in place, it defined its own logic and rhetorics, which are also recognizable in the distinction between [[Caodong school|Caodong]] ([[S\u014dt\u014d]]) and [[Linji school|Linji]] ([[Rinzai school|Rinzai]]) schools.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=123}} But it also leads to a \"sometimes bitter and always prolix sectarian controversy between later Ch'an and [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] exegetes\".{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=234}} In the [[Huayan school#Classification of Buddhist teachings|Huayan classification of teachings]], the sudden approach was regarded inferior to the Perfect Teaching of Huayan. [[Guifeng Zongmi]], fifth patriarch of Huayan and Chan master, devised his [[Guifeng Zongmi#The Buddha's Teachings|own classification]] to counter this subordination.{{sfn|Gregory|1993}} To establish the superiority of Chan, [[Jinul]], the most important figure in the formation of [[Korean Seon]], explained the sudden approach as not pointing to mere emptiness, but to ''suchness'' or the [[dharmadhatu]].{{sfn|Buswell|1991|p=240-241}}\n\n====Later re-interpretations====\n[[Guifeng Zongmi]], fifth-generation successor to Shenhui, also softened the edge between sudden and gradual. In his analysis, sudden awakening points to seeing into one's true nature, but is to be followed by a gradual cultivation to attain [[buddhahood]].{{sfn|Gregory|1991}}\n\nThis gradual cultivation is also recognized by [[Dongshan Liangjie]], who described the [[Five Ranks]] of enlightenment]].<ref group=web>[http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/02/tozan-ryokais-verses-on-five-ranks.html The Five Ranks of Tozan]</ref> Other example of depiction of stages on the path are the [[Ten Bulls]], which detail the steps on the Path, [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|The Three Mysterious Gates]] of Linji, and the [[Hakuin Ekaku#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin Ekaku]].{{sfn|Low|2006}} This gradual cultivation is described by Chan Master Sheng Yen as follows:\n{{quote|Ch'an expressions refer to enlightenment as \"seeing your self-nature\". But even this is not enough. After seeing your self-nature, you need to deepen your experience even further and bring it into maturation. You should have enlightenment experience again and again and support them with continuous practice. Even though Ch'an says that at the time of enlightenment, your outlook is the same as of the Buddha, you are not yet a [[Buddhahood|full Buddha]].{{sfn|Yen|2006|p=54}}}}\n\n===Hua-yen===\nIn the [[Huayan school#Classification of Buddhist teachings|Fivefold Classification]] of the [[Huayan school]] and the [[Tiantai#Five Periods and Eight Teachings|Five Periods and Eight Teachings]] of the [[Tiantai|Tiantai-school]] the sudden teaching was given a high place, but still inferior to the Complete or Perfect teachings of these schools.\n\n===Korean Seon===\n[[Jinul|Chinul]], a 12th-century Korean Seon master, followed Zongmi, and also emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full Buddhahood.{{sfn|Buswell|1989|p=21}}\n\nIn contemporary Korean Seon, [[Seongcheol]] has defended the stance of \"sudden insight, sudden cultivation\".
