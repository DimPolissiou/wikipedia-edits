It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14101911 |title=Amazon FAQ |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.<ref name=\"amazon\" /> Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers |title=Amazon.com Movers and shakers |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public.

Amazon started by focusing on business-to-consumer relationships between itself and its customers and business-to-business relationships between itself and its suppliers and then moved to facilitate customer-to-customer with the Amazon marketplace which acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions. The company lets anyone sell nearly anything using its platform. In addition to an affiliate program that lets anyone post Amazon links and earn a commission on click-through sales, there is now a program which lets those affiliates build entire websites based on Amazon's platform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/amazon2.htm |title=How Amazon Works |accessdate=December 15, 2011|date=January 25, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nSome other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=743056 |title=Help |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmazon also employs the use of [[drop shipping|drop shippers]] or meta sellers. These are members or entities that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time.

In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100503005110/en/2010-Social-Shopping-Study-Reveals-Consumers%E2%80%99-Online |title=2010 Social Shopping Study Reveals Changes in Consumers' Online Shopping Habits and Usage of Customer Reviews |work=the e-tailing group, PowerReviews |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=January 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available\u2014the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Amazon.com |author=Spector, Robert |year=2002 |page=132}}</ref>\n\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by [[public relations]] companies on behalf of their clients<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnatibeacon.com/index.php?/contents/comments/amazon.com_rave_book_reviews_too_good_to_be_true |title=BEACON SPOTLIGHT: Amazon.com rave book reviews \u2013 too good to be true? |work=The Cincinnati Beacon |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004404/http://www.cincinnatibeacon.com/index.php?%2Fcontents%2Fcomments%2Famazon.com_rave_book_reviews_too_good_to_be_true |archivedate=May 2, 2014 }}</ref> and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works.\n\n=== Content search ===\n\"Search Inside the Book\" is a feature which allows customers to search for keywords in the full text of many books in the catalog.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com |title=Amazon's online reader ''Search Inside'' reference |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828044958/http://www.amazon.com/ |archivedate=August 28, 2010 |url-status=live |df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com |title=''Search Inside'' reference |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> The feature started with 120,000 titles (or 33 million pages of text) on October 23, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Ward |url=http://www.urlwire.com/news/102203.html |title=Amazon.com Launches \"Search Inside the Book\" Feature |publisher=Urlwire.com |date=October 23, 2003 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> There are about 300,000 books in the program.

It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14101911 |title=Amazon FAQ |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.<ref name=\"amazon\" /> Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers |title=Amazon.com Movers and shakers |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public.

Amazon started by focusing on business-to-consumer relationships between itself and its customers and business-to-business relationships between itself and its suppliers and then moved to facilitate customer-to-customer with the Amazon marketplace which acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions. The company lets anyone sell nearly anything using its platform. In addition to an affiliate program that lets anyone post Amazon links and earn a commission on click-through sales, there is now a program which lets those affiliates build entire websites based on Amazon's platform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/amazon2.htm |title=How Amazon Works |accessdate=December 15, 2011|date=January 25, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nSome other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=743056 |title=Help |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmazon also employs the use of [[drop shipping|drop shippers]] or meta sellers. These are members or entities that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true. As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in [[University Village, Seattle|University Village]] in Seattle.
