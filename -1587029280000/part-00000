{"title_page": "Natural units", "text_new": "{{short description|Physical units of measurement based only on universal physical constants}}\nIn [[physics]], '''natural units''' are [[physical units]] of [[measurement]] based only on universal [[physical constants]]. For example, the [[elementary charge]] {{math|''e''}} is a natural unit of [[electric charge]], and the [[speed of light]] {{math|''c''}} is a natural unit of [[speed]]. A purely natural [[system of units]] has all of its units defined in this way, and usually such that the numerical values of the selected physical constants in terms of these units are exactly {{math|1}}. These constants are then typically omitted from mathematical expressions of physical laws, and while this has the apparent advantage of simplicity, it may entail a loss of clarity due to the loss of information for [[dimensional analysis]]. It precludes the interpretation of an expression in terms of fundamental physical constants, such as {{mvar|e}} and {{mvar|c}}, unless it is ''known'' which units (in dimensionful units) the expression is supposed to have. In this case, the reinsertion of the correct powers of {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''c''}}, etc., can be uniquely determined.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP5G20ImveU What are natural units?], [[Sabine Hossenfelder]], 2011-11-07.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaN8uM_2_sk Planck Units \u2013 Part 1 of 3], DrPhysicistA, 2012-02-14.</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nNatural units are intended to [[Nondimensionalization| simplify]] particular equations appearing in the laws of physics or to [[Normalizing constant|normalize]] some chosen physical quantities that are properties of universal [[elementary particle]]s and are reasonably believed to be constant. However, there is a choice of which quantities to set to unity in a natural system of units, and quantities which are set to unity in one system may take a different value or even be assumed to vary in another natural unit system.\n\nNatural units are \"natural\" because the origin of their definition comes only from properties of [[nature]] and not from any human construct (e.g. [[luminous intensity]] (cd), [[luminous flux]] (lm), and [[equivalent dose]] (Sv)) nor any quality of earth or universe (e.g. [[standard gravity]], [[standard atmosphere]], and [[Hubble constant]]) nor any quality of a given substance (e.g. [[melting point]] of [[water]], [[density]] of [[water]], and [[specific heat capacity]] of [[water]]). [[Planck units]] are often, without qualification, called \"natural units\", although they constitute only one of several systems of natural units, albeit the best known such system. Planck units (up to a simple multiplier for each unit) might be considered one of the most \"natural\" systems in that the set of units is not based on properties of any prototype object or particle (e.g. [[elementary charge]], [[electron rest mass]], and [[proton rest mass]]) but are solely derived from the properties of [[free space]]. \n\nDimensioned physical constants may be thought of as conversion factors between inconsistent, rather arbitrary \"human-constructed\" units of measure. For example, spatial distance may be measured in terms of the rather arbitrary unit of the meter and time may be measured in terms of the rather arbitrary unit of the second. In [[Special relativity|relativity theory]], no distinction is drawn between space-like distances and time-like distances, and so the speed of light is a conversion factor between the meter and the second. Likewise, the [[Avogadro number]] is a conversion factor between quantities measured in particle number and in [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s (which are in turn defined by the rather arbitrary mass unit of the gram). The universal [[gas constant]] is simply Boltzmann's constant when quantity is measured in moles, and [[Boltzmann's constant]] may be thought of as a conversion factor between energy measured in, say, [[Joule]]s and in [[Kelvin]], and also (controversially) as a conversion factor between [[Entropy|thermodynamic entropy]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]].\n\nAs with other [[systems of units]], the base units of a set of natural units will include definitions and values for [[length]], [[mass]], [[time]], [[temperature]], and [[electric charge]] (in lieu of [[electric current]]). It is possible to disregard temperature as a [[fundamental units|fundamental physical quantity]], since it states the energy per degree of freedom of a particle, which can be expressed in terms of energy (or mass, length, and time). Virtually every system of natural units normalizes [[Boltzmann's constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}} to 1, which can be thought of as simply a way of defining the unit of temperature.\n\nIn [[SI]], electric charge is a separate fundamental dimension of physical quantity, but in natural unit systems charge is expressed in terms of the mechanical units of mass, length, and time, similarly to [[cgs]]. There are two common ways to relate charge to mass, length, and time: In [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]] (also called \"rationalized\"), [[Coulomb's law]] is {{math|1=''F'' = {{sfrac|''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>|4\u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}}, and in [[Gaussian units]] (also called \"non-rationalized\"), Coulomb's law is {{math|1=''F'' = {{sfrac|''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>|''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}}.<ref>Kowalski, Ludwik, 1986, \"[http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML A Short History of the SI Units in Electricity,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429035624/http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML |date=2009-04-29 }}\" ''The Physics Teacher'' 24(2): 97\u201399.

units are most commonly used by ''setting the units to one''. For example, many natural unit systems include the equation {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} in the unit-system definition, where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. If a velocity {{math|''v''}} is half the speed of light, then as {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|''c''|2}}}} and {{math|1=''c'' = 1}}, hence {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}}. The equation {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}} means \"the velocity {{math|''v''}} has the value one-half when measured in Planck units\", or \"the velocity {{math|''v''}} is one-half the Planck unit of velocity\".\n\nThe equation {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} can be plugged in anywhere else. For example, Einstein's equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} can be rewritten in Planck units as {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''}}. This equation means \"The energy of a particle, measured in Planck units of energy, equals the mass of the particle, measured in Planck units of mass.\"\n\n=== Advantages and disadvantages ===\nCompared to [[SI]] or other unit systems, natural units have both advantages and disadvantages:\n\n*'''Simplified equations:''' By setting constants to 1, equations containing those constants appear more compact and in some cases may be simpler to understand. For example, the [[invariant mass|special relativity]] equation {{math|1=''E''<sup>2</sup> = ''p''<sup>2</sup>''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''m''<sup>2</sup>''c''<sup>4</sup>}} appears somewhat complicated, but the natural units version, {{math|1=''E''<sup>2</sup> = ''p''<sup>2</sup> + ''m''<sup>2</sup>}}, appears simpler.\n*'''Physical interpretation:''' Space and time are put on equal footing and are both measured in the same units. Natural unit systems automatically subsume [[dimensional analysis]]. For example, in [[Planck units]], the units are defined by properties of quantum mechanics and gravity. Not coincidentally, the Planck unit of length is approximately the distance at which [[quantum gravity]] effects become important. Likewise, [[atomic units]] are based on the mass and charge of an electron, and not coincidentally the atomic unit of length is the [[Bohr radius]] describing the \"orbit\" of the electron in a [[hydrogen atom]].\n*'''No prototypes:''' A [[Prototype#Metrology|prototype]] is a physical object that defines a unit, such as the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]], a physical cylinder of metal whose mass used to be by definition exactly one [[kilogram]] (as of 2019 one kilogram is instead defined [[2019 redefinition of the SI base units|in terms of fundamental constants]]). A prototype definition always has imperfect reproducibility between different places and between different times, and it is an advantage of natural unit systems that they use no prototypes. (They share this advantage with some ''non-natural'' unit systems, such as [[conventional electrical units]].)\n*'''Less precise measurements:''' [[SI]] units are designed to be used in precision measurements. For example, the [[second]] is defined by an atomic transition frequency in cesium atoms, because this transition frequency can be precisely reproduced with [[atomic clock]] technology. Natural unit systems are generally ''not'' based on quantities that can be precisely reproduced in a lab. Therefore, in order to retain the same degree of precision, the fundamental constants used still have to be measured in a laboratory in terms of physical objects that can be directly observed. If this is not possible, then a quantity expressed in natural units can be less precise than the same quantity expressed in SI units. For example, Planck units use the [[gravitational constant|gravitational constant {{math|''G''}}]], which is measurable in a laboratory only to four significant digits.\n\n==Choosing constants to normalize==\nOut of the many [[physical constant]]s, the designer of a system of natural unit systems must choose a few of these constants to normalize (set equal to 1). It is not possible to normalize just ''any'' set of constants. For example, the mass of a proton and the mass of an electron cannot both be normalized: if the mass of an electron is defined to be 1, then the mass of a proton has to be approximately 1836. In a less trivial example, the [[fine-structure constant]], {{math|''\u03b1'' \u2248 {{sfrac|137}}}}, cannot be set to 1 because it is a dimensionless number defined in terms of other quantities. The fine-structure constant is related to other physical constants through {{math|''\u03b1'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''k''{{sub|e}}''e''{{sup|2}}|''\u0127c''}}}}, where {{math|''k''{{sub|e}}}} is the [[Coulomb constant]], {{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]], {{math|''\u0127''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. Thus, it is impossible to set all of {{math|''k''{{sub|e}}}}, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''\u0127''}}, and {{math|''c''}} to 1; at most three of this set can be normalized to 1.\n\n==Electromagnetism units==\n{{main|Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units|Gaussian units}}\nIn [[SI units]], electric charge is expressed in coulombs, a separate unit which is additional to the \"mechanical\" units (mass, length, time), even though the traditional definition of the ampere refers to some of these other units.\n\nIn order to build natural units in electromagnetism one can use:\n*'''[[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]]''' (classified as a '''rationalized''' system of electromagnetism units).\n*'''[[Gaussian units]]''' (classified as a '''non-rationalized''' system of electromagnetism units).\nOf these, Lorentz\u2013Heaviside is somewhat more common,<ref name=\"GreinerNeise1995\">{{cite book|author1=Walter Greiner|author2=Ludwig Neise|author3=Horst St\u00f6cker|title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12DKsFtFTgYC&pg=PA385|year=1995|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-0-387-94299-5|page=385}}</ref> mainly because [[Maxwell's equations]] are simpler in Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units than they are in Gaussian units.\n\nIn the two unit systems, the Planck unit charge {{math|''q''<sub>P</sub>}} is:\n*{{math|''q''<sub>P</sub> {{=}} {{sqrt|4\u03c0''\u03b1\u0127c''}}}} (Lorentz\u2013Heaviside),\n*{{math|''q''<sub>P</sub> {{=}} {{sqrt|''\u03b1\u0127c''}}}} (Gaussian)\nwhere {{math|''\u0127''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], and {{math|''\u03b1'' \u2248 {{sfrac|137.036}}}} is the [[fine-structure constant]].\n\nIn a natural unit system where {{math|1=[[speed of light|''c'']] = 1}}, Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units can be derived from SI units by setting {{math|1=[[electric constant|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>]] = [[magnetic constant|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>]] = 1}}.

This makes Planck units particularly useful and common in theories of [[quantum gravity]], including [[string theory]].\n\nPlanck units may be considered \"more natural\" even than other natural unit systems discussed below, as Planck units are not based on any arbitrarily chosen prototype object or particle. For example, some other systems use the mass of an electron as a parameter to be normalized. But the electron is just one of 16 known massive [[elementary particle]]s, all with different masses, and there is no compelling reason, within fundamental physics, to emphasize the electron mass over some other elementary particle's mass.\n\nPlanck considered only the units based on the universal constants ''G'', ''\u0127'', ''c'', and ''k''<sub>B</sub> to arrive at natural units for [[length]], [[time]], [[mass]], and [[temperature]].<ref name=\"TOM\">*Tomilin, K.

The Hartree units were first proposed by [[Douglas Hartree]], and are more common than the Rydberg units.\n\nThe units are designed especially to characterize the behavior of an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom. For example, using the Hartree convention, in the [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom, an electron in the ground state has orbital velocity = 1, orbital radius = 1, angular momentum = 1, [[ionization energy]] = {{sfrac|2}}, etc.\n\nThe unit of [[energy]] is called the [[Hartree energy]] in the Hartree system and the [[Rydberg energy]] in the Rydberg system. They differ by a factor of 2. The [[speed of light]] is relatively large in atomic units (137 in Hartree or 274 in Rydberg), which comes from the fact that an electron in hydrogen tends to move much slower than the speed of light. The [[gravitational constant]] is extremely small in atomic units (around 10<sup>\u221245</sup>), which comes from the fact that the gravitational force between two electrons is far weaker than the [[Coulomb force]].

However, there is a choice of which quantities to set to unity in a natural system of units, and quantities which are set to unity in one system may take a different value or even be assumed to vary in another natural unit system.\n\nA unit is \"natural\" if it is defined from properties of [[nature]] and not from any human construct (e.g., the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram|IPK]]), a specific object (e.g., the [[Earth]]) or even an arbitrarily selected substance (e.g., [[water]]). [[Planck units]] are often, without qualification, called \"natural units\", although they constitute only one of several systems of natural units, albeit the best known such system. Planck units (up to a simple multiplier for each unit) might be considered one of the most \"natural\" systems in that the set of units is not based on properties of any prototype object or particle (e.g. [[elementary charge]], [[electron rest mass]]) but are solely derived from the properties of [[free space]]. \n\nDimensioned physical constants may be thought of as conversion factors between inconsistent, rather arbitrary \"human-constructed\" units of measure. For example, spatial distance may be measured in terms of the rather arbitrary unit of the meter and time may be measured in terms of the rather arbitrary unit of the second. In [[Special relativity|relativity theory]], no distinction is drawn between space-like distances and time-like distances, and so the speed of light is a conversion factor between the meter and the second. Likewise, the [[Avogadro constant]] is a conversion factor between quantities measured in particle number and in [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s. The [[molar gas constant]] is simply Boltzmann's constant when the substance quantity is measured in moles, and [[Boltzmann's constant]] may be thought of as a conversion factor between energy measured in, say, [[joule]]s and in [[kelvin]]s, and also (controversially) as a conversion factor between [[Entropy|thermodynamic entropy]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]].\n\nAs with other [[systems of units]], a set of natural units will often include definitions of units for [[length]], [[mass]], [[time]], and [[electric charge]]. It is possible to disregard temperature as a [[fundamental units|fundamental physical quantity]], since it states the energy per degree of freedom of a particle, which can be expressed in terms of energy, which in turn can be expressed in terms of mass, length, and time.\n\nSome systems of units use proxies for the quantities of other systems.  For example, [[SI]] regards electric charge as an independent fundamental physical quantity, whereas the CGS systems [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]] and [[Gaussian units]] each use a different proxy for electric charge (with the proxies confusingly also called \"electric charge\" and given the same symbols as in other systems, despite being different quantities) defined so that [[Coulomb's law]] is becomes {{math|1=''F'' = {{sfrac|''q''<sub>1</sub>\u2032''q''<sub>2</sub>\u2032|4\u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}} and {{math|1=''F'' = {{sfrac|''q''<sub>1</sub>\u2033''q''<sub>2</sub>\u2033|''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}} respectively.  Because these proxies of electric charge can be defined in terms of time, length and mass, the CGS unit systems dispense with a concept of electric charge as an independent quantity.  A natural unit system may be regarded in two different ways; in one the units are defined in terms of natural constants and retained, and in the other all quantities are replaced by proxies in the same way.\n\n==Notation and use==\n\nNatural units are most commonly used by ''setting the units to one'', which corresponds to replacing all quantities with dimensionless proxies as described above. For example, many natural unit systems may be described as setting {{math|1=''c'' = 1}}, where {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. If a velocity {{math|''v''}} is half the speed of light, then as {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|''c''|2}}}} and {{math|1=''c'' = 1}}, hence {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}}. The equation {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}} means \"the velocity {{math|''v''}} has the value one-half when measured in Planck units\", or \"the velocity {{math|''v''}} is one-half the Planck unit of velocity\".\n\nThe equation {{math|1=''c'' = 1}} can be plugged in anywhere else. For example, Einstein's equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} can be rewritten in Planck units as {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''}}. This equation means \"The energy of a particle, measured in Planck units of energy, equals the mass of the particle, measured in Planck units of mass.\"\n\nThis approach, in which the same names and symbols are repurposed for the corresponding proxy quantities leads to inconsistencies if not carefully tracked, and is consequently impractical when comparing units systems.  Consequently, here the approach of retaining the natural units as dimensioned quantities will be followed.\n\n=== Advantages and disadvantages ===\nCompared to [[SI]] or other unit systems, natural units have both advantages and disadvantages:\n\n*'''Simplified equations:''' By setting constants to 1, equations containing those constants appear more compact and in some cases may be simpler to understand. For example, the [[invariant mass|special relativity]] equation {{math|1=''E''<sup>2</sup> = ''p''<sup>2</sup>''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''m''<sup>2</sup>''c''<sup>4</sup>}} in the natural units version becomes {{math|1=''E''<sup>2</sup> = ''p''<sup>2</sup> + ''m''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n*'''Physical interpretation:''' Space and time are put on equal footing and are both measured in the same units. Natural unit systems automatically subsume [[dimensional analysis]]. For example, in [[Planck units]], the units are defined by properties of quantum mechanics and gravity. Not coincidentally, the Planck unit of length is approximately the distance at which [[quantum gravity]] effects dominate. Likewise, [[Hartree atomic units]] are based on the mass and charge of an electron, and not coincidentally the atomic unit of length is the [[Bohr radius]] describing the orbit of the electron in the [[Bohr model]] of the [[hydrogen atom]].\n*'''No prototypes:''' A [[Prototype#Metrology|prototype]] is a physical object that defines a unit, such as the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram]], a physical cylinder of metal whose mass used to be by definition exactly one [[kilogram]] (as of 2019 one kilogram is instead defined [[2019 redefinition of the SI base units|in terms of fundamental constants]]). A prototype-based definition always has imperfect reproducibility between different places and between different times, and it is an advantage of natural unit systems that they use no prototypes. (They share this advantage with some ''non-natural'' unit systems, such as [[conventional electrical units]].)\n*'''Less precise measurements:''' [[SI]] units are designed to be used in precision measurements. For example, the [[second]] is defined by an atomic transition frequency in cesium atoms, because this transition frequency can be precisely reproduced with [[atomic clock]] technology. Natural unit systems are generally ''not'' based on quantities that can be precisely reproduced in a lab. Therefore, in order to retain the same degree of precision, the fundamental constants used still have to be measured in a laboratory in terms of physical objects that can be directly observed. If this is not possible, then a quantity expressed in natural units can be less precise than the same quantity expressed in SI units. For example, Planck units use the [[gravitational constant|gravitational constant {{math|''G''}}]], which is measurable in a laboratory to only four significant digits.\n\n==Choosing constants to normalize==\nOut of the many [[physical constant]]s, only a mutually independent set can be chosen to be normalized (set equal to 1). It is not possible to normalize just ''any'' set of constants. For example, the mass of a proton and the mass of an electron cannot both be normalized: if the mass of an electron is defined to be 1, then the mass of a proton has to be approximately 1836. In a less trivial example, the [[fine-structure constant]], {{math|''\u03b1'' \u2248 {{sfrac|137}}}}, cannot be set to 1 because it is a dimensionless number defined in terms of other quantities. The fine-structure constant is related to other physical constants through {{math|''\u03b1'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''e''{{sup|2}}|4''\u03c0\u03b5''{{sub|0}}''\u0127c''}}}}, where {{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]], {{math|''\u03b5''{{sub|0}}}} is the [[vacuum electric permittivity]], {{math|''\u0127''}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]]. Thus, it is impossible to set all of {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''\u03b5''{{sub|0}}}}, {{math|''\u0127''}}, and {{math|''c''}} to 1; at most three of this set can be normalized to 1.\n\n==Systems of natural units==\n\n===Planck units===\n{{Main|Planck units}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; background-color: #ffffff\"\n!

They only refer to the basic structure of the laws of physics: {{math|''c''}} and {{math|''G''}} are part of the structure of [[spacetime]] in [[general relativity]], and {{math|''\u0127''}} captures the relationship between energy and frequency which is at the foundation of [[quantum mechanics]]. This makes Planck units particularly useful and common in theories of [[quantum gravity]], including [[string theory]].\n\nPlanck units may be considered \"more natural\" even than other natural unit systems discussed below, as Planck units are not based on any arbitrarily chosen prototype object or particle. For example, some other systems use the mass of an electron as a parameter to be normalized. But the electron is just one of 16 known massive [[elementary particle]]s, all with different masses, and there is no compelling reason, within fundamental physics, to emphasize the electron mass over some other elementary particle's mass.\n\nPlanck considered only the units based on the universal constants ''G'', ''h'', ''c'', and ''k''<sub>B</sub> to arrive at natural units for [[length]], [[time]], [[mass]], and [[temperature]], but no electromagnetic units.<ref>However, if it is assumed that at the time the Gaussian definition of electric charge was used and hence not regarded as an independent quantity, the [[Coulomb constant]] {{math|1=''k''{{sub|e}} = {{sfrac|4\u03c0''\u03b5''{{sub|0}}}}}} would be implicitly added to the list of defining constants, this would yield a charge unit {{math|{{radic|''\u0127c''/''k''{{sub|e}}}}}}.</ref>  The Planck system of units is now understood to substitute the reduced Planck constant, ''\u0127'' for ''h''.<ref name=\"TOM\">*Tomilin, K.

The Hartree units were first proposed by [[Douglas Hartree]].  There is a less common, closely related system of Rydberg atomic units.\n\nThe units are designed especially to characterize the behavior of an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom. For example, using the Hartree convention, in the [[Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom an electron in the ground state has orbital velocity = 1, orbital radius = 1, angular momentum = 1, [[ionization energy]] = {{sfrac|2}}, etc.\n\nThe unit of [[energy]] is called the [[Hartree energy]] in the Hartree system. The [[speed of light]] is relatively large in Hartree atomic units ({{sfrac|1|''\u03b1''}} \u2248 137) since an electron in hydrogen tends to move much slower than the speed of light. The [[gravitational constant]] is extremely small in atomic units (around 10<sup>\u221245</sup>), which comes from the fact that the gravitational force between two electrons is far weaker than the [[Coulomb force]].

Like the other systems, the electromagnetism units can be based on either [[Lorentz\u2013Heaviside units]] or [[Gaussian units]]. The unit of charge is different in each.\n\nFinally, one more unit is needed to construct a usable system of units that includes energy and mass. Most commonly, [[electronvolt]] (eV) is used, despite the fact that this is not a \"natural\" unit in the sense discussed above \u2013 it is defined by a natural property, the [[elementary charge]], and the anthropogenic unit of [[electric potential]], the [[volt]]. (The [[SI prefix]]ed multiples of eV are used as well: keV, MeV, GeV, etc.)\n\nWith the addition of eV (or any other auxiliary unit with the proper dimension), any quantity can be expressed.

Following this, Eutelsat issued a press release and written declaration, denying all charges of censorship against NTD.

The colours used are vegetable colours which have endured through time because the drawings were generally made deep inside a niche or on inner walls. The drawings and paintings can be classified under seven different periods.\n\n'''Period I''' \u2013 ([[Upper Paleolithic]]): These are linear representations, in green and dark red, of huge figures of animals such as [[bison]], [[tiger]]s and [[rhinoceros]]es.{{dubious|date=August 2019}}{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n'''Period II''' \u2013 ([[Mesolithic]]): Comparatively small in size the stylised figures in this group show linear decorations on the body.  In addition to animals there are human figures and hunting scenes, giving a clear picture of the weapons they used: barbed [[spear]]s, pointed sticks, [[bow and arrow|bows and arrows]].<ref name=bhim3/><ref name=bhim1/><ref name=bhim2/> Some scenes are interpreted as depicting tribal war between three tribes symbolised by their animal totems.<ref name=\"PeregrineEmber2003p315\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=South Asian Prehistory: A Multidisciplinary study|author=D.

The association is of riders, depiction of religious symbols, tunic-like dresses and the existence of scripts of different periods. The religious beliefs are represented by figures of [[yaksha]]s, tree gods and magical sky chariots.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n'''Period VI & VII''' \u2013 (Medieval): These paintings are geometric linear and more schematic, but they show degeneration and crudeness in their artistic style. The colors used by the cave dwellers were prepared by combining black [[manganese oxide]]s, red [[hematite]] and [[charcoal]].\n\nOne rock, popularly referred to as \"Zoo Rock\", depicts [[elephant]]s, [[barasingha]] (swamp deer), [[bison]] and [[deer]]. Paintings on another rock show a [[peacock]], a [[snake]], a deer and the sun. On another rock, two elephants with tusks are painted. Hunting scenes with hunters carrying bows, [[arrow]]s, [[sword]]s, and shields also find their place in the community of these pre-historic paintings. In one of the caves, a bison is shown in pursuit of a hunter while his two companions appear to stand helplessly nearby; in another, some horsemen are seen, along with archers.

The colours used are vegetable colours which have endured through time because the drawings were generally made deep inside a niche or on inner walls. The drawings and paintings can be classified under seven different periods.\n\n'''Period I''' \u2013 ([[Upper Paleolithic]]): These are linear representations, in green and dark red, of huge figures of animals such as [[bison]], [[tiger]]s and [[rhinoceros]]es.{{dubious|date=August 2019}}{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n'''Period II''' \u2013 ([[Mesolithic]]): Comparatively small in size the stylised figures in this group show linear decorations on the body.

The association is of riders, depiction of religious symbols, tunic-like dresses and the existence of scripts of different periods. The religious beliefs are represented by figures of [[yaksha]]s, tree gods and magical sky chariots.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n'''Period VI & VII''' \u2013 (Medieval): These paintings are geometric linear and more schematic, but they show degeneration and crudeness in their artistic style. The colors used by the cave dwellers were prepared by combining black [[manganese oxide]]s, red [[hematite]] and [[charcoal]].\n\nOne rock, popularly referred to as \"Zoo Rock\", depicts [[elephant]]s, [[barasingha]] (swamp deer), [[bison]] and [[deer]]. Paintings on another rock show a [[peacock]], a [[snake]], a deer and the sun. On another rock, two elephants with tusks are painted. Hunting scenes with hunters carrying bows, [[arrow]]s, [[sword]]s, and shields also find their place in the community of these pre-historic paintings. In one of the caves, a bison is shown in pursuit of a hunter while his two companions appear to stand helplessly nearby; in another, some horsemen are seen, along with archers.
