[[Native American cultures in the United States|Numerous indigenous cultures]] formed, and many disappeared before 1500. The arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the year 1492 started the [[European colonization of the Americas]]. Most colonies were formed after 1600, and the early records and writings of [[John Winthrop]] make the [[United States]] the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of the American people|last=Johnson, Paul, 1928\u2013|date=1999|publisher=HarperPerennial|isbn=0060930349|edition= 1st HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY|pages=32|oclc=40984521|quote=These early diaries and letters, which are plentiful, and the fact that most important documents about the early American colonies have been preserved, mean that the United States is the first nation in human history whose most distant origins are fully recorded.}}</ref> By the 1760s, the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] contained 2.5 million people along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. After [[French and Indian Wars|defeating France]], the British government imposed a series of taxes, including the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], rejecting the colonists' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval. Resistance to these taxes, especially the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773, led to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] issuing [[Intolerable Acts|punitive laws]] designed to end self-government in Massachusetts.\n\nArmed conflict began in 1775. In 1776, in Philadelphia, the [[Second Continental Congress]] [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared the independence]] of the colonies as the United States. Led by General [[George Washington]], it won the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] with large support from France. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty of 1783]] gave the land east of the Mississippi River (except Canada and Florida) to the new nation. The [[Articles of Confederation]] established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|convention]] in 1787 wrote [[Constitution of the United States|a new Constitution]] that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] was added to guarantee [[Natural rights and legal rights|inalienable rights]]. With Washington as the first president and [[Alexander Hamilton]] his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. [[Louisiana Purchase|Purchase]] of the [[Louisiana Territory]] from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States. A second and final war with Britain was [[War of 1812|fought in 1812]], which solidified national pride.\n\nEncouraged by the notion of [[manifest destiny]], U.S. territory expanded [[American frontier|all the way]] to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]]. While the United States was large in terms of area, by 1790 [[Demography of the United States|its population]] was only 4 million. It grew rapidly, however, reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 321 million in 2015. Economic growth in terms of overall [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] was even greater. Compared to European powers, though, the nation's military strength was relatively limited in peacetime before 1940. [[American frontier|Westward expansion]] was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for [[yeoman]] farmers and slave owners. The expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states [[Northern United States|north]] of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] by 1804, but the [[Southern United States|South]] continued to profit from the institution, mostly from the [[Cotton production in the United States|production of cotton]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] was [[1860 United States presidential election|elected president in 1860]] on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery.\n\nSeven Southern slave states rebelled and created the foundation of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Its [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack of Fort Sumter]] against the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union forces]] there in 1861 started the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Defeat of the Confederates in 1865 led to the impoverishment of the South and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolition of slavery]]. In the [[Reconstruction era]] following the war, [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|legal and voting rights were extended]] to [[Freedman|freed slaves]]. The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868, it gained explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained their power in the South in 1877, often by [[paramilitary]] [[Voter suppression in the United States|suppression of voting]], they passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to maintain [[white supremacy]], as well as new [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] that prevented most [[African Americans]] and many [[Poor White|poor whites]] from voting. This continued until the gains of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s and the passage of federal legislation to enforce uniform constitutional rights for all citizens.\n\nThe United States became the world's leading industrial power at the turn of the 20th century, due to an outburst of entrepreneurship and industrialization in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the arrival of [[European emigration|millions of immigrant workers and farmers from Europe]]. A national railroad network was completed and large-scale mines and factories were established. Mass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency, and traditional politics stimulated the [[Progressive Era|Progressive movement]], from the 1890s to 1920s. This era led to many reforms, including the Sixteenth to Nineteenth constitutional amendments, which brought the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], and [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]]. Initially neutral during [[World War I]], the United States [[American entry into World War I|declared war on Germany]] in 1917 and funded the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory the following year. Women obtained the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to vote]] in 1920, with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] obtaining citizenship and the right to vote in 1924.\n\nAfter [[Roaring Twenties|a prosperous decade]] in the 1920s, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Democratic President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ended the Republican dominance of the [[White House]] and implemented his [[New Deal]] programs, which included relief for the unemployed, support for farmers, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]]. The New Deal defined [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the United States entered [[World War II]] and financed the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort and helped defeat [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater]]. Its involvement culminated in using newly-invented [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear weapons on two Japanese cities]] to defeat [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]].\n\nThe United States and the [[Soviet Union]] emerged as rival superpowers in the [[aftermath of World War II]]. During the [[Cold War]], the two countries confronted each other indirectly in the [[arms race]], the [[Space Race]], [[proxy war]]s, and propaganda campaigns. The goal of the United States in this was to stop the spread of [[communism]]. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the [[civil rights movement]], another wave of social reforms was enacted which enforced the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African Americans and other racial minorities. The Cold War ended when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was officially dissolved]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the world's only [[superpower]].\n\nAfter the Cold War, the United States's foreign policy has focused on [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East|modern conflicts in the Middle East]]. The beginning of the 21st century saw the [[September 11 attacks]] carried out by [[Al-Qaeda]] in 2001, which was later followed by wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. In 2007, the United States entered its [[Great Recession in the United States|worst economic crisis since the Great Depression]], which was followed by slower-than-usual rates of economic growth during the early 2010s. Economic growth and unemployment rates recovered by the late 2010s, however new economic disruption began in [[2020]] due to the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Early America==\n{{Main|Prehistory of the United States|History of Native Americans in the United States|Pre-Columbian era}}\n{{See also|Native Americans in the United States}}\n[[File:Peopling of America through Beringia.png|thumb|200px|This map shows the approximate location of the ice-free corridor and specific Paleoindian sites ([[Clovis theory]]).]]\nIt is not definitively known how or when Native Americans first [[Settlement of the Americas|settled the Americas]] and the present-day United States. The prevailing theory proposes that people from [[Eurasia]] followed [[Game (hunting)|game]] across [[Beringia]], a [[land bridge]] that connected [[Siberia]] to present-day [[Alaska]] during the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]], and then spread southward throughout the Americas. This migration may have begun as early as 30,000 years ago<ref>{{cite news |title=New Ideas About Human Migration From Asia To Americas |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071025160653.htm |work=ScienceDaily |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref> and continued through to about 10,000 years ago, when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the melting glaciers.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|Cohen|Bailey|2006|p=6}}</ref> These early inhabitants, called [[Paleo-Indians]], soon diversified into hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes.\n\nThis [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] era incorporates all [[archaeology of the Americas|periods]] in the [[history of the Americas]] before the appearance of European influences on the American continents, spanning from the [[Settlement of the Americas|original settlement]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period to [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] during the [[early modern period]]. While the term technically refers to the era before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage in 1492, in practice the term usually includes the history of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American indigenous cultures]] until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbus's initial landing.\n\n===Paleo-Indians===\n[[File:North American cultural areas.png|thumb|200px|left|The [[Cultural area]]s of [[pre-Columbian North America]], according to [[Alfred Kroeber]].]]\nBy 10,000 BCE, humans were relatively well-established throughout [[North America]]. Originally, Paleo-Indian hunted Ice Age [[megafauna]] like [[mammoth]]s, but as they began to go extinct, people turned instead to [[bison]] as a food source. As time went on, foraging for berries and seeds became an important alternative to hunting. Paleo-Indians in central Mexico were the first in the Americas to farm, starting to plant corn, beans, and squash around 8,000 BCE. Eventually, the knowledge began to spread northward. By 3,000 BCE, corn was being grown in the valleys of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], followed by primitive [[irrigation]] systems and early villages of the [[Hohokam]].<ref name=\":6\"/><ref name=\"mark\">Chenault, Mark, Rick Ahlstrom, and Tom Motsinger, (1993) ''In the Shadow of South Mountain: The Pre-Classic Hohokam of 'La Ciudad de los Hornos{{'}}'', Part I and II.</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest cultures in the present-day United States was the [[Clovis culture]], who are primarily identified by the use of fluted [[spear]] points called the [[Clovis point]]. From 9,100 to 8,850 BCE, the culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The [[Folsom tradition|Folsom culture]] was similar, but is marked by the use of the [[Folsom point]].\n\nA later migration identified by linguists, anthropologists, and archeologists occurred around 8,000 BCE. This included [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]]-speaking peoples, who reached the [[Pacific Northwest]] by 5,000 BCE.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 670070|title = Toward a Prehistory of the Na-Dene, with a General Comment on Population Movements among Nomadic Hunters|journal = American Anthropologist|volume = 71|issue = 5|pages = 857\u2013863|last1 = Dumond|first1 = D.

They are the earliest known people to have been [[Mound Builders|mound builders]], however, there are mounds in the United States that predate this culture. [[Watson Brake]] is an 11-mound complex in [[Louisiana]] that dates to 3,500 BCE, and nearby [[Poverty Point]], built by the [[Poverty Point culture]], is an earthwork complex that dates to 1,700 BCE. These mounds likely served a religious purpose.\n\nThe Adenans were absorbed into the [[Hopewell tradition]], a powerful people who traded tools and goods across a wide territory. They continued the Adena tradition of mound-building, with remnants of several thousand still in existence across the core of their former territory in southern [[Ohio]]. The Hopewell pioneered a trading system called the Hopewell Exchange System, which at its greatest extent ran from the present-day Southeast up to the Canadian side of [[Lake Ontario]].<ref name=\":8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1283|title=Hopewell|publisher=Ohio History Central}}</ref> By 500 CE, the Hopewellians had too disappeared, absorbed into the larger [[Mississippian culture]].\n\nThe Mississippians were a broad group of tribes. Their most important city was [[Cahokia]], near modern-day [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. At its peak in the 12th century, the city had an estimated population of 20,000, larger than the population of London at the time. The entire city was centered around a [[Monks Mound|mound]] that stood {{Convert|100|ft|m|abbr=}} tall. Cahokia, like many other cities and villages of the time, depended on hunting, foraging, trading, and agriculture, and developed a class system with slaves and human sacrifice that was influenced by societies to the south, like the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]].<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nIn the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Anasazi]] began constructing stone and adobe pueblos around 900 BCE.<ref name=\"eb\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22804/Ancestral-Pueblo-culture \"Ancestral Pueblo culture.\"] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.''

Many distinct cultural and political nations developed there, but they all shared certain beliefs traditions, and practices, such as the centrality of [[salmon]] as a resource and spiritual symbol. Permanent villages began to develop in this region as early as 1,000 BCE, and these communities celebrated by the gift-giving feast of the [[potlatch]]. These gatherings were usually organized to commemorate special events such as the raising of a [[Totem pole]] of the celebration of a new chief.\n\nIn present-day [[Upstate New York|upstate]] [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Iroquois]] formed a [[Confederation|confederacy]] of tribal nations in the mid-15th&nbsp;century, consisting of the [[Oneida Indian Nation|Oneida]], [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca people|Seneca]].

It would be twenty years before another attempt.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe early British colonies were established by private groups seeking profit, and were marked by starvation, disease, and Native American attacks. Many immigrants were people seeking religious freedom or escaping political oppression, peasants displaced by the Industrial Revolution, or those simply seeking adventure and opportunity.\n\nIn some areas, Native Americans taught colonists how to plant and harvest the native crops. In others, they attacked the settlers. Virgin forests provided an ample supply of building material and firewood. Natural inlets and harbors lined the coast, providing easy ports for essential trade with Europe. Settlements remained close to the coast due to this as well as Native American resistance and the Appalachian Mountains that were found in the interior.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== The first settlement: Jamestown ====\n[[Image:Squantoteaching.png|thumb|200px|[[Squanto]] known for having been an early liaison between the native populations in Southern New England and the ''Mayflower'' settlers, who made their settlement at the site of Squanto's former summer village.]]\n\nThe first successful English colony, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], was established by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] in 1607 on the [[James River]] in [[Virginia]]. The colonists were preoccupied with the search for gold and were ill-equipped for life in the New World. Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] held the fledgling Jamestown together in the first year, and the colony descended into anarchy and nearly failed when he returned to England two years later. [[John Rolfe]] began experimenting with tobacco from the West Indies in 1612, and by 1614 the first shipment arrived in London. It became Virginia's chief source of revenue within a decade.\n\nIn 1624, after years of disease and Indian attacks, including the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], [[James VI and I|King James I]] revoked the Virginia Company's charter and made Virginia a royal colony.\n\n==== New England ====\n[[File:Thanksgiving-Brownscombe.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jennie Augusta Brownscombe]], ''The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth'', 1914, Pilgrim Hall Museum, Plymouth, Massachusetts]]\n\n[[New England]] was initially settled primarily by [[Puritans]] fleeing religious persecution. The [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] sailed for Virginia on the Mayflower in 1620, but were knocked off course by a storm and landed at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], where they agreed to a social contract of rules in the [[Mayflower Compact]]. Like Jamestown, Plymouth suffered from disease and starvation, but local [[Wampanoag]] Indians taught the colonists how to farm maize.\n\nPlymouth was followed by the [[Puritans]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1630. They maintained a charter for self-government separate from England, and elected founder [[John Winthrop]] as the governor for most of its early years. [[Roger Williams]] opposed Winthrop's treatment of Native Americans and religious intolerance, and established the colony of [[Providence Plantations]], later [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], on the basis of freedom of religion. Other colonists established settlements in the [[Connecticut River]] Valley, and on the coasts of present-day [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]]. Native American attacks continued, with the most significant occurring in the 1637 [[Pequot War]] and the 1675 [[King Philip's War]].\n\nNew England became a center of commerce and industry due to the poor, mountainous soil making agriculture difficult. Rivers were harnessed to power grain mills and sawmills, and the numerous harbors facilitated trade. Tight-knit villages developed around these industrial centers, and [[Boston]] became one of America's most important ports.\n\n==== Middle Colonies ====\n[[File:Indians_at_a_Hudson_Bay_Company_trading_post.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Indians trade 90-lb packs of furs at a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in the 19th century.]]\n\nIn the 1660s, the [[Middle Colonies]] of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[History of Delaware|Delaware]] were established in the former Dutch New Netherland, and were characterized by a large degree of ethnic and religious diversity. At the same time, the [[Iroquois]] of New York, strengthened by years of fur trading with Europeans, formed the powerful Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nThe last colony in this region was [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], established in 1681 by [[William Penn]] as a home for religious dissenters, including [[Quakers]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and the [[Amish]].<ref name=\":9\" /> The capital of colony, [[Philadelphia]], became a dominant commercial center in a few short years, with busy docks and brick houses. While Quakers populated the city, [[German Americans|German]] immigrants began to flood into the Pennsylvanian hills and forests, while the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] pushed into the far western frontier.\n\n==== Southern Colonies ====\nThe extremely rural [[Southern Colonies]] contrasted greatly with the north. Outside of Virginia, the first British colony south of New England was [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], established as a Catholic haven in 1632. The economy of these two colonies was built entirely on [[yeoman]] farmers and planters. The planters established themselves in the [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater]] region of Virginia, establishing massive [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] with slave labor, while the small-scale farmers made their way into political office.\n\nIn 1670, the [[Province of Carolina]] was established, and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] became the region's great trading port. While Virginia's economy was based on tobacco, Carolina was much more diversified, exporting rice, indigo, and lumber as well. In 1712 the colony was split in half, creating [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]]. The [[Province of Georgia|Georgia Colony]]&nbsp;\u2013 the last of the Thirteen Colonies&nbsp;\u2013 was established by [[James Oglethorpe]] in 1732 as a border to Spanish Florida and a reform colony for former prisoners and the poor.<ref name=\":9\">Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\u201d>\n1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|The [[Indian massacre of 1622|Indian massacre of Jamestown settlers]] in 1622.

American [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] affected by the Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted new believers with an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and carried the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic, setting the stage for the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the late 1790s.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref> In the early stages, evangelicals in the South, such as [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]], preached for religious freedom and abolition of slavery; they converted many slaves and recognized some as preachers.\n\n==== Government ====\nEach of the 13 American colonies had a slightly different governmental structure. Typically, a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from London who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected legislature to vote on taxes and make laws. By the 18th century, the American colonies were growing very rapidly as a result of low death rates along with ample supplies of land and food. The colonies were richer than most parts of Britain, and attracted a steady flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who arrived as indentured servants.<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\">{{cite book |author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA185|origyear=1948|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|pages=185\u201390|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>\n\n==== Servitude and slavery ====\nOver half of all European immigrants to Colonial America arrived as [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America|last=Barker|first=Deanna|publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022161033/http://geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|archivedate=October 22, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Few could afford the cost of the journey to America, and so this form of unfree labor provided a means to immigrate. Typically, people would sign a contract agreeing to a set term of labor, usually four to seven years, and in return would receive transport to America and a piece of land at the end of their servitude. In some cases, ships' captains received rewards for the delivery of poor migrants, and so extravagant promises and kidnapping were common. The Virginia Company and the Massachusetts Bay Company also utilized indentured servant labor.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe first [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] were brought to Virginia from the British West Indies in 1619, just twelve years after the founding of Jamestown. Initially regarded as indentured servants who could buy their freedom, the institution of slavery began to harden and the involuntary servitude became lifelong as the demand for labor on tobacco and rice plantations grew in the 1660s. Slavery became identified with brown skin color, at the time seen as a \"[[black race]]\", and the children of slave women were born slaves (''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''). By the 1770s African slaves comprised a fifth of the American population.\n\nThe question of independence from Britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed British military support against the French and Spanish powers. Those threats were gone by 1765. London, however, continued to regard the American colonies as existing for the benefit of the mother country in a policy known as [[mercantilism]].<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\" />\n\nColonial America was defined by a severe labor shortage that utilized forms of [[Unfree labour|unfree labor]], such as [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] and [[indentured servitude]].The British colonies were also marked by a policy of avoiding strict enforcement of parliamentary laws, known as [[salutary neglect]]. This permitted the development of an American spirit distinct from that of its European founders.<ref name=\"history of colonial2\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Henretta|first=James A.|title=History of Colonial America|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_1741502191___0/History_of_Colonial_America.html|encyclopedia=Encarta Online Encyclopedia|year=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923141733/http://encarta.msn.com/text_1741502191___0/History_of_Colonial_America.html|archivedate=September 23, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Road to independence==\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|Map of the [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[New France|French]] settlements in North America in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]]]]\nAn upper-class emerged in South Carolina and Virginia, with wealth based on large plantations operated by slave labor. A unique class system operated in [[upstate New York]], where Dutch tenant farmers rented land from very wealthy Dutch proprietors, such as the [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselaer family]]. The other colonies were more egalitarian, with Pennsylvania being representative. By the mid-18th century Pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited respect for its small upper-class. A writer in the ''Pennsylvania Journal'' in 1756 summed it up:\n<blockquote>The People of this Province are generally of the middling Sort, and at present pretty much upon a Level. They are chiefly industrious Farmers, Artificers or Men in Trade; they enjoy in are fond of Freedom, and the ''meanest among them'' thinks he has a right to Civility from the greatest.<ref>Clinton Rossiter, ''Seedtime of the Republic: the origin of the American tradition of political liberty'' (1953) p 106.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Political integration and autonomy===\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|''[[Join, or Die]]'': This 1756 political cartoon by [[Benjamin Franklin]] urged the colonies to join together during the French and Indian War.]]\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363), part of the larger [[Seven Years' War]], was a watershed event in the political development of the colonies. The influence of the French and Native Americans, the main rivals of the [[The Crown|British Crown]] in the colonies and Canada, was significantly reduced and the territory of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] expanded into [[New France]], both in Canada and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The war effort also resulted in greater political integration of the colonies, as reflected in the [[Albany Congress]] and symbolized by [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s call for the colonies to \"[[Join, or Die]]\". Franklin was a man of many inventions&nbsp;\u2013 one of which was the concept of a United States of America, which emerged after 1765 and would be realized a decade later.<ref>{{cite book |author=H.W.

In the following years, strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the Crown. The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], imposing a tax on the colonies, without going through the colonial legislatures. The issue was drawn: did Parliament have the right to tax Americans who were not represented in it? Crying \"[[No taxation without representation]]\", the colonists refused to pay the taxes as tensions escalated in the late 1760s and early 1770s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Edmund S.

Parliament quickly responded the next year with the [[Intolerable Acts]], stripping Massachusetts of its historic right of self-government and putting it under military rule, which sparked outrage and resistance in all thirteen colonies. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] leaders from every colony convened the [[First Continental Congress]] to coordinate their resistance to the Intolerable Acts. The Congress called for a [[Continental Association|boycott of British trade]], published a [[Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress|list of rights and grievances]], and [[Petition to the King|petitioned the king]] to rectify those grievances.<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert Allison|title=The Boston Tea Party|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6x7Cmio5hoC|year=2007|publisher=Applewood Books|pages=47\u201363|isbn=9781933212111}}</ref> This appeal to the Crown had no effect, though, and so the [[Second Continental Congress]] was convened in 1775 to organize the defense of the colonies against the British Army.\n\nCommon people became insurgents against the British even though they were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered. They held very strongly a sense of \"rights\" that they felt the British were deliberately violating&nbsp;\u2013 rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested by the arrival in Boston of the British Army to punish the Bostonians.

His biggest challenge was logistics,  since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers.\n\nAs a battlefield tactician, Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.<ref name=\"NEH EDSITEMENT\">Lesson Plan on \"What Made George Washington a Good Military Leader?\" [http://edsitement.neh.gov/curriculum-unit/what-made-george-washington-good-military-leader NEH EDSITEMENT]</ref>\n\n=== Loyalists and Britain ===\n[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' (1819)]]\nThe Loyalists, whom the British counted upon too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized.

A compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths of the number of slaves in each state's total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade.\n\nTo assuage the Anti-Federalists who feared a too-powerful national government, the nation adopted the [[United States Bill of Rights]] in 1791. Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution, it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice, jury trials, and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights (which were not specified).<ref>Richard Labunski, ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights'' (2008)</ref>\n\n===President George Washington===\n\n[[File:Stuart-george-washington-constable-1797.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Washington]] legacy remains among the two or three greatest in American history, as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, hero of the Revolution, and the first President of the United States.]]\n[[File:Farewelladdresses 01 various 128kb.ogg|thumb|Reading of the [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell address]] of President George Washington, 1796]]\n\n[[George Washington]]&nbsp;\u2013 a renowned hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]], commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]], and president of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]]&nbsp;\u2013 became the first President of the United States under the new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in 1789.

Inspired by revolutionary ideals of the equality of men and influenced by their lesser economic reliance on slavery, northern states abolished slavery.\n\nStates of the [[Upper South]] made [[manumission]] easier, resulting in an increase in the proportion of [[Free negro|free blacks]] in the Upper South (as a percentage of the total non-white population) from less than one percent in 1792 to more than 10 percent by 1810. By that date, a total of 13.5 percent of all blacks in the United States were free.<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery, 1619\u20131877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 79\u201381</ref> After that date, with the demand for slaves on the rise because of the Deep South's expanding cotton cultivation, the number of manumissions declined sharply; and an internal U.S. slave trade became an important source of wealth for many planters and traders.\n\nIn 1807, Congress severed the US's involvement with the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/congress-abolishes-the-african-slave-trade</ref>\n\n===Louisiana and Republicanism under Jefferson===\n[[File:Thomas-Jefferson.jpg|thumb|200px|Jefferson saw himself as a man of the frontier and a scientist; he was keenly interested in expanding and exploring the West.]]\nJefferson's major achievement as president was the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, which provided U.S. settlers with vast potential for expansion west of the Mississippi River.<ref>Gordon S.

Although the Constitution specified a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], its functions were vague until Marshall, the Chief Justice (1801\u201335), defined them, especially the power to overturn acts of Congress or states that violated the Constitution, first enunciated in 1803 in ''[[Marbury v.

The American high command remained incompetent until the last year. The American militia proved ineffective because the soldiers were reluctant to leave home and efforts to invade Canada repeatedly failed. The British blockade ruined American commerce, bankrupted the Treasury, and further angered New Englanders, who smuggled supplies to Britain.

Americans claimed victory on February 18, 1815 as news came almost simultaneously of Jackson's victory of New Orleans and the [[Treaty of Ghent|peace treaty]] that left the prewar boundaries in place. Americans swelled with pride at success in the \"second war of independence\"; the naysayers of the antiwar Federalist Party were put to shame and the party never recovered.

The former Jeffersonian (Democratic-Republican) party split into factions. They split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Monroe]], and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], became the Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in 1828:\n<blockquote>Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party, and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American politics.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nOpposing factions led by [[Henry Clay]] helped form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery.\n\nBehind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats:\n\n[[File:Clay44b.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Horace Greeley]]'s ''New York Tribune''\u2014the leading Whig paper\u2014endorsed Clay for President and Fillmore for Governor, 1844.]]\n<blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"corrupt bargain\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics.&nbsp;... Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual (the \"common man,\" i.e. the artisan and the ordinary farmer) by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (2007) pp 287\u201388</ref><ref>Robert Allen Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (U. of Missouri Press, 1995) ch 1\u20134</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe great majority of anti-slavery activists, such as Abraham Lincoln and Mr. Walters, rejected [[William_Lloyd_Garrison|Garrison's]] theology and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil, not a sin.<ref>{{cite book |author=James Oakes|title=The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK0ThVhgcbAC&pg=PA57|year=2008|publisher=W.

Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the \"Wild West\" of the second half of the 19th century. As defined by Hine and Faragher, \"frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states\".

San Francisco by 1880 had become the economic hub of the entire Pacific Coast with a diverse population of a quarter million.\n\nFrom the early 1830s to 1869, the [[Oregon Trail]] and its many offshoots were used by over 300,000 settlers.

Much larger numbers in the North were against the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that America would be committed to free land (as in low-cost farms owned and cultivated by a family), free labor, and free speech (as opposed to censorship of abolitionist material in the South). Southern whites insisted that slavery was of economic, social, and cultural benefit to all whites (and even to the slaves themselves), and denounced all anti-slavery spokesmen as \"abolitionists\".<ref>Jeff Forret, ''Slavery in the United States'' (Facts on File, 2012)</ref> Justifications of slavery included economics, history, religion, legality, social good, and even humanitarianism, to further their arguments.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the [[Missouri Compromise]]. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution.\n\n=== Lincoln and secession ===\nAfter [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 presidential election|1860 election]], seven Southern states [[Secession|seceded]] from the union and set up a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]] (Confederacy), on February 8, 1861. It attacked [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. Army fort in South Carolina, thus igniting the war. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the Confederacy in April 1861, four more states seceded and joined the Confederacy. A few of the (northernmost) \"[[slave and free states|slave states]]\" did not secede and became known as the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]; these were Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri.\n\nDuring the war, the northwestern portion of Virginia seceded from the Confederacy. and became the new Union state of [[West Virginia]].<ref>Kenneth Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'' (2008)</ref> West Virginia is usually associated with the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]].\n\n===Civil War===\n{{Main|American Civil War}}\nThe Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when elements of 100,000 [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation]] at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. In response to the attack, on April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union\", which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had their first major clash at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (Battle of Manassas), ending in a Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved to both the Union and Confederacy that the war would be much longer and bloodier than originally anticipated.<ref>Allen C. Guelzo, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=313dh9YAiE4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction]'' (2012) ch 3\u20134</ref>\n\n[[File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Lincoln with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at the [[Battle of Antietam]].]]\nThe war soon divided into two theaters: [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]] and [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western]]. In the western theater, the Union was relatively successful, with major battles, such as [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] along with Union gunboat dominance of navigable rivers producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations.<ref>Stephen E. Woodworth, ''Decision in the Heartland: The Civil War in the West'' (2011)</ref>\n\nWarfare in the Eastern theater began poorly for the Union as the Confederates won at Manassas Junction (Bull Run), just outside Washington. Major General [[George B. McClellan]] was put in charge of the Union armies. After reorganizing the new [[Army of the Potomac]], McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] in his [[Peninsula Campaign]] and [[Seven Days Battle|retreated after attacks]] from newly appointed Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>Bruce Catton, ''The Army of the Potomac: Mr. Lincoln's Army'' (1962)</ref> Meanwhile, both sides concentrated in 1861\u201362 on raising and training new armies.  The main action was Union success in controlling the border states, with Confederates largely driven out of Maryland, West Virginia (a new state), Kentucky and Missouri. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland was designed to hurt Union morale and win European support. It ended with Confederate retreat at the [[Battle of Antietam]], and Lincoln's warning he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 if the states did not return. Making slavery a central war goal Energized Republicans in the North, as well as their enemies, the anti-war Copperhead Democrats. It ended the risk of British and French intervention.\n\nLee's smaller army won at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863, while losing his top aide, [[Stonewall Jackson]]. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause [[war-weariness]] in the North. In perhaps the [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]], Lee's army was badly beaten at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1\u20133, 1863, and barely made it back to Virginia.<ref>On Lee's strategy in 1863 see James M. McPherson, \"To Conquer a Peace?\" ''Civil War Times'' (March/April 2007) 46#2 pp 26\u201333, online at EBSCO\n</ref>  On the homefront,  industrial expansion in the North expanded dramatically, using its extensive railroad service, and moving industrial workers into munitions factories.  Foreign trade increased, with the United States providing both food and cotton to Britain, And Britain sending in manufactured products and thousands of volunteers for the Union Army (plus a few to the Confederates).  The British operated blockade runners bringing in food, luxury items and munitions to the Confederacy, bringing out tobacco and cotton.  The Union blockade increasingly shut down Confederate ports, and by late 1864 the blockade runners were usually captured before they could make more than a handful of runs.\n\n[[File:Gettysburg by Britton.ogg|left|thumb|Modern recording of [[Gettysburg Address]] originally spoken by [[President of the United States|U.S President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n[[File:Kurz and Allison - Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Battle of Franklin]], November 30, 1864.]]\nIn the West, on July 4, 1863, Union forces under the command of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the Mississippi River at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], thereby splitting the Confederacy. Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant put General William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the Western armies.  In 1864, Sherman marched south from Chattanooga to capture Atlanta, a decisive victory that ended war jitters among Republicans in the North who feared they might fail to reelect Lincoln in 1864.  Lincoln won a landslide. The last two years of the war were bloody for both sides, With Sherman marching almost unopposed through central and eastern Georgia, then moving up through South Carolina and North Carolina, burning cities, destroying plantations, ruining railroads and bridges, but avoiding civilian casualties.  Sherman demonstrated that the South lacked the long-term ability to resist a northern invasion.  Much of the heartland of the Confederacy was physically destroyed, and could no longer provide desperately needed food, horses, mules, wagons, boots or munitions to its combat armies.  In spring 1864 Grant, realizing that Lee was unable to replenish casualties, while Lincoln would provide replacements for Union losses,  launched a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns. The first of these, the [[Overland Campaign]] forced Lee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive, the [[Richmond-Petersburg Campaign]] in which he [[Siege of Petersburg|besieged Petersburg]]. After a near ten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the [[Third Battle of Petersburg|defense of Fort Gregg]] allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant pursued and launched the final, [[Appomattox Campaign]] which resulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia numbering 28,000 on April 9, 1865, at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]]. Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended with no postwar insurgency.\n\nThe American Civil War was the world's earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial war]]. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in [[World War I]]. It remains the deadliest war in American history, resulting in the deaths of about 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of [[civilian casualties]].<ref>A new way of calculating casualties by looking at the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm through analysis of census data found that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000 people, but most likely 761,000 people, died through the war.

It broke down barriers of parochialism; it ended distrust of large-scale effort; it hardened and matured the whole people emotionally.  The adolescent land of the 1850s\u2026rose under the blows of battle to adult estate.  The nation of the post-Appomattox generation, though sadly hurt (especially in the South) by war losses, and deeply scarred psychologically (especially in the North) by war hatreds and greeds, had at last the power, resolution, and self-trust of manhood.<ref>Allan Nevins, \"Introduction\" in Paul Gates, ''Agriculture and the Civil War'' (1965) p. v.</ref>\n\n===Emancipation===\n{{See also|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}\n[[File:The Emancipation Proclamation - read by Winston Tharp for LibriVox's Short Nonfiction Collection Vol. 028 (2013).ogg|alt=Emancipation Proclamation |left|thumb|Modern reading of President [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863 giving freedom to all [[African Americans]] who resided within the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] but not those within the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].]]\nThe [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was an executive order issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves.<ref>Allen C.

President [[Andrew Johnson]], who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless in the face of the Radical Republican Congress; he was impeached, but the Senate's attempt to remove him from office failed by one vote. Congress enfranchised black men and temporarily stripped many ex-Confederate leaders of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen made up of [[Carpetbaggers]] (new arrivals from the North), and [[Scalawags]] (native white Southerners). They were backed by the U.S. Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites.<ref name=\"George C. Rable 2007\">George C.

In response to Radical Reconstruction, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) emerged in 1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]] of 1870 shut down the Klan, and it disbanded. [[Paramilitary]]  groups, such as the [[White League]] and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] emerged about 1874 that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting to regain white political power in states across the South during the 1870s.

In every major city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change. Leading politicians from both parties, most notably [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and [[Robert M.

The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]]. By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights,<ref>Rebecca J.

Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting.

Roosevelt]] promised \"a [[New Deal]] for the American people\", coining the enduring label for his domestic policies. The result was a series of permanent reform programs including Relief for the unemployed, assistance for the elderly, jobs for young men, social security, unemployment insurance, public housing, bankruptcy insurance, farm subsidies, and regulation of financial securities. State governments added new programs as well, and introduced the sales tax to pay for them. Ideologically the revolution established [[modern liberalism in the United States]] and kept the Democrats in power in Washington almost continuously for Three decades thanks to the [[New Deal Coalition]] of ethnic Whites, Blacks, blue-collar workers, labor unions, and white Southerners.  It provided relief to the long-term unemployed through numerous programs, such as the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) and for young men, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Large scale spending projects designed to provide private sector construction jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the [[Public Works Administration]]. The Second New Deal was a turn to the left in 1935\u201336, building up labor unions through the [[Wagner Act]]. Unions became a powerful element of the merging [[New Deal Coalition]], which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, relief recipients, big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups (especially Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North (where they could vote). Roosevelt seriously weakened his second term by a failed effort to pack the Supreme Court, which had been a center of conservative resistance to his programs. Most of the relief programs were dropped after 1938 in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the [[Conservative Coalition]]. Of special importance is the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security program]], begun in 1935. The economy basically recovered by 1936, but had a sharp, short recession in 1937\u201338; long-term unemployment, however, remained a problem until it was solved by wartime spending.<ref>David M.

[[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] militarized and threatened conquests, while Britain and France attempted [[appeasement]] to avert another war in Europe. U.S. legislation in the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] sought to avoid foreign conflicts; however, policy clashed with increasing anti-Nazi feelings following the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 that started World War II. Roosevelt positioned the U.S. as the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\", pledging full-scale financial and munitions support for the Allies&nbsp;\u2013 but no military personnel.<ref>Conrad Black, ''Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom'' (2003) pp 648\u201382</ref> This was carried out through the [[Lend-Lease]] agreements.

Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high-efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked.\n\n[[File:Roosevelt Pearl Harbor.ogg|thumb|left|alt=Infamy speech|President Roosevelt's [[Infamy Speech]] in aftermath of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Attack]].

[[Native American cultures in the United States|Numerous indigenous cultures]] formed, and many disappeared before 1500. The arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the year 1492 started the [[European colonization of the Americas]]. Most colonies were formed after 1600, and the early records and writings of [[John Winthrop]] make the [[United States]] the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of the American people|last=Johnson, Paul, 1928\u2013|date=1999|publisher=HarperPerennial|isbn=0060930349|edition= 1st HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY|pages=32|oclc=40984521|quote=These early diaries and letters, which are plentiful, and the fact that most important documents about the early American colonies have been preserved, mean that the United States is the first nation in human history whose most distant origins are fully recorded.}}</ref> By the 1760s, the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] contained 2.5 million people along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. After [[French and Indian Wars|defeating France]], the British government imposed a series of taxes, including the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], rejecting the colonists' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval. Resistance to these taxes, especially the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773, led to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] issuing [[Intolerable Acts|punitive laws]] designed to end self-government in Massachusetts.\n\nArmed conflict began in 1775. In 1776, in Philadelphia, the [[Second Continental Congress]] [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared the independence]] of the colonies as the United States. Led by General [[George Washington]], it won the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] with large support from France. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty of 1783]] gave the land east of the Mississippi River (except Canada and Florida) to the new nation. The [[Articles of Confederation]] established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|convention]] in 1787 wrote [[Constitution of the United States|a new Constitution]] that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] was added to guarantee [[Natural rights and legal rights|inalienable rights]]. With Washington as the first president and [[Alexander Hamilton]] his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. [[Louisiana Purchase|Purchase]] of the [[Louisiana Territory]] from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States. A second and final war with Britain was [[War of 1812|fought in 1812]], which solidified national pride.\n\nEncouraged by the notion of [[manifest destiny]], U.S. territory expanded [[American frontier|all the way]] to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]]. While the United States was large in terms of area, by 1790 [[Demography of the United States|its population]] was only 4 million. It grew rapidly, however, reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 321 million in 2015. Economic growth in terms of overall [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] was even greater. Compared to European powers, though, the nation's military strength was relatively limited in peacetime before 1940. [[American frontier|Westward expansion]] was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for [[yeoman]] farmers and slave owners. The expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states [[Northern United States|north]] of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] by 1804, but the [[Southern United States|South]] continued to profit from the institution, mostly from the [[Cotton production in the United States|production of cotton]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] was [[1860 United States presidential election|elected president in 1860]] on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery.\n\nSeven Southern slave states rebelled and created the foundation of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Its [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack of Fort Sumter]] against the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union forces]] there in 1861 started the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Defeat of the Confederates in 1865 led to the impoverishment of the South and the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolition of slavery]]. In the [[Reconstruction era]] following the war, [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|legal and voting rights were extended]] to [[Freedman|freed slaves]]. The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868, it gained explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained their power in the South in 1877, often by [[paramilitary]] [[Voter suppression in the United States|suppression of voting]], they passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to maintain [[white supremacy]], as well as new [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] that prevented most [[African Americans]] and many [[Poor White|poor whites]] from voting. This continued until the gains of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s and the passage of federal legislation to enforce uniform constitutional rights for all citizens.\n\nThe United States became the world's leading industrial power at the turn of the 20th century, due to an outburst of entrepreneurship and industrialization in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the arrival of [[European emigration|millions of immigrant workers and farmers from Europe]]. A national railroad network was completed and large-scale mines and factories were established. Mass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency, and traditional politics stimulated the [[Progressive Era|Progressive movement]], from the 1890s to 1920s. This era led to many reforms, including the Sixteenth to Nineteenth constitutional amendments, which brought the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], and [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]]. Initially neutral during [[World War I]], the United States [[American entry into World War I|declared war on Germany]] in 1917 and funded the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory the following year. Women obtained the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to vote]] in 1920, with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] obtaining citizenship and the right to vote in 1924.\n\nAfter [[Roaring Twenties|a prosperous decade]] in the 1920s, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. Democratic President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ended the Republican dominance of the [[White House]] and implemented his [[New Deal]] programs, which included relief for the unemployed, support for farmers, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]]. The New Deal defined [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the United States entered [[World War II]] and financed the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort and helped defeat [[Nazi Germany]] in the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater]]. Its involvement culminated in using newly-invented [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear weapons on two Japanese cities]] to defeat [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]].\n\nThe United States and the [[Soviet Union]] emerged as rival superpowers in the [[aftermath of World War II]]. During the [[Cold War]], the two countries confronted each other indirectly in the [[arms race]], the [[Space Race]], [[proxy war]]s, and propaganda campaigns. The goal of the United States in this was to stop the spread of [[communism]]. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the [[civil rights movement]], another wave of social reforms was enacted which enforced the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African Americans and other racial minorities. The Cold War ended when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was officially dissolved]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the world's only [[superpower]].\n\nAfter the Cold War, the United States's foreign policy has focused on [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East|modern conflicts in the Middle East]]. The beginning of the 21st century saw the [[September 11 attacks]] carried out by [[Al-Qaeda]] in 2001, which was later followed by wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. In 2007, the United States entered its [[Great Recession in the United States|worst economic crisis since the Great Depression]], which was followed by slower-than-usual rates of economic growth during the early 2010s. Economic growth and unemployment rates recovered by the late 2010s, however new economic disruption began in [[2020]] due to the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Early America==\n{{Main|Prehistory of the United States|History of Native Americans in the United States|Pre-Columbian era}}\n{{See also|Native Americans in the United States}}\n[[File:Peopling of America through Beringia.png|thumb|200px|This map shows the approximate location of the ice-free corridor and specific Paleoindian sites ([[Clovis theory]]).]]\nIt is not definitively known how or when Native Americans first [[Settlement of the Americas|settled the Americas]] and the present-day United States. The prevailing theory proposes that people from [[Eurasia]] followed [[Game (hunting)|game]] across [[Beringia]], a [[land bridge]] that connected [[Siberia]] to present-day [[Alaska]] during the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]], and then spread southward throughout the Americas. This migration may have begun as early as 30,000 years ago<ref>{{cite news |title=New Ideas About Human Migration From Asia To Americas |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071025160653.htm |work=ScienceDaily |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref> and continued through to about 10,000 years ago, when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the melting glaciers.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|Cohen|Bailey|2006|p=6}}</ref> These early inhabitants, called [[Paleo-Indians]], soon diversified into hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes.\n\nThis [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] era incorporates all [[archaeology of the Americas|periods]] in the [[history of the Americas]] before the appearance of European influences on the American continents, spanning from the [[Settlement of the Americas|original settlement]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period to [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] during the [[early modern period]]. While the term technically refers to the era before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage in 1492, in practice the term usually includes the history of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American indigenous cultures]] until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbus's initial landing.\n\n===Paleo-Indians===\n[[File:North American cultural areas.png|thumb|200px|left|The [[Cultural area]]s of [[pre-Columbian North America]], according to [[Alfred Kroeber]].]]\nBy 10,000 BCE, humans were relatively well-established throughout [[North America]]. Originally, Paleo-Indian hunted Ice Age [[megafauna]] like [[mammoth]]s, but as they began to go extinct, people turned instead to [[bison]] as a food source. As time went on, foraging for berries and seeds became an important alternative to hunting. Paleo-Indians in central Mexico were the first in the Americas to farm, starting to plant corn, beans, and squash around 8,000 BCE. Eventually, the knowledge began to spread northward. By 3,000 BCE, corn was being grown in the valleys of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], followed by primitive [[irrigation]] systems and early villages of the [[Hohokam]].<ref name=\":6\"/><ref name=\"mark\">Chenault, Mark, Rick Ahlstrom, and Tom Motsinger, (1993) ''In the Shadow of South Mountain: The Pre-Classic Hohokam of 'La Ciudad de los Hornos{{'}}'', Part I and II.</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest cultures in the present-day United States was the [[Clovis culture]], who are primarily identified by the use of fluted [[spear]] points called the [[Clovis point]]. From 9,100 to 8,850 BCE, the culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The [[Folsom tradition|Folsom culture]] was similar, but is marked by the use of the [[Folsom point]].\n\nA later migration identified by linguists, anthropologists, and archeologists occurred around 8,000 BCE. This included [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]]-speaking peoples, who reached the [[Pacific Northwest]] by 5,000 BCE.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 670070|title = Toward a Prehistory of the Na-Dene, with a General Comment on Population Movements among Nomadic Hunters|journal = American Anthropologist|volume = 71|issue = 5|pages = 857\u2013863|last1 = Dumond|first1 = D.

They are the earliest known people to have been [[Mound Builders|mound builders]], however, there are mounds in the United States that predate this culture. [[Watson Brake]] is an 11-mound complex in [[Louisiana]] that dates to 3,500 BCE, and nearby [[Poverty Point]], built by the [[Poverty Point culture]], is an earthwork complex that dates to 1,700 BCE. These mounds likely served a religious purpose.\n\nThe Adenans were absorbed into the [[Hopewell tradition]], a powerful people who traded tools and goods across a wide territory. They continued the Adena tradition of mound-building, with remnants of several thousand still in existence across the core of their former territory in southern [[Ohio]]. The Hopewell pioneered a trading system called the Hopewell Exchange System, which at its greatest extent ran from the present-day Southeast up to the Canadian side of [[Lake Ontario]].<ref name=\":8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1283|title=Hopewell|publisher=Ohio History Central}}</ref> By 500 CE, the Hopewellians had too disappeared, absorbed into the larger [[Mississippian culture]].\n\nThe Mississippians were a broad group of tribes. Their most important city was [[Cahokia]], near modern-day [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. At its peak in the 12th century, the city had an estimated population of 20,000, larger than the population of London at the time. The entire city was centered around a [[Monks Mound|mound]] that stood {{Convert|100|ft|m|abbr=}} tall. Cahokia, like many other cities and villages of the time, depended on hunting, foraging, trading, and agriculture, and developed a class system with slaves and human sacrifice that was influenced by societies to the south, like the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]].<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nIn the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Anasazi]] began constructing stone and adobe pueblos around 900 BCE.<ref name=\"eb\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22804/Ancestral-Pueblo-culture \"Ancestral Pueblo culture.\"] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.''

Many distinct cultural and political nations developed there, but they all shared certain beliefs traditions, and practices, such as the centrality of [[salmon]] as a resource and spiritual symbol. Permanent villages began to develop in this region as early as 1,000 BCE, and these communities celebrated by the gift-giving feast of the [[potlatch]]. These gatherings were usually organized to commemorate special events such as the raising of a [[Totem pole]] of the celebration of a new chief.\n\nIn present-day [[Upstate New York|upstate]] [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Iroquois]] formed a [[Confederation|confederacy]] of tribal nations in the mid-15th&nbsp;century, consisting of the [[Oneida Indian Nation|Oneida]], [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca people|Seneca]].

Notable Americans of Dutch descent include [[Martin Van Buren]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and the [[Frelinghuysen family|Frelinghuysens]].<ref name=\"questia.com\"/>\n\n==== French and Spanish conflict ====\n[[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] landed in North Carolina in 1524, and was the first European to sail into [[New York Harbor]] and [[Narragansett Bay]]. A decade later, [[Jacques Cartier]] sailed in search of the Northwest Passage, but instead discovered the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and laid the foundation for [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonization]] of the Americas in [[New France]]. After the collapse of the first [[Charlesbourg-Royal|Quebec]] colony in the 1540s, French [[Huguenots]] settled at [[Fort Caroline]] near present-day [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] in Florida. In 1565, Spanish forces led by [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s|Pedro Men\u00e9ndez]] destroyed the settlement and established the first European settlement in what would become the United States \u2014 [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].\n\nAfter this, the French mostly remained in [[Quebec]] and [[Acadia]], but far-reaching trade relationships with Native Americans throughout the Great Lakes and Midwest spread their influence. French colonists in small villages along the Mississippi and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] rivers lived in farming communities that served as a grain source for Gulf Coast settlements. The French established plantations in Louisiana along with settling [[New Orleans]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]].\n\n=== British colonies ===\n{{Further|British colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Descriptionofnewengland 2 smith 64kb.ogg|thumb|Excerpt of a ''Description of New England'' by English explorer [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]], published in 1616.]]\n\n[[File:MayflowerHarbor.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The ''[[Mayflower]]'', which transported [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] to the New World.

The first British colony in North America was established at [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] by [[Walter Raleigh]] in 1585, but failed. It would be twenty years before another attempt.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe early British colonies were established by private groups seeking profit, and were marked by starvation, disease, and Native American attacks. Many immigrants were people seeking religious freedom or escaping political oppression, peasants displaced by the Industrial Revolution, or those simply seeking adventure and opportunity.\n\nIn some areas, Native Americans taught colonists how to plant and harvest the native crops. In others, they attacked the settlers. Virgin forests provided an ample supply of building material and firewood. Natural inlets and harbors lined the coast, providing easy ports for essential trade with Europe. Settlements remained close to the coast due to this as well as Native American resistance and the Appalachian Mountains that were found in the interior.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== The first settlement: Jamestown ====\n[[Image:Squantoteaching.png|thumb|200px|[[Squanto]] known for having been an early liaison between the native populations in Southern New England and the ''Mayflower'' settlers, who made their settlement at the site of Squanto's former summer village.]]\n\nThe first successful English colony, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], was established by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] in 1607 on the [[James River]] in [[Virginia]]. The colonists were preoccupied with the search for gold and were ill-equipped for life in the New World. Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] held the fledgling Jamestown together in the first year, and the colony descended into anarchy and nearly failed when he returned to England two years later. [[John Rolfe]] began experimenting with tobacco from the West Indies in 1612, and by 1614 the first shipment arrived in London. It became Virginia's chief source of revenue within a decade.\n\nIn 1624, after years of disease and Indian attacks, including the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], [[James VI and I|King James I]] revoked the Virginia Company's charter and made Virginia a royal colony.\n\n==== New England ====\n[[File:Thanksgiving-Brownscombe.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jennie Augusta Brownscombe]], ''The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth'', 1914, Pilgrim Hall Museum, Plymouth, Massachusetts]]\n\n[[New England]] was initially settled primarily by [[Puritans]] fleeing religious persecution. The [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] sailed for Virginia on the Mayflower in 1620, but were knocked off course by a storm and landed at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], where they agreed to a social contract of rules in the [[Mayflower Compact]]. Like Jamestown, Plymouth suffered from disease and starvation, but local [[Wampanoag]] Indians taught the colonists how to farm maize.\n\nPlymouth was followed by the [[Puritans]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1630. They maintained a charter for self-government separate from England, and elected founder [[John Winthrop]] as the governor for most of its early years. [[Roger Williams]] opposed Winthrop's treatment of Native Americans and religious intolerance, and established the colony of [[Providence Plantations]], later [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], on the basis of freedom of religion. Other colonists established settlements in the [[Connecticut River]] Valley, and on the coasts of present-day [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]]. Native American attacks continued, with the most significant occurring in the 1637 [[Pequot War]] and the 1675 [[King Philip's War]].\n\nNew England became a center of commerce and industry due to the poor, mountainous soil making agriculture difficult. Rivers were harnessed to power grain mills and sawmills, and the numerous harbors facilitated trade. Tight-knit villages developed around these industrial centers, and [[Boston]] became one of America's most important ports.\n\n==== Middle Colonies ====\n[[File:Indians_at_a_Hudson_Bay_Company_trading_post.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Indians trade 90-lb packs of furs at a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in the 19th century.]]\n\nIn the 1660s, the [[Middle Colonies]] of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[History of Delaware|Delaware]] were established in the former Dutch New Netherland, and were characterized by a large degree of ethnic and religious diversity. At the same time, the [[Iroquois]] of New York, strengthened by years of fur trading with Europeans, formed the powerful Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nThe last colony in this region was [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], established in 1681 by [[William Penn]] as a home for religious dissenters, including [[Quakers]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and the [[Amish]].<ref name=\":9\" /> The capital of colony, [[Philadelphia]], became a dominant commercial center in a few short years, with busy docks and brick houses. While Quakers populated the city, [[German Americans|German]] immigrants began to flood into the Pennsylvanian hills and forests, while the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] pushed into the far western frontier.\n\n==== Southern Colonies ====\nThe extremely rural [[Southern Colonies]] contrasted greatly with the north. Outside of Virginia, the first British colony south of New England was [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], established as a Catholic haven in 1632. The economy of these two colonies was built entirely on [[yeoman]] farmers and planters. The planters established themselves in the [[Tidewater (region)|Tidewater]] region of Virginia, establishing massive [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] with slave labor, while the small-scale farmers made their way into political office.\n\nIn 1670, the [[Province of Carolina]] was established, and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] became the region's great trading port. While Virginia's economy was based on tobacco, Carolina was much more diversified, exporting rice, indigo, and lumber as well. In 1712 the colony was split in half, creating [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]]. The [[Province of Georgia|Georgia Colony]]&nbsp;\u2013 the last of the Thirteen Colonies&nbsp;\u2013 was established by [[James Oglethorpe]] in 1732 as a border to Spanish Florida and a reform colony for former prisoners and the poor.<ref name=\":9\">Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\u201d>\n1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|The [[Indian massacre of 1622|Indian massacre of Jamestown settlers]] in 1622.

American [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] affected by the Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted new believers with an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and carried the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic, setting the stage for the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the late 1790s.<ref>Thomas S. Kidd, ''The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America'' (2009)</ref> In the early stages, evangelicals in the South, such as [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]], preached for religious freedom and abolition of slavery; they converted many slaves and recognized some as preachers.\n\n==== Government ====\nEach of the 13 American colonies had a slightly different governmental structure. Typically, a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from London who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected legislature to vote on taxes and make laws. By the 18th century, the American colonies were growing very rapidly as a result of low death rates along with ample supplies of land and food. The colonies were richer than most parts of Britain, and attracted a steady flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who arrived as indentured servants.<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\">{{cite book |author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA185|origyear=1948|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|pages=185\u201390|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>\n\n==== Servitude and slavery ====\nOver half of all European immigrants to Colonial America arrived as [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|title=Indentured Servitude in Colonial America|last=Barker|first=Deanna|publisher=National Association for Interpretation, Cultural Interpretation and Living History Section|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022161033/http://geocities.com/nai_cilh/servitude.html|archivedate=October 22, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Few could afford the cost of the journey to America, and so this form of unfree labor provided a means to immigrate. Typically, people would sign a contract agreeing to a set term of labor, usually four to seven years, and in return would receive transport to America and a piece of land at the end of their servitude. In some cases, ships' captains received rewards for the delivery of poor migrants, and so extravagant promises and kidnapping were common. The Virginia Company and the Massachusetts Bay Company also utilized indentured servant labor.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe first [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] were brought to Virginia from the British West Indies in 1619, just twelve years after the founding of Jamestown. Initially regarded as indentured servants who could buy their freedom, the institution of slavery began to harden and the involuntary servitude became lifelong as the demand for labor on tobacco and rice plantations grew in the 1660s. Slavery became identified with brown skin color, at the time seen as a \"[[black race]]\", and the children of slave women were born slaves (''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''). By the 1770s African slaves comprised a fifth of the American population.\n\nThe question of independence from Britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed British military support against the French and Spanish powers. Those threats were gone by 1765. London, however, continued to regard the American colonies as existing for the benefit of the mother country in a policy known as [[mercantilism]].<ref name=\"Max Savelle 2005 185\u201390\" />\n\nColonial America was defined by a severe labor shortage that utilized forms of [[Unfree labour|unfree labor]], such as [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] and [[indentured servitude]].The British colonies were also marked by a policy of avoiding strict enforcement of parliamentary laws, known as [[salutary neglect]]. This permitted the development of an American spirit distinct from that of its European founders.<ref name=\"history of colonial2\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Henretta|first=James A.|title=History of Colonial America|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_1741502191___0/History_of_Colonial_America.html|encyclopedia=Encarta Online Encyclopedia|year=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923141733/http://encarta.msn.com/text_1741502191___0/History_of_Colonial_America.html|archivedate=September 23, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Road to independence==\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|Map of the [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[New France|French]] settlements in North America in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]]]]\nAn upper-class emerged in South Carolina and Virginia, with wealth based on large plantations operated by slave labor. A unique class system operated in [[upstate New York]], where Dutch tenant farmers rented land from very wealthy Dutch proprietors, such as the [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselaer family]]. The other colonies were more egalitarian, with Pennsylvania being representative. By the mid-18th century Pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited respect for its small upper-class. A writer in the ''Pennsylvania Journal'' in 1756 summed it up:\n<blockquote>The People of this Province are generally of the middling Sort, and at present pretty much upon a Level. They are chiefly industrious Farmers, Artificers or Men in Trade; they enjoy in are fond of Freedom, and the ''meanest among them'' thinks he has a right to Civility from the greatest.<ref>Clinton Rossiter, ''Seedtime of the Republic: the origin of the American tradition of political liberty'' (1953) p 106.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Political integration and autonomy===\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|''[[Join, or Die]]'': This 1756 political cartoon by [[Benjamin Franklin]] urged the colonies to join together during the French and Indian War.]]\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363), part of the larger [[Seven Years' War]], was a watershed event in the political development of the colonies. The influence of the French and Native Americans, the main rivals of the [[The Crown|British Crown]] in the colonies and Canada, was significantly reduced and the territory of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] expanded into [[New France]], both in Canada and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The war effort also resulted in greater political integration of the colonies, as reflected in the [[Albany Congress]] and symbolized by [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s call for the colonies to \"[[Join, or Die]]\". Franklin was a man of many inventions&nbsp;\u2013 one of which was the concept of a United States of America, which emerged after 1765 and would be realized a decade later.<ref>{{cite book |author=H.W.

In the following years, strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the Crown. The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]], imposing a tax on the colonies, without going through the colonial legislatures. The issue was drawn: did Parliament have the right to tax Americans who were not represented in it? Crying \"[[No taxation without representation]]\", the colonists refused to pay the taxes as tensions escalated in the late 1760s and early 1770s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Edmund S.

Parliament quickly responded the next year with the [[Intolerable Acts]], stripping Massachusetts of its historic right of self-government and putting it under military rule, which sparked outrage and resistance in all thirteen colonies. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] leaders from every colony convened the [[First Continental Congress]] to coordinate their resistance to the Intolerable Acts. The Congress called for a [[Continental Association|boycott of British trade]], published a [[Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress|list of rights and grievances]], and [[Petition to the King|petitioned the king]] to rectify those grievances.<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert Allison|title=The Boston Tea Party|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6x7Cmio5hoC|year=2007|publisher=Applewood Books|pages=47\u201363|isbn=9781933212111}}</ref> This appeal to the Crown had no effect, though, and so the [[Second Continental Congress]] was convened in 1775 to organize the defense of the colonies against the British Army.\n\nCommon people became insurgents against the British even though they were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered. They held very strongly a sense of \"rights\" that they felt the British were deliberately violating&nbsp;\u2013 rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested by the arrival in Boston of the British Army to punish the Bostonians. This heightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge, and they had faith that God was on their side.<ref>Mark Edward Lender, review of ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) by T.

In the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u201383) the Americans captured the British invasion army at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga in 1777]], secured the Northeast and encouraged the French to make a military alliance with the United States.

His biggest challenge was logistics,  since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers.\n\nAs a battlefield tactician, Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.<ref name=\"NEH EDSITEMENT\">Lesson Plan on \"What Made George Washington a Good Military Leader?\" [http://edsitement.neh.gov/curriculum-unit/what-made-george-washington-good-military-leader NEH EDSITEMENT]</ref>\n\n=== Loyalists and Britain ===\n[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' (1819)]]\nThe Loyalists, whom the British counted upon too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized.

With the migration of settlers to the Northwest, soon they became states.

A compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths of the number of slaves in each state's total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade.\n\nTo assuage the Anti-Federalists who feared a too-powerful national government, the nation adopted the [[United States Bill of Rights]] in 1791. Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution, it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice, jury trials, and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights (which were not specified).<ref>Richard Labunski, ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights'' (2008)</ref>\n\n===President George Washington===\n\n[[File:Stuart-george-washington-constable-1797.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Washington]] legacy remains among the two or three greatest in American history, as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, hero of the Revolution, and the first President of the United States.]]\n[[File:Farewelladdresses 01 various 128kb.ogg|thumb|Reading of the [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell address]] of President George Washington, 1796]]\n\n[[George Washington]]&nbsp;\u2013 a renowned hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]], commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]], and president of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]]&nbsp;\u2013 became the first President of the United States under the new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in 1789.

Inspired by revolutionary ideals of the equality of men and influenced by their lesser economic reliance on slavery, northern states abolished slavery.\n\nStates of the [[Upper South]] made [[manumission]] easier, resulting in an increase in the proportion of [[Free negro|free blacks]] in the Upper South (as a percentage of the total non-white population) from less than one percent in 1792 to more than 10 percent by 1810.

The American high command remained incompetent until the last year.

Americans swelled with pride at success in the \"second war of independence\"; the naysayers of the antiwar Federalist Party were put to shame and the party never recovered.

The former Jeffersonian (Democratic-Republican) party split into factions. They split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Monroe]], and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], became the Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in 1828:\n<blockquote>Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party, and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American politics.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nOpposing factions led by [[Henry Clay]] helped form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery.\n\nBehind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats:\n\n[[File:Clay44b.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Horace Greeley]]'s ''New York Tribune''\u2014the leading Whig paper\u2014endorsed Clay for President and Fillmore for Governor, 1844.]]\n<blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"corrupt bargain\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics.&nbsp;... Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual (the \"common man,\" i.e. the artisan and the ordinary farmer) by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (2007) pp 287\u201388</ref><ref>Robert Allen Rutland, ''The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton'' (U. of Missouri Press, 1995) ch 1\u20134</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe great majority of anti-slavery activists, such as Abraham Lincoln and Mr. Walters, rejected [[William_Lloyd_Garrison|Garrison's]] theology and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil, not a sin.<ref>{{cite book |author=James Oakes|title=The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK0ThVhgcbAC&pg=PA57|year=2008|publisher=W.

Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the \"Wild West\" of the second half of the 19th century.

Much larger numbers in the North were against the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that America would be committed to free land (as in low-cost farms owned and cultivated by a family), free labor, and free speech (as opposed to censorship of abolitionist material in the South). Southern whites insisted that slavery was of economic, social, and cultural benefit to all whites (and even to the slaves themselves), and denounced all anti-slavery spokesmen as \"abolitionists\".<ref>Jeff Forret, ''Slavery in the United States'' (Facts on File, 2012)</ref> Justifications of slavery included economics, history, religion, legality, social good, and even humanitarianism, to further their arguments.

By 1860, there were four million slaves in [[Southern United States|the South]], nearly eight times as many as there were nationwide in 1790. The [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] were highly profitable, due to the heavy European demand for raw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves (largely drawn from the declining [[tobacco]] regions).\n\n[[File:National-atlas-1970-1860.png|right|thumb|300px|The United States, immediately before the Civil War.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the [[Missouri Compromise]]. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution.\n\n=== Lincoln and secession ===\nAfter [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 presidential election|1860 election]], seven Southern states [[Secession|seceded]] from the union and set up a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]] (Confederacy), on February 8, 1861. It attacked [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. Army fort in South Carolina, thus igniting the war. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the Confederacy in April 1861, four more states seceded and joined the Confederacy. A few of the (northernmost) \"[[slave and free states|slave states]]\" did not secede and became known as the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]; these were Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri.\n\nDuring the war, the northwestern portion of Virginia seceded from the Confederacy. and became the new Union state of [[West Virginia]].<ref>Kenneth Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'' (2008)</ref> West Virginia is usually associated with the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]].\n\n===Civil War===\n{{Main|American Civil War}}\nThe Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when elements of 100,000 [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation]] at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. In response to the attack, on April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union\", which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had their first major clash at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (Battle of Manassas), ending in a Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved to both the Union and Confederacy that the war would be much longer and bloodier than originally anticipated.<ref>Allen C. Guelzo, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=313dh9YAiE4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction]'' (2012) ch 3\u20134</ref>\n\n[[File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Lincoln with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at the [[Battle of Antietam]].]]\nThe war soon divided into two theaters: [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]] and [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western]]. In the western theater, the Union was relatively successful, with major battles, such as [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] along with Union gunboat dominance of navigable rivers producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations.<ref>Stephen E. Woodworth, ''Decision in the Heartland: The Civil War in the West'' (2011)</ref>\n\nWarfare in the Eastern theater began poorly for the Union as the Confederates won at Manassas Junction (Bull Run), just outside Washington. Major General [[George B. McClellan]] was put in charge of the Union armies. After reorganizing the new [[Army of the Potomac]], McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] in his [[Peninsula Campaign]] and [[Seven Days Battle|retreated after attacks]] from newly appointed Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>Bruce Catton, ''The Army of the Potomac: Mr. Lincoln's Army'' (1962)</ref> Meanwhile, both sides concentrated in 1861\u201362 on raising and training new armies.  The main action was Union success in controlling the border states, with Confederates largely driven out of Maryland, West Virginia (a new state), Kentucky and Missouri. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland was designed to hurt Union morale and win European support. It ended with Confederate retreat at the [[Battle of Antietam]], and Lincoln's warning he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 if the states did not return. Making slavery a central war goal Energized Republicans in the North, as well as their enemies, the anti-war Copperhead Democrats. It ended the risk of British and French intervention.\n\nLee's smaller army won at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863, while losing his top aide, [[Stonewall Jackson]]. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause [[war-weariness]] in the North. In perhaps the [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]], Lee's army was badly beaten at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1\u20133, 1863, and barely made it back to Virginia.<ref>On Lee's strategy in 1863 see James M. McPherson, \"To Conquer a Peace?\" ''Civil War Times'' (March/April 2007) 46#2 pp 26\u201333, online at EBSCO\n</ref>  On the homefront,  industrial expansion in the North expanded dramatically, using its extensive railroad service, and moving industrial workers into munitions factories.  Foreign trade increased, with the United States providing both food and cotton to Britain, And Britain sending in manufactured products and thousands of volunteers for the Union Army (plus a few to the Confederates).  The British operated blockade runners bringing in food, luxury items and munitions to the Confederacy, bringing out tobacco and cotton.  The Union blockade increasingly shut down Confederate ports, and by late 1864 the blockade runners were usually captured before they could make more than a handful of runs.\n\n[[File:Gettysburg by Britton.ogg|left|thumb|Modern recording of [[Gettysburg Address]] originally spoken by [[President of the United States|U.S President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n[[File:Kurz and Allison - Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Battle of Franklin]], November 30, 1864.]]\nIn the West, on July 4, 1863, Union forces under the command of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the Mississippi River at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]], thereby splitting the Confederacy. Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant put General William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the Western armies.  In 1864, Sherman marched south from Chattanooga to capture Atlanta, a decisive victory that ended war jitters among Republicans in the North who feared they might fail to reelect Lincoln in 1864.  Lincoln won a landslide. The last two years of the war were bloody for both sides, With Sherman marching almost unopposed through central and eastern Georgia, then moving up through South Carolina and North Carolina, burning cities, destroying plantations, ruining railroads and bridges, but avoiding civilian casualties.  Sherman demonstrated that the South lacked the long-term ability to resist a northern invasion.  Much of the heartland of the Confederacy was physically destroyed, and could no longer provide desperately needed food, horses, mules, wagons, boots or munitions to its combat armies.  In spring 1864 Grant, realizing that Lee was unable to replenish casualties, while Lincoln would provide replacements for Union losses,  launched a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns. The first of these, the [[Overland Campaign]] forced Lee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive, the [[Richmond-Petersburg Campaign]] in which he [[Siege of Petersburg|besieged Petersburg]]. After a near ten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the [[Third Battle of Petersburg|defense of Fort Gregg]] allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant pursued and launched the final, [[Appomattox Campaign]] which resulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia numbering 28,000 on April 9, 1865, at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]]. Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended with no postwar insurgency.\n\nThe American Civil War was the world's earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial war]]. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in [[World War I]]. It remains the deadliest war in American history, resulting in the deaths of about 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of [[civilian casualties]].<ref>A new way of calculating casualties by looking at the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm through analysis of census data found that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000 people, but most likely 761,000 people, died through the war.

It broke down barriers of parochialism; it ended distrust of large-scale effort; it hardened and matured the whole people emotionally.  The adolescent land of the 1850s\u2026rose under the blows of battle to adult estate.  The nation of the post-Appomattox generation, though sadly hurt (especially in the South) by war losses, and deeply scarred psychologically (especially in the North) by war hatreds and greeds, had at last the power, resolution, and self-trust of manhood.<ref>Allan Nevins, \"Introduction\" in Paul Gates, ''Agriculture and the Civil War'' (1965) p. v.</ref>\n\n===Emancipation===\n{{See also|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}\n[[File:The Emancipation Proclamation - read by Winston Tharp for LibriVox's Short Nonfiction Collection Vol. 028 (2013).ogg|alt=Emancipation Proclamation |left|thumb|Modern reading of President [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863 giving freedom to all [[African Americans]] who resided within the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] but not those within the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].]]\nThe [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was an executive order issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves.<ref>Allen C.

President [[Andrew Johnson]], who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless in the face of the Radical Republican Congress; he was impeached, but the Senate's attempt to remove him from office failed by one vote. Congress enfranchised black men and temporarily stripped many ex-Confederate leaders of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen made up of [[Carpetbaggers]] (new arrivals from the North), and [[Scalawags]] (native white Southerners). They were backed by the U.S. Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites.<ref name=\"George C. Rable 2007\">George C.

In response to Radical Reconstruction, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) emerged in 1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]] of 1870 shut down the Klan, and it disbanded. [[Paramilitary]]  groups, such as the [[White League]] and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] emerged about 1874 that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting to regain white political power in states across the South during the 1870s.

In every major city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change. Leading politicians from both parties, most notably [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], and [[Robert M.

The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]]. By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights,<ref>Rebecca J.

Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting.

Roosevelt]] promised \"a [[New Deal]] for the American people\", coining the enduring label for his domestic policies. The result was a series of permanent reform programs including Relief for the unemployed, assistance for the elderly, jobs for young men, social security, unemployment insurance, public housing, bankruptcy insurance, farm subsidies, and regulation of financial securities. State governments added new programs as well, and introduced the sales tax to pay for them. Ideologically the revolution established [[modern liberalism in the United States]] and kept the Democrats in power in Washington almost continuously for Three decades thanks to the [[New Deal Coalition]] of ethnic Whites, Blacks, blue-collar workers, labor unions, and white Southerners.  It provided relief to the long-term unemployed through numerous programs, such as the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) and for young men, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Large scale spending projects designed to provide private sector construction jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the [[Public Works Administration]]. The Second New Deal was a turn to the left in 1935\u201336, building up labor unions through the [[Wagner Act]]. Unions became a powerful element of the merging [[New Deal Coalition]], which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, relief recipients, big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups (especially Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North (where they could vote). Roosevelt seriously weakened his second term by a failed effort to pack the Supreme Court, which had been a center of conservative resistance to his programs. Most of the relief programs were dropped after 1938 in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the [[Conservative Coalition]]. Of special importance is the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security program]], begun in 1935. The economy basically recovered by 1936, but had a sharp, short recession in 1937\u201338; long-term unemployment, however, remained a problem until it was solved by wartime spending.<ref>David M.

[[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] asserted dominance in East Asia and in the Pacific. [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] militarized and threatened conquests, while Britain and France attempted [[appeasement]] to avert another war in Europe. U.S. legislation in the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]] sought to avoid foreign conflicts; however, policy clashed with increasing anti-Nazi feelings following the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 that started World War II. Roosevelt positioned the U.S. as the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\", pledging full-scale financial and munitions support for the Allies&nbsp;\u2013 but no military personnel.<ref>Conrad Black, ''Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom'' (2003) pp 648\u201382</ref> This was carried out through the [[Lend-Lease]] agreements.

Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high-efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked.\n\n[[File:Roosevelt Pearl Harbor.ogg|thumb|left|alt=Infamy speech|President Roosevelt's [[Infamy Speech]] in aftermath of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Attack]].

People tolerated the extra work because of patriotism, the pay, and the confidence that it was only \"for the duration\", and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won.

While recognized as a prominent figure in the contemporary [[teen pop]] scene, Aguilera sought to assume artistic control with ''[[Stripped (Christina Aguilera album)|Stripped]]'' (2002) and its lead single \"[[Dirrty]]\", which displayed her sexually emancipated persona and generated considerable controversy.

While recognized as a prominent figure in the contemporary [[teen pop]] scene, Aguilera sought to assume artistic control with ''[[Stripped (Christina Aguilera album)|Stripped]]'' (2002) and its lead single \"[[Dirrty]]\", which displayed her sexually emancipated persona and generated considerable controversy.

Despite the merger, the company initially maintained two divisions, [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] (covering the former TV area) and [[Aldershot]] covering A&D's area, each of which continued to issue its own timetable booklet. From 1 November 1973 these divisions were renamed North and South. Thames Valley had also managed the [[Oxford to London coach route|South Midland]] express services between [[Oxford]] and [[London]], but these were transferred to [[Oxford Bus Company|City of Oxford Motor Services]] in 1971. The new company's head office was at the former TV headquarters in Reading, but the Aldershot office was retained as a divisional headquarters,<ref name=\"Aldershot's Buses by Peter Holmes\">\"Aldershot's Buses\" by Peter Holmes</ref><ref>\"National Bus Company: The Early Years\" by Kevin Lane</ref><ref>\"National Bus Company: The Road to Privatisation\" by Kevin Lane</ref> and in 1981 became the head office, allowing the Reading site to be sold for redevelopment.\n\n===Liveries===\nThe buses began to be painted in dark red and cream, with small Tilling-style Alder Valley fleetnames with gold coloured lettering in early 1972. In keeping with the NBC policy, however, poppy red was soon applied (from December 1972), with a white stripe at waist level (single-deckers) or above the lower windows (double-deckers), along with white double-N logo, bold white fleetnames and light grey wheels. The logo later appeared in red and blue on a round-cornered white rectangular background.\n\nIn the early days of the NBC livery, cream coloured NBC-style fleetnames/logos were applied to those vehicles which retained A&D two-tone green/cream or the early red/cream liveries. Alder Valley coaches were painted white all over with the red and blue \"NATIONAL\" fleetname and logo, with the Alder Valley fleetname less-prominently. \"Dual-purpose\" vehicles (i.e. bus -bodied vehicles fitted with coach seats and used mainly on long-distance stage-carriage services but also on express services, private hire, excursions and local stage-carriage services) were painted poppy red below waist level and white above, with red fleetnames and logos.\n\nA variation was a white livery with broad red band at waist level.<ref>photo by L Smith in Aldershot's Buses</ref> In 1977 (and for some time afterwards) a [[Dennis Loline]] carried a silver and red livery in honour of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. Later, coaches carried a livery of white with an angular application of black and red horizontal stripes; this was also applied to the company's open-top double-decker based at Aldershot depot (see illustration). Coaches used on the London express services carried Londonlink branding from this point. There were, however, a large number of variations from the above standards.<ref>\"Aldershot's Buses\" by Peter Holmes and Recollections of M P Andrew</ref>\n\n===Fleet===\nWhile A&D was a [[British Electric Traction]] company with a varied fleet including mostly [[Dennis Loline]]s and [[AEC Reliance]]s, Thames Valley had a typical [[Thomas Tilling|Tilling Group]] fleet comprising almost entirely [[Bristol Commercial Vehicles|Bristol]] vehicles. Some cross-border swapping of vehicles occurred between the two divisions after the merger. Through NBC days, Alder Valley adopted the [[Leyland National]] and [[Bristol VRT]] as its standard single and double deck buses. In the early/mid-1970s there was a severe shortage of vehicles, resulting in the hiring-in of a varied fleet which included a [[Trans World Airlines]] double decker noted on services from Aldershot, including the service 12 to Reading in 1974;<ref name=\"Aldershot's Buses by Peter Holmes\"/> a number of elderly City of Oxford AEC Reliances in maroon and green livery, which operated Aldershot local services; and at least two ageing Sheffield United Tours coaches which operated daily on the [[Farnham]] to London service. Vehicle shortages (together with poor staff morale and retention) led to poor customer service at this time, with many service cancellations.\n\n===Depots===\nDepots were maintained in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Lambourn]], [[High Wycombe]], [[Maidenhead]], [[Bracknell]], [[Aldershot]], [[Guildford]], [[Woking]], [[Hindhead]] and [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]], which eventually became an outstation when [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]] depot was closed.\n\n===Operation===\nAs well as local services, Alder Valley also ran frequent express coach services from Farnham and Reading into London, and seasonal services to the south coast. With changes in legislation in the early 1980s, the London services were mostly switched to the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]] and [[M4 motorway|M4]] motorways and re-branded as Londonlink. These services enjoyed a healthy boom period for a decade or so, with greatly expanded commuter services.\n\n===Decline===\nAt the same time, local services were in decline and the Market Analysis Project (MAP) resulted in severe reductions in mileage, the end of any remaining two-person bus operation, and a reduction in the fleet size. Local fleetnames were applied to buses and publicity, and the Blackwater Valley MAP scheme saw the revival of the Aldershot & District name, while other areas were less fortunate (Forestride, Weyfarer, etc.). These names vanished after a couple of years.\n\nIn the lead up to [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|deregulation]], Alder Valley was again split on 1 January 1986 into Alder Valley North<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/01966624 Companies House extract company no 1966624] First Rail Support Limited formerly Thames Valley Traction Company Limited formerly Q Drive Buses Limited formerly Berks Bucks Company Limited formerly Alder Valley North Limited</ref> and Alder Valley South.<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/01966625 Companies House extract company no 1966625] Mulberry Development Holdings Limited formerly Alder Valley South Limited</ref><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/12th-october-1985/16/alder-valley-prepares-to-split-again Alder Valley prepares to split again] ''Commercial Motor'' 12 October 1985 page 16</ref> Initially, North and South were added to the company names. The NBC red livery was maintained initially, although it wasn't long before Alder Valley North experimented with various combinations of red, yellow and grey.\n\n==Deregulation and privatisation==\n===Alder Valley North===\nIn the lead-up to [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|deregulation]] in 1986, Alder Valley North was rebranded as The Bee Line with a yellow and grey livery adorned with bees.

In 1992 The Bee Line sold its Reading and Newbury operations to [[Reading Buses|Reading Transport]]. In 1993 the company expanded when the former [[London Country North West]] depot at [[Slough]] was purchased from [[Arriva Shires & Essex|Luton & District]], although this led to the closure of [[Maidenhead]] depot.<ref>[http://www.arrivabus.co.uk/content.aspx?id=13207 History - South East] Arriva</ref><ref>[http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/busworld/beeline/timeline.html BeeLine Company History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012210436/http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/busworld/beeline/timeline.html |date=12 October 2013 }} BusWorld</ref> In March 1996, the remaining operations were sold to [[First London|CentreWest]], which was then sold to [[FirstGroup|FirstBus]] and rebranded as [[First Berkshire & The Thames Valley|First Berkshire]].\n\n===Alder Valley South===\nAlder Valley South, meanwhile, was sold in December 1987 to the Frontsource Group.<ref name=Hansard18Apr88/><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/3rd-march-1988/16/frontsource-stretches-out Frontsource stretches out] ''Commercial Motor'' 3 March 1988 page 16</ref> It dropped the South from its name and adopted a two-tone green and yellow livery. It was sold in December 1988 to Q Drive, bringing both parts of Alder Valley back under common ownership.<ref name=CommercialMotor19Dec88/> Q Drive sold the [[Guildford]] and [[Woking]] operations in November 1990 to the [[British Bus|Drawlane Group]]<ref name=CommercialMotor4Oct90/> which eventually became part of [[Arriva Guildford & West Surrey]]. On 26 October 1992, the rest of the company was sold to [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] as [[Stagecoach South|Stagecoach in Hants & Surrey]]. The once impressive Londonlink network also went into terminal decline.

Despite the merger, the company initially maintained two divisions, [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] (covering the former TV area) and [[Aldershot]] covering A&D's area, each of which continued to issue its own timetable booklet. From 1 November 1973 these divisions were renamed North and South. Thames Valley had also managed the [[Oxford to London coach route|South Midland]] express services between [[Oxford]] and [[London]], but these were transferred to [[Oxford Bus Company|City of Oxford Motor Services]] in 1971. The new company's head office was at the former TV headquarters in Reading, but the Aldershot office was retained as a divisional headquarters,<ref name=\"Aldershot's Buses by Peter Holmes\">\"Aldershot's Buses\" by Peter Holmes</ref><ref>\"National Bus Company: The Early Years\" by Kevin Lane</ref><ref>\"National Bus Company: The Road to Privatisation\" by Kevin Lane</ref> and in 1981 became the head office, allowing the Reading site to be sold for redevelopment.\n\n===Liveries===\nThe buses began to be painted in dark red and cream, with small Tilling-style Alder Valley fleetnames with gold coloured lettering in early 1972. In keeping with the NBC policy, however, poppy red was soon applied (from December 1972), with a white stripe at waist level (single-deckers) or above the lower windows (double-deckers), along with white double-N logo, bold white fleetnames and light grey wheels. The logo later appeared in red and blue on a round-cornered white rectangular background.\n\nIn the early days of the NBC livery, cream coloured NBC-style fleetnames/logos were applied to those vehicles which retained A&D two-tone green/cream or the early red/cream liveries. Alder Valley coaches were painted white all over with the red and blue \"NATIONAL\" fleetname and logo, with the Alder Valley fleetname less-prominently. \"Dual-purpose\" vehicles (i.e. bus -bodied vehicles fitted with coach seats and used mainly on long-distance stage-carriage services but also on express services, private hire, excursions and local stage-carriage services) were painted poppy red below waist level and white above, with red fleetnames and logos.\n\nA variation was a white livery with broad red band at waist level.<ref>photo by L Smith in Aldershot's Buses</ref> In 1977 (and for some time afterwards) a [[Dennis Loline]] carried a silver and red livery in honour of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. Later, coaches carried a livery of white with an angular application of black and red horizontal stripes; this was also applied to the company's open-top double-decker based at Aldershot depot (see illustration). Coaches used on the London express services carried Londonlink branding from this point. There were, however, a large number of variations from the above standards.<ref>\"Aldershot's Buses\" by Peter Holmes and Recollections of M P Andrew</ref>\n\n===Fleet===\nWhile A&D was a [[British Electric Traction]] company with a varied fleet including mostly [[Dennis Loline]]s and [[AEC Reliance]]s, Thames Valley had a typical [[Thomas Tilling|Tilling Group]] fleet comprising almost entirely [[Bristol Commercial Vehicles|Bristol]] vehicles. Some cross-border swapping of vehicles occurred between the two divisions after the merger. Through NBC days, Alder Valley adopted the [[Leyland National]] and [[Bristol VRT]] as its standard single and double deck buses. In the early/mid-1970s there was a severe shortage of vehicles, resulting in the hiring-in of a varied fleet which included a [[Trans World Airlines]] double decker noted on services from Aldershot, including the service 12 to Reading in 1974;<ref name=\"Aldershot's Buses by Peter Holmes\"/> a number of elderly City of Oxford AEC Reliances in maroon and green livery, which operated Aldershot local services; and at least two ageing Sheffield United Tours coaches which operated daily on the [[Farnham]] to London service. Vehicle shortages (together with poor staff morale and retention) led to poor customer service at this time, with many service cancellations.\n\n===Depots===\nDepots were maintained in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Lambourn]], [[High Wycombe]], [[Maidenhead]], [[Bracknell]], [[Aldershot]], [[Guildford]], [[Woking]], [[Hindhead]] and [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]], which eventually became an outstation when [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]] depot was closed.\n\n===Operation===\nAs well as local services, Alder Valley also ran frequent express coach services from Farnham and Reading into London, and seasonal services to the south coast. With changes in legislation in the early 1980s, the London services were mostly switched to the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]] and [[M4 motorway|M4]] motorways and re-branded as Londonlink. These services enjoyed a healthy boom period for a decade or so, with greatly expanded commuter services.\n\n===Decline===\nAt the same time, local services were in decline and the Market Analysis Project (MAP) resulted in severe reductions in mileage, the end of any remaining two-person bus operation, and a reduction in the fleet size. Local fleetnames were applied to buses and publicity, and the Blackwater Valley MAP scheme saw the revival of the Aldershot & District name, while other areas were less fortunate (Forestride, Weyfarer, etc.). These names vanished after a couple of years.\n\nIn the lead up to [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|deregulation]], Alder Valley was again split on 1 January 1986 into Alder Valley North<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/01966624 Companies House extract company no 1966624] First Rail Support Limited formerly Thames Valley Traction Company Limited formerly Q Drive Buses Limited formerly Berks Bucks Company Limited formerly Alder Valley North Limited</ref> and Alder Valley South.<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/01966625 Companies House extract company no 1966625] Mulberry Development Holdings Limited formerly Alder Valley South Limited</ref><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/12th-october-1985/16/alder-valley-prepares-to-split-again Alder Valley prepares to split again] ''Commercial Motor'' 12 October 1985 page 16</ref> Initially, North and South were added to the company names. The NBC red livery was maintained initially, although it wasn't long before Alder Valley North experimented with various combinations of red, yellow and grey.\n\n==Deregulation and privatisation==\n===Alder Valley North===\nIn the lead-up to [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|deregulation]] in 1986, Alder Valley North was rebranded as The Bee Line with a yellow and grey livery adorned with bees. It was sold to Q Drive in December 1987.<ref name=Hansard18Apr88>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1988/apr/18/national-bus-company Hansard] House of Commons 18 April 1988</ref><ref name=CommercialMotor19Dec88>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/1st-december-1988/19/q-takes-on-alder-valley Q takes on Alder Valley] ''Commercial Motor'' 1 December 1988 page 19</ref> The company was shrinking.

In 1992 The Bee Line sold its Reading and Newbury operations to [[Reading Buses|Reading Transport]]. In 1993 the company expanded when the former [[London Country North West]] depot at [[Slough]] was purchased from [[Arriva Shires & Essex|Luton & District]], although this led to the closure of [[Maidenhead]] depot.<ref>[http://www.arrivabus.co.uk/content.aspx?id=13207 History - South East] Arriva</ref><ref>[http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/busworld/beeline/timeline.html BeeLine Company History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012210436/http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/busworld/beeline/timeline.html |date=12 October 2013 }} BusWorld</ref> In March 1996, the remaining operations were sold to [[First London|CentreWest]], which was then sold to [[FirstGroup|FirstBus]] and rebranded as [[First Berkshire & The Thames Valley|First Berkshire]].\n\n===Alder Valley South===\nAlder Valley South, meanwhile, was sold in December 1987 to the Frontsource Group.<ref name=Hansard18Apr88/><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/3rd-march-1988/16/frontsource-stretches-out Frontsource stretches out] ''Commercial Motor'' 3 March 1988 page 16</ref> It dropped the South from its name and adopted a two-tone green and yellow livery. It was sold in December 1988 to Q Drive, bringing both parts of Alder Valley back under common ownership.<ref name=CommercialMotor19Dec88/> Q Drive sold the [[Guildford]] and [[Woking]] operations in November 1990 to the [[British Bus|Drawlane Group]]<ref name=CommercialMotor4Oct90/> which eventually became part of [[Arriva Guildford & West Surrey]]. On 26 October 1992, the rest of the company was sold to [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] as [[Stagecoach South|Stagecoach in Hants & Surrey]]. The once impressive Londonlink network also went into terminal decline. The remnant of the network is a [[Green Line Coaches|Green Line]] service from [[Bracknell]] to London operated by First Berkshire.\n\n==Alder Valley Travel==\n[[File:Alder Valley Travel Spectra.JPG|thumb|Alder Valley Travel [[Optare Spectra]] in [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]] in 2008]]\n[[File:Alder Valley Travel logo.jpg]]<br>\nIn 2002, the name was revived when Alder Valley Travel<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/04549417 Companies House extract company no 4549417] Alder Valley (South) Limited</ref> commenced trading.

Eric Clayton is notable for his deep baritone operatic vocals, and is known for his theatrical live performances and dark, peculiar appearances and masks. \n\n==Saviour Machine==\n{{main|Saviour Machine}}\n\nEric Clayton's most ambitious work has been Saviour Machine, which released two studio albums ''Saviour Machine I'' (1993) and ''Saviour Machine II'' (1994) before starting the ''Legend'' trilogy that strictly focuses on the [[end times]], [[Book of Revelation]] and prophecies about the biblical [[apocalypse]]. The band has also released a compilation album titled ''Synopsis'' (2003), the live albums ''Live in Deutschland 1995'' and ''Live in Deutschland 2002''. Both were also filmed and released on VHS and DVD format. The band was originally signed to Christian metal label [[Frontline Records]] but gothic metal in all its visual appearance was misunderstood in US Christian scenes, and eventually Saviour Machine began work with MCM Music and [[Massacre Records]], labels based in [[Germany]] where the band was more popular than in US. In 1997 Saviour Machine performed at [[Wacken Open Air]], the biggest exclusively metal music festival in the world.\n\nEric Clayton had on and off been working on the last album in the ''Legend'' series, ''Legend Part III:II'', which should have been the last Saviour Machine album. The album was supposed to be released on July 7, 2007, but was postponed due to Clayton's esophageal condition called [[Barrett's Esophagus]] which was diagnosed in 2004 but eventually got worse. During the down-time of Saviour Machine, Clayton occasionally performed guest vocals and produced albums by other bands.\n\nClayton compiled ''The Collective Journals'' (1997\u20132009) released in 2010 available at the band website, but soon after performing a handful of unplugged Saviour Machine-shows in The Netherlands and Germany in 2013, he officially broke up the band, abandoned the unfinished Legend-project, and retired from the music business. \n\nFollowing the death of [[David Bowie]] in 2016, Eric started a project with his brother Jeff, to record and digitally release a Bowie cover song once a month for a year, in tribute. This collaboration has led to the writing of potential new Saviour Machine material.\n\n==Post-Saviour Machine==\n\nTwo years after the dissolution of Saviour Machine, in 2015, Clayton committed to playing at Ayreon's Theater Equation shows in Holland in September, reprising his role as \"Reason\" from the 2004 album ''[[The Human Equation]]''. In 2018 he finally returned to music properly, starting a new band called Eric Clayton And The Nine for a European tour. The band consists of Eric and five Dutch musicians, performing the early Saviour Machine repertoire.\nIn 2020 Eric releases his first solo album called 'A Thousand Scars', written together with his brother, Adam Pederson, Ludo Caanen and Twan Bakker. All lyrics written by Eric Clayton and music performed by 'The Nine', produced and mixed by Devon Graves (Psychotic Waltz). The album contains 15 tracks (79 minutes).\n\n==Vocal style and live performance==\nClayton's vocals can simply be described as [[opera]]tic. His voice ranges from high [[tenor]] to low [[baritone]] to occasionally the deep [[Bass (voice type)|basso]], and is typically filled with dark emotions. On ''Legend'' trilogy as well as on some guest performances he utilized cinematic, narrative speaking vocals.\n\nOn Saviour Machine's concerts, Clayton performs several theatrical and symbolic gestures. He typically paints his face in a way that it resembles an iconic theatre mask, and wears a peculiar forehead jewel as well as black clothes. Some of his live performances include wearing an American flag during the songs \"Legion\" and \"American Babylon\", dipping the Israeli and Palestinian flag into blood, wearing devices that resemble demon wings, and other gestures with separate masks, candles, chains, statues etc.\n\nClayton's lyrics are deeply spiritual, and on the first two album's include themes ranging from salvation to melodramatic, horror oriented [[dark romanticism]] on songs such as \"Legion\". As the first album was banned from Christian bookstores due to a certain line in that song, Clayton has somewhat humorously criticized the Christian music scene for its hypocritical manners on songs such as \"Ascension of Heroes.\"<ref>Eric Clayton's Liner notes on Saviour Machine -

In 1997 Saviour Machine performed at [[Wacken Open Air]], the biggest exclusively metal music festival in the world.\n\nEric Clayton had on and off been working on the last album in the ''Legend'' series, ''Legend Part III:II'', which should have been the last Saviour Machine album. The album was supposed to be released on July 7, 2007, but was postponed due to Clayton's esophageal condition called [[Barrett's Esophagus]] which was diagnosed in 2004 but eventually got worse. During the down-time of Saviour Machine, Clayton occasionally performed guest vocals and produced albums by other bands.\n\nClayton compiled ''The Collective Journals'' (1997\u20132009) released in 2010 available at the band website, but soon after performing a handful of unplugged Saviour Machine-shows in The Netherlands and Germany in 2013, he officially broke up the band, abandoned the unfinished Legend-project, and retired from the music business. \n\nFollowing the death of [[David Bowie]] in 2016, Eric started a project with his brother Jeff, to record and digitally release a Bowie cover song once a month for a year, in tribute. This collaboration has led to the writing of potential new Saviour Machine material.\n\n==Post-Saviour Machine==\n\nTwo years after the dissolution of Saviour Machine, in 2015, Clayton committed to playing at Ayreon's Theater Equation shows in Holland in September, reprising his role as \"Reason\" from the 2004 album ''[[The Human Equation]]''. In 2018 he finally returned to music properly, starting a new band called Eric Clayton And The Nine for a European tour. The band consists of Eric and five Dutch musicians, performing the early Saviour Machine repertoire.\nIn 2020 Eric releases his first solo album called 'A Thousand Scars', written together with his brother, Adam Pederson, Ludo Caanen and Twan Bakker. All lyrics written by Eric Clayton and music performed by 'The Nine', produced and mixed by Devon Graves (Psychotic Waltz). The album contains 15 tracks (79 minutes).\n\n==Vocal style and live performance==\nClayton's vocals can simply be described as [[opera]]tic. His voice ranges from high [[tenor]] to low [[baritone]] to occasionally the deep [[Bass (voice type)|basso]], and is typically filled with dark emotions. On ''Legend'' trilogy as well as on some guest performances he utilized cinematic, narrative speaking vocals.\n\nOn Saviour Machine's concerts, Clayton performs several theatrical and symbolic gestures. He typically paints his face in a way that it resembles an iconic theatre mask, and wears a peculiar forehead jewel as well as black clothes. Some of his live performances include wearing an American flag during the songs \"Legion\" and \"American Babylon\", dipping the Israeli and Palestinian flag into blood, wearing devices that resemble demon wings, and other gestures with separate masks, candles, chains, statues etc.\n\nClayton's lyrics are deeply spiritual, and on the first two album's include themes ranging from salvation to melodramatic, horror oriented [[dark romanticism]] on songs such as \"Legion\". As the first album was banned from Christian bookstores due to a certain line in that song, Clayton has somewhat humorously criticized the Christian music scene for its hypocritical manners on songs such as \"Ascension of Heroes.\"<ref>Eric Clayton's Liner notes on Saviour Machine - Synopsis booklet, 2003, mas cd0298, Massacre Records. retrieved on October 21, 2007</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n'''Saviour Machine'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\"|Year\n!align=\"center\"|Title\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1990\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Saviour Machine (demo)''\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1993\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''[[Saviour Machine I]]''\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1994\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Saviour Machine II''\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1995\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Live In Deutschland 1995''\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1997\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Legend I''\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1998\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Legend II''\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2001\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Legend III:I''\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2002\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Live In Deutschland 2002''\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2003\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Synopsis: An Introduction To The Artist''\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2006\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Rarities/Revelations''\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2020\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''A Thousand Scars''\n\n|}\n\n'''Guest appearances'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\"|Year\n!align=\"center\"|Title\n!align=\"center\"|Artist\n!align=\"center\"|Contribution\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1992\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Stay of Execution''\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Deliverance\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Backing vocals\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1998\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Anthems''\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Wedding Party\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Backing vocals\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1998\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''[[Damnation (Ride the Madness)]]''\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|[[Eva O]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2003\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''The Great Fall''\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|[[Narnia (band)|Narnia]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Lead vocals on \"The Great Fall of Man\"\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2004\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''[[The Human Equation]]''\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|[[Ayreon]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|The part of \"Reason\" on several songs\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2004\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''Glory Thy Name''\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|[[DivineFire]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Narration on \"From Death To Life\", \"The Spirit\", and \"The Way To Eternity\"\n\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2005\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|''The Calling''\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Audiovision\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Narration on \"Hold Me\"\n\n|}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.saviourmachine.com Official website Saviour Machine]\n* [https://www.ericclaytonandthenine.com Official website Eric Clayton And The Nine]\n\n{{Saviour Machine}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Clayton, Eric}}\n[[Category:1967 births]]\n[[Category:American heavy metal singers]]\n[[Category:American male singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American rock songwriters]]\n[[Category:American male songwriters]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "name_user": "Twanb", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDiscography", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clayton"}

It is a set of [[Genetic engineering techniques|technologies]] used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel [[organisms]]. New [[DNA]] is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using [[recombinant DNA]] methods or by [[Artificial gene synthesis|artificially synthesising]] the DNA. A [[Vector (molecular biology)|construct]] is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by [[Paul Berg]] in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus [[SV40]] with the [[Lambda phage|lambda virus]]. As well as inserting [[gene]]s, the process can be used to remove, or \"[[Gene knockout|knock out]]\", genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or [[Gene targeting|targeted]] to a specific part of the [[genome]]. It also genetically modifies the '''photosynthesis''' of the bisectors.\n\nAn organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified (GM) and the resulting entity is a [[genetically modified organism]] (GMO). The first GMO was a [[Genetically modified bacterium|bacterium]] generated by [[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] in 1973. [[Rudolf Jaenisch]] created the first GM animal when he inserted foreign DNA into a [[Genetically modified mouse|mouse]] in 1974. The first company to focus on genetic engineering, Genentech, was founded in 1976 and started the production of human proteins. Genetically engineered human [[insulin]] was produced in 1978 and insulin-producing bacteria were commercialised in 1982. [[Genetically modified food]] has been sold since 1994, with the release of the [[Flavr Savr]] tomato. The Flavr Savr was engineered to have a longer shelf life, but most current GM crops are modified to increase resistance to insects and herbicides. [[GloFish]], the first GMO designed as a pet, was sold in the United States in December 2003. In 2016 [[AquAdvantage salmon|salmon]] modified with a growth hormone were sold.\n\nGenetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture. In research GMOs are used to study gene function and expression through loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression experiments. By knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create [[Model organism|animal model organisms]] of human diseases. As well as producing hormones, vaccines and other drugs genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases through [[gene therapy]]. The same techniques that are used to produce drugs can also have industrial applications such as producing enzymes for laundry detergent, cheeses and other products.\n\nThe rise of commercialised [[genetically modified crops]] has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries, but has also been the source of most of the [[Genetically modified food controversies|controversy]] surrounding the technology. This has been present since its early use; the first field trials were destroyed by anti-GM activists. Although there is a [[scientific consensus]] that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, GM food safety is a leading concern with critics. [[Gene flow]], impact on non-target organisms, control of the food supply and [[intellectual property]] rights have also been raised as potential issues. These concerns have led to the development of a regulatory framework, which started in 1975. It has led to an international treaty, the [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], that was adopted in 2000. Individual countries have developed their own regulatory systems regarding GMOs, with the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe.\n\n{{Quote box\n| title = [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition\n| quote = '''Genetic engineering''': Process of inserting new genetic information into existing cells in order to modify a specific organism for the purpose of changing its characteristics.\n\n''Note'': Adapted from ref.<ref>{{cite web|website=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency online|title=Terms and Acronyms|url=http://www.epa.gov/OCEPAterms/gterms.html|access-date= 16 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vert M, Doi Y, Hellwich KH, Hess M, Hodge P, Kubisa P, Rinaudo M, Schu\u00e9 F |title=Terminology for biorelated polymers and applications (IUPAC Recommendations 2012) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |year=2012 |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=377\u2013410 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-12-04 }}</ref>\n| align = right\n| width = 30%\n}}\n\n==Overview==\n\n[[File:Breeding transgenesis cisgenesis.svg|thumb|Comparison of conventional plant breeding with [[transgenic]] and [[cisgenic]] genetic modification|upright=1.7]]\n\nGenetic engineering is a process that alters the genetic structure of an organism by either removing or introducing [[DNA]].

This could be the effect on the phenotype of the organism, where the gene is expressed or what other genes it interacts with. These experiments generally involve loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression.\n\n* '''Loss of function experiments''', such as in a [[gene knockout]] experiment, in which an organism is engineered to lack the activity of one or more genes. In a simple knockout a copy of the desired gene has been altered to make it non-functional. [[Embryonic stem cells]] incorporate the altered gene, which replaces the already present functional copy. These stem cells are injected into [[blastocyst]]s, which are implanted into surrogate mothers. This allows the experimenter to analyse the defects caused by this [[mutation]] and thereby determine the role of particular genes. It is used especially frequently in [[developmental biology]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal |last=Alberts |first=Bruce |last2=Johnson |first2=Alexander |last3=Lewis |first3=Julian |last4=Raff |first4=Martin |last5=Roberts |first5=Keith |last6=Walter |first6=Peter | name-list-format =  vanc |date=2002|title=Studying Gene Expression and Function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26818/ }}</ref> When this is done by creating a library of genes with point mutations at every position in the area of interest, or even every position in the whole gene, this is called \"scanning mutagenesis\".

These are sometimes performed in conjunction with knockout experiments to more finely establish the function of the desired gene. The process is much the same as that in knockout engineering, except that the construct is designed to increase the function of the gene, usually by providing extra copies of the gene or inducing synthesis of the protein more frequently. Gain of function is used to tell whether or not a protein is sufficient for a function, but does not always mean it's required, especially when dealing with genetic or functional redundancy.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* '''Tracking experiments''', which seek to gain information about the localisation and interaction of the desired protein. One way to do this is to replace the wild-type gene with a 'fusion' gene, which is a juxtaposition of the wild-type gene with a reporting element such as [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) that will allow easy visualisation of the products of the genetic modification. While this is a useful technique, the manipulation can destroy the function of the gene, creating secondary effects and possibly calling into question the results of the experiment. More sophisticated techniques are now in development that can track protein products without mitigating their function, such as the addition of small sequences that will serve as binding motifs to monoclonal antibodies.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* '''Expression studies''' aim to discover where and when specific proteins are produced. In these experiments, the DNA sequence before the DNA that codes for a protein, known as a gene's [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], is reintroduced into an organism with the protein coding region replaced by a reporter gene such as GFP or an enzyme that catalyses the production of a dye. Thus the time and place where a particular protein is produced can be observed.

However, safety concerns cannot, as yet, be dismissed completely on the basis of information currently available. When seeking to optimise the balance between benefits and risks, it is prudent to err on the side of caution and, above all, learn from accumulating knowledge and experience. Any new technology such as genetic modification must be examined for possible benefits and risks to human health and the environment. As with all novel foods, safety assessments in relation to GM foods must be made on a case-by-case basis. Members of the GM jury project were briefed on various aspects of genetic modification by a diverse group of acknowledged experts in the relevant subjects. The GM jury reached the conclusion that the sale of GM foods currently available should be halted and the moratorium on commercial growth of GM crops should be continued. These conclusions were based on the precautionary principle and lack of evidence of any benefit. The Jury expressed concern over the impact of GM crops on farming, the environment, food safety and other potential health effects. The Royal Society review (2002) concluded that the risks to human health associated with the use of specific viral DNA sequences in GM plants are negligible, and while calling for caution in the introduction of potential allergens into food crops, stressed the absence of evidence that commercially available GM foods cause clinical allergic manifestations. The BMA shares the view that that there is no robust evidence to prove that GM foods are unsafe but we endorse the call for further research and surveillance to provide convincing evidence of safety and benefit.|access-date=21 March 2016}}</ref> Nonetheless, members of the public are less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe.<ref>{{Cite web |first1=Cary |last1=Funk |last2=Rainie |first2=Lee| name-list-format = vanc |url= http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/ |title=Public and Scientists' Views on Science and Society|date=29 January 2015|publisher=Pew Research Center|quote=The largest differences between the public and the AAAS scientists are found in beliefs about the safety of eating genetically modified (GM) foods.

It is a set of [[Genetic engineering techniques|technologies]] used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel [[organisms]]. New [[DNA]] is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using [[recombinant DNA]] methods or by [[Artificial gene synthesis|artificially synthesising]] the DNA. A [[Vector (molecular biology)|construct]] is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by [[Paul Berg]] in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus [[SV40]] with the [[Lambda phage|lambda virus]]. As well as inserting [[gene]]s, the process can be used to remove, or \"[[Gene knockout|knock out]]\", genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or [[Gene targeting|targeted]] to a specific part of the [[genome]].\n\nAn organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified (GM) and the resulting entity is a [[genetically modified organism]] (GMO). The first GMO was a [[Genetically modified bacterium|bacterium]] generated by [[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] in 1973. [[Rudolf Jaenisch]] created the first GM animal when he inserted foreign DNA into a [[Genetically modified mouse|mouse]] in 1974. The first company to focus on genetic engineering, Genentech, was founded in 1976 and started the production of human proteins. Genetically engineered human [[insulin]] was produced in 1978 and insulin-producing bacteria were commercialised in 1982. [[Genetically modified food]] has been sold since 1994, with the release of the [[Flavr Savr]] tomato. The Flavr Savr was engineered to have a longer shelf life, but most current GM crops are modified to increase resistance to insects and herbicides. [[GloFish]], the first GMO designed as a pet, was sold in the United States in December 2003. In 2016 [[AquAdvantage salmon|salmon]] modified with a growth hormone were sold.\n\nGenetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture. In research GMOs are used to study gene function and expression through loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression experiments. By knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create [[Model organism|animal model organisms]] of human diseases. As well as producing hormones, vaccines and other drugs genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases through [[gene therapy]]. The same techniques that are used to produce drugs can also have industrial applications such as producing enzymes for laundry detergent, cheeses and other products.\n\nThe rise of commercialised [[genetically modified crops]] has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries, but has also been the source of most of the [[Genetically modified food controversies|controversy]] surrounding the technology. This has been present since its early use; the first field trials were destroyed by anti-GM activists. Although there is a [[scientific consensus]] that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, GM food safety is a leading concern with critics. [[Gene flow]], impact on non-target organisms, control of the food supply and [[intellectual property]] rights have also been raised as potential issues. These concerns have led to the development of a regulatory framework, which started in 1975. It has led to an international treaty, the [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], that was adopted in 2000. Individual countries have developed their own regulatory systems regarding GMOs, with the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe.\n\n{{Quote box\n| title = [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition\n| quote = '''Genetic engineering''': Process of inserting new genetic information into existing cells in order to modify a specific organism for the purpose of changing its characteristics.\n\n''Note'': Adapted from ref.<ref>{{cite web|website=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency online|title=Terms and Acronyms|url=http://www.epa.gov/OCEPAterms/gterms.html|access-date= 16 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vert M, Doi Y, Hellwich KH, Hess M, Hodge P, Kubisa P, Rinaudo M, Schu\u00e9 F |title=Terminology for biorelated polymers and applications (IUPAC Recommendations 2012) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |year=2012 |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=377\u2013410 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-12-04 }}</ref>\n| align = right\n| width = 30%\n}}\n\n==Overview==\n\n[[File:Breeding transgenesis cisgenesis.svg|thumb|Comparison of conventional plant breeding with [[transgenic]] and [[cisgenic]] genetic modification|upright=1.7]]\n\nGenetic engineering is a process that alters the genetic structure of an organism by either removing or introducing [[DNA]].

This could be the effect on the phenotype of the organism, where the gene is expressed or what other genes it interacts with. These experiments generally involve loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression.\n\n* '''Loss of function experiments''', such as in a [[gene knockout]] experiment, in which an organism is engineered to lack the activity of one or more genes. In a simple knockout a copy of the desired gene has been altered to make it non-functional. [[Embryonic stem cells]] incorporate the altered gene, which replaces the already present functional copy. These stem cells are injected into [[blastocyst]]s, which are implanted into surrogate mothers. This allows the experimenter to analyse the defects caused by this [[mutation]] and thereby determine the role of particular genes. It is used especially frequently in [[developmental biology]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal |last=Alberts |first=Bruce |last2=Johnson |first2=Alexander |last3=Lewis |first3=Julian |last4=Raff |first4=Martin |last5=Roberts |first5=Keith |last6=Walter |first6=Peter | name-list-format =  vanc |date=2002|title=Studying Gene Expression and Function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26818/ }}</ref> When this is done by creating a library of genes with point mutations at every position in the area of interest, or even every position in the whole gene, this is called \"scanning mutagenesis\".

These are sometimes performed in conjunction with knockout experiments to more finely establish the function of the desired gene. The process is much the same as that in knockout engineering, except that the construct is designed to increase the function of the gene, usually by providing extra copies of the gene or inducing synthesis of the protein more frequently. Gain of function is used to tell whether or not a protein is sufficient for a function, but does not always mean it's required, especially when dealing with genetic or functional redundancy.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* '''Tracking experiments''', which seek to gain information about the localisation and interaction of the desired protein. One way to do this is to replace the wild-type gene with a 'fusion' gene, which is a juxtaposition of the wild-type gene with a reporting element such as [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) that will allow easy visualisation of the products of the genetic modification. While this is a useful technique, the manipulation can destroy the function of the gene, creating secondary effects and possibly calling into question the results of the experiment. More sophisticated techniques are now in development that can track protein products without mitigating their function, such as the addition of small sequences that will serve as binding motifs to monoclonal antibodies.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* '''Expression studies''' aim to discover where and when specific proteins are produced. In these experiments, the DNA sequence before the DNA that codes for a protein, known as a gene's [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], is reintroduced into an organism with the protein coding region replaced by a reporter gene such as GFP or an enzyme that catalyses the production of a dye. Thus the time and place where a particular protein is produced can be observed. Expression studies can be taken a step further by altering the promoter to find which pieces are crucial for the proper expression of the gene and are actually bound by transcription factor proteins; this process is known as [[promoter bashing]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ed4_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114 |title=Techniques in Genetic Engineering|last=Kurnaz|first=Isil Aksan| name-list-format = vanc |date=2015-05-08|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4822-6090-8 }}</ref>\n\n=== Industrial ===\n\nOrganisms can have their cells transformed with a gene coding for a useful protein, such as an enzyme, so that they will [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|overexpress]] the desired protein.

However, safety concerns cannot, as yet, be dismissed completely on the basis of information currently available. When seeking to optimise the balance between benefits and risks, it is prudent to err on the side of caution and, above all, learn from accumulating knowledge and experience. Any new technology such as genetic modification must be examined for possible benefits and risks to human health and the environment. As with all novel foods, safety assessments in relation to GM foods must be made on a case-by-case basis. Members of the GM jury project were briefed on various aspects of genetic modification by a diverse group of acknowledged experts in the relevant subjects. The GM jury reached the conclusion that the sale of GM foods currently available should be halted and the moratorium on commercial growth of GM crops should be continued. These conclusions were based on the precautionary principle and lack of evidence of any benefit. The Jury expressed concern over the impact of GM crops on farming, the environment, food safety and other potential health effects. The Royal Society review (2002) concluded that the risks to human health associated with the use of specific viral DNA sequences in GM plants are negligible, and while calling for caution in the introduction of potential allergens into food crops, stressed the absence of evidence that commercially available GM foods cause clinical allergic manifestations. The BMA shares the view that that there is no robust evidence to prove that GM foods are unsafe but we endorse the call for further research and surveillance to provide convincing evidence of safety and benefit.|access-date=21 March 2016}}</ref> Nonetheless, members of the public are less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe.<ref>{{Cite web |first1=Cary |last1=Funk |last2=Rainie |first2=Lee| name-list-format = vanc |url= http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/ |title=Public and Scientists' Views on Science and Society|date=29 January 2015|publisher=Pew Research Center|quote=The largest differences between the public and the AAAS scientists are found in beliefs about the safety of eating genetically modified (GM) foods.

It was renewed for a fourth season of 20 episodes on October 20, 2018.<ref name=\"S4\" />\n\nSince March 18, 2018, new episodes moved to the Nick Jr. channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thanks @nickelodeon for the amazing Shimmer and Shine wrap party \ud83c\udf89 @farnazcharmatz|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/ByyQosZBx-S/|work=[[Instagram]]|date=June 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SHIMMER AND SHINE (NICK JR)|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/shimmer-and-shine/listings/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=February 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe first season is set in the human world and focuses on a young girl named Leah who is friends with a pair of twin genie sisters named Shimmer and Shine. Each day, the genies grant Leah three wishes, but they often make mistakes. Each episode features Leah working together with the genies to resolve the problems they unintentionally cause, all while keeping Shimmer and Shine a secret from her next door neighbor and best friend Zac.\n\nIn the second season, the characters are transported to Zahramay Falls, a magical land where Shimmer and Shine live. Leah reveals her genies' existence to Zac, who is given a genie of his own, named Kaz. Shimmer and Shine continue to grant Leah wishes in Zahramay Falls and befriend the sovereign of the land, Princess Samira. The season includes Samira's pet peacock, Roya and Leah's pet fox, Parisa. Also, Zeta, a villainous sorceress, and finally, Zeta's dragon, Nazboo.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n{{:List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Humans and genies===\n*Shimmer (voiced by [[Eva Bella]] in US, and [[Mia Wiltshire]] in UK) \u2013 An optimistic genie with blue eyes and pink hair. She is enthusiastic and encouraging. She loves cleaning, glitter, and collecting genie bottles. Her pet is a [[gibbon monkey]] named Tala.\n*Shine (voiced by [[Isabella Cramp]] in US, [[Elie Simons]] and [[Mia Hope]] in UK) \u2013 A courageous genie with purple eyes and blue hair. She is an animal lover and is often hungry. Her pet is a [[Bengal tiger]] cub named Nahal. Due to her love of animals, she is very knowledgeable about the behaviors of magical creatures native to Zahramay Falls. Unlike her sister, she hates cleaning. A running gag involves Shine saying \"It's like I always say...\" only to humorously reveal that she has just made up whatever she says next.\n*Leah (voiced by [[Alina Foley]] in US, and [[Claudia Burns]] in UK) \u2013 A blonde girl with green eyes who owns a genie bottle necklace, which includes Shimmer and Shine.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Sweetest Thing |minutes=3 |series=Shimmer and Shine |quote=Boom Zahramay! Your best friends are on the way.}}</ref> Although Shimmer and Shine usually mess up her wishes, Leah is patient and forgiving with them. Originally, she was forced to keep her genies' existence a secret from her close friend Zac, but revealed her secret to him after being transported to Zahramay Falls. In the second season, Princess Samira grants Leah and Zac's wish to visit Zahramay Falls whenever they want. While visiting her genies in Zahramay Falls, Leah magically dons a genie disguise in order to blend in, as humans are normally not allowed in Zahramay Falls.\n*Zac (voiced by [[Blake Bertrand]] in the first two seasons, [[Justin Felbinger]], and later [[Ethan Jones]] in season three and onward in US, and [[Innis Robertson-Pinnel]] in UK) \u2013 Leah's neighbor with red hair and blue eyes, and best human friend. In the first season, he is oblivious to the fact that Leah has genies. Whenever something strange or unusual happens, he responds to it in a carefree manner. He also has a habit of telling humorous experiences he has had to Leah. In the second season, he learns that Leah has genies and gets a genie of his own named Kaz.\n*Princess Samira (voiced by [[Nikki SooHoo]] in US, and [[Cariad Lloyd]] in UK) \u2013 The ruler of Zahramay Falls with violet eyes and ice blue hair with darker blue tips, who is in charge of checking up on all the genies in training. She can grant wishes along with the younger genies. She occasionally rewards genies with magic Genie Gems that can have a variety of magical effects. She acts as Shimmer and Shine's mentor and teacher. Despite Zeta being her self-proclaimed rival, Samira likes Zeta and is willing to give her a second chance at becoming a genie-in-training, which in season three is revealed to be due to her past friendship with Zeta when they were both students under Empress Caliana and hopes that Zeta and her can one day become friends again.\n*Zeta the Sorceress (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] in US & UK) \u2013 A resident of Zahramay Falls with green eyes and purple hair, who is Princess Samira's rival and wishes to replace her as the most powerful person in Zahramay Falls. Zeta is a sorceress instead of a genie, as she has no desire to grant the wishes of others, relying on magic potions and magical items. Her plans are almost always thwarted by Shimmer, Shine, and Leah. However, her own arrogance and ignorance can cause her to foil her own schemes as well. Despite the trouble she causes, the girls and Zac don't hold it against her and generally try to be friendly towards her when not foiling her schemes. Though she tends to be antagonistic towards Leah and her genies, she can be civil towards them at times and even work with them such when she finds herself and/or Nazboo in danger usually when her schemes backfire, which usually results in them saving her. Before becoming a sorceress, she was a genie-in-training under Empress Caliana along with Samira, whom Zeta befriended when she was a new student, though later quit school due to her jealousy of Samira and decided to become a sorceress instead, though despite her current rivalry with Samira is shown to cherish their past friendship as she held onto a feather pen Samira gave her when they first met along with a picture of the two of them together when they were both still friends.\n*Kaz (voiced by [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] in US, and [[Harrison Noble]] in UK) \u2013 A genie in training with blue eyes and magenta hair who becomes Zac's genie in the second season. In contrast to Zac's easy-going and adventurous personality, Kaz is more cautious and scared easily. Despite their contrasting personalities, Zac and Kaz work well together and can be brave when he has to be. His cautious nature also means he puts more thought into how he grants Zac's wishes. Like most genies in Zahramay Falls, he has his own magic carpet, though sometimes uses Zac's Super Zoom Flyer, a magic carpet wished up by Zac. Kaz has a pet Ziffilon named Zain, who summoned by one of Zac's wishes after he learned that Kaz always wanted a Ziffilon as a pet. Though he and Zac get along well, he occasionally becomes unenthusiastic when granting wishes for Zac he would prefer not too. He was initially afraid of Zac's dog Rocket due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though eventually overcame his fear after Zac and the girls reminded him of how other genies were initially scared of Zain before they got to know him.\n*Empress Caliana (voiced by [[Barbara Eden]]) \u2013 Princess Samira's famous, semi-retired mentor with purple eyes and blonde hair with pink tips. Caliana was the one who gave Samira her special necklace back when she was a little genie-in-training. Empress Caliana was a great explorer when she was a little girl and made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as finding the Caliana Caves. She is also old friends with Rohan, the normally shy crystalline golem that guards the caves. When Zeta and Samira were younger, Caliana taught genies-in-training at her school in Genie Hall, where Zeta was her top student. While praising Zeta's potion making skills, she tried to teach her to be more considerate of others and assigned Samira to sit next to Zeta when Samira was a new student which lead to Samira befriending Zeta, though Zeta eventually became jealous of Samira when she became the class's new top student, which eventually led Zeta to quit school and decide to become a Sorceress instead after her attempt to sabotage Samira backfired, though Caliana expressed hope to Samira that she would one day return. \n*Captain Zora (voiced by [[Kellie Pickler]] from the season two finale, [[Kate Higgins]] from season three and onward) \u2013 A pirate genie who is Shine's idol. She is absentminded at times and can be very clumsy and forgetful, especially when she is on an adventure. She owns a flying pirate ship that she sometimes accidentally docks in odd places. Shine loves pirate genies and Captain Zora is her favorite of them all, so she gets very nervous and sometimes cannot talk clearly when she is around Zora.\n*Layla (voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]) \u2013 An ice genie who is a good friend of Princess Samira. She possesses an ice gem necklace that gives her freezing powers and keeps her body cold. She originally lived in a genie bottle buried on a sandy beach in Zahramay Falls, but it was accidentally broken by Leah and her genies. She currently lives in an ice palace.\n*Shaya (voiced by [[Kin Santiago]] in Season 2 through 3 and [[Hudson West]]) \u2013 A lightning genie in training who rides around on a flying cloud-board and can generate magical lightning. Leah and her genies help him catch a run away magic lightning bolt he created while practicing his magic. Though he is reluctant to work with Leah and her genies at first, he eventually learns the value of teamwork from them.\n*Nila (voiced by [[Mila Brener]] in US, and [[Kimani Arthur]] in UK) \u2013 A mermaid who lives in the waters near Zahramay Falls. Leah and her genies befriend Nila after Leah wishes to find a Mermaid after learning they are real. She helps the girls obtain the Mermaid Gem to change the girls back to their non-mermaid selves after Leah accidentally uses up her wishes which leaves the girls trapped in Mermaid form. After Nila and the girls obtain the gem by befriending its lonely Guardian, she teaches them the spell to activate the gem's power which can both transform into Mermaids as well as undo the transformation allowing the girls to visit Nila and go on underwater adventures with her. \n*Imma  (voiced by [[Grace Kaufman]]) \u2013 The Waterfall Genie who oversees the source of the rainbow waterfalls of Zahramay Falls in Rainbow Zahramay. The girls befriend her after Samira sends them on their first adventure to Rainbow Zahramay to investigate the cause of a weird mist produced by the falls that disrupts magic in Zahramay Falls and help Imma resolve the problem. Imma can use water magic that allows her to manipulate water using her magic staff which she also uses to activate the locks that control the flow of rainbow water to the falls.\n* Wishy Washy Genie (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) \u2013 A male genie whose powerful magic is to remove or fix a wish that cannot be used on other genies. He can be very wishy washy, just like his name. But while on their adventure to find his home, the children help him make decisions.\n*Ayla (voiced by [[Liliana Mumy]]) \u2013 A hair-changing genie who has the power to change hairstyles.\n*Minu (voiced by [[Kitana Turnbull]]) \u2013 A flitter genie.\n*Afina (voiced by [[Julie Nathanson]]) \u2013 The Glitter Genie who lives in a glittery palace on a cloud in Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Princess Ula (voiced by [[Tatyana Ali]]) \u2013 The ruler of Rainbow Zarahmay.

However it is rare for her to make dreams actually come true. \n*Ezri (voiced by [[Gunnar Sizemore]]) \u2013 Nadia's assistant who like Nadia knows about everybody in Zahramay Falls as he recognizes Leah, Shimmer, Shine, and even Zeta on first meeting them.\n*Misha (voiced by [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] in Season 3 and [[Kailey Snider]] in Season 4) \u2013 The Animal Genie who helps all the genies in Zarahmay Falls find their pets.\n*Princess Adara (voiced by [[Tania Gunadi]]) \u2013 The beautiful stardust princess of Zarahmay Skies.\n*Rubi (voiced by [[Luna Bella]]) \u2013 The Rainbow Genie of Zarahmay Skies.\n*Shaun (voiced by [[Ramone Hamilton]]) \u2013 Shaya's twin brother who's a cloud genie.\n\n===Animals===\nAll animals in the series are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].\n*Tala \u2013 Shimmer's pet [[gibbon monkey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707235316/http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archivedate=July 7, 2017|title=Tala from Shimmer and Shine \u2013 Nick Asia|work=[[Nickelodeon (Southeast Asia)|Nickelodeon Southeast Asia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International|Viacom International, Inc.]]|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref> She has green eyes and wears white pearls, like Shimmer does.

She has a talent for playing the keyboard.\n*Rocket \u2013 Zac's pet beagle who appears in several episodes of the first season and reappears in the third season. He is a rambunctious dog with a tendency to drool and chew on things which often causes trouble, though is simply an overly playful pouch who means no real harm. He has encountered Shimmer, Shine, Tala, and Nahal at various times. The only pet native to Leah and Zac's world, he eventually is wished to Zahramay Falls by Zac though is mistakenly seen as a monster by genies like Kaz and animals native to genie world like Parisa and Zain who are unfamiliar with dogs at first due to dogs not being native to their world, with the exception of Shimmer, Shine, Tala, Nahal, and Samira. After helping Zac stop Zeta from stealing Samira's staff, Samira permits Rocket to accompany Zac when he visits Zahramay Falls. \n*Nazboo \u2013 Zeta's talking pet dragon, who caters to her every need and acts as Zeta's underling. He has teal scales, purple eyes, white horns, a white tummy, and blue toes. He is somewhat clumsy and often accidentally causes Zeta's schemes to backfire. He can also get easily distracted by food or anything that piques his interest. He also enjoys getting an occasional tummy rub from Zeta. Though he acts as Zeta's underling most of the time, he is friendly towards Leah, Zac, and their genies as well as their pets to the point he often greets them by saying \"''Hi, Friends!''\" even in the middle of one of Zeta's schemes. Unlike Zeta, he is generally more considerate of others and prefers to play fair in competitions though usually assists Zeta in cheating. In the third season, he is revealed to be from Manetikar, The Land of Dragons and befriended Zeta when she came to Manetikar to find a dragon for a pet. Feeling sorry for Zeta after her attempt to make one of the larger flying dragons her pet failed, he agreed to become her pet and went home with her to her lair in Zahramay Falls, where he has lived ever since. He has a sister and two brothers who resemble him in appearance and personality.\n*Roya \u2013 Princess Samira's pet peacock, who resides in her palace. Roya is the polar opposite of Shimmer and Shine's pets, as she would much rather show off her feathers or practice walking gracefully than play or dance. Unlike Samira, Roya has a strong dislike for Zeta and Nazboo, to the point of literally chasing them out of Samira's Palace on one occasion. Once a year, she sheds a special feather with the ability to repair any magical object. \n*Parisa \u2013 Leah's pet Zahramay fox who possesses the ability to camouflage herself, making her practically invisible, whenever she wants. she also has a talent for painting. Parisa is introduced midway through the second season. Like Kaz and Zain, she was initially scared of Rocket, due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though not to the same degree that Kaz and Zain were.\n*Zain \u2013 Kaz's pet Ziffilon (a griffin-like creature). Kaz had always wanted a pet Ziffilon before getting Zain, so Zac uses one of his wishes to wish up a Ziffilon for Kaz. Zain is by far the largest of the pets, as he is big enough for Kaz to ride on his back, though despite his size Zain gets scared easily even more so than Kaz. Like most Ziffilons his favorite food is Zlam Berries and is originally from Ziffilon Island. Though he gets along with the other pets, he is frightened by Rocket at first due to being unfamiliar with dogs though after Zac reminds Kaz and Zain how other genies were scared of Zain at first, he and Kaz manage to overcome their initial fear of Rocket. \n*Zoomicorns \u2013 Winged Unicorns native to Zahramay Falls and Rainbow Zahramay introduced in the second season. They are friendly and helpful creatures who occasionally aid the girls and allow them to ride them. There is also a game called Zoomicorn Toss, where players ride flying Zahramay Cloud Boards while trying to throw rings around a Zoomicorn's horn as it flies around, without the use of magic as using magic is considered unfair. The only known named Zoomicorn, is Gleam who lives in Rainbow Zahramay that is a friend of the Glitter Genie Afina whom the girls meet and befriend during one of their adventures in Rainbow Zahramay in the third season. \n*Scallywag \u2013 The magical pet of the Pirate Genie Captain Zora, who helps Zora remember things that she forgets such as names and the meaning of words and phrases used by pirates. Scallywag flies around by spinning her tail in helicopter like fashion. Her magic goes out of control when scared, causing random magic effects. \n*Nazboo's Family \u2013 Nazboo's three siblings Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank who are introduced in the third season. They are all small flightless dragons that resemble Nazboo in appearance and share his friendly, playful nature as well as his love of food and tummy rubs. Nazboo and his siblings tend to get into trouble when they are together, much to Zeta's frustration and annoyance. Nazboo's sister Razboo has purple scales and wears a dark pink bow on her head. His brother Kazboo has dark green scales and a purple mohawk, while his brother Frank has blue scales and wears a light pink bowtie. Like their brother, Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank all have purple eyes, blue toes, and white bellies and horns. While Kazboo and Razboo are capable of speech like Nazboo, Frank's vocabulary is apparently limited to saying his own name, which doesn't rhyme with his other siblings' names.\n*Gleam \u2013 A blue glitter Zoomicorn native Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Lulu \u2013 Misha's pet Panda.\n*Zahrora, Zoomdust, and Zadazzle \u2013 three Zarahcorns.\n*Dahliza \u2013 Princess Adara's Zarahcorn.\n*Fuzzle Whuzzles \u2013 Little creatures in Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Azah \u2013 Rubi's Zarahcorn.\n\n==Production==\n''Shimmer and Shine'' is based on an unreleased pilot that took six months to develop in 2013, with a reported completion date of September 2013.

Leah reveals her genies' existence to Zac, who is given a genie of his own, named Kaz. Shimmer and Shine continue to grant Leah wishes in Zahramay Falls and befriend the sovereign of the land, Princess Samira. The season includes Samira's pet peacock, Roya and Leah's pet fox, Parisa. Also, Zeta, a villainous sorceress, and finally, Zeta's dragon, Nazboo.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n{{:List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Humans and genies===\n*Shimmer (voiced by [[Eva Bella]] in US, and [[Mia Wiltshire]] in UK) \u2013 An optimistic genie with blue eyes and pink hair. She is enthusiastic and encouraging. She loves cleaning, glitter, and collecting genie bottles. Her pet is a [[gibbon monkey]] named Tala.\n*Shine (voiced by [[Isabella Cramp]] in US, [[Elie Simons]] and [[Mia Hope]] in UK) \u2013 A courageous genie with purple eyes and blue hair. She is an animal lover and is often hungry. Her pet is a [[Bengal tiger]] cub named Nahal. Due to her love of animals, she is very knowledgeable about the behaviors of magical creatures native to Zahramay Falls. Unlike her sister, she hates cleaning. A running gag involves Shine saying \"It's like I always say...\" only to humorously reveal that she has just made up whatever she says next.\n*Leah (voiced by [[Alina Foley]] in US, and [[Claudia Burns]] in UK) \u2013 A blonde girl with green eyes who owns a genie bottle necklace, which includes Shimmer and Shine.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Sweetest Thing |minutes=3 |series=Shimmer and Shine |quote=Boom Zahramay! Your best friends are on the way.}}</ref> Although Shimmer and Shine usually mess up her wishes, Leah is patient and forgiving with them. Originally, she was forced to keep her genies' existence a secret from her close friend Zac, but revealed her secret to him after being transported to Zahramay Falls. In the second season, Princess Samira grants Leah and Zac's wish to visit Zahramay Falls whenever they want. While visiting her genies in Zahramay Falls, Leah magically dons a genie disguise in order to blend in, as humans are normally not allowed in Zahramay Falls.\n*Zac (voiced by [[Blake Bertrand]] in the first two seasons, [[Justin Felbinger]], and later [[Ethan Jones]] in season three and onward in US, and [[Innis Robertson-Pinnel]] in UK) \u2013 Leah's neighbor with red hair and blue eyes, and best human friend. In the first season, he is oblivious to the fact that Leah has genies. Whenever something strange or unusual happens, he responds to it in a carefree manner. He also has a habit of telling humorous experiences he has had to Leah. In the second season, he learns that Leah has genies and gets a genie of his own named Kaz.\n*Princess Samira (voiced by [[Nikki SooHoo]] in US, and [[Cariad Lloyd]] in UK) \u2013 The ruler of Zahramay Falls with violet eyes and ice blue hair with darker blue tips, who is in charge of checking up on all the genies in training. She can grant wishes along with the younger genies. She occasionally rewards genies with magic Genie Gems that can have a variety of magical effects. She acts as Shimmer and Shine's mentor and teacher. Despite Zeta being her self-proclaimed rival, Samira likes Zeta and is willing to give her a second chance at becoming a genie-in-training, which in season three is revealed to be due to her past friendship with Zeta when they were both students under Empress Caliana and hopes that Zeta and her can one day become friends again.\n*Zeta the Sorceress (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] in US & UK) \u2013 A resident of Zahramay Falls with green eyes and purple hair, who is Princess Samira's rival and wishes to replace her as the most powerful person in Zahramay Falls. Zeta is a sorceress instead of a genie, as she has no desire to grant the wishes of others, relying on magic potions and magical items. Her plans are almost always thwarted by Shimmer, Shine, and Leah. However, her own arrogance and ignorance can cause her to foil her own schemes as well. Despite the trouble she causes, the girls and Zac don't hold it against her and generally try to be friendly towards her when not foiling her schemes. Though she tends to be antagonistic towards Leah and her genies, she can be civil towards them at times and even work with them such when she finds herself and/or Nazboo in danger usually when her schemes backfire, which usually results in them saving her. Before becoming a sorceress, she was a genie-in-training under Empress Caliana along with Samira, whom Zeta befriended when she was a new student, though later quit school due to her jealousy of Samira and decided to become a sorceress instead, though despite her current rivalry with Samira is shown to cherish their past friendship as she held onto a feather pen Samira gave her when they first met along with a picture of the two of them together when they were both still friends.\n*Kaz (voiced by [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] in US, and [[Harrison Noble]] in UK) \u2013 A genie in training with blue eyes and magenta hair who becomes Zac's genie in the second season. In contrast to Zac's easy-going and adventurous personality, Kaz is more cautious and scared easily. Despite their contrasting personalities, Zac and Kaz work well together and can be brave when he has to be. His cautious nature also means he puts more thought into how he grants Zac's wishes. Like most genies in Zahramay Falls, he has his own magic carpet, though sometimes uses Zac's Super Zoom Flyer, a magic carpet wished up by Zac. Kaz has a pet Ziffilon named Zain, who summoned by one of Zac's wishes after he learned that Kaz always wanted a Ziffilon as a pet. Though he and Zac get along well, he occasionally becomes unenthusiastic when granting wishes for Zac he would prefer not too. He was initially afraid of Zac's dog Rocket due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though eventually overcame his fear after Zac and the girls reminded him of how other genies were initially scared of Zain before they got to know him.\n*Empress Caliana (voiced by [[Barbara Eden]]) \u2013 Princess Samira's famous, semi-retired mentor with purple eyes and blonde hair with pink tips. Caliana was the one who gave Samira her special necklace back when she was a little genie-in-training. Empress Caliana was a great explorer when she was a little girl and made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as finding the Caliana Caves. She is also old friends with Rohan, the normally shy crystalline golem that guards the caves. When Zeta and Samira were younger, Caliana taught genies-in-training at her school in Genie Hall, where Zeta was her top student. While praising Zeta's potion making skills, she tried to teach her to be more considerate of others and assigned Samira to sit next to Zeta when Samira was a new student which lead to Samira befriending Zeta, though Zeta eventually became jealous of Samira when she became the class's new top student, which eventually led Zeta to quit school and decide to become a Sorceress instead after her attempt to sabotage Samira backfired, though Caliana expressed hope to Samira that she would one day return. \n*Captain Zora (voiced by [[Kellie Pickler]] from the season two finale, [[Kate Higgins]] from season three and onward) \u2013 A pirate genie who is Shine's idol. She is absentminded at times and can be very clumsy and forgetful, especially when she is on an adventure. She owns a flying pirate ship that she sometimes accidentally docks in odd places. Shine loves pirate genies and Captain Zora is her favorite of them all, so she gets very nervous and sometimes cannot talk clearly when she is around Zora.\n*Layla (voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]) \u2013 An ice genie who is a good friend of Princess Samira. She possesses an ice gem necklace that gives her freezing powers and keeps her body cold. She originally lived in a genie bottle buried on a sandy beach in Zahramay Falls, but it was accidentally broken by Leah and her genies. She currently lives in an ice palace.\n*Shaya (voiced by [[Kin Santiago]] in Season 2 through 3 and [[Hudson West]]) \u2013 A lightning genie in training who rides around on a flying cloud-board and can generate magical lightning. Leah and her genies help him catch a run away magic lightning bolt he created while practicing his magic. Though he is reluctant to work with Leah and her genies at first, he eventually learns the value of teamwork from them.\n*Nila (voiced by [[Mila Brener]] in US, and [[Kimani Arthur]] in UK) \u2013 A mermaid who lives in the waters near Zahramay Falls. Leah and her genies befriend Nila after Leah wishes to find a Mermaid after learning they are real. She helps the girls obtain the Mermaid Gem to change the girls back to their non-mermaid selves after Leah accidentally uses up her wishes which leaves the girls trapped in Mermaid form. After Nila and the girls obtain the gem by befriending its lonely Guardian, she teaches them the spell to activate the gem's power which can both transform into Mermaids as well as undo the transformation allowing the girls to visit Nila and go on underwater adventures with her. \n*Imma  (voiced by [[Grace Kaufman]]) \u2013 The Waterfall Genie who oversees the source of the rainbow waterfalls of Zahramay Falls in Rainbow Zahramay. The girls befriend her after Samira sends them on their first adventure to Rainbow Zahramay to investigate the cause of a weird mist produced by the falls that disrupts magic in Zahramay Falls and help Imma resolve the problem.

She has a talent for playing the keyboard.\n*Rocket \u2013 Zac's pet beagle who appears in several episodes of the first season and reappears in the third season. He is a rambunctious dog with a tendency to drool and chew on things which often causes trouble, though is simply an overly playful pouch who means no real harm. He has encountered Shimmer, Shine, Tala, and Nahal at various times. The only pet native to Leah and Zac's world, he eventually is wished to Zahramay Falls by Zac though is mistakenly seen as a monster by genies like Kaz and animals native to genie world like Parisa and Zain who are unfamiliar with dogs at first due to dogs not being native to their world, with the exception of Shimmer, Shine, Tala, Nahal, and Samira. After helping Zac stop Zeta from stealing Samira's staff, Samira permits Rocket to accompany Zac when he visits Zahramay Falls. \n*Nazboo \u2013 Zeta's talking pet dragon, who caters to her every need and acts as Zeta's underling. He has teal scales, purple eyes, white horns, a white tummy, and blue toes. He is somewhat clumsy and often accidentally causes Zeta's schemes to backfire. He can also get easily distracted by food or anything that piques his interest. He also enjoys getting an occasional tummy rub from Zeta. Though he acts as Zeta's underling most of the time, he is friendly towards Leah, Zac, and their genies as well as their pets to the point he often greets them by saying \"''Hi, Friends!''\" even in the middle of one of Zeta's schemes. Unlike Zeta, he is generally more considerate of others and prefers to play fair in competitions though usually assists Zeta in cheating. In the third season, he is revealed to be from Manetikar, The Land of Dragons and befriended Zeta when she came to Manetikar to find a dragon for a pet. Feeling sorry for Zeta after her attempt to make one of the larger flying dragons her pet failed, he agreed to become her pet and went home with her to her lair in Zahramay Falls, where he has lived ever since. He has a sister and two brothers who resemble him in appearance and personality.\n*Roya \u2013 Princess Samira's pet peacock, who resides in her palace. Roya is the polar opposite of Shimmer and Shine's pets, as she would much rather show off her feathers or practice walking gracefully than play or dance. Unlike Samira, Roya has a strong dislike for Zeta and Nazboo, to the point of literally chasing them out of Samira's Palace on one occasion. Once a year, she sheds a special feather with the ability to repair any magical object. \n*Parisa \u2013 Leah's pet Zahramay fox who possesses the ability to camouflage herself, making her practically invisible, whenever she wants. she also has a talent for painting. Parisa is introduced midway through the second season. Like Kaz and Zain, she was initially scared of Rocket, due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though not to the same degree that Kaz and Zain were.\n*Zain \u2013 Kaz's pet Ziffilon (a griffin-like creature). Kaz had always wanted a pet Ziffilon before getting Zain, so Zac uses one of his wishes to wish up a Ziffilon for Kaz. Zain is by far the largest of the pets, as he is big enough for Kaz to ride on his back, though despite his size Zain gets scared easily even more so than Kaz. Like most Ziffilons his favorite food is Zlam Berries and is originally from Ziffilon Island. Though he gets along with the other pets, he is frightened by Rocket at first due to being unfamiliar with dogs though after Zac reminds Kaz and Zain how other genies were scared of Zain at first, he and Kaz manage to overcome their initial fear of Rocket. \n*Zoomicorns \u2013 Winged Unicorns native to Zahramay Falls and Rainbow Zahramay introduced in the second season. They are friendly and helpful creatures who occasionally aid the girls and allow them to ride them. There is also a game called Zoomicorn Toss, where players ride flying Zahramay Cloud Boards while trying to throw rings around a Zoomicorn's horn as it flies around, without the use of magic as using magic is considered unfair. The only known named Zoomicorn, is Gleam who lives in Rainbow Zahramay that is a friend of the Glitter Genie Afina whom the girls meet and befriend during one of their adventures in Rainbow Zahramay in the third season. \n*Scallywag \u2013 The magical pet of the Pirate Genie Captain Zora, who helps Zora remember things that she forgets such as names and the meaning of words and phrases used by pirates. Scallywag flies around by spinning her tail in helicopter like fashion. Her magic goes out of control when scared, causing random magic effects. \n*Nazboo's Family \u2013 Nazboo's three siblings Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank who are introduced in the third season. They are all small flightless dragons that resemble Nazboo in appearance and share his friendly, playful nature as well as his love of food and tummy rubs. Nazboo and his siblings tend to get into trouble when they are together, much to Zeta's frustration and annoyance. Nazboo's sister Razboo has purple scales and wears a dark pink bow on her head. His brother Kazboo has dark green scales and a purple mohawk, while his brother Frank has blue scales and wears a light pink bowtie.
