Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[soil fertility]].\nIn [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.\n\nA [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The [[ISO]] standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.\n\nIn astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.)

The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].<ref>[[OED]], s.v. \"year\", entry 2.b.: \"''transf.''  Applied to a very long period or cycle (in chronology or mythology, or vaguely in poetic use).\"</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nEnglish ''year'' (via [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] ''\u0121\u0113ar'' ({{IPA|/j\u025bar/}}), [[Anglian dialects|Anglian]] ''\u0121\u0113r'') continues [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*j\u01e3ran'' (''*j[[Proto-Germanic language#\u0113\u2081 and \u0113\u2082|\u0113\u2081]]<nowiki>ran</nowiki>'').\nCognates are [[German language|German]] ''Jahr'', [[Old High German]] ''j\u0101r'', [[Old Norse]] ''\u00e1r'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''[[:wikt:\ud800\udf3e\ud800\udf34\ud800\udf42|jer]]'',<!--(Gothic ''e'' is always a long vowel)--> from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] noun ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh\u2081-|*yeh\u2081r-om]]}}'' \"year, season\". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''y\u0101r\u01dd'' \"year\", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f65\u03c1\u03b1}} (h\u1e53ra) \"year, season, period of time\" (whence \"[[hour]]\"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jar\u016d'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' \"of this year\". <!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2081ey-]] \"go\", needs reference to deal with the \"laryingealistic\" problems-->\n\nLatin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''ann\u012b'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''ann\u014d'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h\u2082et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''a\u00fen'' \"year\" (only the dative plural ''a\u00fenam'' is attested).\n\nAlthough most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh\u2081r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-'' and ''*h\u2082et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning \"to go, move\", ''*h\u2081ey-'' and ''*h\u2082et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''\u00e9ti'' \"goes\", ''atasi'' \"thou goest, wanderest\").\nA number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means \"each year\", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means \"in the year of the Lord\".\n\nThe Greek word for \"year\", {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' \"old\", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' \"year\", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' \"year\" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' \"yearling (calf)\", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' \"bull calf\",  English ''wether'' \"ram\" (Old English ''we\u00f0er'', Gothic ''wi\u00ferus'' \"lamb\").\n\nIn some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in \"summers\", or \"winters\", or \"harvests\". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:\u5e74|\u5e74]] \"year\", originally [[:wikt:\u79c2|\u79c2]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting \"harvest\". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god\u044a|god\u016d]]'' \"time period; year\" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/l\u011bto|l\u011bto]]'' \"summer; year\".\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.\n\n== Intercalation ==\nAstronomical years do not have an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months. Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.\n\n=== Julian calendar ===\nIn the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name \"[[Leap Day]]\" is applied to the added day.\n\nThe [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es,\nhas 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9\u00b710<sup>\u22128</sup>).\nIn the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.<ref>Shields, Miriam Nancy.

It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.\n\n===Other calendars===\n{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}\nHistorically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.\nLunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).\n\nA modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.\n\n==Year numbering==\nA [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.\n\nThe worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]], although some prefer the term [[Common Era]] because it has no explicit reference to [[Christianity]]. It was introduced in the 6th century and was intended to count years from the [[nativity of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P.K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly say that Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does say on page 585 that the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes.</ref>\n\nThe Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] \"in the year of the Lord\"), or alternatively CE for \"[[Common Era]]\". Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].\nYear numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no \"year zero\".\nIn the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], \u22121 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.\n\n==Pragmatic divisions==\nFinancial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.\n\n=== Fiscal year ===\nA [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.\n\nFor example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.\n\n=== Academic year ===\nAn academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].\n\nSome schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.\n\nSome other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.\n\nThere are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.\n\nIn India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nSchools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.\n\n== Astronomical years == <!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] -->\n{{see also|Astronomical month}}\n\n=== Julian year ===\n{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}\nThe Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" (symbol \"a\" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many \"real\" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].\n\nIn the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a<sub>j</sub>'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.\n\n:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a<sub>j</sub> = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]\n\nThe [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.\n\n=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===\n{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}\n\nEach of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.\n\nThe [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).<ref>International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service.

The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is\n:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\nThis term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Full moon cycle ===\nThe [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit.

The duration of one full moon cycle is:\n:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Lunar year ===\nThe [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].\nA Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.\n\n=== Vague year ===\nThe vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Ethiopian calendar|Ethiopia]], [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].<ref>[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center</ref>   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.\n\n=== Heliacal year ===\nA heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Sothic year ===\nThe [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.\n\n=== Gaussian year ===\nThe [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:\n:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).\n\n=== Besselian year === <!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] -->\nThe [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280\u00b0. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [[Friedrich Bessel]]. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):<ref>\n{{cite book\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010\n |year=2008\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = B3\n|title-link=Astronomical Almanac\n }}</ref>\n: B = 1900.0 + (Julian date<sub>TT</sub> \u2212 {{val|2415020.31352}}) / {{val|365.242198781}}\n\nThe TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale, or its predecessor, [[ephemeris time]].<!-- Capitalization follows that of the glossary of the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010'' -->\n\n=== Variation in the length of the year and the day ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\nThe exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.\n* The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [[precession]], and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets.  Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a \"tropical year\" measured from one passage of the northward (\"vernal\") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward (\"autumnal\") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.\n* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.\n* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].\n\n==== Numerical value of year variation ====\n\nMean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years.

The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with \"a\" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10<sup>3</sup> years), Mega-annus (10<sup>6</sup> years), and Giga-annus (10<sup>9</sup> years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The \"present\" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as \"ago\" or \"before the present\" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates).

Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[soil fertility]].\nIn [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.\n\nA [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The [[ISO]] standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.\n\nIn astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.)

The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].<ref>[[OED]], s.v. \"year\", entry 2.b.: \"''transf.''  Applied to a very long period or cycle (in chronology or mythology, or vaguely in poetic use).\"</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nEnglish ''year'' (via [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] ''\u0121\u0113ar'' ({{IPA|/j\u025bar/}}), [[Anglian dialects|Anglian]] ''\u0121\u0113r'') continues [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*j\u01e3ran'' (''*j[[Proto-Germanic language#\u0113\u2081 and \u0113\u2082|\u0113\u2081]]<nowiki>ran</nowiki>'').\nCognates are [[German language|German]] ''Jahr'', [[Old High German]] ''j\u0101r'', [[Old Norse]] ''\u00e1r'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''[[:wikt:\ud800\udf3e\ud800\udf34\ud800\udf42|jer]]'',<!--(Gothic ''e'' is always a long vowel)--> from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] noun ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh\u2081-|*yeh\u2081r-om]]}}'' \"year, season\". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''y\u0101r\u01dd'' \"year\", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f65\u03c1\u03b1}} (h\u1e53ra) \"year, season, period of time\" (whence \"[[hour]]\"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jar\u016d'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' \"of this year\". <!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2081ey-]] \"go\", needs reference to deal with the \"laryingealistic\" problems-->\n\nLatin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''ann\u012b'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''ann\u014d'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h\u2082et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''a\u00fen'' \"year\" (only the dative plural ''a\u00fenam'' is attested).\n\nAlthough most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh\u2081r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-'' and ''*h\u2082et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning \"to go, move\", ''*h\u2081ey-'' and ''*h\u2082et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''\u00e9ti'' \"goes\", ''atasi'' \"thou goest, wanderest\").\nA number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means \"each year\", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means \"in the year of the Lord\".\n\nThe Greek word for \"year\", {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' \"old\", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' \"year\", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' \"year\" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' \"yearling (calf)\", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' \"bull calf\",  English ''wether'' \"ram\" (Old English ''we\u00f0er'', Gothic ''wi\u00ferus'' \"lamb\").\n\nIn some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in \"summers\", or \"winters\", or \"harvests\". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:\u5e74|\u5e74]] \"year\", originally [[:wikt:\u79c2|\u79c2]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting \"harvest\". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god\u044a|god\u016d]]'' \"time period; year\" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/l\u011bto|l\u011bto]]'' \"summer; year\".\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.\n\n== Intercalation ==\nAstronomical years do not have an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months. Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.\n\n=== Julian calendar ===\nIn the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name \"[[Leap Day]]\" is applied to the added day.\n\nThe [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es,\nhas 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9\u00b710<sup>\u22128</sup>).\nIn the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.<ref>Shields, Miriam Nancy.

It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.\n\n===Other calendars===\n{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}\nHistorically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.\nLunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).\n\nA modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.\n\n==Year numbering==\nA [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.\n\nThe worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]], although some prefer the term [[Common Era]] because it has no explicit reference to [[Christianity]]. It was introduced in the 6th century and was intended to count years from the [[nativity of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P.K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly say that Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does say on page 585 that the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes.</ref>\n\nThe Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] \"in the year of the Lord\"), or alternatively CE for \"[[Common Era]]\". Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].\nYear numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no \"year zero\".\nIn the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], \u22121 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.\n\n==Pragmatic divisions==\nFinancial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.\n\n=== Fiscal year ===\nA [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.\n\nFor example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.\n\n=== Academic year ===\nAn academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].\n\nSome schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.\n\nSome other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.\n\nThere are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.\n\nIn India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nSchools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.\n\n== Astronomical years == <!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] -->\n{{see also|Astronomical month}}\n\n=== Julian year ===\n{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}\nThe Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" (symbol \"a\" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many \"real\" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].\n\nIn the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a<sub>j</sub>'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.\n\n:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a<sub>j</sub> = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]\n\nThe [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.\n\n=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===\n{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}\n\nEach of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.\n\nThe [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).<ref>International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service.

The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#y\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2011\n |year=2009\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = M18 (Glossary)\n}}</ref> (= 365.24219 days of 86400 SI seconds)\n\nThe anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 5, 07:48 UT in 2020), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 11:35 UT in 2020). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.

The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is\n:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\nThis term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Full moon cycle ===\nThe [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:\n:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Lunar year ===\nThe [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].\nA Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.\n\n=== Vague year ===\nThe vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Ethiopian calendar|Ethiopia]], [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].<ref>[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center</ref>   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.\n\n=== Heliacal year ===\nA heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Sothic year ===\nThe [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.\n\n=== Gaussian year ===\nThe [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance.

Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a \"tropical year\" measured from one passage of the northward (\"vernal\") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward (\"autumnal\") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.\n* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.\n* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].\n\n==== Numerical value of year variation ====\n\nMean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years.

The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with \"a\" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10<sup>3</sup> years), Mega-annus (10<sup>6</sup> years), and Giga-annus (10<sup>9</sup> years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The \"present\" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as \"ago\" or \"before the present\" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates).

Compare to the 47%, less rDNA in [[Sarcophaga barbata]] ovaries.\n*It has only four pairs of [[chromosomes]] \u2013 three [[autosome]]s, and one pair of [[XY sex-determination system|sex chromosomes]].\n*Males do not show meiotic [[Meiotic recombination|recombination]], facilitating genetic studies.\n*Recessive lethal \"[[balancer chromosomes]]\" carrying visible genetic markers can be used to keep stocks of [[lethal alleles]] in a heterozygous state without recombination due to multiple inversions in the balancer.\n*The development of this organism\u2014from fertilized egg to mature adult\u2014is well understood.\n*Genetic transformation techniques have been available since 1987.\n*Its complete [[genome]] was [[Genome project|sequenced]] and first published in 2000.<ref name=Adams_2000>{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams MD, Celniker SE, Holt RA, Evans CA, Gocayne JD, Amanatides PG, etal | title = The genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Science | volume = 287 | issue = 5461 | pages = 2185\u201395 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10731132 | doi = 10.1126/science.287.5461.2185 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.549.8639 | bibcode = 2000Sci...287.2185. }}</ref>\n*Sexual mosaics can be readily produced, providing an additional tool for studying the development and behavior of these flies.<ref name=\"Hotta_1972\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hotta Y, Benzer S | title = Mapping of behaviour in Drosophila mosaics | journal = Nature | volume = 240 | issue = 5383 | pages = 527\u201335 | date = December 1972 | pmid = 4568399 | doi = 10.1038/240527a0 | bibcode = 1972Natur.240..527H }}</ref>\n*\n\n=== Genetic markers ===\nGenetic markers are commonly used in ''Drosophila'' research, for example within balancer chromosomes or P-element inserts, and most phenotypes are easily identifiable either with the naked eye or under a microscope.

It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a [[syncytium]].\n[[File:Drosophila m oogenesis.png|left|thumb|''D. melanogaster'' [[oogenesis]]]]\nDuring oogenesis, cytoplasmic bridges called \"ring canals\" connect the forming oocyte to nurse cells. Nutrients and developmental control molecules move from the nurse cells into the oocyte. In the figure to the left, the forming oocyte can be seen to be covered by follicular support cells.\n\nAfter fertilization of the oocyte, the early embryo (or [[syncytium|syncytial embryo]]) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By the end of the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, [[gastrulation]] starts.<ref name=\"flymove\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weigmann K, Klapper R, Strasser T, Rickert C, Technau G, J\u00e4ckle H, Janning W, Kl\u00e4mbt C | display-authors = 6 | title = FlyMove--a new way to look at development of Drosophila | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 310\u20131 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12801722 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-9525(03)00050-7 }}</ref>\n\nNuclear division in the early ''Drosophila'' embryo happens so quickly, no proper checkpoints exist, so mistakes may be made in division of the DNA. To get around this problem, the nuclei that have made a mistake detach from their [[centrosome]]s and fall into the centre of the embryo (yolk sac), which will not form part of the fly.\n\nThe gene network (transcriptional and protein interactions) governing the early development of the fruit fly embryo is one of the best understood gene networks to date, especially the patterning along the anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes (See under [[Morphogenesis#Anterior-posterior axis patterning in Drosophila|morphogenesis]]).<ref name=\"flymove\"/>\n\nThe embryo undergoes well-characterized [[morphogenesis|morphogenetic]] movements during gastrulation and early development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the mesoderm, and posterior and anterior invagination of endoderm (gut), as well as extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first-instar larva.\n\nDuring larval development, tissues known as [[imaginal disc]]s grow inside the larva. Imaginal discs develop to form most structures of the adult body, such as the head, legs, wings, thorax, and genitalia. Cells of the imaginal disks are set aside during embryogenesis and continue to grow and divide during the larval stages\u2014unlike most other cells of the larva, which have differentiated to perform specialized functions and grow without further cell division. At metamorphosis, the larva forms a [[pupa]], inside which the larval tissues are reabsorbed and the imaginal tissues undergo extensive morphogenetic movements to form adult structures.\n\n=== Developmental plasticity ===\nAs in most insects,<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Abram PK, Boivin G, Moiroux J, Brodeur J | title = Behavioural effects of temperature on ectothermic animals: unifying thermal physiology and behavioural plasticity | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 1859\u20131876 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28980433 | doi = 10.1111/brv.12312 }}</ref> environmental factors such as temperature can influence development in ''Drosophila melanogaster''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibert P, Huey RB, Gilchrist GW | title = Locomotor performance of Drosophila melanogaster: interactions among developmental and adult temperatures, age, and geography | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 205\u20139 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11263741 | doi = 10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb01286.x }}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Zamudio|first=Kelly R.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Crill|first3=Wayne D. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1995|title=Bigger isn't always better: body size, developmental and parental temperature and male territorial success in Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=49|issue=3|pages=671\u2013677|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80200-2|issn=0003-3472}}</ref> For example, temperature can lead to [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] variation, such as larger or smaller body sizes, via [[developmental plasticity]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = West-Eberhard MJ | title = Developmental plasticity and the origin of species differences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 Suppl 1 | issue = suppl 1 | pages = 6543\u20139 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851679 | pmc = 1131862 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501844102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6543W }}</ref> Temperature-induced developmental plasticity can be beneficial and/or detrimental.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Crill|first=Wayne D.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Gilchrist|first3=George W.|date=1996|title=Within- and Between-Generation Effects of Temperature on the Morphology and Physiology of Drosophila melanogaster|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2410661|journal=Evolution|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1205\u20131218|doi=10.2307/2410661|issn=0014-3820}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=David|first=J.

Unlike humans, the Y chromosome does not confer maleness; rather, it encodes genes necessary for making sperm. Sex is instead determined by the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes. Furthermore, each cell \"decides\" whether to be male or female independently of the rest of the organism, resulting in the occasional occurrence of [[gynandromorph]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! X Chromosomes !! Autosomes !! Ratio of X:A !! Sex\n|-\n| XXXX || AAAA || 1 || Normal Female\n|-\n| XXX || AAA || 1 || Normal Female\n|-\n| XXY || AA || 1 || Normal Female\n|-\n| XXYY || AA || 1 || Normal Female\n|-\n| XX || AA || 1 || Normal Female\n|-\n| XY || AA || 0.50 || Normal Male\n|-\n| X || AA || 0.50 || Normal Male (sterile)\n|-\n| XXX || AA || 1.50 || [[Metafemale]]\n|-\n| XXXX || AAA || 1.33 || Metafemale\n|-\n| XX || AAA || 0.66 || [[gynandromorph|Intersex]]\n|-\n| X || AAA || 0.33 || [[Metamale]]\n|}\n\nThree major genes are involved in determination of ''Drosophila'' sex. These are ''sex-lethal, sisterless'', and ''deadpan''. Deadpan is an autosomal gene which inhibits ''sex-lethal'', while ''sisterless'' is carried on the X chromosome and inhibits the action of ''deadpan''. An AAX cell has twice as much ''deadpan'' as ''sisterless'', so ''sex-lethal'' will be inhibited, creating a male. However, an AAXX cell will produce enough ''sisterless'' to inhibit the action of ''deadpan'', allowing the ''sex-lethal'' gene to be transcribed to create a female.\n\nLater, control by ''deadpan'' and ''sisterless'' disappears and what becomes important is the form of the ''sex-lethal'' gene. A secondary promoter causes transcription in both males and females. Analysis of the [[cDNA]] has shown that different forms are expressed in males and females. ''Sex-lethal'' has been shown to affect the [[RNA splicing|splicing]] of its own [[mRNA]]. In males, the third [[exon]] is included which encodes a [[stop codon]], causing a truncated form to be produced. In the female version, the presence of ''sex-lethal'' causes this exon to be missed out; the other seven [[amino acids]] are produced as a full [[peptide]] chain, again giving a difference between males and females.<ref name=Sin_2000>{{cite book | vauthors = Gilbert SF | title = Developmental Biology | url = https://archive.org/details/developmentalbio00gilb | url-access = registration | edition = 6th | location = Sunderland (MA) | publisher = Sinauer Associates; 2000 |year=2000 }}</ref>\n\nPresence or absence of functional sex-lethal proteins now go on to affect the transcription of another protein known as doublesex. In the absence of sex-lethal, doublesex will have the fourth exon removed and be translated up to and including exon 6 (DSX-M[ale]), while in its presence the fourth exon which encodes a stop codon will produce a truncated version of the protein (DSX-F[emale]). DSX-F causes transcription of Yolk proteins 1 and 2 in [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells, which will be pumped into the [[oocyte]] on its production.\n\n== Immunity ==\n[[File:Toll Pathway of Drosophila melanogaster.jpg|thumb|right|The Toll pathway as found in the fruit fly<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lemaitre B, Hoffmann J | title = The host defense of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 25 | pages = 697\u2013743 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17201680 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.25.022106.141615 | url = http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/151765 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Valanne S, Wang JH, R\u00e4met M | title = The Drosophila Toll signaling pathway | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 186 | issue = 2 | pages = 649\u201356 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21209287 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.1002302 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"Dudzic2019\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dudzic JP, Hanson MA, Iatsenko I, Kondo S, Lemaitre B | title = More Than Black or White: Melanization and Toll Share Regulatory Serine Proteases in Drosophila | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 1050\u20131061.e3 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 31018123 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.03.101 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanson MA, Hamilton PT, Perlman SJ | title = Immune genes and divergent antimicrobial peptides in flies of the subgenus Drosophila | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 228 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27776480 | pmc = 5078906 | doi = 10.1186/s12862-016-0805-y }}</ref>]]\nUnlike mammals, ''Drosophila'' flies only have [[innate immunity]] and lack an adaptive immune response. The ''D. melanogaster'' immune system can be divided into two responses: humoral and cell-mediated. The former is a systemic response mediated through the ''[[Toll (gene)|Toll]]'' and [[Imd pathway|''Imd'']] pathways, which are parallel systems for detecting microbes. The ''Toll'' pathway in ''Drosophila'' is known as the homologue of ''Toll-like'' pathways in mammals. Spatzle, a known ligand for the ''Toll'' pathway in flies, is produced in response to [[Gram-positive bacteria]], parasites, and fungal infection. Upon infection, pro-Spatzle will be cleaved by the protease SPE (Spatzle processing enzyme) to become active Spatzle, which then binds to the ''Toll'' receptor located on the cell surface (Fat body, hemocytes) and dimerizes for activation of downstream [[NF-\u03baB]] signaling pathways. It has been proposed that a second SPE-like enzyme similarly acts to activate Spatzle, as loss of SPE does not completely reduce the activity of Toll signalling.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamoto-Hino M, Goto S | title = Sp\u00e4tzle-Processing Enzyme-independent Activation of the Toll Pathway in Drosophila Innate Immunity | journal = Cell Structure and Function | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201360 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26843333 | doi = 10.1247/csf.16002 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"Dudzic2019\"/> The [[Imd pathway]] is instead triggered by [[Gram-negative bacteria]] through soluble and surface receptors (PGRP-LE and LC, respectively). ''D. melanogaster'' has a [[fat body]], which is [[Homology (biology)#Homology vs analogy|analogous]] to the human liver. It is the primary secretory organ and produces [[antimicrobial peptides]]. These peptides are secreted into the [[hemolymph]] and bind infectious bacteria, killing them by forming pores in their [[cell wall]]s. Other than the fat body, hemocytes, the blood cells in ''Drosophila'', are analogous to mammalian monocyte/macrophages, possessing a significant role in mediating immune responses.\n\nIt is known from the literature that in response to immune challenge, hemocytes are able to secrete cytokines, for example Spatzle, to activate downstream signaling pathways in the fat body. However, the mechanism still remains unclear. The response to infection can involve up to 2,423 genes, or 13.7% of the genome. Although the fly's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens, ''Drosophila'' differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria. This core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response, stress response, secretion, neuron-like, reproduction, and metabolism among others.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Troha K, Im JH, Revah J, Lazzaro BP, Buchon N | title = Comparative transcriptomics reveals CrebA as a novel regulator of infection tolerance in D. melanogaster | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = e1006847 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29394281 | pmc = 5812652 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006847 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Gregorio |first1=E |last2=Spellman |first2=PT |last3=Tzou |first3=P |last4=Rubin |first4=GM |last5=Lemaitre |first5=B |title=The Toll and Imd pathways are the major regulators of the immune response in Drosophila |journal=EMBO |date=2002 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=2568\u20132579 |doi=10.1093/emboj/21.11.2568 |pmid=12032070|pmc=126042 }}</ref> ''Drosophila'' also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli.

Wild-type flies show an [[Drosophila circadian rhythm|activity rhythm]] with a frequency of about a day (24 hours). They found mutants with faster and slower rhythms, as well as broken rhythms\u2014flies that move and rest in random spurts. Work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations (and others like them) affect a group of genes and their products that form a biochemical or [[Circadian rhythm|biological clock]]. This clock is found in a wide range of fly cells, but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly's central brain.\n\nSince then, Benzer and others have used behavioral screens to isolate genes involved in vision, olfaction, audition, learning/memory, courtship, pain, and other processes, such as longevity.\n\nFollowing the pioneering work of [[Alfred Sturtevant|Alfred Henry Sturtevant]] <ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Sturtevant AH | date = 1929 | title = The claret mutant type of Drosophila simulans: a study of chromosome elimination and cell-lineage|url=|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Wissenschaftliche Zoologie|volume=135|pages=323\u2013356|via=}}</ref> and others, Benzer and colleagues<ref name=\"Hotta_1972\" /> used sexual mosaics to develop a novel [[fate mapping]] technique.

Metarhodopsin activates Gq, which in turn activates a [[phospholipase]] C\u03b2 (PLC\u03b2) known as NorpA.<ref name=Raghu_2000>{{cite journal | vauthors = Raghu P, Colley NJ, Webel R, James T, Hasan G, Danin M, Selinger Z, Hardie RC | display-authors = 6 | title = Normal phototransduction in Drosophila photoreceptors lacking an InsP(3) receptor gene | journal = Molecular and Cellular Neurosciences | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 429\u201345 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10833300 | doi = 10.1006/mcne.2000.0846 }}</ref>\n\nPLC\u03b2 hydrolyzes [[phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate]] (PIP<sub>2</sub>), a [[phospholipid]] found in the [[cell membrane]], into soluble [[inositol triphosphate]] (IP<sub>3</sub>) and [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]] (DAG), which stays in the cell membrane.

InaD contains five binding domains called [[PDZ domain]] proteins, which specifically bind the C termini of target proteins. Disruption of the complex by mutations in either the PDZ domains or the target proteins reduces the efficiency of signaling.

''D. melanogaster'' males show little to no preference for ''D. melanogaster'' females over females of other species or even other male flies. However, after ''D. simulans'' or other flies incapable of copulation have rejected the males\u2019 advances, ''D. melanogaster'' males are much less likely to spend time courting nonspecifically in the future.

It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a [[syncytium]].\n[[File:Drosophila m oogenesis.png|left|thumb|''D. melanogaster'' [[oogenesis]]]]\nDuring oogenesis, cytoplasmic bridges called \"ring canals\" connect the forming oocyte to nurse cells. Nutrients and developmental control molecules move from the nurse cells into the oocyte. In the figure to the left, the forming oocyte can be seen to be covered by follicular support cells.\n\nAfter fertilization of the oocyte, the early embryo (or [[syncytium|syncytial embryo]]) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By the end of the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, [[gastrulation]] starts.<ref name=\"flymove\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weigmann K, Klapper R, Strasser T, Rickert C, Technau G, J\u00e4ckle H, Janning W, Kl\u00e4mbt C | display-authors = 6 | title = FlyMove--a new way to look at development of Drosophila | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 310\u20131 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12801722 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-9525(03)00050-7 }}</ref>\n\nNuclear division in the early ''Drosophila'' embryo happens so quickly, no proper checkpoints exist, so mistakes may be made in division of the DNA. To get around this problem, the nuclei that have made a mistake detach from their [[centrosome]]s and fall into the centre of the embryo (yolk sac), which will not form part of the fly.\n\nThe gene network (transcriptional and protein interactions) governing the early development of the fruit fly embryo is one of the best understood gene networks to date, especially the patterning along the anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes (See under [[Morphogenesis#Anterior-posterior axis patterning in Drosophila|morphogenesis]]).<ref name=\"flymove\"/>\n\nThe embryo undergoes well-characterized [[morphogenesis|morphogenetic]] movements during gastrulation and early development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the mesoderm, and posterior and anterior invagination of endoderm (gut), as well as extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first-instar larva.\n\nDuring larval development, tissues known as [[imaginal disc]]s grow inside the larva. Imaginal discs develop to form most structures of the adult body, such as the head, legs, wings, thorax, and genitalia. Cells of the imaginal disks are set aside during embryogenesis and continue to grow and divide during the larval stages\u2014unlike most other cells of the larva, which have differentiated to perform specialized functions and grow without further cell division. At metamorphosis, the larva forms a [[pupa]], inside which the larval tissues are reabsorbed and the imaginal tissues undergo extensive morphogenetic movements to form adult structures.\n\n=== Developmental plasticity ===\nAs in most insects,<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Abram PK, Boivin G, Moiroux J, Brodeur J | title = Behavioural effects of temperature on ectothermic animals: unifying thermal physiology and behavioural plasticity | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 1859\u20131876 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28980433 | doi = 10.1111/brv.12312 }}</ref> environmental factors such as temperature can influence development in ''Drosophila melanogaster''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibert P, Huey RB, Gilchrist GW | title = Locomotor performance of Drosophila melanogaster: interactions among developmental and adult temperatures, age, and geography | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 205\u20139 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11263741 | doi = 10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb01286.x }}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Zamudio|first=Kelly R.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Crill|first3=Wayne D. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1995|title=Bigger isn't always better: body size, developmental and parental temperature and male territorial success in Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=49|issue=3|pages=671\u2013677|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80200-2|issn=0003-3472}}</ref> For example, temperature can lead to [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] variation, such as larger or smaller body sizes, via [[developmental plasticity]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = West-Eberhard MJ | title = Developmental plasticity and the origin of species differences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 Suppl 1 | issue = suppl 1 | pages = 6543\u20139 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851679 | pmc = 1131862 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501844102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6543W }}</ref> Temperature-induced developmental plasticity can be beneficial and/or detrimental.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Crill|first=Wayne D.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Gilchrist|first3=George W.|date=1996|title=Within- and Between-Generation Effects of Temperature on the Morphology and Physiology of Drosophila melanogaster|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2410661|journal=Evolution|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1205\u20131218|doi=10.2307/2410661|issn=0014-3820}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=David|first=J.

Unlike humans, the Y chromosome does not confer maleness; rather, it encodes genes necessary for making sperm. Sex is instead determined by the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes. Furthermore, each cell \"decides\" whether to be male or female independently of the rest of the organism, resulting in the occasional occurrence of [[gynandromorph]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! X Chromosomes !! Autosomes !! Ratio of X:A !! Sex\n|-\n| XXXX || AAAA || 1 || Normal Female\n|-\n| XXX || AAA || 1 || Normal Female\n|-\n| XXY || AA || 1 || Normal Female\n|-\n| XXYY || AA || 1 || Normal Female\n|-\n| XX || AA || 1 || Normal Female\n|-\n| XY || AA || 0.50 || Normal Male\n|-\n| X || AA || 0.50 || Normal Male (sterile)\n|-\n| XXX || AA || 1.50 || [[Metafemale]]\n|-\n| XXXX || AAA || 1.33 || Metafemale\n|-\n| XX || AAA || 0.66 || [[gynandromorph|Intersex]]\n|-\n| X || AAA || 0.33 || [[Metamale]]\n|}\n\nThree major genes are involved in determination of ''Drosophila'' sex. These are ''sex-lethal, sisterless'', and ''deadpan''. Deadpan is an autosomal gene which inhibits ''sex-lethal'', while ''sisterless'' is carried on the X chromosome and inhibits the action of ''deadpan''. An AAX cell has twice as much ''deadpan'' as ''sisterless'', so ''sex-lethal'' will be inhibited, creating a male. However, an AAXX cell will produce enough ''sisterless'' to inhibit the action of ''deadpan'', allowing the ''sex-lethal'' gene to be transcribed to create a female.\n\nLater, control by ''deadpan'' and ''sisterless'' disappears and what becomes important is the form of the ''sex-lethal'' gene. A secondary promoter causes transcription in both males and females. Analysis of the [[cDNA]] has shown that different forms are expressed in males and females. ''Sex-lethal'' has been shown to affect the [[RNA splicing|splicing]] of its own [[mRNA]]. In males, the third [[exon]] is included which encodes a [[stop codon]], causing a truncated form to be produced.

The ''D. melanogaster'' immune system can be divided into two responses: humoral and cell-mediated. The former is a systemic response mediated through the ''[[Toll (gene)|Toll]]'' and [[Imd pathway|''Imd'']] pathways, which are parallel systems for detecting microbes. The ''Toll'' pathway in ''Drosophila'' is known as the homologue of ''Toll-like'' pathways in mammals. Spatzle, a known ligand for the ''Toll'' pathway in flies, is produced in response to [[Gram-positive bacteria]], parasites, and fungal infection. Upon infection, pro-Spatzle will be cleaved by the protease SPE (Spatzle processing enzyme) to become active Spatzle, which then binds to the ''Toll'' receptor located on the cell surface (Fat body, hemocytes) and dimerizes for activation of downstream [[NF-\u03baB]] signaling pathways. It has been proposed that a second SPE-like enzyme similarly acts to activate Spatzle, as loss of SPE does not completely reduce the activity of Toll signalling.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamoto-Hino M, Goto S | title = Sp\u00e4tzle-Processing Enzyme-independent Activation of the Toll Pathway in Drosophila Innate Immunity | journal = Cell Structure and Function | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201360 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26843333 | doi = 10.1247/csf.16002 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"Dudzic2019\"/> The [[Imd pathway]] is instead triggered by [[Gram-negative bacteria]] through soluble and surface receptors (PGRP-LE and LC, respectively). ''D. melanogaster'' has a [[fat body]], which is [[Homology (biology)#Homology vs analogy|analogous]] to the human liver. It is the primary secretory organ and produces [[antimicrobial peptides]]. These peptides are secreted into the [[hemolymph]] and bind infectious bacteria, killing them by forming pores in their [[cell wall]]s. Other than the fat body, hemocytes, the blood cells in ''Drosophila'', are analogous to mammalian monocyte/macrophages, possessing a significant role in mediating immune responses.\n\nIt is known from the literature that in response to immune challenge, hemocytes are able to secrete cytokines, for example Spatzle, to activate downstream signaling pathways in the fat body. However, the mechanism still remains unclear. The response to infection can involve up to 2,423 genes, or 13.7% of the genome. Although the fly's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens, ''Drosophila'' differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria. This core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response, stress response, secretion, neuron-like, reproduction, and metabolism among others.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Troha K, Im JH, Revah J, Lazzaro BP, Buchon N | title = Comparative transcriptomics reveals CrebA as a novel regulator of infection tolerance in D. melanogaster | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = e1006847 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29394281 | pmc = 5812652 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006847 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Gregorio |first1=E |last2=Spellman |first2=PT |last3=Tzou |first3=P |last4=Rubin |first4=GM |last5=Lemaitre |first5=B |title=The Toll and Imd pathways are the major regulators of the immune response in Drosophila |journal=EMBO |date=2002 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=2568\u20132579 |doi=10.1093/emboj/21.11.2568 |pmid=12032070|pmc=126042 }}</ref> ''Drosophila'' also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli.

Some categories such as \"Actors, actresses, comedians and directors\" are relative since a subject who is a comedian may also be an actor or director. In some cases a subject may be notable in more than one field, such as [[Luis A. Ferr\u00e9]], who is notable both as a former governor and as an industrialist. However, the custom is to place the subject's name under the category for which he/she is most noted.\n\nAs of 2019, this list will be carefully maintained, and adding or deleting a name without first discussing the change on the article's talk page is likely to be reverted. This list should contain the names of persons who meet the pre-established [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Puerto Rico/Notability Criteria|Notability criteria]], even if the person does not have an article yet. Additions to the list must be listed in the section which best describes the field for which the person is most notable and in alphabetical order by surname. Each addition to the list must also provide a reliable verifiable source which cites the person's notability and/or the person's link to Puerto Rico, otherwise the name will be removed.\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Actors, actresses, comedians and directors==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Auli'i Cravalho]]]]\n[[File:Henry Darrow.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Henry Darrow]]]][[File:Joaquin Cannes 20002 cropped.jpg|140px|thumb|[[Joaquin Phoenix]]]][[File:Benicio Del Toro - Guardians of the Galaxy premiere - July 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|140px|[[Benicio del Toro]]]][[File:Erik Estrada.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Erik Estrada]]]]\n[[File:Jose Ferrer in Caine Mutiny.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]]]][[File:Juano hernandez in intruder in the dust.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Juano Hern\u00e1ndez]]]]\n[[File:Jennifer Lopez 2, 2012.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Jennifer Lopez]]]]\n[[File:Rita Moreno (1963).jpg|thumb|140px|[[Rita Moreno]]]]\n[[File:Lymari Nadal.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Lymari Nadal]]]]\n[[File:Lin-Manuel Miranda WH.png|thumb|209x209px|[[Lin-Manuel Miranda]]]]\n[[File:Rosie Perez 2012.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Rosie Perez]]]]\n[[File:Marquita Rivera 3.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Marquita Rivera]]]]\n[[File:Jon Seda.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Jon Seda]]]]\n[[File:JimmySmits07TIFF.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Jimmy Smits]]]][[File:Liz Torres 94.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Liz Torres]]]]\n[[File:David Zayas.jpg|thumb|140px|[[David Zayas]]]]\n\n\n'''A'''\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kirk Acevedo]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot]] (a.k.a. \"Don Cholito\"), comedian\n* [[Jorge Alberti]], actor\n* [[Trini Alvarado]], actress \n* [[Miguel \u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez]], actor and comedian\n* [[La La Anthony]], actress, MTV VJ\n* [[Marc Anthony]], singer and actor\n* [[Victor Argo|V\u00edctor Argo]], actor \n* [[Yancey Arias]], actor \n* [[Raymond Arrieta]], comedian and television host\n* [[Miguel Arteta]], film/television director<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/filmstudies/video-arteta.html |title=Miguel Arteta - Wesleyan University |website=Wesleyan.edu |accessdate=October 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021010402/http://www.wesleyan.edu/filmstudies/video-arteta.html |archive-date=October 21, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Rick Aviles|Rick Avil\u00e9s]], actor and comedian \n* [[Charlotte Ayanna]], actress\n{{colend}}\n\n'''B'''\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ivonne Bel\u00e9n]], documentary director and producer\n* [[Rosa Blasi]], theatrical actress\n* [[Giselle Blondet]], actress and television host\n* [[Diego Boneta]], actor, singer-songwriter (Puerto Rican grandfather)\n* [[Lucy Boscana]], television and theatrical actress\n{{colend}}\n{{div col}}\n'''C'''\n* [[Paul Calder\u00f3n]], actor \n* [[Armando Calvo]], actor\n* [[Norma Candal]], actress and comedian\n* [[Irene Cara]], actress and singer \n* [[Awilda Carbia]], actress and comedian<ref>[http://www.elnuevodia.com/fallece_awilda_carbia/548014.html Awilda Carbia obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325044509/http://www.elnuevodia.com/fallece_awilda_carbia/548014.html |date=March 25, 2009 }}, elnuevodia.com;

Some categories such as \"Actors, actresses, comedians and directors\" are relative since a subject who is a comedian may also be an actor or director. In some cases a subject may be notable in more than one field, such as [[Luis A. Ferr\u00e9]], who is notable both as a former governor and as an industrialist. However, the custom is to place the subject's name under the category for which he/she is most noted.\n\nAs of 2019, this list will be carefully maintained, and adding or deleting a name without first discussing the change on the article's talk page is likely to be reverted. This list should contain the names of persons who meet the pre-established [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Puerto Rico/Notability Criteria|Notability criteria]], even if the person does not have an article yet. Additions to the list must be listed in the section which best describes the field for which the person is most notable and in alphabetical order by surname. Each addition to the list must also provide a reliable verifiable source which cites the person's notability and/or the person's link to Puerto Rico, otherwise the name will be removed.\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Actors, actresses, comedians and directors==\n[[File:Auli'i Cravalho December 2016.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Auli'i Cravalho]]]]\n[[File:Henry Darrow.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Henry Darrow]]]][[File:Joaquin Cannes 20002 cropped.jpg|140px|thumb|[[Joaquin Phoenix]]]][[File:Benicio Del Toro - Guardians of the Galaxy premiere - July 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|140px|[[Benicio del Toro]]]][[File:Erik Estrada.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Erik Estrada]]]]\n[[File:Jose Ferrer in Caine Mutiny.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]]]][[File:Juano hernandez in intruder in the dust.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Juano Hern\u00e1ndez]]]]\n[[File:Jennifer Lopez 2, 2012.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Jennifer Lopez]]]]\n[[File:Rita Moreno (1963).jpg|thumb|140px|[[Rita Moreno]]]]\n[[File:Lymari Nadal.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Lymari Nadal]]]]\n[[File:Lin-Manuel Miranda WH.png|thumb|209x209px|[[Lin-Manuel Miranda]]]]\n[[File:Rosie Perez 2012.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Rosie Perez]]]]\n[[File:Marquita Rivera 3.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Marquita Rivera]]]]\n[[File:Jon Seda.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Jon Seda]]]]\n[[File:JimmySmits07TIFF.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Jimmy Smits]]]][[File:Liz Torres 94.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Liz Torres]]]]\n[[File:David Zayas.jpg|thumb|140px|[[David Zayas]]]]\n\n\n'''A'''\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kirk Acevedo]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot]] (a.k.a. \"Don Cholito\"), comedian\n* [[Jorge Alberti]], actor\n* [[Trini Alvarado]], actress \n* [[Miguel \u00c1ngel \u00c1lvarez]], actor and comedian\n* [[La La Anthony]], actress, MTV VJ\n* [[Marc Anthony]], singer and actor\n* [[Victor Argo|V\u00edctor Argo]], actor \n* [[Yancey Arias]], actor \n* [[Raymond Arrieta]], comedian and television host\n* [[Miguel Arteta]], film/television director<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/filmstudies/video-arteta.html |title=Miguel Arteta - Wesleyan University |website=Wesleyan.edu |accessdate=October 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021010402/http://www.wesleyan.edu/filmstudies/video-arteta.html |archive-date=October 21, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Rick Aviles|Rick Avil\u00e9s]], actor and comedian \n* [[Charlotte Ayanna]], actress\n{{colend}}\n\n'''B'''\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ivonne Bel\u00e9n]], documentary director and producer\n* [[Rosa Blasi]], theatrical actress\n* [[Giselle Blondet]], actress and television host\n* [[Diego Boneta]], actor, singer-songwriter (Puerto Rican grandfather)\n* [[Lucy Boscana]], television and theatrical actress\n{{colend}}\n{{div col}}\n'''C'''\n* [[Paul Calder\u00f3n]], actor \n* [[Armando Calvo]], actor\n* [[Norma Candal]], actress and comedian\n* [[Irene Cara]], actress and singer \n* [[Awilda Carbia]], actress and comedian<ref>[http://www.elnuevodia.com/fallece_awilda_carbia/548014.html Awilda Carbia obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325044509/http://www.elnuevodia.com/fallece_awilda_carbia/548014.html |date=March 25, 2009 }}, elnuevodia.com;
