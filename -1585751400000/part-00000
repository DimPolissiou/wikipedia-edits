The first semester of studies commenced on October 17, 1976. In 1980, the Open University was officially recognized as an institute of higher learning in Israel, and was accredited to award undergraduate or bachelor's degrees (BA). In 1982, 41 graduates were awarded BA diplomas at the university's first diploma ceremony.\n\nBy 1987, the university had 11,000 students and offered 180 courses. The university grew rapidly and by 1993, it had 20,000 students and 300 courses, and 405 new graduates. Then, in 1996, the university launched its postgraduate program offering courses towards a master's degree (MA). By 2002, the university had grown to 36,710 enrolled students and by 2003, more than 13,000 people had graduated the university with an academic degree. \n\n[[Nehemia Levtzion]] was President of the university from 1987 to 1992.

[[Mimi Ajzenstadt]] became President in 2018.\n\nIn 2010, the Open University began offering online courses taught in Russian. Students could enroll worldwide for 24 courses, most of them with Israeli or Jewish content. According to the online program, examinations can be held at Israeli consulates and [[Jewish Agency]] offices around the world.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dattel |first=Lior |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/open-university-pioneering-courses-for-overseas-russians-by-internet-1.310269 |title=Open University pioneering courses for overseas Russians, by Internet |publisher=Haaretz |date=April 2, 2008 |accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref> [[Mimi Ajzenstadt]] is the President of the university.\n\n==Undergraduate studies==\n\n[[File:Open University of Israel campus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Campus of the Open University of Israel]]\n[[File:\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8\u05e1\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05d7\u05d4 \u05de\u05e7\u05d3\u05d9\u05de\u05d43.JPG|thumb|250px|The Rennert Study Center]]\n[[File:Library of Open University of Israel.jpg|thumb|250px|Library of Open University of Israel]]\nThe Open University is open to anyone who wishes to study towards a [[bachelor's degree]], without any prerequisites or screening process. However, the Open University still has high standards and demands academic achievements from its graduates. Another way in which the Open University is ''open'' is in the study path it offers to its students. When enrolling in the university, the student does not need to decide the primary focus of his or her degree, nor to determine in advance the pace of the degree (how many years the studies will take). In fact, it is possible to take only a single course or several courses without receiving a degree, or to take several courses per semester, until finally enough courses relevant to a certain academic area have been taken to be eligible for a degree.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the Open University employs distance education. The university has no single central campus, or rigid schedules, making it especially well-suited to those who are preoccupied with a job, army service, or their family.\n\nThe most important aspect of studying in the Open University is self-study from books. Each of the university's courses has a specially-prepared book with the course material and exercises, from which the students study on their own. The Open University's books and teaching aids have become quite popular in Israel's other universities and colleges as well.\n\nTo supplement the self-study, there are occasional group meetings, where the students can ask the teacher questions about the material, and talk to other students who take the same course. These meetings take place throughout Israel, and are optional to attend. The students can also use the university's Internet site (\"TELEM\") to communicate with the teachers or with other students. Some courses also feature video cassettes, multimedia CDs, and other audio-visual aids. Recently, video-conferencing technology has also enabled viewing a real-time lecture without the students all coming to a single campus. For each course, students must complete several required assignments, and take a final exam. To obtain a degree, students must participate in one or more seminar courses, depending on the academic program. The examination of seminar papers is carried out by academic staff members of [[List of universities and colleges in Israel|Israel's universities]].\n\n==Graduate studies==\nThe Open University also has [[master's degree]] programs for some of the areas it teaches, but they are not open to everyone and do have acceptance criteria. At present, the university does not offer [[Doctorate|doctoral]] programs.\n\n==Affiliation with other universities==\nThe Open University, together with the other Israeli universities, has reached agreements that enable students to begin their undergraduate studies within the flexible framework of the Open University and after taking a cluster of courses, decide whether they would like to complete their degree at the Open University, or transfer to another institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-e.openu.ac.il/academic/234.html |title=Requirements for all Bachelor's degrees |publisher=E.openu.ac.il |date= |accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref> The courses studied at the Open University will shorten the duration of degree studies at the other academic institution.\n\nSince 2007, the transfer options are available to:\n*[[Tel Aviv University]]: Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Social Sciences (School of Economics); Faculty of Engineering\n*[[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]: Faculty of Social Sciences (Department of Economics, Department of Sociology and Anthropology); Faculty of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Quality Sciences in Rehovot; Computer Science Department.\n*[[University of Haifa]]: Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Social Sciences (Department of Economics)\n*[[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]]: The Faculty of Engineering Sciences (Computer Science); The Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences (Department of Economics), The Department of Behavioral Sciences\n*[[Bar-Ilan University]]: The Faculty of Social Sciences (The Department of Economics)\n*[[Technion - Israel Institute of Technology]]: 14 faculties\n\n==Notable alumni==\n[[File:Yarden Gerbi.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Yarden Gerbi]]]]\n* [[Vladislav Bykanov]] (born 1989), Olympic short track speed skater\n*[[Yael Dayan]], politician and author\n* [[Yuval Freilich]] (born 1995), \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer, 2019 European Epee Champion\n*[[Yarden Gerbi]], world champion and Olympic bronze medalist judoka\n*[[Sharren Haskel]], politician\n*[[Zion Kenan]], former Chief Executive Officer of [[Bank Hapoalim]]\n*[[Itzik Kornfein]], goalkeeper\n*[[Ashmoret Mishal]], ultramarathoner and physical coach\n*[[Rivka Ravitz]], chief of staff to [[President of Israel]] [[Reuven Rivlin]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of universities in Israel]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Open University of Israel}}\n*[http://www-e.openu.ac.il Open University of Israel] Web site\n\n{{Universities in Israel}}\n\n[[Category:Open University of Israel| ]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1974]]\n[[Category:Education in Israel]]\n[[Category:Universities in Israel]]\n[[Category:1974 establishments in Israel]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=March 2016}} \n{{Infobox University\n|name            =Open University of Israel\n|native_name     ={{Hebrew|\u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8\u05e1\u05d9\u05d8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05d7\u05d4}}\n|image           =Open University of Israel logo2.svg\n|image_size      =120px\n|established     =1974\n|type            =[[Distance education]]<br />[[Public university|Public]]\n|endowment       =\n|staff           =\n|faculty         =\n|president       =Professor [[Mimi Ajzenstadt]]\n|provost         =\n|principal       =David Klibanski\n|rector          =\n|chancellor      =[[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|The Rt.

In 1939 he was given an appointment in the art school of [[Melbourne]] but was prevented from taking it up by the outbreak of World War II. His wife, [[Gertrud Herzog-Hauser]] (1894\u20131953), to whom he had been married since 1922, was of Jewish origin and emigrated to the Netherlands, where she managed to survive the war. Hauser went into exile in Switzerland, where he wrote ''Eine Geschichte vom verlorenen Sohn'' (1941, privately published 1945), the novel ''Zwischen gestern und morgen'' (1945) and the fairytale ''Maler, Tod und Jungfrau'' (1946).\n\nIn 1947 Hauser and his wife returned to Vienna and took part in the reconstruction. In 1952 he became General Secretary of the Austrian [[PEN Club]], and later its vice-president, which he remained until 1972. He was also a council member of the organisation ''Aktion gegen Antisemitismus'' (\"Action Against Antisemitism\") and was involved in the revival of the ''Berufsvereinigung der bildenden K\u00fcnstler \u00d6sterreichs'' (\"Professional Union of the Fine Artists of Austria\"), of which he was later vice-president.\n\nHe died in 1985 in [[Rekawinkel]].

During the 1930s in the time of the [[St\u00e4ndestaat]] he was active in the [[Fatherland's Front (Austria)|Patriotic Front]] (''Vaterl\u00e4ndische Front'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMY1V0_Carry_Hauser_Wien_Austria|title=Carry Hauser - Wien, Austria - Citizen Memorials on Waymarking.com|website=www.waymarking.com|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Anschluss]] of 1938, Hauser, because of his political stance, was banned by the [[National Socialists]] from working and exhibiting. In 1939 he was given an appointment in the art school of [[Melbourne]] but was prevented from taking it up by the outbreak of World War II. His wife, Gertrud Herzog-Hauser (1894\u20131953), to whom he had been married since 1922, was of Jewish origin and emigrated to the Netherlands, where she managed to survive the war. Hauser went into exile in Switzerland, where he wrote ''Eine Geschichte vom verlorenen Sohn'' (1941, privately published 1945), the novel ''Zwischen gestern und morgen'' (1945) and the fairytale ''Maler, Tod und Jungfrau'' (1946).\n\nIn 1947 Hauser and his wife returned to Vienna and took part in the reconstruction. In 1952 he became General Secretary of the Austrian [[PEN Club]], and later its vice-president, which he remained until 1972. He was also a council member of the organisation ''Aktion gegen Antisemitismus'' (\"Action Against Antisemitism\") and was involved in the revival of the ''Berufsvereinigung der bildenden K\u00fcnstler \u00d6sterreichs'' (\"Professional Union of the Fine Artists of Austria\"), of which he was later vice-president.\n\nHe died in 1985 in [[Rekawinkel]].

His films include ''[[I Shot Jesse James]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'' (1958).\n\nIn 1962 Lippert said, \"the word around Hollywood is: Lippert makes a lot of cheap pictures but he's never made a stinker\".<ref name=\"rob\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Alameda, California]] and adopted by the owner of a hardware store Robert Lippert became fascinated by the cinema at an early age. As a youngster, he worked a variety of jobs in local theaters, including projectionist and assistant manager. As a manager of a cinema during the [[Great Depression|Depression]], Lippert encouraged regular attendance with promotions such as \"Dish Night\" and \"Book Night\".\n\nLippert went from cinema manager to owning a chain of cinemas in California in 1942, during the peak years of theater attendance.<ref>[http://mst3k.booyaka.com/episodes/directors/robert_lippert.txt Booyaka.com]</ref> Lippert's theaters in Los Angeles often screened older films for a continuous 24 hours with an admission price of 25 cents.

A 1949 ''New York Times'' profile said he owned 61 theaters. It also reported (erroneously) that he had directed most of the Westerns his company had made.<ref name=\"lip1\">By, A. H. W. (1949, Jan 30). BY WAY OF REPORT. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/105774114</ref>\n\nLippert tried to add luster to his productions, but only if it could be done economically. His studio became a haven for actors whose careers were interrupted when their studios, no longer making lower-budget pictures, released them from their contracts. Robert Lippert was able to sign major-studio talent for a fraction of the usual rate, giving his productions more marquee value. Among the established names who worked for Lippert were George Raft, [[Veronica Lake]], [[Zachary Scott]], [[Robert Hutton]], [[Joan Leslie]], [[George Reeves]], [[Ralph Byrd]], [[Richard Arlen]], [[Don \"Red\" Barry]], [[Robert Alda]], [[Gloria Jean]], [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]], [[Ellen Drew]], [[Preston Foster]], [[Jean Porter]], [[Anne Gwynne]], [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], [[Tom Neal]], [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]], and [[John Howard]].\n\nAdditional selling angles were realized when certain of Lippert's features could be marketed in a process more elaborate than ordinary black-and-white. Lippert used [[Cinecolor]] and [[sepiatone]] to dress up his more ambitious features, and embellished others by using tinted film stock for special effects (mint green for ''[[Lost Continent (1951 film)|Lost Continent]]'', pinkish-red for the Mars sequences in ''[[Rocketship X-M]]''). He even anticipated the [[3D film|3-D]] film craze by publicizing a special photographic lens, which he claimed gave a stereoscopic effect without special projection equipment.\n\nIn addition to his original productions, Lippert reissued older films to theaters under his own brand name, including several [[Hopalong Cassidy]] westerns and the [[Laurel and Hardy]] feature ''[[Babes in Toyland (1934 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (reissued as ''March of the Wooden Soldiers'').\n\nLippert read a 1949 ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'' magazine article about a proposed trip to and landing on the [[Moon]]. He rushed into production his film version called ''Rocketship X-M'', released a year later in 1950; he changed the destination to [[Mars]] to avoid copying exactly the same idea being utilized by producer [[George Pal]] in his large-budget, high-profile ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]''. ''Rocketship X-M'' succeeded in becoming the first [[post-war]] science fiction [[outer space]] drama to appear in theaters, but just barely. More importantly, it became the first film drama to warn of the dangers and folly of full-scale atomic war.\n\n[[Ron Ormond]] produced and directed several films for Lippert, including many westerns with [[Lash LaRue]].\n\nIn 1951 Lippert signed the first contract with the American Federation of Musicians to sell films to television. Lippert had to rescore some of the films and pay an amount to the musicians' music fund.<ref>First contract signed to allow sale of movies to television. (1951, Apr 25).

He appeared as a supporting comedian in many of Lippert's productions and starred in three one hour-long comedies.\n\n==20th Century-Fox==\n===Regal Pictures===\nWhen [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] announced his [[CinemaScope]] process, he faced hostility from many theatre owners who had gone to great expense to convert their theatres to show [[3-D film]]s that Hollywood had stopped making. Zanuck assured them that they could have a large supply of CinemaScope product because Fox would make CinemaScope lenses available to other film companies and start a production unit, led by Lippert, called '''Regal Pictures''' in 1956 to produce [[B picture]]s in that process.\n\nLippert's company was contracted to make 20 pictures a year for seven years, each to be shot in seven days for no more than $100,000. Due to Lippert's problems with the film unions over not paying residuals to actors and writers of his films when they were sold to television, Ed Baumgarten was officially appointed the head of Regal, but Lippert had overall control.<ref>p.94 ''Maury Dexter Interview'' by Tom Weaver '' I Talked with a Zombie: Interviews with 23 Veterans of Horror and Sci-Fi'' McFarland</ref><ref>Dexter p 89</ref> Regal Pictures filmed its movies with CinemaScope lenses, but due to 20th Century-Fox insisting that only its \"A\" films would be labelled CinemaScope, Regal's product used the term \"Regalscope\" in its films' credits.<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/cslist.htm Widescreenmuseum.com]</ref>\n\nBeginning with ''[[Stagecoach to Fury]]'' (1956), Regal produced 25 pictures in its first year.<ref>By, T.

The films were entirely financed and released by Fox, but Regal was independent. Dexter says \"the only stipulation production-wise was that we had to give Bausch and Lomb screen credit on each film for CinemaScope camera lenses, as well as being charged back to Fox, $3,000 of each budget.<ref>Dexter p 88</ref>\n\nImpressed by the unit's profits, Fox extended Regal's contract by a further 16 films with an \"exploitation angle\" that would be approved by Fox.<ref>p.103 Dombrowski, Lisa ''The Films of Samuel Fuller: If You Die, I'll Kill You!''

His films include ''[[I Shot Jesse James]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'' (1958).\n\nIn 1962 Lippert said, \"the word around Hollywood is: Lippert makes a lot of cheap pictures but he's never made a stinker\".<ref name=\"rob\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Alameda, California]] and adopted by the owner of a hardware store Robert Lippert became fascinated by the cinema at an early age. As a youngster, he worked a variety of jobs in local theaters, including projectionist and assistant manager. As a manager of a cinema during the [[Great Depression|Depression]], Lippert encouraged regular attendance with promotions such as \"Dish Night\" and \"Book Night\".\n\nLippert went from cinema manager to owning a chain of cinemas in California in 1942, during the peak years of theater attendance.<ref>[http://mst3k.booyaka.com/episodes/directors/robert_lippert.txt Booyaka.com]</ref> Lippert's theaters in Los Angeles often screened older films for a continuous 24 hours with an admission price of 25 cents. Not only did his theaters attract shift workers and late-night revelers, but servicemen on leave who could not find cheap accommodation and would sleep in the chairs.<ref>p. 110 ''Maury Dexter Interview'' by Tom Weaver '' I Talked with a Zombie: Interviews with 23 Veterans of Horror and Sci-Fi'' McFarland</ref>\n\nIn May 1948 he merged his theater chain with George Mann's.<ref>Mustering-out pay dead line changed.

A 1949 ''New York Times'' profile said he owned 61 theaters. It also reported (erroneously) that he had directed most of the Westerns his company had made.<ref name=\"lip\">By, A. H. W. (1949, Jan 30). BY WAY OF REPORT. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/105774114</ref>\n\nLippert tried to add luster to his productions, but only if it could be done economically. His studio became a haven for actors whose careers were interrupted when their studios, no longer making lower-budget pictures, released them from their contracts. Robert Lippert was able to sign major-studio talent for a fraction of the usual rate, giving his productions more marquee value. Among the established names who worked for Lippert were George Raft, [[Veronica Lake]], [[Zachary Scott]], [[Robert Hutton]], [[Joan Leslie]], [[George Reeves]], [[Ralph Byrd]], [[Richard Arlen]], [[Don \"Red\" Barry]], [[Robert Alda]], [[Gloria Jean]], [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]], [[Ellen Drew]], [[Preston Foster]], [[Jean Porter]], [[Anne Gwynne]], [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], [[Tom Neal]], [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]], and [[John Howard]].\n\nAdditional selling angles were realized when certain of Lippert's features could be marketed in a process more elaborate than ordinary black-and-white. Lippert used [[Cinecolor]] and [[sepiatone]] to dress up his more ambitious features, and embellished others by using tinted film stock for special effects (mint green for ''[[Lost Continent (1951 film)|Lost Continent]]'', pinkish-red for the Mars sequences in ''[[Rocketship X-M]]''). He even anticipated the [[3D film|3-D]] film craze by publicizing a special photographic lens, which he claimed gave a stereoscopic effect without special projection equipment.\n\nIn addition to his original productions, Lippert reissued older films to theaters under his own brand name, including several [[Hopalong Cassidy]] westerns and the [[Laurel and Hardy]] feature ''[[Babes in Toyland (1934 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (reissued as ''March of the Wooden Soldiers'').\n\nLippert read a 1949 ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'' magazine article about a proposed trip to and landing on the [[Moon]]. He rushed into production his film version called ''Rocketship X-M'', released a year later in 1950; he changed the destination to [[Mars]] to avoid copying exactly the same idea being utilized by producer [[George Pal]] in his large-budget, high-profile ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]''. ''Rocketship X-M'' succeeded in becoming the first [[post-war]] science fiction [[outer space]] drama to appear in theaters, but just barely. More importantly, it became the first film drama to warn of the dangers and folly of full-scale atomic war.\n\n[[Ron Ormond]] produced and directed several films for Lippert, including many westerns with [[Lash LaRue]].\n\nIn 1951 Lippert signed the first contract with the American Federation of Musicians to sell films to television. Lippert had to rescore some of the films and pay an amount to the musicians' music fund.<ref>First contract signed to allow sale of movies to television. (1951, Apr 25).

He appeared as a supporting comedian in many of Lippert's productions and starred in three one hour-long comedies.\n\n==20th Century-Fox==\n===Regal Pictures===\nWhen [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] announced his [[CinemaScope]] process, he faced hostility from many theatre owners who had gone to great expense to convert their theatres to show [[3-D film]]s that Hollywood had stopped making. Zanuck assured them that they could have a large supply of CinemaScope product because Fox would make CinemaScope lenses available to other film companies and start a production unit, led by Lippert, called '''Regal Pictures''' in 1956 to produce [[B picture]]s in that process.\n\nLippert's company was contracted to make 20 pictures a year for seven years, each to be shot in seven days for no more than $100,000. Due to Lippert's problems with the film unions over not paying residuals to actors and writers of his films when they were sold to television, Ed Baumgarten was officially appointed the head of Regal, but Lippert had overall control.<ref>p.94 ''Maury Dexter Interview'' by Tom Weaver '' I Talked with a Zombie: Interviews with 23 Veterans of Horror and Sci-Fi'' McFarland</ref><ref>Dexter p 89</ref> Regal Pictures filmed its movies with CinemaScope lenses, but due to 20th Century-Fox insisting that only its \"A\" films would be labelled CinemaScope, Regal's product used the term \"Regalscope\" in its films' credits.<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/cslist.htm Widescreenmuseum.com]</ref>\n\nBeginning with ''[[Stagecoach to Fury]]'' (1956), Regal produced 25 pictures in its first year.<ref>By, T.

The films were entirely financed and released by Fox, but Regal was independent. Dexter says \"the only stipulation production-wise was that we had to give Bausch and Lomb screen credit on each film for CinemaScope camera lenses, as well as being charged back to Fox, $3,000 of each budget.<ref>Dexter p 88</ref>\n\nImpressed by the unit's profits, Fox extended Regal's contract by a further 16 films with an \"exploitation angle\" that would be approved by Fox.<ref>p.103 Dombrowski, Lisa ''The Films of Samuel Fuller: If You Die, I'll Kill You!''

REGAL TO START TEN FILMS SOON.

It did not make a deal with writers, and the Screenwriters Guild forbade its writers to work for Lippert. Regal stopped making films.\n\nIn 1960 Lippert sold 30 Regal films to television for $1 million.<ref>National telefilm concern buys 30 films from regal. (1960, Jan 21). Wall Street Journal (1923 - Current File) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/132610753</ref>\n\nIn October 1958 a new company was formed by Lippert, Regal Films, to make one a month low budget films for Fox, starting with ''[[Alaskan Highway]]''. The company was headed by George Warren, a cost controller for MGM, with William Magginetti as production supervisor and Harry Spaulding as story editor. Lippert was described as being \"associated\" with the company.<ref>By THOMAS M PRYORSpecial to The New York Times. (1958, Oct 08). 12 MOVIES ADDED TO FOX SCHEDULE.

I wouldn't be a director for anything. No wonder they all have ulcers.\"<ref name=\"rob\"/>\n\n===Associated Producers Incorporated===\nIn 1959 Lippert renamed Regal as Associated Producers Incorporated (API) to make more low-budget films for [[double feature]]s<ref>p.105 Heffernan, Kevin ''Ghouls, Gimmicks and Gold: Horror Films and the American Movie Business'' 2004 Duke University Press</ref> (API having similar initials to exploitation specialist [[American International Pictures]] may have been coincidental).\n\nThe core of API was [[Harry Spalding]] and [[Maury Dexter]]. All API's productions were done in-house.\n\nIn October 1959 Lippert said making \"little Bs\" for $100,000 was no longer as lucrative because \"it is now in the same category as the short TV feature which people can see for free.\"<ref name=\"lip\">Scheuer, P.

There's hardly any re-shooting. Unless something is glaringly wrong, we let 'em go. What the hell, people don't care. They want to be entertained.I've heard people coming out of my theatres after seeing a double bill that featured a big production, 'Everybody died' or 'How that girl suffered. Thank God for the little picture'.\"<ref name=\"rob\"/>\n\nLippert said he wanted to make more Westerns \"because they're cheap\" but did not because \"television had saturated the market.\"<ref name=\"rob\"/>\n\nFaced with increasing production costs in Hollywood, Lippert announced in 1962 that he would be making films in England, Italy (''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'') and the Philippines.
