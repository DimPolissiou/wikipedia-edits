Access Software was acquired by [[Microsoft]] in April 1999, transitioning in name twice before being acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] in October 2004, receiving the name Indie Built. In January 2005, Access Software became part of Take-Two's [[2K (company)|2K]] label. Following a poor financial performance at Take-Two, Indie Built was closed down in May 2006.\n\nTruGolf, a company that develops indoor golf simulators, was formerly a subsidiary of Access Software based on the display technology they had made for the ''Links'' games and spun out to its own company during the Microsoft acquisition.

In 1984, while there were other golf games on the market, most used a top-down approach, while Bruce Carver wanted to create a game that was shown from behind the golfer. With little artistic skill among their team, the developers set up a small studio in the basement, projecting frame-by-frame [[VHS]] footage of Roger Carver's golf swing onto a clear sheet, tracing his outline onto the sheets as to then convert them into sprites within the Commodore 64 system. This became the basis of ''[[Leader Board]]'', the first game considered part of the ''Links'' series, and would establish the behind-the-golfer view for most other golf simulation games that followed.

With this knowledge Nanni\u2019s life timeline circles Donatello\u2019s. \nIn February of 1405 Nanni was enrolled as an artist into the masons\u2019 guild Arte Di Pietra e Legname. This guild allowed him to work in the cathedral directly where he began his work as a sculptor.

Nanni was selected to carve a sculpture of St. Luke which took him 5 years to complete. He is mostly known for his work in transitioning from gothic to renaissance art.\n\n=== Colleagues ===\nA contemporary of [[Donatello]] and [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], Nanni was a sculptor in fifteenth-century Florence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hartt|first1=Frederick|title=History of Italian Renaissance art: painting, sculpture, architecture|date=1994|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliff, N.J.|isbn=0-13--393380-6|edition=4th}}</ref> He is well known for his sculpture group ''Four Crowned Martyrs (Quattro Santi Coronati)'' (1412\u201315) which was commissioned by the stone carvers and wood workers guild for the Church of [[Orsanmichele]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Richard|title=Renaissance Florence : the invention of a new art|date=2005|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0-13-134401-3}}</ref> The significance of this work is not only the striking naturalism and individuality of the figures, but also the complexity of construction of a sculpture group.\n\n=== His Works ===\nNanni di Banco made a name for himself in the transition from International Gothic art to Renaissance art creating a path for Early Renaissance in Florence. Many of his works are displayed inside the Cathedral, the church and museum of Orsanmichele in Florence. His first major work was a statue of the Isaiah in 1408 for the Cathedral his father worked for.\n\nThe Quattro Coronati was created in 1416. At this time many artists wanted to depict pagan gods and saints but were hung. Nanni Di Banco decided to depict a dialogue between four saints, creating the title. The sculpture not only shows dialogue but also demonstrates the extent to which human behavior can be portrayed by stone.  It is easy to find ancient Roman influence on the four sculptures. Many of the faces and togas look similar to ancient Roman republican sculptures. Artists were required to develop a sculpture for the outside of church St. Michele. Nanni\u2019s colleague, Donatello, is credited to sculpt one saint. However, Nanni Di Banco portrays a dialogue in which only one of the four men is speaking and the rest are listening, not directly looking at the subject but still engaging in conversation.\n\nSan Luca is a marble sculpture, in works with the renaissance artist Donatello. Nanni Di Banco exploits the themes of humanism and a new proposal to human expression.

Avildsen]]. It is the second installment in ''[[The Karate Kid (franchise)|The Karate Kid]]'' franchise, and stars [[Ralph Macchio]] and [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]]. ''The Karate Kid Part II'' follows [[Daniel LaRusso]] (Macchio), who accompanies his karate teacher [[Mr. Miyagi]] (Morita) to [[Okinawa]] in aid of his dying father, only to encounter a group of bullies with long-harbored grudges against Miyagi.\n\nPreparations for the film began immediately after the success of the first installment, and after completing the final edit of the script, casting took place between May and July 1985 after the re-signing of Macchio and Morita. Principal photography began in September 1985 in [[Los Angeles]], and filming was complete by December 1985, which included locations such as [[Oahu, Hawaii|Oahu]], to replicate Okinawa.\n\n''The Karate Kid Part II'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 20, 1986. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the new location and characters, and Morita's performance, although some criticized elements of the storyline, the villains, and some action scenes. The film was also a commercial success, grossing over $115 million worldwide, making it among the highest grossing films of 1986, and the highest grossing in the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|title= Screen: 'Karate Kid Part II  |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=20 June 1986|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE4DD163DF933A15755C0A960948260|accessdate=26 July 2014|first=Vincent|last=Canby}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= The Karate Kid Part II |publisher= Variety|date=January 1, 1986|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117792263.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nShortly after the All-Valley Karate Tournament, Sensei John Kreese becomes furious and attacks Johnny Lawrence in the parking lot. Miyagi confronts Kreese and passively immobilizes him. Miyagi threatens to strike a deadly blow but instead, comically tweaks Kreese's nose and walks away.\n\nSix months later, Daniel visits Mr. Miyagi's house after previously attending a senior prom, and furiously explains that Ali has dumped him for a football player from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Miyagi receives a letter notifying him that his father is sick. He plans to return to his home village on [[Okinawa Island]], and brings Daniel with him. Miyagi explains that he fell in love with a woman named Yukie, who was arranged to marry his best friend Sato, son of the richest man in the village and fellow karate student of his father. Upon announcing his intentions to marry Yukie, Sato challenged him to a fight to the death. Rather than fight, however, Miyagi left the country.\n\nIn Okinawa, Miyagi and Daniel are greeted by Chozen Toguchi, who takes them to meet Sato and reveals that he is Sato's nephew. Sato demands to fight Miyagi, who adamantly refuses. Arriving at the village, Miyagi and Daniel are welcomed by Yukie and her niece Kumiko. They discover that Sato has become a rich industrialist whose [[fishing trawler|supertrawlers]] have destroyed the local fish population, impoverishing the other villagers. They are forced to rent property from Sato, who owns the village's land title. Yukie reveals that she never married Sato, because of her love for Miyagi. After Miyagi's father dies, Sato gives him three days to mourn out of respect before their fight. Miyagi shows Daniel the secret to his family's karate \u2013 a [[Den-den daiko|handheld drum]] that twists back and forth illustrating the \"drum technique\", a block-and-defense karate move that Daniel begins to practice.\n\nSome time later, Daniel accidentally exposes corruption in Chozen's grocery business. Chozen accuses Daniel of insulting his honor, and they have a series of confrontations. Their feud comes to a head when Chozen and his cronies attack Daniel and vandalize Miyagi's family property. The group is quickly defeated and runs off after Miyagi arrives. Miyagi and Daniel plan to return to Los Angeles before the situation gets worse. However, Sato shows up with bulldozers and threatens to destroy the village if Miyagi refuses to fight. Forced to comply, Miyagi gives in on the condition that Sato signs the village's land title over to the villagers regardless of the fight's outcome. Sato begrudgingly agrees after Miyagi describes the condition as a \"small price\" to pay for honor.\n\nOn the day of the fight, a [[typhoon]] arrives. Villagers take cover at a nearby shelter, but Sato gets trapped when his family's dojo is leveled by the storm. Miyagi and Daniel rush to rescue him. After carrying Sato to safety, Daniel attempts to rescue a child on top of a nearby bell tower. Sato orders Chozen to help, but when he refuses, Sato rushes to assist Daniel himself. He then [[disownment|disowns]] his nephew for refusing to cooperate, and an enraged Chozen runs off into the storm in disgrace. The next morning, as the villagers are rebuilding, Sato returns with his bulldozers \u2013 only this time to help rebuild the village. Sato hands over the land title to the village and asks for Miyagi's forgiveness, which he accepts. Daniel and Kumiko approach Sato about hosting the upcoming [[Bon Festival|O-bon]] festival in a nearby ceremonial castle, to which he agrees and invites Daniel to join in the celebration.\n\nWhile Kumiko is performing a dance at the festival, a now-vengeful Chozen ziplines into the presentation, taking her hostage and demanding to fight Daniel alone, to the death. After a fierce fight, Daniel is eventually overwhelmed by Chozen. Miyagi, Sato and the crowd respond by twisting handheld drums they brought to the celebration, inspiring Daniel. Seemingly confused, Chozen closes in for the kill, but Daniel is able to deflect Chozen's attacks and land counter-attacks using the drum technique. Daniel grabs the vanquished Chozen, raising his hand and threatening to end Chozen's life saying, \"Live or die, man?!\" Chozen chooses death, but, reminiscent of the way Miyagi handled Kreese earlier, Daniel tweaks Chozen's nose and drops him to the ground. Daniel embraces Kumiko, while Miyagi looks on proudly.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]] as [[Mr. Miyagi]]\n* [[Nobu McCarthy]] as Yukie\n* [[Tamlyn Tomita]] as Kumiko\n* [[Yuji Okumoto]] as Chozen\n* [[Joey Miyashima]] as Toshio\n* [[Marc Hayashi]] as Taro\n* [[Danny Kamekona]] as Sato\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]]\n* [[William Zabka]] as [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]]\n* [[Tony O'Dell]] as Jimmy\n* Ron Thomas as Bobby\n* [[Rob Garrison]] as Tommy\n\nOther notable cast appearances include [[BD Wong|B. D. Wong]] (credited as \"Bradd Wong\") as an Okinawan boy who invites Daniel and Kumiko to a dance club and [[Clarence Gilyard]] as one of the participants in the ice-breaking scene.\n\n==Production==\nThe opening scene takes place immediately following the finale of the first film to seamlessly tie the two together. It was originally planned as the ending for the first film, although it was not shot until after the second film's production began.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2007/zabka/index.html |title=\"Sweep the Leg!\" The Billy Zabka Interview |last1=Berry |first1=Robert |work=retrocrush.com |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]], in the northeastern area of the island known as the \"windward side\". The local countryside in modern-day Okinawa had been drastically changed due to the presence of military bases, so other locations in both Japan and Hawaii were scouted as alternative filming locations. Filmmakers selected a property in Oahu that was privately owned by a retired local physician who agreed to allow a portion of the land to be used in the film. To form the Okinawan village portrayed in the film, seven authentic replicas of Okinawan houses were constructed along with more than three acres of planted crops. 50 Okinawa-born Hawaii residents were also recruited as [[Extra (acting)|film extras]]. Filming began on September 23, 1985, and ended on December 20, 1985.<ref name=\"Palm Beach Post\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19851114&id=-QIjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=484FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1075,2017505|title='Karate Kid II' Under Way in Hawaii|last=Thomas|first=Bob|date=November 14, 1985|work=The Palm Beach Post|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/karate-kid-part-ii/details|title='The Karate Kid Part II' Production Notes|publisher=Sony Movie Channel|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe [[film score|musical score]] for ''The Karate Kid Part II'' was composed by [[Bill Conti]], who wrote the score for the previous installment, and features the [[pan flute]] of [[Gheorghe Zamfir]]. The film's signature tune was [[Peter Cetera]]'s song \"[[Glory of Love]]\", which was a No. 1 hit in the United States and received an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]]. When Daniel and Miyagi are being driven by Chozen and his crony Toshio after they arrive in Okinawa, Chozen tunes in the radio of the car until he reaches a station playing \"Fascination\", the same song to which Ali and Johnny were slow dancing at the high-end country club in the original film. The soundtrack is notable as being the final album released by [[United Artists Records]].\n\n# \"[[Glory of Love]]\" ([[Peter Cetera]])\n# \"Rock 'n' Roll Over You\" ([[The Moody Blues]])\n# \"Fish for Life\" (Mancrab)\n# \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" ([[Paul Rodgers]])\n# \"Let Me at 'Em\" (Southside Johnny)\n# \"This is the Time\" ([[Dennis DeYoung]])\n# \"[[Earth Angel]]\" ([[New Edition]])\n# \"Love Theme from ''The Karate Kid Part II''\" ([[Bill Conti]])\n# \"Two Looking at One\" ([[Carly Simon]])\n# \"The Storm\" (Bill Conti)\n\nThe score, which features 20 tracks, was released separately on compact disc by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] in a box set in 2007 and 2012.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Karate Kid Part II'' opened in 1,323 theaters across North America on June 20, 1986.

Avildsen]]. It is the second installment in ''[[The Karate Kid (franchise)|The Karate Kid]]'' franchise, and stars [[Ralph Macchio]] and [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]]. ''The Karate Kid Part II'' follows [[Daniel LaRusso]] (Macchio), who accompanies his karate teacher [[Mr. Miyagi]] (Morita) to [[Okinawa]] in aid of his dying father, only to encounter a group of bullies with long-harbored grudges against Miyagi.\n\nPreparations for the film began immediately after the success of the first installment, and after completing the final edit of the script, casting took place between May and July 1985 after the re-signing of Macchio and Morita. Principal photography began in September 1985 in [[Los Angeles]], and filming was complete by December 1985, which included locations such as [[Oahu, Hawaii|Oahu]], to replicate Okinawa.\n\n''The Karate Kid Part II'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 20, 1986. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the new location and characters, and Morita's performance, although some criticized elements of the storyline, the villains, and some action scenes. The film was also a commercial success, grossing over $115 million worldwide, making it among the highest grossing films of 1986, and the highest grossing in the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|title= Screen: 'Karate Kid Part II  |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=20 June 1986|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE4DD163DF933A15755C0A960948260|accessdate=26 July 2014|first=Vincent|last=Canby}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= The Karate Kid Part II |publisher= Variety|date=January 1, 1986|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117792263.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nShortly after the All-Valley Karate Tournament, Sensei John Kreese becomes furious and attacks Johnny Lawrence in the parking lot. Miyagi confronts Kreese and passively immobilizes him. Miyagi threatens to strike a deadly blow but instead, comically tweaks Kreese's nose and walks away.\n\nSix months later, Daniel visits Mr. Miyagi's house after previously attending a senior prom, and furiously explains that Ali has dumped him for a football player from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Miyagi receives a letter notifying him that his father is sick. He plans to return to his home village on [[Okinawa Island]], and brings Daniel with him. Miyagi explains that he fell in love with a woman named Yukie, who was arranged to marry his best friend Sato, son of the richest man in the village and fellow karate student of his father. Upon announcing his intentions to marry Yukie, Sato challenged him to a fight to the death. Rather than fight, however, Miyagi left the country.\n\nIn Okinawa, Miyagi and Daniel are greeted by Chozen Toguchi, who takes them to meet Sato and reveals that he is Sato's nephew. Sato demands to fight Miyagi, who adamantly refuses. Arriving at the village, Miyagi and Daniel are welcomed by Yukie and her niece Kumiko. They discover that Sato has become a rich industrialist whose [[fishing trawler|supertrawlers]] have destroyed the local fish population, impoverishing the other villagers. They are forced to rent property from Sato, who owns the village's land title. Yukie reveals that she never married Sato, because of her love for Miyagi. After Miyagi's father dies, Sato gives him three days to mourn out of respect before their fight. Miyagi shows Daniel the secret to his family's karate \u2013 a [[Den-den daiko|handheld drum]] that twists back and forth illustrating the \"drum technique\", a block-and-defense karate move that Daniel begins to practice.\n\nSome time later, Daniel accidentally exposes corruption in Chozen's grocery business. Chozen accuses Daniel of insulting his honor, and they have a series of confrontations. Their feud comes to a head when Chozen and his cronies attack Daniel and vandalize Miyagi's family property. The group is quickly defeated and runs off after Miyagi arrives. Miyagi and Daniel plan to return to Los Angeles before the situation gets worse. However, Sato shows up with bulldozers and threatens to destroy the village if Miyagi refuses to fight. Forced to comply, Miyagi gives in on the condition that Sato signs the village's land title over to the villagers regardless of the fight's outcome. Sato begrudgingly agrees after Miyagi describes the condition as a \"small price\" to pay for honor.\n\nOn the day of the fight, a [[typhoon]] arrives. Villagers take cover at a nearby shelter, but Sato gets trapped when his family's dojo is leveled by the storm. Miyagi and Daniel rush to rescue him. After carrying Sato to safety, Daniel attempts to rescue a child on top of a nearby bell tower. Sato orders Chozen to help, but when he refuses, Sato rushes to assist Daniel himself. He then [[disownment|disowns]] his nephew for refusing to cooperate, and an enraged Chozen runs off into the storm in disgrace. The next morning, as the villagers are rebuilding, Sato returns with his bulldozers \u2013 only this time to help rebuild the village. Sato hands over the land title to the village and asks for Miyagi's forgiveness, which he accepts. Daniel and Kumiko approach Sato about hosting the upcoming [[Bon Festival|O-bon]] festival in a nearby ceremonial castle, to which he agrees and invites Daniel to join in the celebration.\n\nWhile Kumiko is performing a dance at the festival, a now-vengeful Chozen ziplines into the presentation, taking her hostage and demanding to fight Daniel alone, to the death. After a fierce fight, Daniel is eventually overwhelmed by Chozen. Miyagi, Sato and the crowd respond by twisting handheld drums they brought to the celebration, inspiring Daniel. Seemingly confused, Chozen closes in for the kill, but Daniel is able to deflect Chozen's attacks and land counter-attacks using the drum technique. Daniel grabs the vanquished Chozen, raising his hand and threatening to end Chozen's life saying, \"Live or die, man?!\" Chozen chooses death, but, reminiscent of the way Miyagi handled Kreese earlier, Daniel tweaks Chozen's nose and drops him to the ground. Daniel embraces Kumiko, while Miyagi looks on proudly.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]] as [[Mr. Miyagi]]\n* [[Nobu McCarthy]] as Yukie\n* [[Tamlyn Tomita]] as Kumiko\n* [[Yuji Okumoto]] as Chozen\n* [[Joey Miyashima]] as Toshio\n* [[Marc Hayashi]] as Taro\n* [[Danny Kamekona]] as Sato\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]]\n* [[William Zabka]] as [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]]\n* [[Tony O'Dell]] as Jimmy\n* Ron Thomas as Bobby\n* [[Rob Garrison]] as Tommy\n\nOther notable cast appearances include [[BD Wong|B. D. Wong]] (credited as \"Bradd Wong\") as an Okinawan boy who invites Daniel and Kumiko to a dance club and [[Clarence Gilyard]] as one of the participants in the ice-breaking scene.\n\n==Production==\nThe opening scene takes place immediately following the finale of the first film to seamlessly tie the two together. It was originally planned as the ending for the first film, although it was not shot until after the second film's production began.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2007/zabka/index.html |title=\"Sweep the Leg!\" The Billy Zabka Interview |last1=Berry |first1=Robert |work=retrocrush.com |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]], in the northeastern area of the island known as the \"windward side\". The local countryside in modern-day Okinawa had been drastically changed due to the presence of military bases, so other locations in both Japan and Hawaii were scouted as alternative filming locations. Filmmakers selected a property in Oahu that was privately owned by a retired local physician who agreed to allow a portion of the land to be used in the film. To form the Okinawan village portrayed in the film, seven authentic replicas of Okinawan houses were constructed along with more than three acres of planted crops. 50 Okinawa-born Hawaii residents were also recruited as [[Extra (acting)|film extras]]. Filming began on September 23, 1985, and ended on December 20, 1985.<ref name=\"Palm Beach Post\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19851114&id=-QIjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=484FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1075,2017505|title='Karate Kid II' Under Way in Hawaii|last=Thomas|first=Bob|date=November 14, 1985|work=The Palm Beach Post|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/karate-kid-part-ii/details|title='The Karate Kid Part II' Production Notes|publisher=Sony Movie Channel|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe [[film score|musical score]] for ''The Karate Kid Part II'' was composed by [[Bill Conti]], who wrote the score for the previous installment, and features the [[pan flute]] of [[Gheorghe Zamfir]]. The film's signature tune was [[Peter Cetera]]'s song \"[[Glory of Love]]\", which was a No. 1 hit in the United States and received an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]]. When Daniel and Miyagi are being driven by Chozen and his crony Toshio after they arrive in Okinawa, Chozen tunes in the radio of the car until he reaches a station playing \"Fascination\", the same song to which Ali and Johnny were slow dancing at the high-end country club in the original film. The soundtrack is notable as being the final album released by [[United Artists Records]].\n\n# \"[[Glory of Love]]\" ([[Peter Cetera]])\n# \"Rock 'n' Roll Over You\" ([[The Moody Blues]])\n# \"Fish for Life\" (Mancrab)\n# \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" ([[Paul Rodgers]])\n# \"Let Me at 'Em\" (Southside Johnny)\n# \"This is the Time\" ([[Dennis DeYoung]])\n# \"[[Earth Angel]]\" ([[New Edition]])\n# \"Love Theme from ''The Karate Kid Part II''\" ([[Bill Conti]])\n# \"Two Looking at One\" ([[Carly Simon]])\n# \"The Storm\" (Bill Conti)\n\nThe score, which features 20 tracks, was released separately on compact disc by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] in a box set in 2007 and 2012.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Karate Kid Part II'' opened in 1,323 theaters across North America on June 20, 1986.

They may form colonies on [[L\u00f6wenstein\u2013Jensen medium|L\u00f6wenstein\u2013Jensen media]] that appear smooth or rough, white or greyish and [[nonphotochromogenic]].\n\n==Physiology==\n''M. abscessus'' shows growth at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C and 37&nbsp;\u00b0C after 7 days but not at 43&nbsp;\u00b0C. It may grow on [[MacConkey agar]] at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C and even 37&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nIt shows tolerance to saline media (5% NaCl) as well as 500&nbsp;mg/l hydroxylamine (Ogawa egg medium) and 0.2% picrate (Sauton agar medium). Strains of the species have been shown to degrade the antibiotic p-[[aminosalicylate]]. ''M. abscessus'' has also been shown to produce [[arylsulfatase]] but not of nitrate reductase and Tween 80 hydrolase.\nIt shows a negative result for the iron uptake test and no utilisation of [[fructose]], [[glucose]], [[oxalate]] or [[citrate]] as sole carbon sources.\n\n==Differential characteristics==\n''M. abscessus'' and [[Mycobacterium chelonae|''M. chelonae'']] can be distinguished from ''[[M. fortuitum]]'' or ''[[Mycobacterium peregrinum|M. peregrinum]]'' by their failure to reduce [[nitrate]] and to take up iron.\nTolerance to 5% NaCl in [[L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen]] media, tolerance to 0.2% picrate in Sauton [[agar]], and non-utilisation of [[citrate]] as a sole carbon source are characteristics that distinguish ''M. abscessus'' from ''M. chelonae''. ''M. abscessus'' and ''M. chelonae'' sequevar I share an identical sequence in the 54-510 region of [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]], though both species can be differentiated by their ''hsp65'', ITS or ''[[rpoB]]'' [[DNA sequencing|gene sequences]].\n\n==Genetics==\nA draft genome sequence of ''M. abscessus'' subsp.

In 1992, ''M. abscessus'' was first recognised as a distinct species. In 2006, this group was separated into three subspecies: ''abscessus'', ''bolletii'' and ''massiliense''. In 2011, ''massiliense'' and ''bolletii'' were briefly merged into a single subspecies, but were subsequently separated again following greater availability of genome sequence data, which showed the three subspecies formed genetically distinct groups.<ref name=\"Lee2015\" />\n\nThese distinct groups also correspond to important biological differences. Clinically important differences include differing susceptibilities to antibiotics. ''M. abscessus'' subsp. ''abscessus'' and ''bolletii'' carry a common [[antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]] gene which confers resistance to macrolide [[antibiotic]]s, while ''massiliense'' is thought to carry a non-functional copy, and is therefore more susceptible to antibiotics and more easily treated.<ref name=\"Lee2015\" />\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''M. abscessus'' can cause [[lung disease]], skin infections, [[central nervous system]] infections, [[bacteremia]], eye infections, and other, less common diseases.<ref name=\"Lee2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Meng-Rui|last2=Sheng|first2=Wang-Huei|last3=Hung|first3=Chien-Ching|last4=Yu|first4=Chong-Jen|last5=Lee|first5=Li-Na|last6=Hsueh|first6=Po-Ren|title=Mycobacterium abscessus Complex Infections in Humans|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=September 2015|volume=21|issue=9|pages=1638\u201346|doi=10.3201/2109.141634|pmid=26295364|pmc=4550155}}</ref>\n\nChronic lung disease occurs most commonly in vulnerable hosts with underlying lung disease such as [[cystic fibrosis]], [[bronchiectasis]], and prior [[tuberculosis]].

They may form colonies on [[L\u00f6wenstein\u2013Jensen medium|L\u00f6wenstein\u2013Jensen media]] that appear smooth or rough, white or greyish and [[nonphotochromogenic]].\n\n==Physiology==\n''M. abscessus'' shows growth at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C and 37&nbsp;\u00b0C after 7 days but not at 43&nbsp;\u00b0C. It may grow on [[MacConkey agar]] at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C and even 37&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nIt shows tolerance to saline media (5% NaCl) as well as 500&nbsp;mg/l hydroxylamine (Ogawa egg medium) and 0.2% picrate (Sauton agar medium). Strains of the species have been shown to degrade the antibiotic p-[[aminosalicylate]]. ''M. abscessus'' has also been shown to produce [[arylsulfatase]] but not of nitrate reductase and Tween 80 hydrolase.\nIt shows a negative result for the iron uptake test and no utilisation of [[fructose]], [[glucose]], [[oxalate]] or [[citrate]] as sole carbon sources.\n\n==Differential characteristics==\n''M. abscessus'' and [[Mycobacterium chelonae|''M. chelonae'']] can be distinguished from ''[[M. fortuitum]]'' or ''[[Mycobacterium peregrinum|M. peregrinum]]'' by their failure to reduce [[nitrate]] and to take up iron.\nTolerance to 5% NaCl in [[L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen]] media, tolerance to 0.2% picrate in Sauton [[agar]], and non-utilisation of [[citrate]] as a sole carbon source are characteristics that distinguish ''M. abscessus'' from ''M. chelonae''. ''M. abscessus'' and ''M. chelonae'' sequevar I share an identical sequence in the 54-510 region of [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]], though both species can be differentiated by their ''hsp65'', ITS or ''[[rpoB]]'' [[DNA sequencing|gene sequences]].\n\n==Genetics==\nA draft genome sequence of ''M. abscessus'' subsp.

In 1992, ''M. abscessus'' was first recognised as a distinct species. In 2006, this group was separated into three subspecies: ''abscessus'', ''bolletii'' and ''massiliense''. In 2011, ''massiliense'' and ''bolletii'' were briefly merged into a single subspecies, but were subsequently separated again following greater availability of genome sequence data, which showed the three subspecies formed genetically distinct groups.<ref name=\"Lee2015\" />\n\nThese distinct groups also correspond to important biological differences. Clinically important differences include differing susceptibilities to antibiotics. ''M. abscessus'' subsp. ''abscessus'' and ''bolletii'' carry a common [[antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]] gene which confers resistance to macrolide [[Antibiotic|antibiotics]], while ''massiliense'' is thought to carry a non-functional copy, and is therefore more susceptible to antibiotics and more easily treated.<ref name=\"Lee2015\" />\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''M. abscessus'' can cause [[lung disease]], skin infections, [[central nervous system]] infections, [[bacteremia]], eye infections, and other, less common diseases.<ref name=\"Lee2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Meng-Rui|last2=Sheng|first2=Wang-Huei|last3=Hung|first3=Chien-Ching|last4=Yu|first4=Chong-Jen|last5=Lee|first5=Li-Na|last6=Hsueh|first6=Po-Ren|title=Mycobacterium abscessus Complex Infections in Humans|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=September 2015|volume=21|issue=9|pages=1638\u201346|doi=10.3201/2109.141634|pmid=26295364|pmc=4550155}}</ref>\n\nChronic lung disease occurs most commonly in vulnerable hosts with underlying lung disease such as [[cystic fibrosis]], [[bronchiectasis]], and prior [[tuberculosis]].
