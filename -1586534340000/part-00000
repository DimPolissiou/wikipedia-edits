Originally Paterchurch, a small fishing village, Pembroke Dock town expanded rapidly following the construction of the [[Royal Navy Dockyard]] in 1814. The [[Cleddau Bridge]] links Pembroke Dock with [[Neyland]].\n\nAfter [[Haverfordwest]] and [[Milford Haven]], Pembroke Dock is the third-largest town in Pembrokeshire.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe natural harbour (now the [[Milford Haven Waterway]]) offering shelter from the prevailing south westerly winds, has probably been used for many thousands of years but the first evidence of settlement from maps is the name of the Carr Rocks at the entrance, derived from the [[Norsemen|Norse]]-language ''Skare'' for [[Rock (geology)|rock]].<ref name=JSGuard/>\n\nFrom 790 until the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Invasion]] (1066) the [[estuary]] was used by the [[Vikings]]. During one visit, either in 854 or in 878, maybe on his way to the [[Battle of Cynuit]], the Viking chieftain [[Ubba|Hubba]] wintered in the haven with 23 ships.<ref>[http://www.pembrokeshire-wales.info/milfordhaven/html/history.html Milford Haven Town Council website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605163354/http://www.pembrokeshire-wales.info/milfordhaven/html/history.html |date=5 June 2009 }} ''History'', Chronology of Events</ref>\n\nIn 1172, three years after the [[Norman Invasion of Ireland]], having prepared his fleet and army in the mouth of the [[Pembroke River]], [[Henry II of England]] sailed there from the haven.<ref name=JSGuard>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/pembroke.htm|title=H.M.

The first recorded mention of Paterchurch was in 1289. A [[medieval]] [[Watchtower|tower]] was built and like nearby 18th century and 19th century fortifications, it may have served as a lookout post. By the 17th century, additional domestic and farm buildings stood close to the tower and the isolated settlement had its own cemetery, whose last recorded burial is that of a Roger Adams, in 1731. The ruin of the tower now lies within the walls of the dockyard.\n\nPaterchurch Tower was the centre of an estate said to stretch from Pennar Point to [[Cosheston]]. This changed hands in 1422 when Ellen de Paterchurch married a John Adams. Prior to the building of the town and before the dockyard was thought of, various sales and exchanges took place between the principal local landowners \u2013 the Adams, Owen and Meyrick families. These exchanges left the [[Meyrick Baronets|Meyricks]] in control of most of the land on which the [[Shipyard|dockyard]] and new town were to develop. By 1802 the Paterchurch buildings were mostly ruins.\n\n== Naval dockyards ==\n===1758 Naval report===\nThe origins of naval shipbuilding on [[Milford Haven Waterway|Milford Haven]] were in the private shipyard of Jacobs on the north side of the waterway. In November 1757, the Admiralty sent a surveying delegation to the haven, which prepared a report for Parliament recommending, ''\"the construction of a Milford dock yard\"''.<ref name=JSGuard/> No such place as Milford existed at this time, just the village of [[Hubberston]]. Secondly, the report showed early signs of [[lobbying]] existing, with the scale of the local infrastructure and ship building activity exaggerated.<ref name=JSGuard/>\n\n===Milford Haven===\n{{main|Milford Haven}}\nDockyard development began on the north bank of the waterway. By the late 18th century, much of the village and the lands around Hubberston were owned by diplomat and politician [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]. Together with his nephew, the Hon. Charles Grenville, he proposed a scheme of development under the title \"Milford\", in reference to the 1758 report.<ref name=JSGuard/> They began by building a shipyard, and leased it to a Messrs. Harry and Joseph Jacob, though after receiving an order in 1796 to build a [[frigate]] and later a 74-gun ship-of-the-line, Jacobs went bankrupt. The Navy took over the shipyard lease.<ref name=JSGuard/>\n\nIn 1809, a naval commission recommended purchase of the Milford Haven facility and formal establishment of a Royal Navy dockyard.<ref name=JSGuard/> After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the merging of the two sides of the [[Royal Navy]] under the Admiralty Board, a [[Royal School of Naval Architecture|School of Naval Architecture]] was opened in [[Portsmouth]] in 1810 and, effectively then, Millford was to be set up as a model dockyard under French management (possibly to develop the manoeuvrability of British ships) from which lessons could be learnt for implementation in other dockyards.<ref name=JSGuard/>\n\n===New town of Pembroke Dock===\n[[File:Customs House - geograph.org.uk - 209948.jpg|thumbnail|Former dockyard buildings: offices ('Sunderland House', left) and storehouse (right)]]\nAfter failing to agree a purchase price for the existing Millford shipyard with Fulke Greville, Charles Greville's heir, the Admiralty agreed purchase of land {{convert|5|mi}} across the haven from Milford, near the town of Pembroke in a district called Pater (village) or Paterchurch. This was one of the few sites in the haven suitable for building a dock for constructing decent sized ships, as its shoreline was flat but led quickly into deep harbour. Secondly, the [[Board of Ordnance]] had purchased {{convert|50|acre}} in preparation from the 1758 report to strengthen the haven's defences,<ref>[https://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/300014390-pater-fort-sw-and-w-walls-pembroke-dock#.WhGawUx2vD4 Listing for remains of Pater Fort, 1758]</ref> which was added to by the purchase of an adjoining {{convert|20|acre}} for \u00a35,500 from the Meyrick family.<ref name=JSGuard/>\n\nThe town of Pembroke Dock was founded in 1814 when [[Pembroke Dockyard]] was established, initially called Pater Dockyard. Construction started immediately, with the former frigate [[HMS Lapwing (1785)|HMS ''Lapwing'']] driven ashore as a temporary accommodation hulk. Orders were placed for the construction of 74 gun battleship, and four frigates. However, after the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June 1815, although the scheme still seemed ill placed in what would be a smaller Royal Navy, the final plans were given the go ahead on 31 October 1815. The Naval Dockyards Society published a historical review in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pembrokedock.org/history.htm |title=Pembroke Dock Community Web Project |publisher=Pembrokedock.org |date=15 July 1926 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219213101/http://www.pembrokedock.org/history.htm |archivedate=19 February 2012  }}</ref>\n\n===Operations===\n{{more|Category:Ships built in Pembroke Dock}}\n[[File:Disused Dry Dock - geograph.org.uk - 489556.jpg|upright|thumbnail|Disused former dry dock, Pembroke Dockyard]]\nOn 10 February 1816, the first two ships were launched from the dockyard \u2013 HMS Valorous and Ariadne, both 20-gun [[post-ship]]s, subsequently converted at [[Plymouth Dockyard]] into 26-gun ships. Over the span of 112 years, five [[royal yacht]]s were built, along with 263 other [[Royal Navy]] vessels. The last ship launched from the dockyard was the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] tanker ''Oleander'' on 26 April 1922.\n\nIn 1925, it was announced that the Royal Dockyards at Pembroke Dock and [[Rosyth]] were redundant and would be closed. A petition was sent to Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]], stressing the lack of alternative employment and the economic consequences of closure, but the decision was not overturned. [[First Sea Lord]], [[Admiral of the Fleet]] [[Earl Beatty]], said, \"Whether these Yards are necessary for naval purposes, the Admiralty is the only competent judge. As to whether they are necessary for political or social reasons is for the Government to decide. The fact is, that so far as the upkeep of the Fleet is concerned, they are entirely redundant.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pembrokedock.org/h_dockyard_2.htm |title=From W.S.

The first recorded mention of Paterchurch was in 1289. A [[medieval]] [[Watchtower|tower]] was built and like nearby 18th century and 19th century fortifications, it may have served as a lookout post. By the 17th century, additional domestic and farm buildings stood close to the tower and the isolated settlement had its own cemetery, whose last recorded burial is that of a Roger Adams, in 1731. The ruin of the tower now lies within the walls of the dockyard.\n\nPaterchurch Tower was the centre of an estate said to stretch from Pennar Point to [[Cosheston]]. This changed hands in 1422 when Ellen de Paterchurch married a John Adams. Prior to the building of the town and before the dockyard was thought of, various sales and exchanges took place between the principal local landowners \u2013 the Adams, Owen and Meyrick families. These exchanges left the [[Meyrick Baronets|Meyricks]] in control of most of the land on which the [[Shipyard|dockyard]] and new town were to develop. By 1802 the Paterchurch buildings were mostly ruins.\n\n== Naval dockyards ==\n===1758 Naval report===\nThe origins of naval shipbuilding on [[Milford Haven Waterway|Milford Haven]] were in the private shipyard of Jacobs on the north side of the waterway. In November 1757, the Admiralty sent a surveying delegation to the haven, which prepared a report for Parliament recommending, ''\"the construction of a Milford dock yard\"''.<ref name=JSGuard/> No such place as Milford existed at this time, just the village of [[Hubberston]]. Secondly, the report showed early signs of [[lobbying]] existing, with the scale of the local infrastructure and ship building activity exaggerated.<ref name=JSGuard/>\n\n===Milford Haven===\n{{main|Milford Haven}}\nDockyard development began on the north bank of the waterway. By the late 18th century, much of the village and the lands around Hubberston were owned by diplomat and politician [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]. Together with his nephew, the Hon. Charles Grenville, he proposed a scheme of development under the title \"Milford\", in reference to the 1758 report.<ref name=JSGuard/> They began by building a shipyard, and leased it to a Messrs. Harry and Joseph Jacob, though after receiving an order in 1796 to build a [[frigate]] and later a 74-gun ship-of-the-line, Jacobs went bankrupt. The Navy took over the shipyard lease.<ref name=JSGuard/>\n\nIn 1809, a naval commission recommended purchase of the Milford Haven facility and formal establishment of a Royal Navy dockyard.<ref name=JSGuard/> After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the merging of the two sides of the [[Royal Navy]] under the Admiralty Board, a [[Royal School of Naval Architecture|School of Naval Architecture]] was opened in [[Portsmouth]] in 1810 and, effectively then, Millford was to be set up as a model dockyard under French management (possibly to develop the manoeuvrability of British ships) from which lessons could be learnt for implementation in other dockyards.<ref name=JSGuard/>\n\n===New town of Pembroke Dock===\n[[File:Customs House - geograph.org.uk - 209948.jpg|thumbnail|Former dockyard buildings: offices ('Sunderland House', left) and storehouse (right)]]\nAfter failing to agree a purchase price for the existing Millford shipyard with Fulke Greville, Charles Greville's heir, the Admiralty agreed purchase of land {{convert|5|mi}} across the haven from Milford, near the town of Pembroke in a district called Pater (village) or Paterchurch. This was one of the few sites in the haven suitable for building a dock for constructing decent sized ships, as its shoreline was flat but led quickly into deep harbour. Secondly, the [[Board of Ordnance]] had purchased {{convert|50|acre}} in preparation from the 1758 report to strengthen the haven's defences,<ref>[https://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/300014390-pater-fort-sw-and-w-walls-pembroke-dock#.WhGawUx2vD4 Listing for remains of Pater Fort, 1758]</ref> which was added to by the purchase of an adjoining {{convert|20|acre}} for \u00a35,500 from the Meyrick family.<ref name=JSGuard/>\n\nThe town of Pembroke Dock was founded in 1814 when [[Pembroke Dockyard]] was established, initially called Pater Dockyard. Construction started immediately, with the former frigate [[HMS Lapwing (1785)|HMS ''Lapwing'']] driven ashore as a temporary accommodation hulk. Orders were placed for the construction of 74 gun battleship, and four frigates. However, after the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June 1815, although the scheme still seemed ill placed in what would be a smaller Royal Navy, the final plans were given the go ahead on 31 October 1815. The Naval Dockyards Society published a historical review in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pembrokedock.org/history.htm |title=Pembroke Dock Community Web Project |publisher=Pembrokedock.org |date=15 July 1926 |accessdate=25 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219213101/http://www.pembrokedock.org/history.htm |archivedate=19 February 2012  }}</ref>\n\n===Operations===\n{{more|Category:Ships built in Pembroke Dock}}\n[[File:Disused Dry Dock - geograph.org.uk - 489556.jpg|upright|thumbnail|Disused former dry dock, Pembroke Dockyard]]\nOn 10 February 1816, the first two ships were launched from the dockyard \u2013 HMS Valorous and Ariadne, both 20-gun [[post-ship]]s, subsequently converted at [[Plymouth Dockyard]] into 26-gun ships. Over the span of 112 years, five [[royal yacht]]s were built, along with 263 other [[Royal Navy]] vessels. The last ship launched from the dockyard was the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] tanker ''Oleander'' on 26 April 1922.\n\nIn 1925, it was announced that the Royal Dockyards at Pembroke Dock and [[Rosyth]] were redundant and would be closed. A petition was sent to Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]], stressing the lack of alternative employment and the economic consequences of closure, but the decision was not overturned. [[First Sea Lord]], [[Admiral of the Fleet]] [[Earl Beatty]], said, \"Whether these Yards are necessary for naval purposes, the Admiralty is the only competent judge.

Between 1849 and 1857, two [[Martello tower]]s of dressed [[Portland stone]] were constructed at the south-western and north-western corner of the dockyard; both were garrisoned by sergeants of artillery and their families.\n\nIn the 1850s a hutted encampment was established nearby on Llanion Hill. In 1904 this was replaced by four brick-built barrack blocks, designed to house a thousand troops. The new Llanion Barracks was 'the first barracks to be constructed with a separate area for cooking and ablutions and was one of the most modern in the country'.<ref>[http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/32085/details/llanion-barracks-pembroke-dock Coflein: the National Monuments Record of Wales]</ref>\n\nThe town remained garrisoned with troops until 1967.\n\n== RAF base ==\n{{Main|RAF Pembroke Dock}}\n[[Image:Pembroke hanger.jpg|thumb|alt=.|The hangars dominate the landscape]]\nWith the closure of the dockyard in 1926, the year of the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike]], unemployment was high through the [[Great Depression]] until 1931 when [[No. 210 Squadron RAF]] arrived equipped with [[Supermarine Southampton|Southampton II]] [[flying boat]]s.

Pepi Popp, the club's first chairman, designed the still unchanged FC 05 logo. \n\nThe team played in various local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. Back  then, the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1.

The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008.

FC Schweinfurt 05 team in 1905]]\n\nAt a time when football became more and more popular among the middle class, 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 was founded on 5 May 1905 by a number of sports enthusiasts. Pepi Popp, the club's first chairman, designed the still unchanged FC 05 logo. The team played in various local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. Back  then, the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1.

With promotion to Gauliga Bayern in 1933, however, the existing venue proved to be more and more inadequate.\n\nThe club's necessity finally motivated local industrialist [[Willy Sachs]] to the donation of a football stadium to the City of [[Schweinfurt]], where the patron designated a privileged right of use for FC Schweinfurt 05. The new [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]],<ref name=\"Willy Sachs Stadion\"/> built by German architect [[Paul Bonatz]], was opened on 23 July 1936 in the presence of leading politicians of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Cicero\"/> The stadium saw its first game three days later with a 2\u20132 draw between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1935 German football championship|1935]] German champion [[FC Schalke 04]].<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> Attandance record was 22,500 at a friendly between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1.

Besides the football field, the stadium offers [[track and field]] facilities, and is equipped with a classical [[Marathon]] gate. Premises at the stadium include changing rooms for players, coaches, and referees. Speaker cabins and a press area are available in the grandstand.\n\nThe stadium has been renovated and equipped with [[floodlights]] in 2001 in order to meet the requirements for [[2001\u201302 2.

This produces a slower moving and more controllable fire. However this term is also colloquially used to mean all of controlled burning as well.\n\nThis process is commonly used for hazard reduction burns and the preparation of fire breaks to enable controlled/ hazard reduction burns.\nBack burning involves starting small fires along a man-made or natural [[firebreak]] in front of a main fire front.<ref>[http://www.hillside.rfsa.org.au/fwhaz.htm What is Hazard Reduction?] Retrieved on 10-3-2009</ref> Back burning reduces the amount of fuel that is available to the main fire by the time that it reaches the burnt area.\n\nBack burning is utilized in controlled burning and during wildfire events. While controlled burns utilize back burning during planned fire events to create a \"black line\", back burning or backfiring is also done to stop a wildfire that is already in progress. Firebreaks are also often used as an anchor point to start a line of fires along natural or manmade features such as a river, road or a bulldozed clearing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/explainer-back-burning-and-fuel-reduction-20605 |title=Explainer: back burning and fuel reduction |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=8 August 2014 |website=The Conversation |publisher=The Conversation Trust (UK) Limited |access-date=5 January 2016 }}</ref> It is called ''back burning'' because the small fires are designed to \"burn back\" towards the main fire front and are usually burning and traveling against ground level winds.\n\nSee [[wikt:fight fire with fire]].\n\n==Forest use==\nAnother consideration is the issue of [[fire prevention]]. In [[Florida]], during the drought in 1995, catastrophic [[wildfire]]s burned numerous homes. But forestry managers in the [[Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services|Florida Division of Forestry]] noted that the underlying problem was previous cessation of controlled burning, resulting from [[NIMBY|complaints by homeowners]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Each year additional [[leaf]] litter and dropped branches increased the likelihood of a hot and uncontrollable fire.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fuel loads, fire regimes, and post-fire fuel dynamics in Florida Keys pine forests|journal=International Journal of Wildland Fire|year=2006|volume=15|issue=4|pages=463\u2013478|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~kopturs/pubs/Sahetal2006.pdf|doi=10.1071/wf05100|access-date=2011-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211052623/http://www2.fiu.edu/~kopturs/pubs/Sahetal2006.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-11|url-status=dead|last1=Sah|first1=Jay P.|last2=Ross|first2=Michael S.|last3=Snyder|first3=James R.|last4=Koptur|first4=Suzanne|last5=Cooley|first5=Hillary C.|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.3531}}</ref>\n\nControlled burns are sometimes ignited using a tool known as the [[driptorch]], which allows a steady stream of flaming fuel to be directed to the ground as needed.  Variations on the driptorch can be used such as the helitorch, which is mounted on a [[helicopter]], or other improvised devices such as mounting a driptorch-like device on the side of a [[vehicle]].  A [[pyrotechnic]] device known as a [[Flare|fusee]] can be used for ignition in nearby fuels while a [[Flare gun|Very pistol]] can be for fuels farther away.\n\nFor the burning of [[Slash (logging)|slash]], [[waste]] materials left over from [[logging]], there are several types of controlled burns. Broadcast burning is the burning of scattered slash over a wide area. Pile burning is gathering up the slash into piles before burning. These burning piles may be referred to as [[bonfire]]s. High temperatures can harm the [[soil]], damaging it [[Hydrophobic soil|physically]], [[chemical change|chemically]] or [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] it. Broadcast burns tend to have lower temperatures and will not harm the soil as much as pile burning,<ref name=\"pile burning\">{{cite journal|last=Julie E. Korb |author2=Nancy C. Johnson |author3=W.

In lop and scatter burning, slash is left to compact over time, or is compacted with machinery.

In particular, the [[giant sequoia]] depends on fire to reproduce: the cones of the tree open after a fire releases their seeds, the fire having cleared all competing vegetation. Due to fire suppression efforts  during the early and mid 20th century, low-intensity fires no longer occurred naturally in many groves, and still do not occur in some groves today. The suppression of fires also led to ground fuel build-up and the dense growth which posed the risk of catastrophic wildfires. It wasn't until the 1970s that the National Park Service began systematic fires for the purpose of new seed growth.{{Citation needed|date = February 2015}} ''[[Eucalyptus regnans]]'' or mountain ash of Australia also depends on fire but in a different fashion. They carry their seeds in capsules which can deposit at any time of the year. Being flammable, during a fire the capsules drop nearly all of their seeds and the fire consumes the eucalypt adults, but most of the seeds survive using the ash as a source of nutrients; at their rate of growth, they quickly dominate the land and a new eucalyptus forest grows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ThePrivateLifeOfPlants_581|title=The Private Life of Plants|work=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Field burning|Slash and burn}}\n\n==Agricultural use==\nIn addition to forest management, controlled burning is also used in agriculture. In the developing world, this is often referred to as [[slash and burn]]. In industrialized nations, it is seen as one component of [[shifting cultivation]], as a part of field preparation for planting. Often called '''field burning''', this technique is used to clear the land of any existing crop residue as well as kill weeds and weed seeds. Field burning is less expensive than most other methods such as herbicides or tillage, but because it produces smoke and other fire-related pollutants, its use is not popular in agricultural areas bounded by residential housing.{{Citation needed|date = February 2015}}\n\nIn the United States, field burning is a legislative and regulatory issue at both the federal and state levels of government.\n\n===Controversy ===\nIn [[Oregon]], field burning has been widely used by [[grass]] seed farmers as a method for clearing fields for the next round of planting, as well as revitalizing serotinous grasses that require fire in order to grow seed again. The [[Oregon Department of Environmental Quality]] began requiring a permit for farmers to burn their fields in 1981, but the requirements became stricter in 1988 following a multi-car collision<ref>[http://extension.oregonstate.edu/oap/story.php?S_No=80&storyType=oap&page=4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903084945/http://extension.oregonstate.edu/oap/story.php?S_No=80&storyType=oap&page=4|date=September 3, 2006}}</ref> in which smoke from field burning near [[Albany, Oregon]], obscured the vision of drivers on Interstate 5, leading to a 23-car collision in which 5 people died and 37 were injured.<ref>[http://extension.oregonstate.edu/oap/story.php?S_No=72&storyType=oap&cmd=pf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905210932/http://extension.oregonstate.edu/oap/story.php?S_No=72&storyType=oap&cmd=pf|date=September 5, 2006}}</ref>  This resulted in more scrutiny of field burning and proposals to ban field burning in the state altogether.<ref>[http://www.westernlaw.org/our-work/field-burning/end-field-burning-in 2008] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2008/07/24/coverstory.html |last=Mortensen |first=Camilla |title=Blowing Smoke |publisher=Eugene Weekly |accessdate=2011-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903080648/http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2008/07/24/coverstory.html |archive-date=2011-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmtr.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=3500afae-7a5f-414c-9d7d-4e191b911cce |accessdate=January 20, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn the European Union burning crop stubble after harvest is used by farmers for plant health reasons under several restrictions in the cross compliance regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2016/gaec-6-maintaining-the-level-of-organic-matter-in-soil|title=GAEC 6: Maintaining the level of organic matter in soil - Guide to cross compliance in England: 2016 - Guidance - GOV.UK|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n== Political history ==\nThe conflict of controlled burn policy in the United States has roots in the historical campaigns to combat wildfires and to the eventual acceptance of fire as a necessary ecological phenomenon.

While the most common driver of fuel treatment is the prevention of loss of human life, certain parameters can also be changed to promote biodiversity and to rearrange stand ages appropriately. The risk of fatal fires can also be reduced proactively by reducing ground fuels before they can create a fuel ladder and begin an active crown fire.

However this term is also colloquially used to mean all of controlled burning as well.\n\nThis process is commonly used for hazard reduction burns and the preparation of fire breaks to enable controlled/ hazard reduction burns.\nBack burning involves starting small fires along a man-made or natural [[firebreak]] in front of a main fire front.<ref>[http://www.hillside.rfsa.org.au/fwhaz.htm What is Hazard Reduction?] Retrieved on 10-3-2009</ref> Back burning reduces the amount of fuel that is available to the main fire by the time that it reaches the burnt area.\n\nBack burning is utilized in controlled burning and during wildfire events. While controlled burns utilize back burning during planned fire events to create a \"black line\", back burning or backfiring is also done to stop a wildfire that is already in progress. Firebreaks are also often used as an anchor point to start a line of fires along natural or manmade features such as a river, road or a bulldozed clearing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/explainer-back-burning-and-fuel-reduction-20605 |title=Explainer: back burning and fuel reduction |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=8 August 2014 |website=The Conversation |publisher=The Conversation Trust (UK) Limited |access-date=5 January 2016 }}</ref> It is called ''back burning'' because the small fires are designed to \"burn back\" towards the main fire front and are usually burning and traveling against ground level winds.\n\nSee [[wikt:fight fire with fire]].\n\n==Forest use==\nAnother consideration is the issue of [[fire prevention]]. In [[Florida]], during the drought in 1995, catastrophic [[wildfire]]s burned numerous homes. But forestry managers in the [[Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services|Florida Division of Forestry]] noted that the underlying problem was previous cessation of controlled burning, resulting from [[NIMBY|complaints by homeowners]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Each year additional [[leaf]] litter and dropped branches increased the likelihood of a hot and uncontrollable fire.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fuel loads, fire regimes, and post-fire fuel dynamics in Florida Keys pine forests|journal=International Journal of Wildland Fire|year=2006|volume=15|issue=4|pages=463\u2013478|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~kopturs/pubs/Sahetal2006.pdf|doi=10.1071/wf05100|access-date=2011-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211052623/http://www2.fiu.edu/~kopturs/pubs/Sahetal2006.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-11|url-status=dead|last1=Sah|first1=Jay P.|last2=Ross|first2=Michael S.|last3=Snyder|first3=James R.|last4=Koptur|first4=Suzanne|last5=Cooley|first5=Hillary C.|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.3531}}</ref>\n\nControlled burns are sometimes ignited using a tool known as the [[driptorch]], which allows a steady stream of flaming fuel to be directed to the ground as needed.  Variations on the driptorch can be used such as the helitorch, which is mounted on a [[helicopter]], or other improvised devices such as mounting a driptorch-like device on the side of a [[vehicle]].  A [[pyrotechnic]] device known as a [[Flare|fusee]] can be used for ignition in nearby fuels while a [[Flare gun|Very pistol]] can be for fuels farther away.\n\nFor the burning of [[Slash (logging)|slash]], [[waste]] materials left over from [[logging]], there are several types of controlled burns. Broadcast burning is the burning of scattered slash over a wide area. Pile burning is gathering up the slash into piles before burning. These burning piles may be referred to as [[bonfire]]s. High temperatures can harm the [[soil]], damaging it [[Hydrophobic soil|physically]], [[chemical change|chemically]] or [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] it. Broadcast burns tend to have lower temperatures and will not harm the soil as much as pile burning,<ref name=\"pile burning\">{{cite journal|last=Julie E. Korb |author2=Nancy C. Johnson |author3=W.

In lop and scatter burning, slash is left to compact over time, or is compacted with machinery. This produces a lower intensity fire, as long as the slash is not packed too tightly.<ref name=\"pile burning\"/> However, soil may be damaged if machinery is used to compress the slash.\n\nControlled burning reduces [[fuel]]s, may improve [[wildlife]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]],<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/443 |title=Whither wildlife without fire? |journal=Transactions of the 63Rd North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference; 1998 March 20-25; Orlando, Fl.

In particular, the [[giant sequoia]] depends on fire to reproduce: the cones of the tree open after a fire releases their seeds, the fire having cleared all competing vegetation. Due to fire suppression efforts  during the early and mid 20th century, low-intensity fires no longer occurred naturally in many groves, and still do not occur in some groves today. The suppression of fires also led to ground fuel build-up and the dense growth which posed the risk of catastrophic wildfires. It wasn't until the 1970s that the National Park Service began systematic fires for the purpose of new seed growth.{{Citation needed|date = February 2015}} ''[[Eucalyptus regnans]]'' or mountain ash of Australia also depends on fire but in a different fashion. They carry their seeds in capsules which can deposit at any time of the year. Being flammable, during a fire the capsules drop nearly all of their seeds and the fire consumes the eucalypt adults, but most of the seeds survive using the ash as a source of nutrients; at their rate of growth, they quickly dominate the land and a new eucalyptus forest grows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ThePrivateLifeOfPlants_581|title=The Private Life of Plants|work=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Field burning|Slash and burn}}\n\n==Agricultural use==\nIn addition to forest management, controlled burning is also used in agriculture. In the developing world, this is often referred to as [[slash and burn]]. In industrialized nations, it is seen as one component of [[shifting cultivation]], as a part of field preparation for planting. Often called '''field burning''', this technique is used to clear the land of any existing crop residue as well as kill weeds and weed seeds. Field burning is less expensive than most other methods such as herbicides or tillage, but because it produces smoke and other fire-related pollutants, its use is not popular in agricultural areas bounded by residential housing.{{Citation needed|date = February 2015}}\n\nIn the United States, field burning is a legislative and regulatory issue at both the federal and state levels of government.\n\n===Controversy ===\nIn [[Oregon]], field burning has been widely used by [[grass]] seed farmers as a method for clearing fields for the next round of planting, as well as revitalizing serotinous grasses that require fire in order to grow seed again. The [[Oregon Department of Environmental Quality]] began requiring a permit for farmers to burn their fields in 1981, but the requirements became stricter in 1988 following a multi-car collision<ref>[http://extension.oregonstate.edu/oap/story.php?S_No=80&storyType=oap&page=4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903084945/http://extension.oregonstate.edu/oap/story.php?S_No=80&storyType=oap&page=4|date=September 3, 2006}}</ref> in which smoke from field burning near [[Albany, Oregon]], obscured the vision of drivers on Interstate 5, leading to a 23-car collision in which 5 people died and 37 were injured.<ref>[http://extension.oregonstate.edu/oap/story.php?S_No=72&storyType=oap&cmd=pf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905210932/http://extension.oregonstate.edu/oap/story.php?S_No=72&storyType=oap&cmd=pf|date=September 5, 2006}}</ref>  This resulted in more scrutiny of field burning and proposals to ban field burning in the state altogether.<ref>[http://www.westernlaw.org/our-work/field-burning/end-field-burning-in 2008] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2008/07/24/coverstory.html |last=Mortensen |first=Camilla |title=Blowing Smoke |publisher=Eugene Weekly |accessdate=2011-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903080648/http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2008/07/24/coverstory.html |archive-date=2011-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmtr.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=3500afae-7a5f-414c-9d7d-4e191b911cce |accessdate=January 20, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn the European Union burning crop stubble after harvest is used by farmers for plant health reasons under several restrictions in the cross compliance regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2016/gaec-6-maintaining-the-level-of-organic-matter-in-soil|title=GAEC 6: Maintaining the level of organic matter in soil - Guide to cross compliance in England: 2016 - Guidance - GOV.UK|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n== Political history ==\nThe conflict of controlled burn policy in the United States has roots in the historical campaigns to combat wildfires and to the eventual acceptance of fire as a necessary ecological phenomenon. The notion of fire as a tool had somewhat evolved by the late 1970s as the National Park Service authorized and administered controlled burns.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Test of Adversity and Strength: Wildland Fire in the National Park System|last=Rothman|first=Hal K.|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=186}}</ref> While the methodology was still relatively emergent the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]] struck, which significantly politicized fire management. The ensuing media coverage was a spectacle that was vulnerable to misinformation. Reports drastically inflated the scale of the fires which disposed politicians in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana to believe that all fires represented a loss of revenue from tourism.<ref name=\":0\" /> Partially as a result of millions of dollars lost in estimates, stricter data recording was enforced and thresholds were established for determining which fires must be suppressed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Yellowstone in the Afterglow: Lessons from the Fires|last=Franke|first=Mary Ann|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}</ref> Paramount to the new action plans is the suppression of fires that threaten the loss of human life with leniency toward areas of historic, scientific, or special ecological interest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.net/fire|title=Forest Service Wilderness Fire Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Since 1988, many states have made progress toward controlled burns but with a proclivity toward forgetfulness between fire events.

While the most common driver of fuel treatment is the prevention of loss of human life, certain parameters can also be changed to promote biodiversity and to rearrange stand ages appropriately. The risk of fatal fires can also be reduced proactively by reducing ground fuels before they can create a fuel ladder and begin an active crown fire.

The appendage differences divide mantis shrimp into two main types: those that hunt by impaling their prey with spear-like structures and those that smash prey with a powerful blow from a heavily mineralised club-like appendage. A considerable amount of damage can be inflicted after impact with these robust, hammer-like claws. This club is further divided into three subregions: the impact region, the periodic region, and the striated region. Mantis shrimp are commonly separated into two distinct groups determined by the type of claws they possess:\n*'''Smashers''' possess a much more developed club and a more rudimentary spear (which is nevertheless quite sharp and still used in fights between their own kind); the club is used to bludgeon and smash their meals apart. The inner aspect of the terminal portion of the appendage can also possess a sharp edge, used to cut prey while the mantis shrimp swims.\n*'''Spearers''' are armed with spiny appendages topped with barbed tips, used to stab and snag prey.\n\nBoth types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their [[raptorial]] claws at the prey, and can inflict serious damage on victims significantly greater in size than themselves. In smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, with an acceleration of 10,400&nbsp;[[g-force|''g'']] (102,000&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> or 335,000&nbsp;ft/s<sup>2</sup>) and speeds of {{convert|23|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on|lk=on}} from a standing start.<ref name=\"Patek et al\">{{cite journal |author=S.

It allows the manipulation of light across the structure rather than through its depth, the typical way polarisers work. This allows the structure to be both small and microscopically thin, and still be able to produce big, bright, colourful polarised signals.<ref>[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2016/february/mantis-shrimp.html New type of optical material discovered in the secret language of the mantis shrimp].

Some species use [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] patterns on their bodies for signalling with their own and maybe even other species, expanding their range of behavioural signals. They can learn and remember well, and are able to recognise individual neighbours with which they frequently interact. They can recognise them by visual signs and even by individual smell. Many have developed complex social behaviours to defend their space from rivals.\n\nIn a lifetime, they can have as many as 20 or 30 breeding episodes. Depending on the species, the eggs can be laid and kept in a burrow, or they can be carried around under the female's tail until they hatch. Also depending on the species, males and females may come together only to mate, or they may bond in [[monogamous]], long-term relationships.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sharing the job: monogamy and parental care |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/aquarius/monogamy.html |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the monogamous species, the mantis shrimps remain with the same partner up to 20&nbsp;years. They share the same burrow and may be able to coordinate their activities. Both sexes often take care of the eggs (bi parental care). In ''[[Pullosquilla]]'' and some species in ''[[Nannosquilla]]'', the female lays two clutches of eggs - one that the male tends and one that the female tends. In other species, the female looks after the eggs while the male hunts for both of them. After the eggs hatch, the offspring may spend up to three months as [[plankton]].\n\nAlthough stomatopods typically display the standard types of movement seen in [[shrimp|true shrimp]] and [[lobster]]s, one species, ''[[Nannosquilla decemspinosa]]'', has been observed flipping itself into a crude wheel. The species lives in shallow, sandy areas. At low tides, ''N. decemspinosa'' is often stranded by its short rear legs, which are sufficient for movement when the body is supported by water, but not on dry land. The mantis shrimp then performs a forward flip in an attempt to roll towards the next tide pool. ''N. '' has been observed to roll repeatedly for {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but specimens typically travel less than {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Caldwell, Roy L. |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=282 |pages=71\u201373 |year=1979 |title=A unique form of locomotion in a stomatopod&nbsp;\u2013 backward somersaulting |doi=10.1038/282071a0 |issue=5734|bibcode= 1979Natur.282...71C}}</ref>\n\n==Culinary uses==\n[[File:Hai san Hau Loc05.JPG|thumb|left|Mantis shrimp caught at [[H\u1eadu L\u1ed9c District|H\u1eadu L\u1ed9c]], [[Thanh H\u00f3a]], [[Vietnam]]]]\nIn [[Japanese cuisine]], the mantis shrimp species ''[[Oratosquilla oratoria]]'', called {{nihongo|''shako''|\u8766\u86c4}}, is eaten boiled as a [[sushi]] topping, and occasionally raw as [[sashimi]].\n\nMantis shrimps are abundant along [[Vietnam]]'s coast, known in Vietnamese as ''b\u1ec1 b\u1ec1'' or ''t\u00f4m t\u00edt''.

The appendage differences divide mantis shrimp into two main types: those that hunt by impaling their prey with spear-like structures and those that smash prey with a powerful blow from a heavily mineralised club-like appendage. A considerable amount of damage can be inflicted after impact with these robust, hammer-like claws. This club is further divided into three subregions: the impact region, the periodic region, and the striated region. Mantis shrimp are commonly separated into two distinct groups determined by the type of claws they possess:\n*'''Smashers''' possess a much more developed club and a more rudimentary spear (which is nevertheless quite sharp and still used in fights between their own kind); the club is used to bludgeon and smash their meals apart. The inner aspect of the terminal portion of the appendage can also possess a sharp edge, used to cut prey while the mantis shrimp swims.\n*'''Spearers''' are armed with spiny appendages topped with barbed tips, used to stab and snag prey.\n\nBoth types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their [[raptorial]] claws at the prey, and can inflict serious damage on victims significantly greater in size than themselves. In smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, with an acceleration of 10,400&nbsp;[[g-force|''g'']] (102,000&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> or 335,000&nbsp;ft/s<sup>2</sup>) and speeds of {{convert|23|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on|lk=on}} from a standing start.<ref name=\"Patek et al\">{{cite journal |author=S.

Some species use [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] patterns on their bodies for signalling with their own and maybe even other species, expanding their range of behavioural signals. They can learn and remember well, and are able to recognise individual neighbours with which they frequently interact. They can recognise them by visual signs and even by individual smell. Many have developed complex social behaviours to defend their space from rivals.\n\nIn a lifetime, they can have as many as 20 or 30 breeding episodes. Depending on the species, the eggs can be laid and kept in a burrow, or they can be carried around under the female's tail until they hatch. Also depending on the species, males and females may come together only to mate, or they may bond in [[monogamous]], long-term relationships.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sharing the job: monogamy and parental care |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/aquarius/monogamy.html |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the monogamous species, the mantis shrimps remain with the same partner up to 20&nbsp;years. They share the same burrow and may be able to coordinate their activities. Both sexes often take care of the eggs (bi parental care). In ''[[Pullosquilla]]'' and some species in ''[[Nannosquilla]]'', the female lays two clutches of eggs - one that the male tends and one that the female tends. In other species, the female looks after the eggs while the male hunts for both of them. After the eggs hatch, the offspring may spend up to three months as [[plankton]].\n\nAlthough stomatopods typically display the standard types of movement seen in [[shrimp|true shrimp]] and [[lobster]]s, one species, ''[[Nannosquilla decemspinosa]]'', has been observed flipping itself into a crude wheel. The species lives in shallow, sandy areas. At low tides, ''N. decemspinosa'' is often stranded by its short rear legs, which are sufficient for movement when the body is supported by water, but not on dry land. The mantis shrimp then performs a forward flip in an attempt to roll towards the next tide pool. ''N. '' has been observed to roll repeatedly for {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but specimens typically travel less than {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Caldwell, Roy L. |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=282 |pages=71\u201373 |year=1979 |title=A unique form of locomotion in a stomatopod&nbsp;\u2013 backward somersaulting |doi=10.1038/282071a0 |issue=5734|bibcode= 1979Natur.282...71C}}</ref>\n\n==Culinary uses==\n[[File:Hai san Hau Loc05.JPG|thumb|left|Mantis shrimp caught at [[H\u1eadu L\u1ed9c District|H\u1eadu L\u1ed9c]], [[Thanh H\u00f3a]], [[Vietnam]]]]\nIn [[Japanese cuisine]], the mantis shrimp species ''[[Oratosquilla oratoria]]'', called {{nihongo|''shako''|\u8766\u86c4}}, is eaten boiled as a [[sushi]] topping, and occasionally raw as [[sashimi]].\n\nMantis shrimps are abundant along [[Vietnam]]'s coast, known in Vietnamese as ''b\u1ec1 b\u1ec1'' or ''t\u00f4m t\u00edt''.

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a demigod. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. Although the gameplay systems remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{US$|80 million|long=no}}.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success and remains widely regarded as a landmark title and one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards and was acknowledged for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[Japanese role-playing game]]s worldwide.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between [[Miyamoto Musashi]] and [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]], with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a [[fixed width font|fixed-width font]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old [[wiktionary:grawlix|comic book '@#$%!']]-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans.

It is the seventh main installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and became the first in the main series to see a [[PAL region|PAL]] release. The game's story follows [[Cloud Strife]], a mercenary who joins an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization to stop a world-controlling [[megacorporation]] from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a demigod. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including [[Aerith Gainsborough]], who holds the secret to saving their world.\n\nDevelopment began in 1994, originally for the  [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the {{nowrap|[[CD-ROM]]}} format. Veteran ''Final Fantasy'' staff returned, including series creator and producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], and composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The title became the first in the series to use [[full motion video]] and [[3D computer graphics]], which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] backgrounds. Although the gameplay systems remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced more widespread [[science fiction]] elements and a more realistic presentation. The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around {{US$|80 million|long=no}}.\n\nAssisted by a large promotional campaign, ''Final Fantasy VII'' received widespread commercial and critical success and remains widely regarded as a landmark title and one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. The title won numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards and was acknowledged for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing [[Japanese role-playing game]]s worldwide.

This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated.<ref name=\"gamespotps1\"/><ref name=\"All Game\"/> The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. ''Final Fantasy VII'' also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal \"statuses\", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and [[experience points]]. If the player is defeated, it is [[game over]] and the game must be loaded to the last save point.<ref name=ps1manual/>{{rp|20\u201327}}\n\nWhen not in battle, the player can use the menu screen. On this screen, the player can review each character's status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game (when on the world map or at a save point), and manage orbs called Materia.

Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between [[Miyamoto Musashi]] and [[Sasaki Kojir\u014d]], with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojir\u014d respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as \"''kakkoii''\", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair.

In contrast, with ''Final Fantasy VII'', the developers knew from the outset it was going to be \"a real 3D game\", so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based character models or 3D polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team's exposure to the 3D character models used in ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]''. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles.<ref name=\"FamVIIanniversary\">{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|title=Nomura, Kitase and Nojima Discuss Final Fantasy VII's Development|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=May 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202219/http://andriasang.com/con11g/ffvii15/|archivedate=March 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The team purchased Silicon Graphics [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, [[PowerAnimator]], and [[N-World]] for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n[[File:FF7 background.gif|thumb|left|The pre-rendered backgrounds, such as this scene in Midgar, provided the developers with a choice of camera angle, giving a more cinematic experience.|alt=An internal industrial environment, with metal walls, girders and a pipework dominating the scene\u2014a track is visible far below, and steam escapes rhythmically from two points within the area.]]\nThe transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation.<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with ''Final Fantasy VII''; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/><ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators\u2014some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret.<ref name=\"VIIinterviews\"/> Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.<ref name=\"NaoraLecture\"/>\n\nThe main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated [[full motion video]] (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/>\n\n''Final Fantasy VII'' features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes.<ref name=\"CGVsakaguchi\"/> The game's [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) FMVs were produced by [[Visual Works]], a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation.

Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|title=Final Fantasy VIII Interview|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 2, 1999|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114212639/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/final-fantasy-viii-interview|archivedate=January 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The PC version came with a license for [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s [[software synthesizer]] S-YXG70, allowing high-quality [[sequenced music]] despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to [[Yamaha XG|XG format]] files was done by Yamaha.<ref name=\"yamahaxg\"/>\n\nTo maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. [[Eidos Interactive]], whose release of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port.<ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/> The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|title=Eidos Interactive Acquires Exclusive PC Rights to Epic Role-Playing Game Final Fantasy VII|work=Coming Soon Magazine|publisher=Coming Soon Magazine|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=January 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225444/http://www.csoon.com/issue30/p_eidos1.htm|archivedate=December 10, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|title=Final Fantasy VII Coming to the PC|author=Staff|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=December 20, 1996|accessdate=November 27, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070905/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1996-12-16.html|archivedate=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead}}</ref> To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box.

The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making \"the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English\", making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Finalizing the Fantasy|url=https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=|issue=94|pages=91\u201394|via=Retromags|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203135144/https://www.retromags.com/files/file/3681-electronic-gaming-monthly-issue-094-may-1997/|archive-date=February 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith's name\u2014which was intended as a conflation of \"air\" and \"earth\"\u2014as \"Aeris\" due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the [[Quality assurance|QA]] team.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\"/>\n\nThe team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a [[fixed width font|fixed-width font]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} and having to insert [[kanji]] through [[language input keys]] to add special characters (for example, vowels with [[Diacritic|diacritics]]) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character's names, which made unintuitive for the translators to identify characters.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\" /> Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional typeface]] was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee [[Richard Honeywood]] as the \"old [[wiktionary:grawlix|comic book '@#$%!']]-type replacement\".<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/> The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text.<ref name=\"SQlocalization\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|title=GameSpite Quarterly Interview: Richard Honeywood on The Rise of Square Localization|last=Fenlon|first=Wesley|date=April 15, 2012|work=Wesley Fenlon Blog|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145009/http://www.wesleyfenlon.com/2012/04/15/gamespite-quarterly-interview-richard-honeywood-on-the-rise-of-square-localization/|archivedate=December 26, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref> According to Honeywood, the success of ''Final Fantasy VII'' in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.<ref name=\"richardhoneywood\"/>\n\nSome months prior to the game's North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans.

In many countries, and throughout history, thousands of villages have been deserted for a variety of causes. Abandonment of villages is often related to [[epidemic]], [[famine]], [[war]], [[climate change]], environmental destruction, or deliberate clearances.\n\n==Armenia and Azerbaijan==\nHundreds of villages in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] were deserted following the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. Between 1988 and 1993, 400,000 ethnic [[Azerbaijani people|Azeris]], and [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] fled the area and nearly 200 villages in Armenia itself populated by Azeris and Kurds were abandoned by 1991. Likewise nearly 300,000 Armenians fled from Azerbaijan between 1988 and 1993, including 50 villages populated by Armenians in Northern Artsakh that were abandoned. Majority of the Armenian settlements and [[List of Armenian churches in Azerbaijan|churches]] outside [[Armenia]] and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] have been destroyed including those in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Triumph of Tolerance or Vandalism?|url=http://hetq.am/eng/print/10215/|website=Hetq.am}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=AZERBAIJAN: VANDALISM AS USUAL|url=http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/09.12.2010.php|website=genocide-museum.am}}</ref>\n\n==Australia==\nIn Australia, the government requires operators of mining towns to remove all traces of the town when it is abandoned.  This has occurred in the case of [[Mary Kathleen, Queensland|Mary Kathleen]], [[Goldsworthy, Western Australia|Goldsworthy]] and [[Shay Gap, Western Australia|Shay Gap]]. Some towns have been lost or moved when dams are built.\n\n==Belarus==\n\nIn 1988, two years after the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the Belarussian government created the [[Polesie State Radioecological Reserve]], a {{convert|1313|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} exclusion zone to protect people against the effects of [[radiation]]. 22,000 people lived there in the 96 settlements that were abandoned, including [[Aravichy]] and [[Dzernavichy]], and the area has since been expanded by a further {{convert|849|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Cyprus==\nVillages have been abandoned as a result of the [[Cyprus dispute]]. Some of these are reported to be landmined.<ref>[http://www.icbl.org/lm/1999/cyprus.html#fn2939. Cyprus], ''Landmine Monitor'' Report 1999</ref>\n\n==France==\n{{See also|List of French villages destroyed in World War I}}\nA number of villages, mainly in the north and north western areas of the country, were destroyed during [[World War One]] and [[World War Two]]. A percentage of them were rebuilt next to the original sites, with the original villages remaining in a [[ruined]] state.\n\n\n==Germany==\n[[File:Kirchenruine Winnefeld 01.jpg|thumb|[[Winnefeld]] church ruin]]\nThere are hundreds of abandoned villages, known as ''[[:de:W\u00fcstung|W\u00fcstungen]]'', in Germany. Geographer [[Kurt Scharlau]] categorized the different types in the 1930s, making distinctions between temporary and permanent W\u00fcstung, settlements used for different purposes (farms or villages), and the extent of abandonment (partial or total).<ref>K. Scharlau, ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur geographischen Betrachtung der W\u00fcstungen'', Badische Geographische Abteilungen Vol. 10, Freiburg i. Br. 1933.</ref> His scheme has been expanded, and has been criticized for not taking into account expansion and regression. A distinction is commonly made between ''Flurw\u00fcstungen'' (farmed areas) and ''Ortsw\u00fcstungen'' (sites where buildings formerly stood) by archaeologists. The most drastic period of abandonment in modern times was during the 14th and 15th centuries \u2013 before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this had been reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450.<ref>{{cite book|title=Peasant Fires: The Drummer of Niklashausen|author=Richard Wunderli|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|page=52|isbn=0-253-36725-5|year=1992}}</ref> As in Britain, the Black Death played a large role in this, as did the growth of large villages and towns, the [[Little Ice Age]], the introduction of [[crop rotation]], and war (in Germany, particularly the [[30 Years War]]). In later times, the [[German Empire]] created a number of [[Proving ground|training grounds]] for the military that were eventually abandoned.\n\n==Hong Kong==\nMany villages in remote parts of the [[New Territories]], Hong Kong, usually in valleys or on islands, have been abandoned due to inaccessibility. Residents go to live in urban areas with better job opportunities. Some villages have been moved to new sites to make way for reservoirs or [[New towns of Hong Kong|new town]] development. See also [[walled villages of Hong Kong]] and [[list of villages in Hong Kong]].\n\n==Hungary==\nHundreds of villages were abandoned during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 16\u201317th century. Many of them were never repopulated and generally left few visible traces. Real ghost towns are rare in present-day [[Hungary]], except the abandoned villages of [[Derenk]] (left in 1943) and [[Nagyg\u00e9c]] (left in 1970). Due to the decrease of rural population beginning in the 1980s dozens of villages are now threatened with abandonment. The first village officially declared as \"died out\" was [[Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171]] in the end of the 1970s but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Sometimes depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts like [[K\u00e1n, Hungary|K\u00e1n]], [[Tornak\u00e1polna]], [[Szanticska]], [[Gorica, Hungary|Gorica]] and [[R\u00e9vfalu]].\n\n==India==\nAbout ten million people, approximately one-third of the population of the affected area, are estimated to have died in the [[Bengal famine of 1770]]. Regions where the famine occurred included especially the modern Indian states of [[Bihar]] and [[West Bengal]], but the famine also extended into [[Odisha]] and [[Jharkhand]] as well as modern [[Bangladesh]]. Among the worst affected areas were [[Birbhum]] and [[Murshidabad]] in [[Bengal]], and [[Tirhut]], [[Champaran]] and [[Bettiah]] in Bihar.\n\nA partial shortfall in crops, considered normal, occurred in 1768 and was followed in late 1769 by more severe conditions. By September 1769 there was a severe drought, and alarming reports were coming in of rural distress. These were, however, ignored by company officers.\n\nBy early 1770 there was starvation, and by mid-1770 deaths from starvation were occurring on a large scale. There were also reports of the living feeding on the bodies of the dead in the middle of that year. [[Smallpox]] and other diseases further took their toll of the population. Later in 1770 good rainfall resulted in a good harvest and the famine abated. However, other shortfalls occurred in the following years, raising the total death toll.\n\nAs a result of the famine, large areas were depopulated and returned to jungle for decades to come as the survivors migrated ''en masse'' in a search for food. Many cultivated lands were abandoned \u2013 much of Birbhum, for instance, returned to jungle and was virtually impassable for decades afterwards. From 1772 on, bands of [[bandits]] and [[criminal|thug]]s became an established feature of Bengal, and were only brought under control by punitive actions in the 1780s.\n\n==Ireland==\nSeveral villages in Ireland have been abandoned during the Middle Ages or later: [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s poem \"[[The Deserted Village]]\" (1770) being a famous commentary on rural depopulation. Notable deserted villages include:\n*[[Cannakill]], County Offaly\n*[[Clonmines]], County Wexford\n*[[Kilcornan]], County Galway\n*[[Port, County Donegal|Port]], County Donegal\n*[[Rindoon]], County Roscommon\n*[[Scattery Island]], County Clare\n*[[Slievemore]], Achill Island, County Mayo\n*[[Tonaroasty]], County Galway\n\nSmaller rural settlements, known as [[clachans]], were also abandoned in large numbers during the [[Irish Potato Famine]] (1845\u201350).\n\n==Territory of the former British Mandate of Palestine including territory of Palestinian Authority and Gaza==\n{{Main|List of villages depopulated during the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus}}\nAs a consequence of the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] during the [[1948 Palestine war]], around 720,000 [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arabs]] were displaced, leaving around 400 Palestinian Arab towns and villages depopulated in what became Israel. In addition, several Jewish communities in what became Israel, the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] were also depopulated.\n\nIn August 2005, Israel evacuated [[Gush Katif]] and all other Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. Some structures in these settlements, including greenhouses and synagogues, were left standing after the withdrawal.\n\n==Malta==\n[[File:Malta - Zurrieq - Triq Hal Far - Tal-Baqqari 03 ies.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Tal-Baqqari, an abandoned village near [[\u017burrieq]]]]\nMany small villages around [[Malta]] were abandoned between the 14th and 18th centuries.

It could be the result of natural events, such as rivers changing course or [[silt]]ing up, or coastal and estuarine [[erosion]].\n\nSometimes villages were deliberately cleared; the [[Harrying of the North]] caused widespread devastation in the winter of 1069\u20131070. In the 12th and 13th centuries, many villages were removed to make way for [[monastery|monasteries]], and in the 18th century, it became fashionable for land-owning [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] to live in large mansions set in large landscaped parklands. Villages that obstructed the view were removed, although by the early 19th century it had become common to provide replacements.\n\nIn modern times, a few villages have been abandoned due to [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]] being built and the location being flooded. These include [[Capel Celyn]] in Gwynedd, Wales, [[Mardale|Mardale Green]] in the [[Lake District|English Lake District]] and two villages \u2013 [[Ashopton]] and [[Derwent Village, Derbyshire|Derwent]] \u2013 drowned by the [[Ladybower Reservoir]] in Derbyshire. In other cases, such as [[Tide Mills, East Sussex]], [[Imber]] and [[Tyneham]], the village lands have been converted to military training areas.

In many countries, and throughout history, thousands of villages have been deserted for a variety of causes. Abandonment of villages is often related to [[epidemic]], [[famine]], [[war]], [[climate change]], environmental destruction, or deliberate clearances.\n\n==Armenia and Azerbaijan==\nHundreds of villages in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] were deserted following the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. Between 1988 and 1993, 400,000 ethnic [[Azerbaijani people|Azeris]], and [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] fled the area and nearly 200 villages in Armenia itself populated by Azeris and Kurds were abandoned by 1991. Likewise nearly 300,000 Armenians fled from Azerbaijan between 1988 and 1993, including 50 villages populated by Armenians in Northern Artsakh that were abandoned. Majority of the Armenian settlements and [[List of Armenian churches in Azerbaijan|churches]] outside [[Armenia]] and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] have been destroyed including those in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Triumph of Tolerance or Vandalism?|url=http://hetq.am/eng/print/10215/|website=Hetq.am}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=AZERBAIJAN: VANDALISM AS USUAL|url=http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/09.12.2010.php|website=genocide-museum.am}}</ref>\n\n==Australia==\nIn Australia, the government requires operators of mining towns to remove all traces of the town when it is abandoned.  This has occurred in the case of [[Mary Kathleen, Queensland|Mary Kathleen]], [[Goldsworthy, Western Australia|Goldsworthy]] and [[Shay Gap, Western Australia|Shay Gap]]. Some towns have been lost or moved when dams are built.\n\n==Belarus==\n\nIn 1988, two years after the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the Belarussian government created the [[Polesie State Radioecological Reserve]], a {{convert|1313|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} exclusion zone to protect people against the effects of [[radiation]]. 22,000 people lived there in the 96 settlements that were abandoned, including [[Aravichy]] and [[Dzernavichy]], and the area has since been expanded by a further {{convert|849|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Cyprus==\nVillages have been abandoned as a result of the [[Cyprus dispute]].

Geographer [[Kurt Scharlau]] categorized the different types in the 1930s, making distinctions between temporary and permanent W\u00fcstung, settlements used for different purposes (farms or villages), and the extent of abandonment (partial or total).<ref>K. Scharlau, ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur geographischen Betrachtung der W\u00fcstungen'', Badische Geographische Abteilungen Vol. 10, Freiburg i. Br. 1933.</ref> His scheme has been expanded, and has been criticized for not taking into account expansion and regression. A distinction is commonly made between ''Flurw\u00fcstungen'' (farmed areas) and ''Ortsw\u00fcstungen'' (sites where buildings formerly stood) by archaeologists. The most drastic period of abandonment in modern times was during the 14th and 15th centuries \u2013 before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this had been reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450.<ref>{{cite book|title=Peasant Fires: The Drummer of Niklashausen|author=Richard Wunderli|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|page=52|isbn=0-253-36725-5|year=1992}}</ref> As in Britain, the Black Death played a large role in this, as did the growth of large villages and towns, the [[Little Ice Age]], the introduction of [[crop rotation]], and war (in Germany, particularly the [[30 Years War]]). In later times, the [[German Empire]] created a number of [[Proving ground|training grounds]] for the military that were eventually abandoned.\n\n==Hong Kong==\nMany villages in remote parts of the [[New Territories]], Hong Kong, usually in valleys or on islands, have been abandoned due to inaccessibility. Residents go to live in urban areas with better job opportunities. Some villages have been moved to new sites to make way for reservoirs or [[New towns of Hong Kong|new town]] development. See also [[walled villages of Hong Kong]] and [[list of villages in Hong Kong]].\n\n==Hungary==\nHundreds of villages were abandoned during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 16\u201317th century. Many of them were never repopulated and generally left few visible traces. Real ghost towns are rare in present-day [[Hungary]], except the abandoned villages of [[Derenk]] (left in 1943) and [[Nagyg\u00e9c]] (left in 1970).

It has an area of {{convert|164.54|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=off}} and an official 2010 Census population of 1,798,601, which had risen to 2,043,213 at the 2015 Intermediate Census.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2018.</ref> The latest official estimate as at mid 2019 is 2,237,006<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, 2019.</ref> \u2013 making it the eighth [[List of largest suburbs by population|most populated suburb in the world]] at the latter date.\n\nTangerang, along with South Tangerang, is where many giant developers created built-up areas such as BSD City, Gading Serpong, Alam Sutera, and Lippo Village.\n\nTangerang is home for [[Soekarno\u2013Hatta International Airport]] which serves Jakarta metropolitan area and as the Indonesia's main gateway.

Many international corporations have plants in the city. Tangerang tends to be hot and humid, with little in the way of trees or geographical features. Certain areas consist of swamps, including the areas near the [[Soekarno\u2013Hatta International Airport]].\n\nIn recent years the urban expansion of Jakarta has covered Tangerang. As a result, many of its residents commute to Jakarta for work or vice versa. Many high-class and middle-class [[satellite cities]] have been developed in Tangerang, complete with their own [[shopping mall]]s, private [[school]]s and convenience centers. The government is working on expanding the [[highway]] system to accommodate more traffic flow to and from the area.\n\nTangerang is the corporations' alternative to move or build their offices from [[Jakarta]] due to the heavy traffic and crowds, such as Unilever Indonesia that moved their head from [[Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto]], [[Jakarta]] to [[BSD City]].\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Cina Benteng wedding.jpg|thumb|left|A traditional ''[[Cina Benteng]]'' wedding ceremony.]]\n{{See also|Benteng Chinese}}\nTangerang has a significant community of [[Chinese Indonesians]], many of whom are of ''[[Benteng Chinese|Cina Benteng]]'' extraction.

It was the first of a series of large-displacement Honda models to carry the RR suffix.  The development of the first generation CBR900RR was led by [[Tadao Baba]].\n\n==History==\n\n===CBR900RR (893cc) SC28===\nThe first generation CBR900RR was introduced in 1992 with an {{convert|893|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} [[inline-four engine]]. It set a precedent for light weight in the super bike class, being much lighter than other large-displacement bikes of the time.  The CBR900RR was based on an advanced research stage model known within Honda as the \"CBR750RR\".  With the objective of equaling the acceleration of competitors\u2019 flagship sport bikes, Honda increased the stroke of its inline 4-cylinder 750cc engine and thus raised displacement to 893cc. Complementing its power performance were the bike's dry weight of just 185&nbsp;kg, wheelbase of 1,405&nbsp;mm and a body almost identical to that of the advanced research stage model. At {{convert|453|lb|kg|abbr=on}} wet weight, it was by just {{convert|4|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} heavier than the [[Honda CBR600F2|CBR600F2]], while the next-lightest over-750cc machine, the [[Yamaha FZR1000]], was heavier by {{convert|76|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nChanges for the 1994 model comprise a new shift drum to improve notchy gear shifts.

The upper cowl stay went from steel to aluminum, and the cylinder head cover went from aluminum to magnesium. The styling of the bike also became more aggressive: The independent dual lights became irregular-shaped multi-reflector lights known as \"fox eyes\" set further back and covered to improve aerodynamics, and the bike had fewer of the RR's unique fairing \"speed\" holes. The foot pegs were firmer and slimmer like that of the [[Honda RC45|RC45]] and the reversed pedal on the original was replaced with a shift linkage. Instead of measuring speed from the front wheel the speed is measured from the countershaft sprocket with an electronic speedometer.\n\n[[Image:Honda_CBR_919_RR_SC33_Left_Side.jpg|thumb|1996 CBR900RR SC33]]\n\n===CBR900RR (919cc) SC33 ===\n1996 brought major changes to the CBR900RR with the third generation CBR900RR. To optimize rigidity Honda revised the suspension and chassis.

The handle bars were raised by  {{convert|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and swept back by five degrees to improve the riding position.

Other revisions included a smaller alternator, the addition of a throttle position sensor, extra clutch plates, and a larger exhaust. \n\nThe only changes for the 1997 model were graphics and color options.\n\nIn 1998, Honda continued subtle refinements in the fourth generation CBR900RR's chassis. It got a stiffer frame more like the original, offset on the triple clamp reduced by {{convert|5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Brakes got larger rotors on the front and new calipers and ergonomics was revised with raised footpegs. The engine got revised with 80 percent new internals in an effort to reduce friction and weight. Cylinders bore got an aluminum composites treatment and new pistons.

The population was 1,269 at the 2010 census, up from 1,247 at the 2000 census. It is 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) east of [[Redding, California]].  The communities of [[Bella Vista, California|Bella Vista]] (pop. 2,781), [[Millville, California|Millville]] (pop. 727), [[Shingletown, California|Shingletown]] (pop. 2,283), [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]] (pop. 880),{{sfn|Berkshire Hathaway Home Services}} [[Whitmore, California|Whitmore]] (pop. 999),{{sfn|CLR Choice, Inc.}} and [[Round Mountain, California|Round Mountain]] (pop. 155) lie within a 15-mile (24&nbsp;km) radius.\n\nOriginally, indigenous Native Americans lived in Northern California, including what is now Shasta County, prior to European American settlement. European American exploration of inland California started in 1769 and continued on into the 19th Century. Cow Creek, a Sacramento River tributary, that runs south through Palo Cedro, was a conduit for entrance into the [[Sacramento Valley]] by Hudson Bay Fur Company trappers including [[Alexander Roderick McLeod|Alexander McLeod]] (1829) and [[John Work (fur trader)|John Work]] (1832). The town is named after cedarwood trees originally indigenous to the area in the 19th Century.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, Palo Cedro has a population density of 338.1 people per square mile (130.5/km<sup>2</sup>). Award winning country musician [[Merle Haggard]] lived in Palo Cedro for decades until his death on April 6, 2016.\n\n==History==\n===Indigenous peoples===\n{{main|Indigenous peoples of California}}\n\nPrior to white settlement, various Indian tribes settled and inhabited Northern California.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} These tribes included the [[Wintu]], [[Patwin]]s, Nozi, [[Pit River Tribe|Pit Rivers]], Hat Creeks, [[Shasta people|Shastas]], [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]]s, and [[Modoc people|Modoc]] Indian tribes.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus established their main camp on Cottonwood Creek.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] Indian tribes on the [[Pacific coast]] or valley included the [[Maidu]], [[Miwok]], [[Ohlone|Constanoan]], [[Yokuts]], Yanas, and other divisions. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} Historians said that California has the most native tribes and subdivisions of tribes, and more different Indian languages in the lower 48 continental United States.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus were the largest and most peaceful division that settled in Northern California and Oregon. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}}\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{see|History of California before 1900|Alta California|California grizzly bears}}\nDuring the 18th Century, the first recorded Spanish (or any European) land entry and exploration of the present-day state of California, was the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]], in 1769\u20131770, that led to the founding of [[Alta California]], reaching as far north as [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nThe 19th Century launched many explorations by whites into California and its northern interior. In March 1812, the Russian-American Fur Company under [[Ivan Kuskov]] established a colony at [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] on the coast of what is now Sonoma County.{{sfn|''Fort Ross'' Establishment of the California Settlement 1998}} As early as 1817, Father [[Narciso Dur\u00e1n]], on an expedition sighted a snow capped mountain (Mount Shasta), that he called ''Jesus Maria'', from what is now the Marysville plains. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=11-12}} Three years later, in 1827, an expedition to the Klammath Mountains from the Coastal Range, by explorer [[Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello|Luis Arg\u00fcello]] and company, sighted two \"twin\" mountains, believed to be Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=11-12}} In 1826, Mount Shasta was seen by Hudson Bay fur trader Peter Skene Odgen.{{sfn|Giles|1949|p=14}} In 1828, Mt. Shasta was seen by United States fur trapper [[Jedediah Smith]], whom he named ''Mt. Simpson''.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=13-14}} On April 11, 1828 Smith and his party traveled north and entered what is now called Shasta County, and proceeded to what is now called [[Burnt Ranch, California|Burnt Ranch]] in Trinity County.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=13-14}}\n[[File:John Work, Hudson's Bay Company officer, before 1861.jpg|left|thumb|120px|<center>'''John Work'''</center>]]\nThe earliest [[European Americans|European American]] history of Palo Cedro comes from the exploration of [[Hudson's Bay Company]] trapper [[Alexander Roderick McLeod|Alexander McLeod]] (c. 1782&nbsp;\u2013 11 June 1840) who sometime between March 26, 1829 and April 6, 1829, along with guide [[John Turner (fur trapper)|John Turner]], and a brigade of trappers, traveling through Mexican [[California]], started from the Pit River following the [[Cow Creek (Sacramento River tributary)|Cow Creek]] trail, and reached the Sacramento River.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} [[Cow Creek (Sacramento River tributary)|Cow Creek]] is Sacramento River tributary that runs through Palo Cedro and serves as its south eastern borderline. McLeod had been sent out earlier in January 1829 from Fort Vancouver to find the origins of a mythical [[Buenaventura River (legend)|Buenaventura River]].{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} After crossing the Sacramento River, McLeod explored and trapped in the [[Sacramento Valley]] as far South as present day Stockton. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} Upon his return with an abundant supply of furs, he camped on the west bank of the Sacramento River by present day [[Anderson, California|Anderson]] in December 1829. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} While attempting to cross the Cascades in winter, McLeod was met by a snow storm at the headwaters of the river named after him, ''McLeod River'' ([[McCloud River]]), he lost all his horses, was forced to cache his furs, and by snowshoe trek back to Vancouver, arriving on February 10, 1830. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}}{{efn|According to historian Rosena A. Giles, the name of the McCloud river was a misspelling of McLeod's original name, and confused by the name of Ross McCloud, a pioneer of the 1850's. In 1878, an unsuccessful attempt was made by C.C. Bush to have the California state legislature change the name of the river from ''McCloud'' to ''McLeod''.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} Frank & Chapel called the river ''McLeod''. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}} Reading called the river ''McLoud''.  {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=14-15}}}}\n[[File:74-LASSOING_A_GRIZZLEY.jpg|right|180px|thumb|'''Lassoing a Grizzley''' ''1873''<br>Canadian fur trapper John Work, in 1832, noted there were California grizzlies, in the area of what is now Palo Cedro.

Shannahan and Joe Enright bought {{convert|30|acre|ha}} of land from Lem Benton and had it divided into 12 lots.{{sfn|Giles|1949|p=194}} The town never materialized or was developed, but the original cedar tree for which it was named was cut down.{{sfn|Giles|1949|p=194}} School children since then planted cedar trees at the Junction School District yard.{{sfn|Giles|1949|p=194}}\n\nIn 1897, or shortly before, the [[California, Shasta and Eastern Railway|Anderson and Bella Vista Railroad]] was constructed by the Terry Lumber Company from [[Anderson, California|Anderson]] to [[Bella Vista, California|Bella Vista]], passing through Palo Cedro.  Miners used this railroad, as did the Terry Lumber Company at Bella Vista.  The train delivered groceries and mail to the villages along its route. It also had a passenger car.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n{{see|History of California 1900 to present|California}}\nIn the early 1900s, the stage route went from [[Redding, California|Redding]] through Palo Cedro, [[Millville, California|Millville]], [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]], and on to [[Fall River Mills, California|Fall River Mills]].\n\nPalo Cedro's first school house was located near the corner of Hillside Drive and Deschutes Road on the south side of town. Later it was moved to a site near the Grange Hall, on the north side of town. The school was located there until the \"new\" Junction School was built in 1960 on the south side of town.\n\nIn 1907 or thereabouts, Frank and Mary Love owned the Palo Cedro general store. The store was on the west side of the tracks and their house on the east.  A two-story house on the northeast corner of Deschutes Road and Old Forty-Four Drive may, at one time, have been a stopping place for stage drivers and travelers. Sarah Addington later owned the Palo Cedro store.  She was also the postmaster and handed the position down to her daughter, Mary Jones. She moved the post office next door into her home.\n\nJohn Gebauer has since owned the store. In the 1960s John moved to his new building on the south east side of Palo Cedro; it had several one-story spaces for commercial businesses. The largest business was the Palo Cedro Market. Gebauer's son John now operates it. The post office moved into a part of Gebauer's building. Mary Jones' assistants were her sisters. The next postmaster was Sylvia Metz. As she found the post office needed more space, it moved to a two-story building on the north side of Palo Cedro.\n\nThe current mayor of Palo Cedro is Carlos Zapata. \n\nThe first Grange Hall and Feed Store were constructed in the early 1930s, just off Deschutes Road on Old Highway 44.  The building was two stories with the meeting and/or dance hall upstairs. The dining room was downstairs in back and the feed store in front. This building burned down in the early 1940s and was quickly replaced with a one-story building, which is still in use in the 21st century. The feed store was built on the north side of Old Forty-Four Drive and is still there today.\n\nAs Palo Cedro continued to grow more services were needed, and the first independently owned pharmacy opened in August 1975.  Its first space was a remodelled auto body shop. To accommodate its growing business, it moved to the current location on the south side of Highway 44 off Deschutes Road. Palo Cedro Pharmacy has an eclectic mix of pictures, memorabilia, and antiques collected over the last 40 years showing how the town and pharmacy has changed over the years.\n\n==Geography==\nPalo Cedro is located at {{Coord|40|33|4|N|122|14|3|W|type:city}} (40.551091, \u2212122.234255)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at an elevation of 465&nbsp;ft (143 m) above sea level.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|3.8|sqmi|km2}}, 98.00% of it land, and 2.00% of it water.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Palo Cedro has a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]], abbreviated \"Csa\" on climate maps.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=692740&cityname=Palo+Cedro%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Palo Cedro, California]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0655296|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715032244/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0655296|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Palo Cedro CDP|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Palo Cedro had a population of 1,269.

The population was 1,269 at the 2010 census, up from 1,247 at the 2000 census. It is 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) east of [[Redding, California]].  The communities of [[Bella Vista, California|Bella Vista]] (pop. 2,781), [[Millville, California|Millville]] (pop. 727), [[Shingletown, California|Shingletown]] (pop. 2,283), [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]] (pop. 880),{{sfn|Berkshire Hathaway Home Services}} [[Whitmore, California|Whitmore]] (pop. 999),{{sfn|CLR Choice, Inc.}} and [[Round Mountain, California|Round Mountain]] (pop. 155) lie within a 15-mile (24&nbsp;km) radius.\n\nOriginally, indigenous Native Americans lived in Northern California, including what is now Shasta County, prior to European American settlement. European American exploration of inland California started in 1769 and continued on into the 19th Century. Cow Creek, a Sacramento River tributary, that runs south through Palo Cedro, was a conduit for entrance into the [[Sacramento Valley]] by Hudson Bay Fur Company trappers including [[Alexander Roderick McLeod|Alexander McLeod]] (1829) and [[John Work (fur trader)|John Work]] (1832). The town is named after cedarwood trees originally indigenous to the area in the 19th Century.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, Palo Cedro has a population density of 338.1 people per square mile (130.5/km<sup>2</sup>). Award winning country musician [[Merle Haggard]] lived in Palo Cedro for decades until his death on April 6, 2016.\n\n==History==\n===Indigenous peoples===\n{{main|Indigenous peoples of California}}\n\nPrior to white settlement, various Indian tribes settled and inhabited Northern California.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} These tribes included the [[Wintu]], [[Patwin]]s, Nozi, [[Pit River Tribe|Pit Rivers]], Hat Creeks, [[Shasta people|Shastas]], [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]]s, and [[Modoc people|Modoc]] Indian tribes.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus established their main camp on Cottonwood Creek.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] Indian tribes on the [[Pacific coast]] or valley included the [[Maidu]], [[Miwok]], [[Ohlone|Constanoan]], [[Yokuts]], Yanas, and other divisions. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} Historians said that California has the most native tribes and subdivisions of tribes, and more different Indian languages in the lower 48 continental United States.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus were the largest and most peaceful division that settled in Northern California and Oregon. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}}\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{see|History of California before 1900|Alta California|California grizzly bears}}\nDuring the 18th Century, the first recorded Spanish (or any European) land entry and exploration of the present-day state of California, was the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]], in 1769\u20131770, that led to the founding of [[Alta California]], reaching as far north as [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nThe 19th Century launched many explorations by whites into California and its northern interior. In March 1812, the Russian-American Fur Company under [[Ivan Kuskov]] established a colony at [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] on the coast of what is now Sonoma County.{{sfn|''Fort Ross'' Establishment of the California Settlement 1998}} As early as 1817, Father [[Narciso Dur\u00e1n]], on an expedition sighted a snow capped mountain (Mount Shasta), that he called ''Jesus Maria'', from what is now the Marysville plains. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=11-12}} Three years later, in 1827, an expedition to the Klammath Mountains from the Coastal Range, by explorer [[Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello|Luis Arg\u00fcello]] and company, sighted two \"twin\" mountains, believed to be Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=11-12}} In 1826, Mount Shasta was seen by Hudson Bay fur trader Peter Skene Odgen.{{sfn|Giles|1949|p=14}} In 1828, Mt.

Miners used this railroad, as did the Terry Lumber Company at Bella Vista.  The train delivered groceries and mail to the villages along its route. It also had a passenger car.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n{{see|History of California 1900 to present|California}}\nIn the early 1900s, the stage route went from [[Redding, California|Redding]] through Palo Cedro, [[Millville, California|Millville]], [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]], and on to [[Fall River Mills, California|Fall River Mills]].\n\nPalo Cedro's first school house was located near the corner of Hillside Drive and Deschutes Road on the south side of town. Later it was moved to a site near the Grange Hall, on the north side of town. The school was located there until the \"new\" Junction School was built in 1960 on the south side of town.\n\nIn 1907 or thereabouts, Frank and Mary Love owned the Palo Cedro general store. The store was on the west side of the tracks and their house on the east.  A two-story house on the northeast corner of Deschutes Road and Old Forty-Four Drive may, at one time, have been a stopping place for stage drivers and travelers. Sarah Addington later owned the Palo Cedro store.  She was also the postmaster and handed the position down to her daughter, Mary Jones. She moved the post office next door into her home.\n\nJohn Gebauer has since owned the store. In the 1960s John moved to his new building on the south east side of Palo Cedro; it had several one-story spaces for commercial businesses. The largest business was the Palo Cedro Market. Gebauer's son John now operates it. The post office moved into a part of Gebauer's building. Mary Jones' assistants were her sisters. The next postmaster was Sylvia Metz. As she found the post office needed more space, it moved to a two-story building on the north side of Palo Cedro.\n\nThe first Grange Hall and Feed Store were constructed in the early 1930s, just off Deschutes Road on Old Highway 44.  The building was two stories with the meeting and/or dance hall upstairs. The dining room was downstairs in back and the feed store in front. This building burned down in the early 1940s and was quickly replaced with a one-story building, which is still in use in the 21st century.
