The name survived all the later migrations affecting the area, including the arrival of the [[Slavs]] and the creation of the Czech state. In the 9th century, the country became officially known as the Duchy of Bohemia, changing to the Kingdom of Bohemia in the 11th century, and the Crown of Bohemia in the 14th century.

It first aired on November 30, 2006 in the United States on [[NBC]]. The episode was the series' only original script written by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], who are the creators of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|original British comedy series of the same name]]. It was directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]], his first such credit of the series.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branches of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) discovers that an employee named [[Characters from The Office (US)#Martin Nash|Martin Nash]] ([[Wayne Wilderson]]), who came with the branches' recent merger, was previously in prison. Michael becomes frustrated when Martin's stories of prison sound better than working in the office. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) plays a prank on [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) by giving incorrect information to [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) on how to impress her.\n\nAccording to [[Nielsen Media Research]], an estimated 9.07 million viewers watched \"The Convict\" on its first broadcast, making it up to that point the largest audience of the season. Among adults aged 18 to 49, it earned a 4.4/11 ratings share, finishing in eighteenth place for the week among all the major networks. Television critics were largely positive towards the episode, particularly Carell's \"Prison Mike\" sequence as well as Helms' performance as Andy Bernard.\n\n==Synopsis==\n<!-- Per Wikipedia \"television episode\" guidelines [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EPISODE#Plot_summaries], the summary should not exceed ten words per minute of screen time. This is a 20-minute episode, so the limit is 200 words. -->\n[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) learns that black employee [[Characters from The Office (US)#Martin Nash|Martin Nash]] ([[Wayne Wilderson]]) is a former criminal, and tells the entire office. During this time, in a misguided effort to avoid issues of [[stereotype|stereotyping]] and [[racism]] Michael asks the employees to name a white person that they trust and he will name a black person he trusts even more. The name [[Jesus]] pops up and Michael replies with [[Apollo Creed]]. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) encourages [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) to pursue [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]), and intentionally gives him information about her strong dislikes. Later, Andy strums \"[[Rainbow Connection]]\" on his banjo while singing [[falsetto]]. Pam smiles politely and silently shares the joke with Jim.\n\nMartin tells the others he was incarcerated for [[insider trading]], and that he enjoyed certain perks of prison, including outside time and art classes. Pam comments that prison sounds better than their current work situation. Attempting to convince his employees that the office is better than prison, Michael sends everyone to \"outside time\" in the bitter cold. He then calls a meeting in which he adopts the persona of \"Prison Mike.\" Martin comments that Michael's performance did not remind him of his time in prison. This further infuriates Michael, who then locks all of the staff inside the conference room. In order to have his co-workers released, [[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) tells Michael the staff is simply teasing him. After letting the agitated workers go, a relieved Michael relents, but Martin chooses to quit.\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Ricky Gervais 2010.jpg\n| width1 = 138\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = StephenMerchantNov09.jpg\n| width2 = 128\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], the co-creators of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|British series]], wrote \"The Convict\"\n}}\n\n\"The Convict\" was written by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], the co-creators of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|British comedy series of the same name]].<ref name=givememyremoteNov29>{{Cite web|url=http://www.givememyremote.com/remote/2006/11/29/the-office-us-meets-the-uk-in-the-convict/ |title=The Office: US Meets the UK in 'The Convict' |publisher=Give Me My Remote |first=Kath |last=Skerry |date=November 29, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}</ref><ref name=ignreview/> It was their first and only original script for the American series,<ref name=zap2it/> after years of creator and executive producer [[Greg Daniels]] imploring them to participate.

It first aired on November 30, 2006 in the United States on [[NBC]]. The episode was the series' only original script written by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], who are the creators of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|original British comedy series of the same name]]. It was directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]], his first such credit of the series.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branches of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) discovers that an employee named [[Characters from The Office (US)#Martin Nash|Martin Nash]] ([[Wayne Wilderson]]), who came with the branches' recent merger, was previously in prison. Michael becomes frustrated when Martin's stories of prison sound better than working in the office. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) plays a prank on [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) by giving incorrect information to [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) on how to impress her.\n\nAccording to [[Nielsen Media Research]], an estimated 9.07 million viewers watched \"The Convict\" on its first broadcast, making it up to that point the largest audience of the season. Among adults aged 18 to 49, it earned a 4.4/11 ratings share, finishing in eighteenth place for the week among all the major networks. Television critics were largely positive towards the episode, particularly Carell's \"Prison Mike\" sequence as well as Helms' performance as Andy Bernard.\n\n==Synopsis==\n<!-- Per Wikipedia \"television episode\" guidelines [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EPISODE#Plot_summaries], the summary should not exceed ten words per minute of screen time. This is a 20-minute episode, so the limit is 200 words. -->\n[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) learns that black employee [[Characters from The Office (US)#Martin Nash|Martin Nash]] ([[Wayne Wilderson]]) is a former criminal, and tells the entire office. During this time, in a misguided effort to avoid issues of [[stereotype|stereotyping]] and [[racism]] Michael asks the employees to name a white person that they trust and he will name a black person he trusts even more. The name [[Jesus]] pops up and Michael replies with [[Apollo Creed]]. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) encourages [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) to pursue [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]), and intentionally gives him information about her strong dislikes. Later, Andy strums \"[[Rainbow Connection]]\" on his banjo while singing [[falsetto]]. Pam smiles politely and silently shares the joke with Jim.\n\nMartin tells the others he was incarcerated for [[insider trading]], and that he enjoyed certain perks of prison, including outside time and art classes. Pam comments that prison sounds better than their current work situation. Attempting to convince his employees that the office is better than prison, Michael sends everyone to \"outside time\" in the bitter cold. He then calls a meeting in which he adopts the persona of \"Prison Mike.\" Martin comments that Michael's performance did not remind him of his time in prison. This further infuriates Michael, who then locks all of the staff inside the conference room. In order to have his co-workers released, [[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) tells Michael the staff is simply teasing him. After letting the agitated workers go, a relieved Michael relents, but Martin chooses to quit.\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Ricky Gervais 2010.jpg\n| width1 = 138\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = StephenMerchantNov09.jpg\n| width2 = 128\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], the co-creators of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|British series]], wrote \"The Convict\"\n}}\n\n\"The Convict\" was written by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], the co-creators of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|British comedy series of the same name]].<ref name=givememyremoteNov29>{{Cite web|url=http://www.givememyremote.com/remote/2006/11/29/the-office-us-meets-the-uk-in-the-convict/ |title=The Office: US Meets the UK in 'The Convict' |publisher=Give Me My Remote |first=Kath |last=Skerry |date=November 29, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}</ref><ref name=ignreview/> It was their first and only original script for the American series,<ref name=zap2it/> after years of creator and executive producer [[Greg Daniels]] imploring them to participate.

Michael, angry at both Jim for leaving the Scranton branch, as well as Josh for being superior to him, tries to one-up both Jim and Josh at every opportunity.  Meanwhile, [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) sets up [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) on a double date with one of her friends which goes nowhere. [[Toby Flenderson]]'s ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) interest in Pam is piqued, beginning an unrequited crush on his part.\n\nThe first draft of the script included a scene suggesting that Angela was pregnant with Dwight's child, but this was cut by showrunner [[Greg Daniels]]. Initially, there were plans for the cast members from the British version of ''[[The Office (TV series)|The Office]]'' to appear in this episode, but due to scheduling conflicts, this fell through. The episode aired on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] on September 28, 2006 and was seen by an estimated 7.8 million viewers according to [[Nielsen Media Research]]. The episode was received generally well by critics.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) from the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch of [[Dunder Mifflin]], [[List of The Office (U.S. TV series) characters#Josh Porter|Josh Porter]] ([[Charles Esten]]) and [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) from the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branch, and [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) from the corporate headquarters all descend upon [[Philadelphia]] for an office supply convention. Michael is bitter that Jim left Scranton for Stamford and tries to one-up Josh at every opportunity. Michael also spreads the word that he is throwing a party in his hotel room that night. Later in the evening, Michael surprises everyone with the news that he has broken [[Staples Inc.|Staples]]' exclusive hold on [[Hammermill Paper Company|Hammermill]] products. Meanwhile, [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) follows after Dwight wanting to spend time with him and waits in his hotel room. While hoping to prank Dwight, Jim acquires a key to his hotel room, but, upon opening the door, Jim hears and sees Angela without realizing it is her; Jim instead thinks it's a hooker Dwight ordered and gleefully ponders who to tell.\n\nIn Scranton, [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) sets [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) up on a double date with her neighbor Alan (Robert Bagnell), a [[cartoonist]] for the local newspaper. However, Kelly is quietly disappointed that Pam intends to wear just her normal work clothes to the date. On the double date, Kelly appears to be the only one having a good time with [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]). Pam chats awkwardly with Alan, who at one point sneaks a peek down Pam's shirt, and they fail to hit it off. At Michael's party, Jim attends as the only guest and explains that he did not leave Scranton because of Michael (whom Jim claims is a great boss), but rather because Pam rejected him, twice; Michael promises he will talk to Pam about the situation, but Jim tells him not to. Finally, the two mend their friendship just as two other guests arrive.\n\n== Production ==\n\n[[File:Mackenzie Crook.JPG|thumb|right|[[Executive producer]] and [[show runner]] of ''The Office'' [[Greg Daniels]] had hoped to get cast members from the original [[The Office (UK TV series)|British ''Office'' series]], such as [[Mackenzie Crook]] (''pictured'') to appear in the episode.]]\n\n\"The Convention\" was the fourth episode of the series written by the writing team of [[Gene Stupnitsky]] and [[Lee Eisenberg]], and the third episode of the series directed by [[Ken Whittingham]].<ref name=\"yahoo\">{{cite web |url= https://tv.yahoo.com/the-office/show/the-coup/episode/95738 |title= ''The Office'': \"The Convention\" |accessdate=July 11, 2008 |last= |first= |vauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Yahoo!

Some of the episode's best uncomfortable moments centered on Michael believing he's the life of the party and that he's Jim's friend. Michael and Dwight pretending to laugh along to an inside joke made by Jim's new boss, Josh, is a prime example. Michael's comment, \"I love inside jokes. Love to be part of one someday,\" creates the kind of uncomfortable silence that ''The Office'' excels at.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/09/29/the-office-the-convention-review |title= ''The Office'': \"The Convention\" Review |accessdate=May 5, 2019 |last= Zoromski |first= Brian |coauthors= |date=September 29, 2006 |work= |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nErik Adams of ''[[The A.V.

Adams also suggests that the episode's main theme is one of isolation, pointing out that both Dwight and Michael feel alone and cut-off from others even in the midst of a massive convention, and that Pam feels \"marooned\" back in Scranton.

Michael, angry at both Jim for leaving the Scranton branch, as well as Josh for being superior to him, tries to one-up both Jim and Josh at every opportunity.  Meanwhile, [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) sets up [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) on a double date with one of her friends which goes nowhere. [[Toby Flenderson]]'s ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) interest in Pam is piqued, beginning an unrequited crush on his part.\n\nThe first draft of the script included a scene suggesting that Angela was pregnant with Dwight's child, but this was cut by showrunner [[Greg Daniels]]. Initially, there were plans for the cast members from the British version of ''[[The Office (TV series)|The Office]]'' to appear in this episode, but due to scheduling conflicts, this fell through. The episode aired on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] on September 28, 2006 and was seen by an estimated 7.8 million viewers according to [[Nielsen Media Research]]. The episode was received generally well by critics.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) from the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch of [[Dunder Mifflin]], [[List of The Office (U.S. TV series) characters#Josh Porter|Josh Porter]] ([[Charles Esten]]) and [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) from the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branch, and [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) from the corporate headquarters all descend upon [[Philadelphia]] for an office supply convention. Michael is bitter that Jim left Scranton for Stamford and tries to one-up Josh at every opportunity. Michael also spreads the word that he is throwing a party in his hotel room that night. Later in the evening, Michael surprises everyone with the news that he has broken [[Staples Inc.|Staples]]' exclusive hold on [[Hammermill Paper Company|Hammermill]] products. Meanwhile, [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) follows after Dwight wanting to spend time with him and waits in his hotel room. While hoping to prank Dwight, Jim acquires a key to his hotel room, but, upon opening the door, Jim hears and sees Angela without realizing it is her; Jim instead thinks it's a hooker Dwight ordered and gleefully ponders who to tell.\n\nIn Scranton, [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) sets [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) up on a double date with her neighbor Alan (Robert Bagnell), a [[cartoonist]] for the local newspaper. However, Kelly is quietly disappointed that Pam intends to wear just her normal work clothes to the date. On the double date, Kelly appears to be the only one having a good time with [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]). Pam chats awkwardly with Alan, who at one point sneaks a peek down Pam's shirt, and they fail to hit it off. At Michael's party, Jim attends as the only guest and explains that he did not leave Scranton because of Michael (whom Jim claims is a great boss), but rather because Pam rejected him, twice; Michael promises he will talk to Pam about the situation, but Jim tells him not to. Finally, the two mend their friendship just as two other guests arrive.\n\n== Production ==\n\n[[File:Mackenzie Crook.JPG|thumb|right|[[Executive producer]] and [[show runner]] of ''The Office'' [[Greg Daniels]] had hoped to get cast members from the original [[The Office (UK TV series)|British ''Office'' series]], such as [[Mackenzie Crook]] (''pictured'') to appear in the episode.]]\n\n\"The Convention\" was the fourth episode of the series written by the writing team of [[Gene Stupnitsky]] and [[Lee Eisenberg]], and the third episode of the series directed by [[Ken Whittingham]].<ref name=\"yahoo\">{{cite web |url= https://tv.yahoo.com/the-office/show/the-coup/episode/95738 |title= ''The Office'': \"The Convention\" |accessdate=July 11, 2008 |last= |first= |vauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Yahoo!

Some of the episode's best uncomfortable moments centered on Michael believing he's the life of the party and that he's Jim's friend. Michael and Dwight pretending to laugh along to an inside joke made by Jim's new boss, Josh, is a prime example. Michael's comment, \"I love inside jokes. Love to be part of one someday,\" creates the kind of uncomfortable silence that ''The Office'' excels at.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/09/29/the-office-the-convention-review |title= ''The Office'': \"The Convention\" Review |accessdate=May 5, 2019 |last= Zoromski |first= Brian |coauthors= |date=September 29, 2006 |work= |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nErik Adams of ''[[The A.V.

A family spends [[Christmas Eve]] in [[jail]]. \"Christmas Story\" is the eleventh [[episode]] in season one, and the eleventh episode in the complete series. The show is noted for being the only Christmas episode in ''The Andy Griffith Show'' complete series, and for featuring actress [[Margaret Kerry]], the model for [[Tinkerbell]] in [[Walt Disney]]'s 1953 animated feature film, ''Peter Pan''. On December 25, 2015, [[CBS]] aired this episode in color, as part of \"[[The Andy Griffith Show Christmas Special]]\", which also included \"[[The Pickle Story]]\".\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nOn Christmas Eve, [[department store]] owner Ben Weaver insists Andy jail [[moonshine]]r Sam Muggins. Weaver has brought along a jug of moonshine as evidence of Sam's wrongdoing. Andy complies with Weaver's request but feels it's only fair that Sam's wife Bess and his two young children be incarcerated as well, since they all had knowledge of Sam's moonshining. With the Muggins family in jail, Andy, Barney, Aunt Bee, Ellie, and Opie have their planned Christmas party relocated to the Sheriff's office, bringing a holiday feast with all the trimmings for the family and a [[Christmas tree]] to decorate. Peeping at the window, Ben Weaver is touched with the Christmas spirit and tries to get himself arrested in order to join the fun. However, Weaver's initial efforts are unsuccessful due to the others' well-meaning efforts to keep him out of jail on Christmas. Andy only arrests Weaver, finally, after he dumps a garbage can in the alley and the sheriff realizes just what Ben is trying to do. Together, the men appear at the jail with a suitcase full of gaily wrapped gifts from Ben's store for everyone. Ben is welcomed and regaled with food and drink. Andy soon releases Sam and his family since there is now no evidence; Weaver has fallen asleep in one of the jail cells after finishing off the jug of Sam's moonshine.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Andy Griffith]] as [[Sheriff Andy Taylor|Andy Taylor]]\n*[[Don Knotts]] as [[Barney Fife]]\n*[[Elinor Donahue]] as Ellie Walker \n*[[Frances Bavier]] as [[Aunt Bee (television character)|Aunt Bee]] \n*[[Joy Ellison]] as Ethie Muggins \n{{col-2}} \n*[[Margaret Kerry]] as Bess Muggins\n*[[Ron Howard]] as [[Opie Taylor]]\n*[[Sam Edwards]] as Sam Muggins  \n*[[Will Wright (actor)|Will Wright]] as Ben Weaver  \n*Kelly Flynn as Billy Muggins \n{{col-end}}\n\n==Crew==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*A Mayberry Enterprises Production\n*[[Aaron Ruben]], producer and story consultant\n*Ann Helfgott, wardrobe\n*Bob Priestley, set decorator\n*Bob Sweeney, [[television director|director]]\n*Bruce Bilson, assistant director\n*David Adler, writer\n*David Forrest, sound engineer\n*[[Earle Hagen]], music\n*Filmed by [[Desilu]]\n*Frank E.
