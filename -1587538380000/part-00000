The earlier recording sessions have been attributed to [[post-production]] work for the [[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to [[Bradley Cooper]]'s ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]'', a remake of the [[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|1937 film of the same name]] in which she has top billing. The later recording sessions have mostly been attributed to further production for ''Chromatica''. Producer [[BloodPop]], who had co-produced every song on the standard edition of Gaga's previous studio album ''Joanne'' (2016), shared on various social media platforms that he and Gaga had been recording at the singer's Malibu estate with German electronic music producer [[Boys Noize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8356693/lady-gaga-boys-noize |title=Lady Gaga & Boys Noize Are Working Together in the Studio|last=Bein|first=Kat|date=April 19, 2018|accessdate=May 8, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420182625/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8356693/lady-gaga-boys-noize |archivedate=April 20, 2018|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> BloodPop continued to post similar updates through the entirety of 2019 and January 2020, indicating production had continued for nearly three years.

So I have a house where it's [[Frank Zappa|Frank Zappa's]] old [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen|studio]], it's a live room, it's a big studio, it's beautiful. And I would be upstairs on the porch, outside the kitchen, and Bloodpop would come up and he'd go, 'Okay, come on, that's enough, off the porch,' and I would cry and I would say, 'I'm miserable, I'm sad, I\u2019m depressed,' and he'd go, 'I know, and we're gonna go make some music now. And then I'd go downstairs and I would write. This album is such a display of not only how you can reframe the way that you view the world, but I promise and I hope, that the love that was around me in the process of making this album is something that other people feel, that they know that artistically, like, you know how producers are, if one guy\u2019s working on it, or one girl\u2019s working on it, they don\u2019t want anyone else to work on it, they don\u2019t wanna share, they, everybody gets cocky, there was none of that. These records got passed around to so many different people, there were so many different iterations of these songs because we all wanted it to be perfect and literally nobody cared who put their fingerprints on it, as long as it was the dopest thing that we could give to the world and that it was meaningful, authentic, and completely me.<ref name=\"Beats1\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' released in March 2020, Gaga talked at length about numerous topics, including the recording process for ''Chromatica'', and confirmed that BloodPop was the \"center\" and her \"nucleus\" of production while creating the album and that he had a hand in the creation of every track.<ref name=\"Paper1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html |title=Lady Gaga: Life on Chromatica |last=Moran |first=Justin |date=March 16, 2020 |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]}}</ref> It was also confirmed in the same interview that Gaga worked with a wide array of producers and musicians, such as [[Burns (musician)|Burns]], [[Axwell]] of [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Tchami]], Benjamin Rice, and [[Rami Yacoub]], to create an album described as an \"[[electronic music|electronic]] [[tapestry]]\u201d by the interviewer.<ref name=\"Paper1\"/> In discussing the large collaborative atmosphere that enveloped the album's production, she said, \"It's easy to go into a computer and find a cool loop, but the producers I work with don't work this way. When they're inspired, they embroider things.\"<ref name=\"Paper1\"/> Gaga disclosed that she had collaborated with a \"fellow female pop star who [had similarly experienced] immense trauma while in the public eye\" and went into depth about the genesis of their song, which she describes as a \"celebration of all the tears\": \"I sat with her and we talked about our lives. It's two women having a conversation about how to keep going and how to be grateful for what you do.\"<ref name=\"Paper1\"/>\n\n==Title and packaging==\nTalking about the album's title, Gaga stated \"I live on Chromatica, that is where I live. I went into my frame. I found Earth, I deleted it. Earth is canceled.

The singer explained that it \"has a [[sine wave]] in it, which is the mathematical symbol for sound.

So it's all the colors, all the sounds, you know, so we, we're talking about inclusivity and life and also a lot of what we see around us and what we're experiencing is math, which is very much like music and sound is math as well. So we talked about that, and then I sort of went back and I said, 'OK, well, yeah, it's inclusivity but it's really a way of thinking,' you know, it's not just, 'Oh, Chromatica, we're being inclusive with all the colors, all the people,' and when I say, 'All the colors, all the people'  I mean way more than we could possibly fathom.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork2020\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn April 5, 2020, the album's official cover was revealed.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=ladygaga |number=1246905802952077312 |title=#Chromatica \u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udc932020 |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> It shows the singer with \"cotton candy pink\" hair, wearing a \"metallic bodysuit with spikes and studs sticking out of it\", \"a pair of platform boots with a tusk and a knife for its heels\" and a \"shoulder-to-fingertip sleeve covered in spikes\" on one of her hands.

So I have a house where it's [[Frank Zappa|Frank Zappa's]] old [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen|studio]], it's a live room, it's a big studio, it's beautiful. And I would be upstairs on the porch, outside the kitchen, and Bloodpop would come up and he'd go, 'Okay, come on, that's enough, off the porch,' and I would cry and I would say, 'I'm miserable, I'm sad, I\u2019m depressed,' and he'd go, 'I know, and we're gonna go make some music now. And then I'd go downstairs and I would write. This album is such a display of not only how you can reframe the way that you view the world, but I promise and I hope, that the love that was around me in the process of making this album is something that other people feel, that they know that artistically, like, you know how producers are, if one guy\u2019s working on it, or one girl\u2019s working on it, they don\u2019t want anyone else to work on it, they don\u2019t wanna share, they, everybody gets cocky, there was none of that. These records got passed around to so many different people, there were so many different iterations of these songs because we all wanted it to be perfect and literally nobody cared who put their fingerprints on it, as long as it was the dopest thing that we could give to the world and that it was meaningful, authentic, and completely me.<ref name=\"Beats1\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' released in March 2020, Gaga talked at length about numerous topics, including the recording process for ''Chromatica'', and confirmed that BloodPop was the \"center\" and her \"nucleus\" of production while creating the album and that he had a hand in the creation of every track.<ref name=\"Paper1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html |title=Lady Gaga: Life on Chromatica |last=Moran |first=Justin |date=March 16, 2020 |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]}}</ref> It was also confirmed in the same interview that Gaga worked with a wide array of producers and musicians, such as [[Burns (musician)|Burns]], [[Axwell]] of [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Tchami]], Benjamin Rice, and [[Rami Yacoub]], to create an album described as an \"[[electronic music|electronic]] [[tapestry]]\u201d by the interviewer.<ref name=\"Paper1\"/> In discussing the large collaborative atmosphere that enveloped the album's production, she said, \"It's easy to go into a computer and find a cool loop, but the producers I work with don't work this way.

It's two women having a conversation about how to keep going and how to be grateful for what you do.\"<ref name=\"Paper1\"/>\n\n==Title and packaging==\nTalking about the album's title, Gaga stated \"I live on Chromatica, that is where I live.

The singer explained that it \"has a [[sine wave]] in it, which is the mathematical symbol for sound.

CBM occurs on forward or backward steps only (or diagonal steps which still feature forward or backward movement), and not on side steps.  Thus, CBM occurs in the following four scenarios:\n\n* The left leg moves forward as the right side of the body moves forward (the torso rotates to the left)\n* The left leg moves backward as the right side of the body moves backward (the torso rotates to the right)\n* The right leg moves forward as the left side of the body moves forward (the torso rotates to the right)\n* The right leg moves backward as the left side of the body moves backward (the torso rotates to the left)\n\nThe overall effect and intention of CBM is smooth transition from linear to rotational movement.  Thus, CBM is often followed by [[Sway_(dance)|sway]].<ref name=\"dancesport.uk\"/>\n\n==Examples==\nOne occurrence of CBM can be observed in a left rock (adlib) turn in American Foxtrot.  As the leader takes their second step (the second \"slow\"), CBM occurs as the right leg moves backward and the left side of the body moves backward, causing the body to begin rotation to the left.  Similarly, as the follower takes their second step (the second \"slow\"), CBM occurs as the left leg moves forward and the right side of the torso moves forward, causing the body to begin rotation to the left.\n\nAn exaggerated CBM is the basic of some specific [[dance move]]s, e.g., [[Chicken Walks (dance move)|Chicken Walks]] in [[Jive (dance)|Jive]] and [[East Coast Swing]].\n\n==Contra body movement position (CBMP)==\n'''Contra body movement position (CBMP)''' is a position rather than a movement.  CBMP is the foot position achieved when the [[moving foot]] is placed on or across the [[line of foot|line]] of the [[standing foot]], in front of or behind  it.\n\nThe term is slightly verbose in an attempt to make it self-describing and to stress the similarity of the dancer's feet position with respect to the body as if a step with CBM was performed.\n\nHowever, the most important usage of this term in ballroom dancing is to describe steps when a foot moves across the standing foot, while the torso moves in the same direction as the moving foot without rotation. CBMP is routinely used in steps taken in [[promenade position]] or [[outside partner step]] in order to maintain the relative body position of the couple. CBMP and CBM often occur together in turning steps commenced outside partner or in promenade, but in such case the CBMP is required by the commencing position and is not a result of the turn. \n\nIn the ballroom tango, most forward steps of the man's left foot are placed in front of the right foot in CBMP, due to the tango's characteristic compact hold and movement slightly biased towards the right side of the body.  Forward steps of the left foot in tango which commence a reverse (left) turn will also utilize CBM in the body in addition to a CBMP foot position.<ref name=\"dancesport.uk\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Glossary of ballroom dance terms]]\n*[[List of dances]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.istd.org ISTD]\n*[http://www.ballroomdancers.com ballroomdancers.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060621025807/http://www.ballroom-dancing-online.com/ ballroom-dancing-online.com]\n\n[[Category:Ballroom dance technique]]\n", "text_old": "'''Contra body movement''' ('''CBM''') is a term used in [[ballroom dance]]s, such as [[Waltz]], [[Foxtrot (dance)|Foxtrot]], [[Tango (dance)|Tango]], [[Quickstep]].

You go to nature for an experience of the sacred...to re-establish your contact with the core of things, where it\u2019s really at, in order to enable you to come back to the world of people and operate more effectively.  Seek ye first the kingdom of nature, that the kingdom of man might be realized.<ref>Unsoeld, W. (1974). Spiritual values in wilderness.

incidents==\n* On 26 March 1991, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 117]], operated by an [[Airbus A310]], was hijacked by four Pakistani terrorists. The flight landed in Changi Airport at 22:15. The [[Special Operations Force (Singapore)|Singapore Special Operations Force]] stormed the plane, on the morning of 27 March. All four hijackers were killed, with no fatalities among the 123 passengers and crew that were held hostage for more than eight hours.\n* On 4 November 2010, [[Qantas Flight 32]], operated by an [[Airbus A380-800]], suffered an [[Turbine engine failure|uncontained engine failure]] and made an [[emergency landing]] in Changi Airport. Upon landing, one of the engines could not be shut down due to ruptured control cables and had to be doused for three hours by airport firefighters to forcefully shut it down. There were no crew or passenger injuries, and all 469 people on board survived this incident.\n* On 27 June 2016, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 368]], operated by a [[Boeing 777-300ER]], suffered an engine problem while flying from Singapore to Milan. During the diversionary landing in Singapore, the right engine and wing caught fire. The fire was quickly extinguished by airport fire services. There were no injuries among the 241 people on board.\n* On 16 May 2017, a fire broke out at the departure hall in Terminal 2.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |title='Small fire' at Changi Airport T2 sparks evacuation, flight delays |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519050018/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> The fire caused 40 flights at Terminal 2 to be delayed and diverted to Terminal 3.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=fbcna |title=Changi Airport fire: About 40 flights affected by Terminal 2 closure |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=17 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519081305/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=FBcna |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Terminal 2 was closed from 17:30 to 22:45.\n* On 6 February 2018, a [[KAI T-50 Golden Eagle]], part of the [[Black Eagles aerobatic team]] taking part in [[Singapore Airshow|Singapore Airshow 2018]], veered off the runway during takeoff and crashed.

At a distance of about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}, the expressway was built almost entirely on reclaimed land, thus minimising disruptions to the existing road network in Singapore's East Coast.\n\nDespite the four main passenger terminal buildings being relatively close to each other, the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|CAAS]] (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore) decided to build the [[Changi Airport Skytrain]] people-mover system to facilitate quicker and more convenient transfers between the terminals for travellers. The system was upgraded in 2007 with new technologies supplied by Mitsubishi, connecting to Terminal 3 and separating checked-in passengers from the general public on distinct tracks.\n\n===Inter-terminal transportation===\n[[File:Changi Airport Skytrain Crystal Mover.JPG|thumb|Changi Airport Skytrain]]\n\n[[File:Changi Airport MRT Station (EWL - Changi Branch) - Platform A.jpg|thumb|[[Changi Airport MRT station]] platforms]]\n{{main|Changi Airport Skytrain}}\n\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 are connected by the free [[Changi Airport Skytrain|Skytrain]] service, which operates from 05:00 to 02:30. During non-operational hours, travellers in the transit areas may transfer within the terminals by foot via the inter-terminal travellators.

[[Changi Airport MRT station]] is located underground between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. Direct, one-train service to the [[Central Area, Singapore|downtown]] and western parts of Singapore was initially in operation when the station opened on 8 February 2002.

However, as of this date, passengers can now transfer at Expo for direct service to [[Bukit Timah]] and [[Bukit Panjang]] using an alternate route via the city.\n\nAs announced in the [[Land Transport Authority|LTA's]] Land Transport Masterplan 2040, the new Thomson\u2013East Coast line will be extended to Changi Airport Terminal 5 and to the current Changi Airport station, with the current EWL Branch line being converted to be part of the TEL.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/ltaweb/corp/AboutUs/files/LTMP2040_May2019/LTA%20LTMP%202040%20eReport%20FA%20hires.pdf | title= Land Transport Master Plan 2040}}</ref>\n\n====Bus====\nThere are seven bus services operated by [[SBS Transit]], [[SMRT Buses]] and [[Go-Ahead Singapore]], making a loop starting from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1, and Terminal 2.

incidents==\n* On 26 March 1991, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 117]], operated by an [[Airbus A310]], was hijacked by four Pakistani terrorists. The flight landed in Changi Airport at 22:15. The [[Special Operations Force (Singapore)|Singapore Special Operations Force]] stormed the plane, on the morning of 27 March. All four hijackers were killed, with no fatalities among the 123 passengers and crew that were held hostage for more than eight hours.\n* On 4 November 2010, [[Qantas Flight 32]], operated by an [[Airbus A380-800]], suffered an [[Turbine engine failure|uncontained engine failure]] and made an [[emergency landing]] in Changi Airport. Upon landing, one of the engines could not be shut down due to ruptured control cables and had to be doused for three hours by airport firefighters to forcefully shut it down. There were no crew or passenger injuries, and all 469 people on board survived this incident.\n* On 27 June 2016, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 368]], operated by a [[Boeing 777-300ER]], suffered an engine problem while flying from Singapore to Milan. During the diversionary landing in Singapore, the right engine and wing caught fire. The fire was quickly extinguished by airport fire services. There were no injuries among the 241 people on board.\n* On 16 May 2017, a fire broke out at the departure hall in Terminal 2.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |title='Small fire' at Changi Airport T2 sparks evacuation, flight delays |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519050018/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> The fire caused 40 flights at Terminal 2 to be delayed and diverted to Terminal 3.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=fbcna |title=Changi Airport fire: About 40 flights affected by Terminal 2 closure |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=17 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519081305/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=FBcna |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Terminal 2 was closed from 17:30 to 22:45.\n* On 6 February 2018, a [[KAI T-50 Golden Eagle]], part of the [[Black Eagles aerobatic team]] taking part in [[Singapore Airshow|Singapore Airshow 2018]], veered off the runway during takeoff and crashed.

At a distance of about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}, the expressway was built almost entirely on reclaimed land, thus minimising disruptions to the existing road network in Singapore's East Coast.\n\nDespite the four main passenger terminal buildings being relatively close to each other, the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|CAAS]] (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore) decided to build the [[Changi Airport Skytrain]] people-mover system to facilitate quicker and more convenient transfers between the terminals for travellers. The system was upgraded in 2007 with new technologies supplied by Mitsubishi, connecting to Terminal 3 and separating checked-in passengers from the general public on distinct tracks.\n\n===Inter-terminal transportation===\n[[File:Changi Airport Skytrain Crystal Mover.JPG|thumb|Changi Airport Skytrain]]\n\n[[File:Changi Airport MRT Station (EWL - Changi Branch) - Platform A.jpg|thumb|[[Changi Airport MRT station]] platforms]]\n{{main|Changi Airport Skytrain}}\n\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 are connected by the free [[Changi Airport Skytrain|Skytrain]] service, which operates from 05:00 to 02:30. During non-operational hours, travellers in the transit areas may transfer within the terminals by foot via the inter-terminal travellators.

[[Changi Airport MRT station]] is located underground between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. Direct, one-train service to the [[Central Area, Singapore|downtown]] and western parts of Singapore was initially in operation when the station opened on 8 February 2002.

However, as of this date, passengers can now transfer at Expo for direct service to [[Bukit Timah]] and [[Bukit Panjang]] using an alternate route via the city.\n\nAs announced in the [[Land Transport Authority|LTA's]] Land Transport Masterplan 2040, the new Thomson\u2013East Coast line will be extended to Changi Airport Terminal 5 and to the current Changi Airport station, with the current EWL Branch line being converted to be part of the TEL.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/ltaweb/corp/AboutUs/files/LTMP2040_May2019/LTA%20LTMP%202040%20eReport%20FA%20hires.pdf | title= Land Transport Master Plan 2040}}</ref>\n\n====Bus====\nThere are seven bus services operated by [[SBS Transit]], [[SMRT Buses]] and [[Go-Ahead Singapore]], making a loop starting from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1, and Terminal 2.

Operated by Transtar Travel, the service will start at coach stands at Terminals 1, 2, 3 and end at Larkin Terminal.\n\nThere is also a free shuttle bus service plying between Changi Airport (T3) and Changi Business Park.

This was Ford Australia's top-of-the-range model until replaced by an Australian-assembled version of the full-sized American [[Ford Galaxie]]. In 1967, Ford Australia reintroduced the Fairlane, this time as an Australian-developed, luxury, long-wheelbase version of its mainstream [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]], positioned between the Falcon and the Galaxie. The locally assembled Galaxie evolved into the [[Ford LTD (North America)|LTD]] which was itself replaced in 1973 by an Australian-developed, Fairlane-based model, also known as the Ford LTD. In North America, unlike its designation in Australia, it was not considered a luxury vehicle. In Australia, \"LTD\" originally stood for \"Lincoln Type Design\", although Ford Australia later promoted a connection with the meaning \"Limited\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aus-ford-uk.co.uk/html/ltd.html|title=Australian Ford Register \u2013 Ford LTD|access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gumtree.com.au/ford-ltd.html|title=Australian Ford LTD Review and Specs|access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Fairlane and LTD competed in the marketplace with the [[Holden Brougham]] (1968\u20131971), the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] (1971\u20131984), and later with the [[Holden Caprice|Holden Statesman and Caprice]] (1990\u20132007).\n\nFord produced the Fairlane/LTD at [[Campbellfield, Victoria]], and [[Eagle Farm, Queensland]], in the early years. Until around March/April 1978 with the upcoming release of the [[Ford Falcon (XD)]] and its derivatives, Ford consolidated Falcon production at Campbellfield and Fairlane/LTD manufacturing to Eagle Farm.

Internally, new door trim patterns debuted and the speedometer backing was now black instead of the silver used on ZCs.\n\nThe ZA to ZD were basically stretched versions of the XR to XY series Ford Falcons, respectively, with the extra length added behind the rear door, moving the rear seat back and giving more leg room.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Second generation ===\n==== ZF (1972\u20131973) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1973 Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500 sedan (20407681604).jpg\n| image2 = 1973 Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500 sedan (21030274955).jpg\n| footer =  Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500\n}}\nAn all-new, Australian-designed ZF series Fairlane was launched in April 1972, with swoopier bodywork, but criticisms launched that it looked too much like a four-headlamp version of the basic Falcon. The ZF Fairlanes were joined by an even more upscale LTD in August 1973, with hidden headlamps and vinyl roof. Model names remained the same (Custom and 500), as did the engine choices, as the previous model year. Although this car was designed and built exclusively in Australia, its styling is reminiscent of the US-market [[Mercury Montego]]. The 1973 ZF also had the last manual transmission; afterwards, all Fairlanes were automatics.\n\nThis model was also sold in South Africa, unlike the Falcon, which was discontinued in favour of the European [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Granada]]. Only the Fairlane 500, with column shift and seating for six, was available in South Africa. These cars were fitted with the {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Ford 335 engine#Cleveland|Cleveland 351]] (5.8-litre) V8 engine.<ref name=zaCARnov72>{{cite magazine | editor-last = Wright | editor-first = Cedric | date = December 1972 | title = Ford Fairlane 500 (ZF model series) | magazine = CAR | location = Cape Town, South Africa | volume = 16 | number = 11 | publisher = Ramsay, Son & Parker (Pty) Ltd. | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== ZG / P5 (1973\u20131976) ====\n[[File:1974 Ford Fairlane (ZG) 500 sedan (19102653969).jpg|thumb|1973\u20131976 Ford Fairlane (ZG) 500]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width =\n| image1 = Ford LTD P5 (15711151727).jpg\n| image2 = Ford P5 LTD (rear).jpg\n| footer = 1973\u20131976 Ford LTD (P5)\n}}\n\nNovember 1973 had the next series of changes, to the ZG-series Fairlane. The changes were mainly cosmetic, with a four-horizontal-bar grille and revised taillight lenses and garnish panel. An anniversary model with a standard 302 was released in 1975, but otherwise the range stayed the same as the 1974 versions.\nThe Fairlane-based P5 series Ford LTD was released very late in the ZF model run in August 1973, three months prior to the ZG Fairlane. The LTD was only available as a four-door sedan, and the wheelbase was even longer than that of the Fairlane, itself a stretched Falcon. A luxury two-door coup\u00e9 called the [[Ford Landau (Australia)|Ford Landau]] (also designated P5) was released at the same time. The Landau was based on the Australian Falcon Hardtop, so featured a {{convert|111|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase as opposed to the {{convert|121|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase of the LTD. Both models were notable for their [[hidden headlights|concealed headlamps]], which were revealed when their vacuum-operated [[grille]] sections were retracted. The technology was similar to that found on earlier models of the American built [[Ford Thunderbird]]. Standard equipment on both the LTD and the Landau included integrated air conditioning, automatic transmission, electric windows, and a 351ci / 5.8L V8 engine.\n\nAlso in July 1975, Ford commenced a release of the Town Cars. These were 50th-Anniversary models, celebrating 50 years of Ford in Australia. They produced 250 of each in the LTD and Fairlane ranges. The Fairlanes in particular were optioned with LTD components, 15-inch wheels, leather interior, and electric windows to name some options. In the Fairlane, only a small handful was special-ordered with a 351 motor. All others were 302s. The LTD were 351-engine cars.\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/23725628@N06/4626374317/in/photostream 50th Anniversary Model badge]\n\nAs the P5 was released during the ZF model run, it retained many ZF components. For example, the main interior upgrade from the Fairlane ZF to ZG was the turn signal stalk. The ZF had the older-style stalk with the high beam \"dipper\" switch on the floor. When the ZG Fairlane was released a big item was the new multifunction column stalk which incorporated the dipper switch and horn. The P5s, however, used the ZF-style stalk and still had a \"squeeze rim\" horn similar to Falcon GTs of the era.  Because the P6 LTD was not released until about five months after the ZH Fairlane, some of the last P5s actually had a few minor ZH parts fitted.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== ZH / P6 (1976\u20131979) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (23531054516).jpg\n| image2 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (22930040893).jpg\n| footer =  1976\u201379 Ford Fairlane (ZH) 500\n}}\n\nThe ZH series addressed earlier complaints about the Fairlane being too close to the Falcon in May 1976. The designers retained the same central section from the upcoming XC [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] (including that car's new rear doors), but put on lengthened front and rear ends, giving the car more bulk and a luxury impression. The styling was reminiscent of the 1968 [[Mercury Marquis]]. The range-topping LTD went further upmarket with a fancy, [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]]-inspired grille (not dissimilar to that found on the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]]. Another sign of the upmarket move was the 500 becoming the basic trim (the Custom was deleted), and the Fairlane Marquis being the upscale version. The Marquis was Ford's response to the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman Caprice]], which was introduced in 1974 as an LTD rival. ZH also moved to the use of the metric system to denote the engine sizes: the basic engine was known as the 4.9&nbsp;L, the other as the 5.8&nbsp;L.

This model was a leap ahead into the new decade, with squared-off lines and a six-light bodyshell clearly distinguishing Fairlane from the new XD Falcon of that year. The traditional quad headlights and distinctive vertically striped taillights further differentiated the luxury model from Falcon. The trim levels were deleted:  now, only a single Fairlane was available, with {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} or {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} V8 engine choices. In October, recognising the fuel crisis, Ford introduced a Fairlane with a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} inline-six from the Falcon.\n\nThe LTD version of the ZJ surfaced in October 1979 as the FC Series, using the same wheelbase and body panels as the Fairlane. In mid-1980, the Falcon 4.1-litre alloy head engine was made optional, the first time the LTD was available in six-cylinder guise.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 01.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 03.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1981 Ford FC LTD Cartier (6058256901).jpg|Ford LTD (FC) Cartier\n</gallery>\n\n==== {{anchor|ZK|FD}} ZK / FD (1982\u20131984) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 200\n| image1 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1982\u20131984 Ford Fairlane (ZK)\n}}\n\nThe ZK series of March 1982 had the deletion of the 5.8-L V8, which was the first warning the company would soon drop [[V8 engine|V8s]] from the local line-up. Minor changes were made to grille and taillights, but otherwise the external changes were negligible. In March 1983, the 4.9-L V8 was deleted, too, with Ford introducing a [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the six to take its place, claiming the new engine had  acceleration figures equivalent to the V8.\n\nThe main notable mechanical change was the introduction of the coil sprung, watts link-located rear axle, one of the best live rear-axle configurations.\n\nThe LTD FC series was updated to and designated FD in March 1982 with the V8 engine option deleted the following year.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== {{anchor|ZL|FE}} ZL / FE (1984\u20131988) ====\n[[File:1984-1986 Ford ZL Fairlane sedan (2011-01-05) 02.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (ZL)]]\n\nThe revised ZL series of 1985 (launched October 1984) kept the two six-cylinder engine options; only at the end of 1986 was the carburettor version of the Fairlane deleted. The ZL again carried over all external panels, but now had integrated headlights with clear indicators, full wrap-around bumpers, and new taillights. Inside, a full digital dashboard was introduced with push-button controls at either end of the instrument binnacle. The FE series LTD was also released in October 1984.<ref>The Red Book Used Car Price Guide, November 1985, page 57</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:1987 Ford LTD (FE) sedan (2015-07-14) 01.jpg|Ford LTD (FE)\nFile:1987 Ford LTD (FE) sedan (2015-07-14) 02.jpg|Ford LTD (FE)\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Fourth generation ===\n==== NA / DA (1988\u20131991) ====\n[[File:1989-1991 Ford DA II LTD sedan (2010-12-28).jpg|thumb|right|Ford LTD (DA II)]]\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1990 Ford Fairlane (NA II) sedan (26021769001).jpg\n| image2 = 1990 Ford Fairlane (NA II) sedan (2010-07-25).jpg\n| footer = Ford Fairlane (NA II)\n}}\n\nJune 1988 had the next major revision; the Fairlane's straight edges gave way to gentle curves, based on the EA26 platform Falcon. The philosophy was the same - a long-wheelbase Falcon with a six-light body. The 4.1-L six was heavily revised, becoming a 3.9-L unit with improved fuel economy and power. These models were part of the EA26 development programme and platform (E for the market segment, A for Australia, 26 the project code). Therefore, officially they were EA26s, but colloquially, Ford aficionados prefer a two-letter code. Hence, the new Fairlanes were given the NA series code.\n\nThe equivalent LTDs came on stream as the DA series in June 1988. Like the previous generation, all N-series Fairlanes and D-series LTDs were built on the Falcon/Fairmont station-wagon platform, and this legacy is most noticeable in the disproportionally narrow station-wagon rear doors on what was meant to be a limousine and in a car that otherwise caters well for rear-seat passengers with a large amount of interior seating and legroom space. Nonetheless, these large sedans were \"limousine enough\" to be one of the most common platforms used by Australian body-building companies to make stretch limousines.\n\nRevisions from November 1989 for the 1990 model year had the release of the NA II and DAII, the most notable change being the fitting of a four-speed, rather than three-speed, automatic transmission (since the Fairlane's debut, it had a three-speed).\n\nAlthough Ford Australia's former official historian, the late Adrian Ryan, was emphatic, officially, an NB series Fairlane never existed, at least one early 1989 prototype fitted with a four-speed automatic escaped from the factory bearing a compliance plate marked \"NB\" and was registered as an \"NB Fairlane\". Ford also produced an alloy wheel identification-guide poster for its parts counters listing one wheel as being for an \"NB Sportsman Fairlane\" and at one point the Series II NA likely was going to be called the NB. Third-party parts suppliers also often list both an \"NB Fairlane\" an \"NB \u2013 Series II Fairlane\" in their parts catalogues adding to the NB mystery. DOTARS (the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services) has no record of giving Ford approval to use an \"NB Fairlane\" compliance plate for a production model which might explain Ford's reluctance to officially acknowledge the \"NB\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}{{original research inline|date=April 2012}}\n\n==== NC / DC (1991\u20131995) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1993 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan\n}}\n\n[[File:1994 Ford LTD (DC II) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|1994 Ford LTD (DC II)]]\n\nAugust 1991 had the news that many Fairlane/LTD purists had awaited: the reintroduction of the V8 in the NC Fairlane and DC-series LTD. Ford had never recovered from deleting the V8s in the 1980s and bowed to public pressure with its reintroduction. The 5.0-L engine was not identical to the one used in the United States Mustang and other passenger cars. For reason of better durability and perhaps cost, it was the Canadian-made Windsor engine used in the North American light truck and 4WD models. To meet the needs of the space required for a right-drive steering column, its inlet manifold was reversed. Again to meet the conversion to right-hand drive and the rerouted inlet ducting, air box, and air conditioning lines, the Australian-installed engines also had most of their serpentine belt-driven accessories on opposite side to the US/North American models. As Australian enthusiasts often found to their frustration, these subtle changes often meant that many Ford Racing/SVO add-on bits, like the available superchargers, were not exactly the bolt-on items they were in North America. The inline six continued. The NC also introduced a higher-spec Fairlane, called the Fairlane Ghia, and the V8 was available in this model.\n\nThe 1992 NC II and DC IIs redesignated the 3.9-L engine a \"4.0-litre\", but trim levels remained the same. To appeal to younger buyers, Ford briefly sold a Fairlane Sportsman Ghia in 1993 with a \"Tickford\"-tuned 4.0-L six used in the Falcon XR6.\nA second, even smaller update, known as the NC III, arrived in August 1993. It is the equivalent to the ED series Falcon, adopting the new \"ozone safe\" R134a air conditioning refrigerant. The base Fairlane model was also discontinued, leaving only the Fairlane Ghia.\n\nFrom March 1994 production, the NC received additional changes - the fitment of a leather-wrapped steering wheel, body-coloured bumpers and side protection strips, new-design alloy wheels, and a [[hood ornament|bonnet ornament]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fordfalconfacts.com/model-specs/fairlane-ltd/nc-fairlane-dc-ltd-1991-1995/ | title = NC Fairlane / DC LTD | publisher = Falcon Facts | accessdate = 14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAn idea proposed in the late 1980s was a Fairlane wagon. Most likely, had it entered production, it would have used the Falcon wagon (which rode on the Fairlane's wheelbase) body, coupled with the Fairlane's front clip.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}{{original research inline|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Falcon utilities were still of the previous-generation XF. A prototype EB Falcon utility was made which looked Fairlane-based. To impart a look of solidness, the ute had a Fairlane frontal treatment. It did not enter production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== NF / DF (1995\u20131996) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane Ghia (4).jpg | width1 = 180\n| image2 = 1995-1996 Ford LTD (DF) sedan (2011-03-23).jpg  | width2 = 242\n| footer = Ford Fairlane Ghia (NF; left) and Ford LTD (DF; right)\n}}\n\nThe Fairlane and LTD received a major front and rear restyle in March 1995 (EA77 series in Ford-speak), coinciding with the EF Falcon, and remained on the same platform. The new NF Fairlanes and DF LTDs were longer and curvier, hiding their 1980s origins reasonably well. The exterior design was more ornamental compared to the relatively clean NAs to NCs. The Fairlane Sportsman reappeared for 1996, with the same formula as 1993, with the 4.0-L six.{{Clear}}\n\n==== NL / DL (1996\u20131999) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24141149516).jpg\n| image2 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24059154062).jpg\n| footer =  Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia\n}}\n\n[[File:1997 Ford LTD (DL) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|Ford LTD (DL)]]\nIn September 1996, the revised NL Fairlanes and DL LTDs appeared. In 1997, Ford introduced a higher Fairlane Concorde trim, with the same 4.0- and 5.0-L engine choices. No Sportsman variant of the Fairlane was offered.\n\nFor customers, five Dealer modified NL Series Fairlanes from Sydney and Melbourne utilised parts from the 5.0-litre [[Mustang Cobra]] and Australian delivered [[Special Vehicle Operations|SVO]] parts due to the limited edition run of the Fairlane by Tickford and customers wanting to maintain the Luxury look but sport the GT's performance.  The rounded body lines were reminiscent of the US-market Ford Taurus, while the front end styling was similar to the Lincoln Town Car.\n\nFord expanded the Fairlane range greatly in 1998. Beginning with the Ghia, also a basic Concorde (six-cylinder) and Concorde Ghia (V8) were offered. A [[Tickford Vehicle Engineering|Tickford]]-modified version was also available, with the larger engine, as well as a luxurious Fairlane Special Edition Ghia.\n\nThe NL and DL series were the last models to come equipped with automatic self-leveling rear suspension.\n{{clear}}\n\nThe New Zealand Government also used the NL Fairlane Ghia as their designated Crown Limousines. Crown Fairlanes were mostly painted Amaretto (a few in white) and were fitted with silver \"Chonchorde\" 16 inch wheels, 6 disc cd stacker, electric adjust drivers seat and New Zealand fitted flag pole mounts on the front guards.\n\nAll of the Fairlane Ghias used by the New Zealand Government were fitted with the factory 4.0L six cylinder engine producing 165kw. The LTD was also used with a few being V8 models. The LTD Crown Cars were a range of colours including Dynamic White, Argon Silver, Mocha Foam and Amaretto in the facelift.  \n\nThe NL and DL Crown cars all sported special government only licence plates starting with CR404 in 1997 and continuing in numerical order to CR437 in 1998. Most crown cars were retired after 3 years of service. The Fairlane and LTD had been used by the New Zealand Government since the 1970s through to 2010s where the Ford brand was replaced with BMW 7 series. \n\nThe New Zealand Government still uses CR registration plates on their current Crown Cars.\n\n<br />\n\n=== Fifth generation ===\n==== AU (1999\u20132003) ====\n[[File:2001 Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 02.jpg\n| footer = 2000\u20132003 Ford LTD (AU II)\n}}\n\nFord introduced its \"[[New Edge]]\" look to the AU series Fairlane in February 1999, with some success, though the EA169 platform was considered a flop, allowing rival [[Holden]] to overtake the company in the sales of full-sized cars. The AU LTD was released 3 months later in May.\n\nThe AU Fairlane and LTD models were the first long-wheelbase sedans to share a model code with the Falcon. They had [[Lincoln Town Car]] styling cues, especially around the [[C-pillar]]. The range was pared back to just two models, the Fairlane Ghia and the LTD, although a limited-edition Fairlane Millennium Ghia was also offered in January 2000.<ref>[http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&ID=D62DD4AB47EC387FCA257125001A1418 Ford AU Fairlane].

The 2001 model year AU II models featured some improvements, and another limited edition was offered: the 75th Anniversary Ghia in October, with the same engine choices as before.

The BA Fairlanes and LTDs were closer to the Falcon in looks, even sharing the taillights. The 5.0-L gave way to the larger 5.4-L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4 L|Modular]] V8, already used in the US From this point the LTD was no longer offered with a six-cylinder engine.\n\nTo capture younger buyers, the Fairlane G220 (denoting its {{convert|220|kW|hp|adj=mid}} power output at 4,750&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|472|Nm|lbft}} of torque from 3,250\u20134,000&nbsp;rpm) took the place of the Fairlane Sportsman, and featured the larger engine only. The traditional automatic gearbox was replaced by a [[tiptronic|sequential automatic]]. Unique to the G220 were 17-inch Elegance alloy wheels, ebony headlight bezels with unique lens, and redline leather seats with warm charcoal, perforated leather inserts.\n\nThe Fairlane Ghia continued as the six-cylinder base model, but came standard with colour ICC screen, asix-CD stack, 11-speaker Premium Sound, 7-way adjustable leather seats, and woodgrain inserts.\n\nThe LTD was further distinguished from the Ghia by having the 5.4-L V8 engine, sunroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, LTD badging, 10-way adjustable front seats, bolstered rear seats, [[satellite navigation]], and auto-dimming rear-vision mirror.<ref>{{cite web |last=Torr |first=Feann |year=2003 |url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/xfd_fairlane.htm |title=First Drive: BA Ford Fairlane |publisher=Web Wombat |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nBrakes were the same as on the Falcon, with Fairlanes coming standard with [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] and [[traction control]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mynrma.com.au/motoring-services/reviews/car-reviews/ford/fairlane-ghia-ba-g220-ltd.htm |title=Ford Fairlane Ghia BA G220 & LTD Car Review |publisher=[[NRMA]] |date=1 March 2004 |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Ford Australia's introduction of the BA II Falcon in October 2004, facelifted versions of the Fairlane Ghia, Fairlane G220, and LTD were introduced in March 2005. The changes were mainly cosmetic, but nevertheless significant, and were carried over in the subsequent BF model ranges. The facelifted Fairlane was headlined by a more heavily chromed exterior, including chrome rub strips, a new chromed rear appliqu\u00e9,  and on Fairlane Ghia and LTD, chromed wing mirror covers. The G220 was given new-design seven-spoke alloy wheels, while Fairlane Ghia and LTD added two-toned paint to their side skirts and lower valances.\n\nFor the BA II interior, the black leather seats and leather section of the door trims were replaced with new leather trim dubbed China Beige. The Ghia and G220 gained an eight-way power driver\u2019s seat with memory function. The G220 was given a leather-wrapped sports steering wheel, and the Ghia a Rhui Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel, and the LTD gained a Stone Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel.\n\nWhile the only BA II mechanical change was the addition of Sports Control Blade rear-suspension tune for the base Ghia and top-shelf LTD, a DVD rear entertainment system became standard for the LTD, exchangeable for a sunroof.\n\nAn interior upgrade that would be carried over in its entirety to the subsequent BF range was the change from black to brushed silver instrument dials and dash clock, and the silver shifter surround, centre cup holder, and ICC fascia became \"piano black\" with the ICC buttons changed accordingly from black to silver. Chrome door handles, vent tips, and door lock barrels were also added.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pettendy |first=Marton |date=4 February 2005 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/F5855C5E817D447CCA256F9D007C8CFA |title=Comfort is king in Ford's fresh Fairlane |work=GoAuto |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref> The original woodgrain trim was retained until the BF.\n\n==== BF (2005\u20132007) ====\n[[File:2007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24).jpg|thumb|2005\u20132007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 02.jpg \n| footer = 2005\u20132007 Ford LTD (BF)\n}}\n\nThe BF series Fairlane and LTD models were introduced in October 2005, with the Fairlane G220 renamed the Fairlane G8. Externally, the BF was outwardly identical to the BA Mark II, but fine tunings to steering, suspension, soundproofing and undercarriage were made. Fuel economy was also improved. Across the whole BF range, the taillight lenses were slightly changed in appearance. The Ghia went from 16-inch to 17-inch alloy wheels as standard.\n\nInterior-wise, the only changes from the upgrades introduced in the BA Mark II were the replacement of the woodgrain inserts with \"satin chrome\" inserts. This colour scheme was the same for all BF Fairlane variants. The BF Ghia and LTD came with black leather seats or China beige leather seats with eight-way adjustable drivers seat and six-way adjustable passenger seat.\n\nThe G8 featured an eight-cylinder engine with improved exhaust system and an additional knock sensor, producing  {{convert|230|kW|hp}} at 5,350&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|500|Nm|lbft}} of torque at 3,500&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[http://www.privatefleet.com.au/buying-new-car/car-reviews/ford/ford-fairlane-review/ Ford Fairlane at www.privatefleet.com.au].

This was Ford Australia's top-of-the-range model until replaced by an Australian-assembled version of the full-sized American [[Ford Galaxie]]. In 1967, Ford Australia reintroduced the Fairlane, this time as an Australian-developed, luxury, long-wheelbase version of its mainstream [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]], positioned between the Falcon and the Galaxie. The locally assembled Galaxie evolved into the [[Ford LTD (North America)|LTD]] which was itself replaced in 1973 by an Australian-developed, Fairlane-based model, also known as the Ford LTD. In North America, unlike its designation in Australia, it was not considered a luxury vehicle. In Australia, \"LTD\" originally stood for \"Lincoln Type Design\", although Ford Australia later promoted a connection with the meaning \"Limited\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aus-ford-uk.co.uk/html/ltd.html|title=Australian Ford Register \u2013 Ford LTD|access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gumtree.com.au/ford-ltd.html|title=Australian Ford LTD Review and Specs|access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Fairlane and LTD competed in the marketplace with the [[Holden Brougham]] (1968\u20131971), the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] (1971\u20131984), and later with the [[Holden Caprice|Holden Statesman and Caprice]] (1990\u20132007).\n\nFord produced the Fairlane/LTD at [[Campbellfield, Victoria]], and [[Eagle Farm, Queensland]], in the early years. Until around March/April 1978 with the upcoming release of the [[Ford Falcon (XD)]] and its derivatives, Ford consolidated Falcon production at Campbellfield and Fairlane/LTD manufacturing to Eagle Farm. Around the release of the next generation during the [[Ford Falcon (EA)|EA Falcon]] era (1988), Eagle Farm ceased manufacture of cars and only produced heavy trucks until its closure in 1998.\n\n== Australian-assembled US Fairlanes ==\n===Full-size Fairlane (1959\u20131962)===\n[[File:1959 Fairlane 500==.JPG|thumb|1960\u20131961 Ford Fairlane 500 sedan (facelift)]]\n\nIn September 1959, [[Ford Australia]] released three new locally assembled models, the [[1957 Ford|Fairlane 500]], the lower specification [[Ford Custom 300|Custom 300]], and the [[Ford Ranch Wagon|Ranch Wagon]].<ref name=RestoredCars>The Australian 1959\u201360 Ford Fairlane, Restored Cars magazine No 84, July 1990, pages 4\u20136</ref> They were sourced from [[Ford of Canada]],<ref>[http://uniquecars.carpoint.ninemsn.com.au/portal/alias__uniquecarsau/tabID__203009/ArticleID__4222/DesktopDefault.aspx 1959 Ford Fairlane at uniquecars.carpoint.ninemsn.com.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329111548/http://uniquecars.carpoint.ninemsn.com.au/portal/alias__uniquecarsau/tabID__203009/ArticleID__4222/DesktopDefault.aspx |date=2010-03-29 }}.

Internally, new door trim patterns debuted and the speedometer backing was now black instead of the silver used on ZCs.\n\nThe ZA to ZD were basically stretched versions of the XR to XY series Ford Falcons, respectively, with the extra length added behind the rear door, moving the rear seat back and giving more leg room.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Second generation ===\n==== ZF (1972\u20131973) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1973 Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500 sedan (20407681604).jpg\n| image2 = 1973 Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500 sedan (21030274955).jpg\n| footer =  Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500\n}}\nAn all-new, Australian-designed ZF series Fairlane was launched in April 1972, with swoopier bodywork, but criticisms launched that it looked too much like a four-headlamp version of the basic Falcon. The ZF Fairlanes were joined by an even more upscale LTD in August 1973, with hidden headlamps and vinyl roof. Model names remained the same (Custom and 500), as did the engine choices, as the previous model year. Although this car was designed and built exclusively in Australia, its styling is reminiscent of the US-market [[Mercury Montego]]. The 1973 ZF also had the last manual transmission; afterwards, all Fairlanes were automatics.\n\nThis model was also sold in South Africa, unlike the Falcon, which was discontinued in favour of the European [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Granada]]. Only the Fairlane 500, with column shift and seating for six, was available in South Africa.

The changes were mainly cosmetic, with a four-horizontal-bar grille and revised taillight lenses and garnish panel. An anniversary model with a standard 302 was released in 1975, but otherwise the range stayed the same as the 1974 versions.\nThe Fairlane-based P5 series Ford LTD was released very late in the ZF model run in August 1973, three months prior to the ZG Fairlane. The LTD was only available as a four-door sedan, and the wheelbase was even longer than that of the Fairlane, itself a stretched Falcon. A luxury two-door coup\u00e9 called the [[Ford Landau (Australia)|Ford Landau]] (also designated P5) was released at the same time. The Landau was based on the Australian Falcon Hardtop, so featured a {{convert|111|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase as opposed to the {{convert|121|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase of the LTD. Both models were notable for their [[hidden headlights|concealed headlamps]], which were revealed when their vacuum-operated [[grille]] sections were retracted. The technology was similar to that found on earlier models of the American built [[Ford Thunderbird]]. Standard equipment on both the LTD and the Landau included integrated air conditioning, automatic transmission, electric windows, and a 351ci / 5.8L V8 engine.\n\nAlso in July 1975, Ford commenced a release of the Town Cars. These were 50th-Anniversary models, celebrating 50 years of Ford in Australia. They produced 250 of each in the LTD and Fairlane ranges. The Fairlanes in particular were optioned with LTD components, 15-inch wheels, leather interior, and electric windows to name some options. In the Fairlane, only a small handful was special-ordered with a 351 motor. All others were 302s. The LTD were 351-engine cars.\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/23725628@N06/4626374317/in/photostream 50th Anniversary Model badge]\n\nAs the P5 was released during the ZF model run, it retained many ZF components. For example, the main interior upgrade from the Fairlane ZF to ZG was the turn signal stalk. The ZF had the older-style stalk with the high beam \"dipper\" switch on the floor. When the ZG Fairlane was released a big item was the new multifunction column stalk which incorporated the dipper switch and horn. The P5s, however, used the ZF-style stalk and still had a \"squeeze rim\" horn similar to Falcon GTs of the era.  Because the P6 LTD was not released until about five months after the ZH Fairlane, some of the last P5s actually had a few minor ZH parts fitted.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== ZH / P6 (1976\u20131979) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (23531054516).jpg\n| image2 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (22930040893).jpg\n| footer =  1976\u201379 Ford Fairlane (ZH) 500\n}}\n\nThe ZH series addressed earlier complaints about the Fairlane being too close to the Falcon in May 1976. The designers retained the same central section from the upcoming XC [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] (including that car's new rear doors), but put on lengthened front and rear ends, giving the car more bulk and a luxury impression. The styling was reminiscent of the 1968 [[Mercury Marquis]]. The range-topping LTD went further upmarket with a fancy, [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]]-inspired grille (not dissimilar to that found on the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]]. Another sign of the upmarket move was the 500 becoming the basic trim (the Custom was deleted), and the Fairlane Marquis being the upscale version. The Marquis was Ford's response to the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman Caprice]], which was introduced in 1974 as an LTD rival.

This model was a leap ahead into the new decade, with squared-off lines and a six-light bodyshell clearly distinguishing Fairlane from the new XD Falcon of that year. The traditional quad headlights and distinctive vertically striped taillights further differentiated the luxury model from Falcon. The trim levels were deleted:  now, only a single Fairlane was available, with {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} or {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} V8 engine choices. In October, recognising the fuel crisis, Ford introduced a Fairlane with a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} inline-six from the Falcon.\n\nThe LTD version of the ZJ surfaced in October 1979 as the FC Series, using the same wheelbase and body panels as the Fairlane. In mid-1980, the Falcon 4.1-litre alloy head engine was made optional, the first time the LTD was available in six-cylinder guise.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 01.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 03.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1981 Ford FC LTD Cartier (6058256901).jpg|Ford LTD (FC) Cartier\n</gallery>\n\n==== {{anchor|ZK|FD}} ZK / FD (1982\u20131984) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 200\n| image1 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1982\u20131984 Ford Fairlane (ZK)\n}}\n\nThe ZK series of March 1982 had the deletion of the 5.8-L V8, which was the first warning the company would soon drop [[V8 engine|V8s]] from the local line-up. Minor changes were made to grille and taillights, but otherwise the external changes were negligible. In March 1983, the 4.9-L V8 was deleted, too, with Ford introducing a [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the six to take its place, claiming the new engine had  acceleration figures equivalent to the V8.\n\nThe main notable mechanical change was the introduction of the coil sprung, watts link-located rear axle, one of the best live rear-axle configurations.\n\nThe LTD FC series was updated to and designated FD in March 1982 with the V8 engine option deleted the following year.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== {{anchor|ZL|FE}} ZL / FE (1984\u20131988) ====\n[[File:1984-1986 Ford ZL Fairlane sedan (2011-01-05) 02.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (ZL)]]\n\nThe revised ZL series of 1985 (launched October 1984) kept the two six-cylinder engine options; only at the end of 1986 was the carburettor version of the Fairlane deleted. The ZL again carried over all external panels, but now had integrated headlights with clear indicators, full wrap-around bumpers, and new taillights. Inside, a full digital dashboard was introduced with push-button controls at either end of the instrument binnacle.

The philosophy was the same - a long-wheelbase Falcon with a six-light body. The 4.1-L six was heavily revised, becoming a 3.9-L unit with improved fuel economy and power. These models were part of the EA26 development programme and platform (E for the market segment, A for Australia, 26 the project code). Therefore, officially they were EA26s, but colloquially, Ford aficionados prefer a two-letter code. Hence, the new Fairlanes were given the NA series code.\n\nThe equivalent LTDs came on stream as the DA series in June 1988. Like the previous generation, all N-series Fairlanes and D-series LTDs were built on the Falcon/Fairmont station-wagon platform, and this legacy is most noticeable in the disproportionally narrow station-wagon rear doors on what was meant to be a limousine and in a car that otherwise caters well for rear-seat passengers with a large amount of interior seating and legroom space. Nonetheless, these large sedans were \"limousine enough\" to be one of the most common platforms used by Australian body-building companies to make stretch limousines.\n\nRevisions from November 1989 for the 1990 model year had the release of the NA II and DAII, the most notable change being the fitting of a four-speed, rather than three-speed, automatic transmission (since the Fairlane's debut, it had a three-speed).\n\nAlthough Ford Australia's former official historian, the late Adrian Ryan, was emphatic, officially, an NB series Fairlane never existed, at least one early 1989 prototype fitted with a four-speed automatic escaped from the factory bearing a compliance plate marked \"NB\" and was registered as an \"NB Fairlane\". Ford also produced an alloy wheel identification-guide poster for its parts counters listing one wheel as being for an \"NB Sportsman Fairlane\" and at one point the Series II NA likely was going to be called the NB. Third-party parts suppliers also often list both an \"NB Fairlane\" an \"NB \u2013 Series II Fairlane\" in their parts catalogues adding to the NB mystery. DOTARS (the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services) has no record of giving Ford approval to use an \"NB Fairlane\" compliance plate for a production model which might explain Ford's reluctance to officially acknowledge the \"NB\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}{{original research inline|date=April 2012}}\n\n==== NC / DC (1991\u20131995) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1993 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan\n}}\n\n[[File:1994 Ford LTD (DC II) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|1994 Ford LTD (DC II)]]\n\nAugust 1991 had the news that many Fairlane/LTD purists had awaited: the reintroduction of the V8 in the NC Fairlane and DC-series LTD. Ford had never recovered from deleting the V8s in the 1980s and bowed to public pressure with its reintroduction. The 5.0-L engine was not identical to the one used in the United States Mustang and other passenger cars. For reason of better durability and perhaps cost, it was the Canadian-made Windsor engine used in the North American light truck and 4WD models. To meet the needs of the space required for a right-drive steering column, its inlet manifold was reversed. Again to meet the conversion to right-hand drive and the rerouted inlet ducting, air box, and air conditioning lines, the Australian-installed engines also had most of their serpentine belt-driven accessories on opposite side to the US/North American models. As Australian enthusiasts often found to their frustration, these subtle changes often meant that many Ford Racing/SVO add-on bits, like the available superchargers, were not exactly the bolt-on items they were in North America. The inline six continued. The NC also introduced a higher-spec Fairlane, called the Fairlane Ghia, and the V8 was available in this model.\n\nThe 1992 NC II and DC IIs redesignated the 3.9-L engine a \"4.0-litre\", but trim levels remained the same. To appeal to younger buyers, Ford briefly sold a Fairlane Sportsman Ghia in 1993 with a \"Tickford\"-tuned 4.0-L six used in the Falcon XR6.\nA second, even smaller update, known as the NC III, arrived in August 1993. It is the equivalent to the ED series Falcon, adopting the new \"ozone safe\" R134a air conditioning refrigerant. The base Fairlane model was also discontinued, leaving only the Fairlane Ghia.\n\nFrom March 1994 production, the NC received additional changes - the fitment of a leather-wrapped steering wheel, body-coloured bumpers and side protection strips, new-design alloy wheels, and a [[hood ornament|bonnet ornament]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fordfalconfacts.com/model-specs/fairlane-ltd/nc-fairlane-dc-ltd-1991-1995/ | title = NC Fairlane / DC LTD | publisher = Falcon Facts | accessdate = 14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAn idea proposed in the late 1980s was a Fairlane wagon. Most likely, had it entered production, it would have used the Falcon wagon (which rode on the Fairlane's wheelbase) body, coupled with the Fairlane's front clip.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}{{original research inline|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Falcon utilities were still of the previous-generation XF. A prototype EB Falcon utility was made which looked Fairlane-based. To impart a look of solidness, the ute had a Fairlane frontal treatment. It did not enter production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== NF / DF (1995\u20131996) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane Ghia (4).jpg | width1 = 180\n| image2 = 1995-1996 Ford LTD (DF) sedan (2011-03-23).jpg  | width2 = 242\n| footer = Ford Fairlane Ghia (NF; left) and Ford LTD (DF; right)\n}}\n\nThe Fairlane and LTD received a major front and rear restyle in March 1995 (EA77 series in Ford-speak), coinciding with the EF Falcon, and remained on the same platform. The new NF Fairlanes and DF LTDs were longer and curvier, hiding their 1980s origins reasonably well. The exterior design was more ornamental compared to the relatively clean NAs to NCs. The Fairlane Sportsman reappeared for 1996, with the same formula as 1993, with the 4.0-L six.{{Clear}}\n\n==== NL / DL (1996\u20131999) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24141149516).jpg\n| image2 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24059154062).jpg\n| footer =  Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia\n}}\n\n[[File:1997 Ford LTD (DL) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|Ford LTD (DL)]]\nIn September 1996, the revised NL Fairlanes and DL LTDs appeared. In 1997, Ford introduced a higher Fairlane Concorde trim, with the same 4.0- and 5.0-L engine choices. No Sportsman variant of the Fairlane was offered.\n\nFor customers, five Dealer modified NL Series Fairlanes from Sydney and Melbourne utilised parts from the 5.0-litre [[Mustang Cobra]] and Australian delivered [[Special Vehicle Operations|SVO]] parts due to the limited edition run of the Fairlane by Tickford and customers wanting to maintain the Luxury look but sport the GT's performance.  The rounded body lines were reminiscent of the US-market Ford Taurus, while the front end styling was similar to the Lincoln Town Car.\n\nFord expanded the Fairlane range greatly in 1998. Beginning with the Ghia, also a basic Concorde (six-cylinder) and Concorde Ghia (V8) were offered. A [[Tickford Vehicle Engineering|Tickford]]-modified version was also available, with the larger engine, as well as a luxurious Fairlane Special Edition Ghia.\n\nThe NL and DL series were the last models to come equipped with automatic self-leveling rear suspension.\n{{clear}}\n\nThe New Zealand Government also used the NL Fairlane Ghia as their designated Crown Limousines. Crown Fairlanes were mostly painted Amaretto (a few in white) and were fitted with silver chonchorde 16 inch wheels, 6 disc cd stacker, electric adjust drivers seat and New Zealand fitted flag pole mounts on the front guards.\n\nAll of the Fairlane Ghias used by the New Zealand Government were fitted with the factory 4.0L six cylinder engine producing 165kw. The LTD was also used with a few being V8 models. The LTD Crown Cars were a range of colours including Dynamic White, Argon Silver, Mocha Foam and Amaretto in the facelift.  \n\nThe NL and DL Crown cars all sported special government only licence plates starting with CR404 in 1997 and continuing in numerical order to CR437 in 1998. Most crown cars were retired after 3 years of service. The Fairlane and LTD had been used by the New Zealand Government since the 1970s through to 2010s where the Ford brand was replaced with BMW 7 series. \n\nThe New Zealand Government still uses CR registration plates on their current Crown Cars.\n\n<br />\n\n=== Fifth generation ===\n==== AU (1999\u20132003) ====\n[[File:2001 Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 02.jpg\n| footer = 2000\u20132003 Ford LTD (AU II)\n}}\n\nFord introduced its \"[[New Edge]]\" look to the AU series Fairlane in February 1999, with some success, though the EA169 platform was considered a flop, allowing rival [[Holden]] to overtake the company in the sales of full-sized cars. The AU LTD was released 3 months later in May.\n\nThe AU Fairlane and LTD models were the first long-wheelbase sedans to share a model code with the Falcon. They had [[Lincoln Town Car]] styling cues, especially around the [[C-pillar]]. The range was pared back to just two models, the Fairlane Ghia and the LTD, although a limited-edition Fairlane Millennium Ghia was also offered in January 2000.<ref>[http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&ID=D62DD4AB47EC387FCA257125001A1418 Ford AU Fairlane].

The 2001 model year AU II models featured some improvements, and another limited edition was offered: the 75th Anniversary Ghia in October, with the same engine choices as before. The Sportsman Ghia was revived in March 2001 and lasted for more than one model year this time, remaining in the range to the end of 2002.\n\n==== BA (2003\u20132005) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | image1 = 2003-2005 Ford BA Fairlane G220 sedan 01.jpg | width1 = 165\n| image2 = 2003-2005 Ford BA Fairlane G220 sedan (2011-03-09).jpg | width2 = 210\n| footer = 2003\u20132005 Ford Fairlane (BA) G220\n}}\n\nFord's new attempt to battle Holden came in July 2003 with the BA series. The BA Fairlanes and LTDs were closer to the Falcon in looks, even sharing the taillights. The 5.0-L gave way to the larger 5.4-L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4 L|Modular]] V8, already used in the US From this point the LTD was no longer offered with a six-cylinder engine.\n\nTo capture younger buyers, the Fairlane G220 (denoting its {{convert|220|kW|hp|adj=mid}} power output at 4,750&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|472|Nm|lbft}} of torque from 3,250\u20134,000&nbsp;rpm) took the place of the Fairlane Sportsman, and featured the larger engine only. The traditional automatic gearbox was replaced by a [[tiptronic|sequential automatic]]. Unique to the G220 were 17-inch Elegance alloy wheels, ebony headlight bezels with unique lens, and redline leather seats with warm charcoal, perforated leather inserts.\n\nThe Fairlane Ghia continued as the six-cylinder base model, but came standard with colour ICC screen, asix-CD stack, 11-speaker Premium Sound, 7-way adjustable leather seats, and woodgrain inserts.\n\nThe LTD was further distinguished from the Ghia by having the 5.4-L V8 engine, sunroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, LTD badging, 10-way adjustable front seats, bolstered rear seats, [[satellite navigation]], and auto-dimming rear-vision mirror.<ref>{{cite web |last=Torr |first=Feann |year=2003 |url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/xfd_fairlane.htm |title=First Drive: BA Ford Fairlane |publisher=Web Wombat |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nBrakes were the same as on the Falcon, with Fairlanes coming standard with [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] and [[traction control]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mynrma.com.au/motoring-services/reviews/car-reviews/ford/fairlane-ghia-ba-g220-ltd.htm |title=Ford Fairlane Ghia BA G220 & LTD Car Review |publisher=[[NRMA]] |date=1 March 2004 |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Ford Australia's introduction of the BA II Falcon in October 2004, facelifted versions of the Fairlane Ghia, Fairlane G220, and LTD were introduced in March 2005. The changes were mainly cosmetic, but nevertheless significant, and were carried over in the subsequent BF model ranges. The facelifted Fairlane was headlined by a more heavily chromed exterior, including chrome rub strips, a new chromed rear appliqu\u00e9,  and on Fairlane Ghia and LTD, chromed wing mirror covers. The G220 was given new-design seven-spoke alloy wheels, while Fairlane Ghia and LTD added two-toned paint to their side skirts and lower valances.\n\nFor the BA II interior, the black leather seats and leather section of the door trims were replaced with new leather trim dubbed China Beige. The Ghia and G220 gained an eight-way power driver\u2019s seat with memory function. The G220 was given a leather-wrapped sports steering wheel, and the Ghia a Rhui Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel, and the LTD gained a Stone Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel.\n\nWhile the only BA II mechanical change was the addition of Sports Control Blade rear-suspension tune for the base Ghia and top-shelf LTD, a DVD rear entertainment system became standard for the LTD, exchangeable for a sunroof.\n\nAn interior upgrade that would be carried over in its entirety to the subsequent BF range was the change from black to brushed silver instrument dials and dash clock, and the silver shifter surround, centre cup holder, and ICC fascia became \"piano black\" with the ICC buttons changed accordingly from black to silver. Chrome door handles, vent tips, and door lock barrels were also added.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pettendy |first=Marton |date=4 February 2005 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/F5855C5E817D447CCA256F9D007C8CFA |title=Comfort is king in Ford's fresh Fairlane |work=GoAuto |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref> The original woodgrain trim was retained until the BF.\n\n==== BF (2005\u20132007) ====\n[[File:2007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24).jpg|thumb|2005\u20132007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 02.jpg \n| footer = 2005\u20132007 Ford LTD (BF)\n}}\n\nThe BF series Fairlane and LTD models were introduced in October 2005, with the Fairlane G220 renamed the Fairlane G8. Externally, the BF was outwardly identical to the BA Mark II, but fine tunings to steering, suspension, soundproofing and undercarriage were made. Fuel economy was also improved. Across the whole BF range, the taillight lenses were slightly changed in appearance. The Ghia went from 16-inch to 17-inch alloy wheels as standard.\n\nInterior-wise, the only changes from the upgrades introduced in the BA Mark II were the replacement of the woodgrain inserts with \"satin chrome\" inserts. This colour scheme was the same for all BF Fairlane variants. The BF Ghia and LTD came with black leather seats or China beige leather seats with eight-way adjustable drivers seat and six-way adjustable passenger seat.\n\nThe G8 featured an eight-cylinder engine with improved exhaust system and an additional knock sensor, producing  {{convert|230|kW|hp}} at 5,350&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|500|Nm|lbft}} of torque at 3,500&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[http://www.privatefleet.com.au/buying-new-car/car-reviews/ford/ford-fairlane-review/ Ford Fairlane at www.privatefleet.com.au].
