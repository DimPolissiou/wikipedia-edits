The first is that it was named after [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]], [[Earl of Burlington|3rd Earl of Burlington]], and the second is that the name honors the politically prominent and wealthy Burling family of New York. While no Burling family members are listed as grantees of the town, the family held large tracts of land in nearby towns, some of which were granted on the same day as Burlington.<ref>Swift, Esther Munroe (1977) ''Vermont Place-Names'' {{ISBN|0-8289-0291-7}}. p.165</ref>\n\nOne of the [[New Hampshire grants]], the land that was developed as Burlington was awarded by New Hampshire colonial governor [[Benning Wentworth]] on June 7, 1763, to Samuel Willis and 63 others.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">Coolidge, A.J. and Mansfield, J.B.

In 1783, Stephen Lawrence arrived with his family. The town was organized in 1785.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nThe [[War of 1812]] was unpopular in Vermont and [[New England]], which had numerous trading ties with Canada. Neither Vermont nor other New England states provided militia units or financial support.

This is described as either a bold stroke by the British with an ineffectual response from the Americans, or a weak sally by the British, which was rightly ignored by the Americans. The cannonade lasted about 10 minutes and caused no casualties. The American troops involved were commanded by Naval Lieutenant [[Thomas Macdonough]], later hero of the [[Battle of Plattsburgh|Battle of Lake Champlain]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nThe town's position on [[Lake Champlain]] helped it develop into a port of entry and center for trade, particularly after completion of the [[Champlain Canal]] in 1823, the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, and the [[Chambly Canal]] in 1843. Wharves allowed steamboats to connect freight and passengers with the [[Rutland and Burlington Railroad|Rutland & Burlington Railroad]] and [[Vermont Central Railroad]]. Burlington became a bustling lumbering and manufacturing center and was incorporated as a city in 1865. Its [[Victorian era]] prosperity left behind much fine architecture, including buildings by [[Ammi B. Young]], [[H.H.

{"title_page": "Federalism", "text_new": "{{about|the form of government|other uses}}\n{{politics sidebar|expanded=Subseries}}\n'''Federalism''' is the mixed or compound mode of [[government]], combining a general government (the central or \"federal\" government) with regional governments (provincial, state, cantonal, territorial or other sub-unit governments) in a single political system. Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism by the [[United States]] under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of 1787]], is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established.<ref>In 1946, scholar Kenneth Wheare observed that the two levels of government in the US were 'co-equally supreme'. In this he echoed the perspective of the founding fathers, James Madison in ''Federalist 39'' having seen the several states as forming 'distinct and independent portions of the supremacy' in relation to the general government. Wheare, Kenneth (1946) ''Federal Government'', Oxford University Press, London, pp. 10-15. Madison, James, Hamilton, Alexander and Jay, John (1987) ''The Federalist Papers'', Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 258.</ref> Federalism can thus be defined as a form of government in which there is a division of powers between two levels of government of equal status.<ref>Law, John (2013) 'How Can We Define Federalism?', in ''Perspectives on Federalism'', Vol. 5, No. 3, pp. E105-6. http://www.on-federalism.eu/attachments/169_download.pdf</ref>\n\nFederalism differs from [[Confederation|confederalism]], in which the general level of government is subordinate to the regional level, and from [[devolution]] within a [[unitary state]], in which the regional level of government is subordinate to the general level.<ref>Wheare, Kenneth (1946), pp. 31-2.</ref> It represents the central form in the pathway of regional integration or separation,<ref>See diagram below.</ref> bounded on the less integrated side by confederalism and on the more integrated side by devolution within a unitary state.<ref>Diamond, Martin (1961) \"The Federalist's View of Federalism\", in Benson, George (ed.)

Hueglin, Thomas and Fenna, Alan (2006) ''Comparative Federalism: A Systematic Inquiry'', Broadview, Peterborough, p. 31.</ref>\n\nLeading examples of the [[federation]] or federal state include the [[United States]], [[India]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]], [[Switzerland]], [[Argentina]], and [[Australia]]. Some also today characterize the [[European Union]] as the pioneering example of federalism in a multi-state setting, in a concept termed the federal union of states.<ref>See Law, John (2013), p. 104. http://www.on-federalism.eu/attachments/169_download.pdf<br />\nThis author identifies two distinct federal forms, where before only one was known, based upon whether [[sovereignty]] (conceived in its core meaning of ultimate authority) resides in the whole (in one people) or in the parts (in many peoples). This is determined by the absence or presence of a right of secession for the parts. The structures are termed, respectively, the federal state (or federation) and the federal union of states (or federal union).</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:The pathway of regional integration or separation.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|The pathway of regional integration or separation]]\nThe terms 'federalism' and 'confederalism' both have a root in the Latin word ''foedus'', meaning \"treaty, pact or [[wikt:covenant|covenant]].\" Their common meaning until the late eighteenth century was a simple league or inter-governmental relationship among sovereign states based upon a treaty. They were therefore initially synonyms. It was in this sense that James Madison in ''Federalist 39'' had referred to the new US Constitution as 'neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both' (i.e. neither constituting a single large unitary state nor a league/confederation among several small states, but a hybrid of the two).<ref>Madison, James, Hamilton, Alexander and Jay, John (1987) ''The Federalist Papers'', Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 259.</ref> In the course of the nineteenth century the meaning of federalism would come to shift, strengthening to refer uniquely to the novel compound political form established, while the meaning of confederalism would remain at a league of states.<ref>Law, John (2012) 'Sense on Federalism', in ''Political Quarterly'', Vol. 83, No. 3, p. 544.</ref> Thus, this article relates to the modern usage of the word 'federalism'.\n\n[[File:Map of unitary and federal states.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|\n{{legend|#00e000;|[[Federal state]]s}}\n{{legend|#0000b0;|[[Unitary state]]s}}]]\nModern federalism is a system based upon [[democracy|democratic]] rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments. The term ''[[federalist]]'' describes several political beliefs around the world depending on context.\n\nFederalism is sometimes viewed as in the context of international negotiation as \"the best system for integrating diverse nations, ethnic groups, or combatant parties, all of whom may have cause to fear control by an overly powerful center.\"<ref name=\"Meyer-Resende\">Michael Meyer-Resende, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/18/why-talk-of-federalism-wont-help-peace-in-syria-assad/ Why Talk of Federalism Won't Help Peace in Syria], ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' (March 18, 2017).</ref> However, in some countries, those skeptical of federal prescriptions believe that increased regional autonomy is likely to lead to secession or dissolution of the nation.<ref name=\"Meyer-Resende\"/> In Syria, federalization proposals have failed in part because \"Syrians fear that these borders could turn out to be the same as the ones that the fighting parties have currently carved out.\"<ref name=\"Meyer-Resende\"/>\n\nFederations such as [[Yugoslavia]] or [[Czechoslovakia]] collapsed as soon as it was possible to put the model to the test.<ref>'The Federal Experience in Yugoslavia', Mihailo Markovic, page 75; included in 'Rethinking Federalism: Citizens, Markets, and Governments in a changing world', edited by Karen Knop, Sylvia Ostry, Richard Simeon, Katherine Swinton|Google books</ref>\n\n=== Early origins ===\nAn early historical example of federalism is the [[Achaean League]] in [[Hellenistic Greece]]. Unlike the [[Greek city states]] of [[Classical Greece]], each of which insisted on keeping its complete independence, changing conditions in the Hellenistic period drove many city states to band together even at the cost of losing part of their sovereignty - similar to the process leading to the formation of later federations.\n\n=== Explanations for adoption ===\nAccording to Daniel Ziblatt's ''Structuring the State'', there are four competing theoretical explanations in the academic literature for the adoption of federal systems:\n# Ideational theories, which hold that a greater degree of ideological commitment to decentralist ideas in society makes federalism more likely to be adopted.\n# Cultural-historical theories, which hold that federal institutions are more likely to be adopted in societies with culturally or ethnically fragmented populations.\n# \"Social contract\" theories, which hold that federalism emerges as a bargain between a center and a periphery where the center is not powerful enough to dominate the periphery and the periphery is not powerful enough to secede from the center.\n# \"Infrastructural power\" theories, which hold that federalism is likely to emerge when the subunits of a potential federation already have highly developed infrastructures (e.g. they are already constitutional, parliamentary, and administratively modernized states).<ref>{{Cite book|author=Daniel Ziblatt|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8201.html|title=Structuring the State: The Formation of Italy and Germany and the Puzzle of Federalism|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|date=2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Immanuel Kant ===\n[[Immanuel Kant]] was an advocate of federalism, noting that \"the problem of setting up a state can be solved even by a nation of devils\" so long as they possess an appropriate constitution which pits opposing factions against each other with a system of [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]]. In particular individual states required a federation as a safeguard against the possibility of war.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v7v3CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT79&lpg=PT79&dq=%22the+problem+of+setting+up+a+state+can+be+solved+even+by+a+nation+of+devils%22&source=bl&ots=D7n6bl_eln&sig=ACfU3U0RbgJrfdftxb6-FTwpXXBVAeMIxw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnwJOu_LbgAhUo7IMKHYiJCYYQ6AEwBXoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22the%20problem%20of%20setting%20up%20a%20state%20can%20be%20solved%20even%20by%20a%20nation%20of%20devils%22&f=false Kant: Political Writings], H.S. Reiss, 2013</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n=== Australia ===\n{{main|Federalism in Australia}}\n{{see also|Federation of Australia}}\n[[File:Australia location map recolored.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The Commonwealth of Australia, consisting of its [[federal district]], [[Australian Capital Territory]] (red), the states of [[New South Wales]] (pink), [[Queensland]] (blue), [[South Australia]] (purple), [[Tasmania]] (yellow on the bottom), [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (green), [[Western Australia]] (orange) and the [[Northern Territory]] (yellow on the top)]]\nOn 1 January 1901, the dominion of Australia officially came into existence as a federation. The [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]] was colonised by the United Kingdom in 1788, which subsequently established six, eventually self-governing, colonies there. In the 1890s the governments of these colonies all held [[referendums]] on becoming the unified, self-governing \"Commonwealth of Australia\" within the British Empire. When all the colonies voted in favour of federation, the [[Federation of Australia]] commenced, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The model of Australian federalism adheres closely to the original model of the United States of America, although it does so through a parliamentary [[Westminster system]] rather than a presidential system.\n\n=== Brazil ===\n{{see also|States of Brazil}}\n[[File:Brazil Political Map.svg|thumb|left|Brazil is a union of 26 [[States of Brazil|states]] and its [[Federal District (Brazil)|federal district]] which is the site of [[Bras\u00edlia]], the federal capital]]\nIn Brazil, the [[Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil|fall of the monarchy in 1889]] by a military ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' led to the rise of the [[presidential system]], headed by [[Deodoro da Fonseca]]. Aided by well-known jurist [[Ruy Barbosa]], Fonseca established federalism in Brazil by decree, but this system of government would be confirmed by every [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian constitution]] since 1891, although some of them would distort some of the federalist principles. The 1937 federal government had the authority to appoint State Governors (called [[Federal intervention|intervenors]]) at will, thus centralizing power in the hands of President [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]. Brazil also uses the Fonseca system to regulate interstate trade. Brazil is one of the biggest federal governments.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution of 1988]] introduced a new component to the ideas of federalism, including [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]] as federal entities. Brazilian municipalities are now invested with some of the traditional powers usually granted to states in federalism, and they are allowed to adopt a constitution.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{main|Canadian federalism}}\n[[File:Political map of Canada.png|thumb|upright=1.1|In Canada, the provincial governments derive all their powers directly from the [[Constitution of Canada|constitution]]. In contrast, the [[Territories of Canada|territories]] are subordinate to the federal government and are delegated powers by it.]]\nIn Canada the system of federalism is described by the division of powers between the [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]] and the country's [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] governments.  Under the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|Constitution Act]]'' (previously known as the ''[[British North America Act of 1867]]''), specific powers of legislation are allotted.  Section 91 of the constitution gives rise to federal authority for legislation, whereas section 92 gives rise to provincial powers.\n\nFor matters not directly dealt with in the constitution, the federal government retains residual powers; however, conflicts between the two levels of government, relating to which level has legislative jurisdiction over various matters, have been a longstanding and evolving issue.  Areas being contested include legislation with respect to regulation of the economy, taxation, and natural resources.\n\n=== <span id=\"Europe\">Europe</span> ===<!-- [[F word]] links here. -->\nSeveral federal systems exist in Europe, such as in Switzerland, Austria, [[Federalism in Germany|Germany]], [[#Belgium|Belgium]], Bosnia and Herzegovina and the [[European Union]].\n\nIn Britain, an [[Imperial Federation]] was once seen as (''inter alia'') a method of solving the [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule]] problem in Ireland; federalism has long been proposed{{by whom|date=May 2013}} as a solution to the \"[[The Irish Problem|Irish Problem]]\", and more lately, to the \"[[West Lothian question]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/82358.stm|title=UK Politics: Talking Politics The West Lothian Question|date=1 June 1998|accessdate=|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==== French Revolution ====\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], especially in 1793, \"federalism\" had an entirely different meaning.

Those organizations exercised influence in the European unification process, but never in a decisive way.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nAlthough the drafts of both the [[Maastricht treaty]] and the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] mentioned federalism, the reference never made it to the text of the treaties adopted by consensus. The strongest advocates of European federalism have been Germany, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg while those historically most strongly opposed have been the United Kingdom, Denmark<ref>{{cite book |last1=S\u00f8rensen |first1=Catharina |title=DANISH AND BRITISH POPULAR EUROSCEPTICISM COMPARED: A SCEPTICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE CONCEPT |publisher=Dansk Institut for Internationale Studier |url=https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/17046/Danish_British_Euroscepticism.pdf |accessdate=24 March 2020 |format=pdf}}</ref> and France (with conservative heads of state and governments).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Since the presidency of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand (1981-1995), the French authorities have adopted a much more pro-European Unification position, as they consider that a strong EU is presenting the best \"insurance\"  against a unified Germany which might become too strong and thus a threat for its neighbours.\n\n{{quote|Those uncomfortable using the \u201cF\u201d word in the EU context should feel free to refer to it as a quasi-federal or federal-like system. Nevertheless, for the purposes of the analysis here, the EU has the necessary attributes of a federal system.

The United States had a similar system until 1913, where prior to the 17th Amendment, Senators were delegates of the state elected by the state legislatures rather than the citizens.\n\nAlready the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the [[German Confederation]], the [[North German Confederation]], the [[German Empire]] and the [[Weimar Republic]] were federal complexes of territories of different political structures. Modern Germany abandoned federalism only during [[Nazi Germany|Nazism]] (1933\u20131945, only de facto but not de jure) and in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (1952\u20131990). [[Adolf Hitler]] viewed federalism as an obstacle to his goals. As he wrote in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', \"[[Nazism|National Socialism]] must claim the right to impose its principles on the whole German nation, without regard to what were hitherto the confines of federal states.\"{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nAccordingly, the idea of a strong, centralized government has very negative connotations in German politics, although the progressive political movements in Germany (Liberals, Social Democrats) were advocating at the time of the Second German Empire (1871-1918) to abolish (or to reshape) the majority of German federated states of that era, as they were considered to be mostly monarchist remnances of the feudal structures of the Middle Ages.<ref>Bernt Engelmann, Einig gegen Recht und Freiheit, p7ff, publ. Goldmann, Munich 1975</ref>\n\n=== India ===\n{{main|Federalism in India}}\n[[File:India-map-en.svg|thumb|left|A map showing India's 29 states and 7 Union territories including the National Capital Territory of Delhi]]\nThe [[Government of India]] (referred to as the ''Union Government'') was established by the [[Constitution of India]], and is the governing authority of a ''federal union'' of [[States and territories of India|28 states and 8 union territories]].\n\nThe government of India is based on a 3 tiered system, in which the [[Constitution of India]] delineates the subjects on which each tier of government has executive powers.  The Constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government, the Union Government (also known as the Central Government), representing the Union of India, and the [[State governments of India|State governments]]. Later, a third tier was added in the form of [[Panchayati raj (India)|Panchayats]] and [[Municipal governance in India|Municipalities]]. In the current arrangement, The [[Constitution of India#Schedules|Seventh Schedule]] of the Indian Constitution delimits the subjects of each level of governmental jurisdiction, dividing them into three lists:\n* [[Union List]] includes subjects of national importance such as defence of the country, foreign affairs, banking, communications and currency. The Union Government alone can make laws relating to the  subjects mentioned in the Union List. This list is about portfolios concerning the country as one ore inter state transaction\n* [[State List]] contains subjects of State and local importance such as police, trade, commerce, agriculture and irrigation. The State Governments alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the State List.\n* [[Concurrent List]] includes subjects of common interest to both the Union Government as well as the State Governments, such as education, forest, trade unions, marriage, adoption and succession. Both the Union as well as the State Governments can make laws on the subjects mentioned in this list. If their laws conflict with each other, the law made by the Union Government will prevail.\n\n==== Asymmetric federalism ====\nA distinguishing aspect of Indian federalism is that unlike many other forms of federalism, it is asymmetric and gives limited [[autonomy]] to only some [[Indian states]].<ref name=\"NCERT\">{{cite book | url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/NCERTS/textbook/textbook.htm?keps2=10-10 | title=Indian Constitution at Work | publisher=[[National Council of Educational Research and Training|NCERT]] | pages=232, 233}}</ref> [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India]] made special provisions for the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as per its [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]] but it was [[Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir|revoked]] in 2019. Article 371 makes special provisions for the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Assam]], [[Goa]], [[Gujarat]], [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Manipur]], [[Mizoram]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Sikkim]] as per their accession or state-hood deals. Also one more aspect of Indian federalism is system of [[President's Rule]] in which the central government (through its appointed Governor) takes control of state's administration for certain months when no party can form a government in the state or there is violent disturbance in the state.\n\n==== Coalition politics ====\nAlthough the constitution does not say so, India is now a multilingual federation.<ref name=\"NCERT\"/> India has a multi-party system, with political allegiances frequently based on linguistic, regional and caste identities,<ref>Johnson, A \"Federalism: The Indian Experience \", HSRC Press,1996, Pg 3, ISBN</ref> necessitating coalition politics, especially at the [[Government of India|Union]] level. India has generally two main groups known as the NDA and the UPA and the third group known as the Left Front.\n\n=== Malaysia ===\n[[File:Malaysia states named.png|thumb|left|300px|Map of Malaysia with its states]]\n[[Malaysia]] is a [[federal monarchy|federal]] [[constitutional monarchy]]. Its monarchy is elective with the nine rulers and four state leaders (representing states with its sultanates abolished) meet at the [[Conference of Rulers]] to elect the next monarch every five years, or if the position becomes vacant for any reason. There is also a custom of rotation of the monarchy between the nine rulers. A legacy of British colonial rule, the federation's system of government is modelled closely on the [[Westminster parliamentary system]]. There exists a [[lower house|lower]] and [[upper house]]. Governance of the states is divided between the [[Government of Malaysia|federal]] and the [[state governments of Malaysia|state government]]s, with different powers reserved for each, and the federal government has direct administration of the federal territories. Legislative powers are divided between state and federal assemblies, with elections being held every five years.\n\nBefore British rule, Malaysia as it is today, was composed of separate sultanates and states. The [[Federated Malay States]] was the first instance of federalism being introduced in the Malay Peninsula. [[Penang]] was ruled as part of the [[Straits Settlements]] along with [[Malacca]]. In Borneo, [[British North Borneo]] joined the federation as the state of [[Sabah]] along with a briefly independent [[Raj of Sarawak]] as the state of [[Sarawak]]. [[Singapore in Malaysia|Singapore]] became independent after being ejected from the federation, due to differences between the central government and the [[People's Action Party]], which still rules Singapore till today.\n\n=== Ethiopia ===\n\nEthiopia has over 80 ethno-linguistic groups and the new Constitution which was introduced in 1994, dividing Ethiopia on ethnic lines into nine regional states and two multiethnic \"chartered administrations\" (Addis Ababa and Diredawa).[10][14]:54-55 Ethnic groups received rights to self-government:[8] the states were given autonomy in legislative, executive and judicial functions,[15]:8 while there were provisions for ethnic groups to be represented in central institutions. Ethnic groups were granted the \"unconditional right\" to secession,[14]:55 although it is doubtful whether any group could in fact achieve this.[16][15]:22 The government was aiming not only to reduce inter-ethnic conflict but to equalise living standards in different areas and improve the working of public institutions locally.\n\n=== Nigeria ===\n{{main|Federalism in Nigeria}}\n[[File:Nigeria states.png|thumb|upright=1.1|A map of the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]], showing its [[States of Nigeria|36 states and 1 Federal Capital Territory]]]]\nThe [[Nigeria|Federal Republic of Nigeria]] has various states which have [[States of Nigeria#Evolution of Nigerian states|evolved over time]] due to complex [[socioeconomic]] issues as well as the effect of their [[Colonial Nigeria|colonial era]].

It is where the functions, responsibilities and authorities of districts government is divided into more smaller units, these units are known as \"Tehsil\". The Tehsils are used in all over the Pakistan except Sindh province where the word \"Taluka\" is used instead, although the functions and authorities are same. The head of the Tehsil government is \"Tehsil Nazim\" who is assisted by the tehsil Naib-Nazim.

Despite the delocalisation enjoyed within the republic, the federal principle is not evident enough and it failed Wheare\u2019s very simple federal test right in the beginning}}</ref>\n\n=== Russian Federation ===\n{{main|Russian federalism}}\n[[File:Map of federal subjects of Russia (2014).svg|thumb|left|upright=1.45|Federal subjects of Russia]]\nThe post-Imperial nature of Russian subdivision of government changed towards a generally autonomous model which began with the establishment of the [[USSR]] (of which Russia was governed as part). It was liberalized in the [[Post-Soviet Russia|aftermath of the Soviet Union]], with the reforms under [[Boris Yeltsin]] preserving much of the Soviet structure while applying increasingly liberal reforms to the governance of the constituent republics and subjects (while also coming into conflict with Chechen secessionist rebels during the [[First Chechen War|Chechen War]]). Some of the reforms under Yeltsin were scaled back by [[Vladimir Putin]].\n\nAll of Russia's subdivisional entities are known as subjects, with some smaller entities, such as the republics enjoying more autonomy than other subjects on account of having an extant presence of a culturally non-Russian ethnic minority or, in some cases, majority.\n\nCurrently, there are 85 federal subjects of Russia.\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\n[[File:UAE Regions map.png|thumb|Map of the United Arab Emirates]]\nThe [[UAE]] is a [[federal monarchy|federal]] [[absolute monarchy]] of [[Royal families of the United Arab Emirates|the six ruling families of the United Arab Emirates]] with [[Emir]] of each Emirate being an absolute monarch and the Emir of [[Abu Dhabi]] being also the [[President of the UAE]].\n\n=== United States of America ===\n{{main|Federalism in the United States}}\nFederalism in the United States is the evolving relationship between [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] and the [[federal government of the United States]]. American government has evolved from a system of dual federalism to one of associative federalism. In \"[[Federalist No. 46]],\" James Madison asserted that the states and national government \"are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people, constituted with different powers.\" [[Alexander Hamilton]], writing in \"[[Federalist No. 28]],\" suggested that both levels of government would exercise authority to the citizens' benefit: \"If their [the peoples'] rights are invaded by either, they can make use of the other as the instrument of redress.\"<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20100502142849/http://www.learner.org/courses/democracyinamerica/dia_3/dia_3_topic.html</ref>\n[[File:Map of USA with state names.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The United States is composed of fifty self-governing states and several territories.]]\n\nBecause the states were pre existing political entities, the U.S. Constitution did not need to define or explain federalism in any one section but it often mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments and state officials in relation to  the federal government. The federal government has certain ''express powers'' (also called ''[[enumerated powers]]'') which are powers spelled out in the Constitution, including the right to levy taxes, declare war, and regulate interstate and foreign commerce. In addition, the ''[[Necessary and Proper Clause]]'' gives the federal government the ''implied power'' to pass any law \"necessary and proper\" for the execution of its express powers. Other powers\u2014the ''[[reserved powers]]''\u2014are reserved to the people or the states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/constitution/supreme.htm|title=THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA With Explanatory Notes|access-date=|publisher=U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International Information Programs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316033029/https://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/constitution/supreme.htm|archive-date=2008-03-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> The power delegated to the federal government was significantly expanded by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), amendments to the Constitution following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and by some later amendments\u2014as well as the overall claim of the Civil War, that the states were legally subject to the final dictates of the federal government.\n\nThe [[Federalist Party]] of the United States was opposed by the [[Democratic-Republicans]], including powerful figures such as [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The Democratic-Republicans mainly believed that: the Legislature had too much power (mainly because of the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]]) and that they were unchecked; the Executive had too much power, and that there was no check on the executive; a dictator would arise; and that a bill of rights should be coupled with the constitution to prevent a potential dictator from exploiting or tyrannizing citizens. The federalists said that it was impossible to list all the rights, and those that were not listed could be easily overlooked because they were not in the official bill of rights. Rather, rights in specific cases were to be decided by the judicial system of courts.\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], the federal government increased greatly in influence on everyday life and in size relative to the state governments. Reasons included the need to regulate businesses and industries that span state borders, attempts to secure civil rights, and the provision of social services. The federal government acquired no substantial new powers until the acceptance by the Supreme Court of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].\n\nFrom 1938 until 1995, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] did not invalidate any federal statute as exceeding Congress' power under the [[Commerce Clause]]. Most actions by the federal government can find some legal support among the express powers, such as the [[Commerce Clause]], whose applicability has been narrowed by the Supreme Court in recent years. In 1995, the Supreme Court rejected the [[Gun-Free School Zones Act]] in the Lopez decision, and also rejected the civil remedy portion of the [[Violence Against Women Act of 1994]] in the ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' decision. Recently, the Commerce Clause was interpreted to include marijuana laws in the ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' decision.\n\n[[Dual federalism]] holds that the federal government and the state governments are co-equals, each sovereign.\n\nHowever, since the Civil War Era, the national courts often interpret the federal government as the final judge of its own powers under dual federalism. The establishment of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] governments (which are [[Indian country|separate and distinct]] from state and federal government) exercising limited powers of [[Tribal sovereignty|sovereignty]], has given rise to the concept of \"bi-federalism.\"\n\n=== Venezuela ===\n[[File:Localizador Politico de Venezuela.svg|thumb|Map of the Venezuelan federation]]\nThe [[Federal War]] ended in 1863 with the signing of the Treaty of Coche by both the centralist government of the time and the Federal Forces.  The [[United States of Venezuela]] were subsequently incorporated under a \"Federation of Sovereign States\" upon principles borrowed from the [[Articles of Confederation]] of the United States of America. In this Federation, each State had a \"President\" of its own that controlled almost every issue, even the creation of \"State Armies,\" while the Federal Army was required to obtain presidential permission to enter any given state.\n\nHowever, more than 140 years later, the original system has gradually evolved into a quasi-centralist form of government. While the [[Constitution of Venezuela|1999 Constitution]] still defines Venezuela as a Federal Republic, it abolished the Senate, transferred competences of the States to the Federal Government and granted the President of the Republic vast powers to intervene in the States and Municipalities.\n\n=== With two components ===\n==== Belgium ====\n{{importance section|date=September 2009}}\n{{main|Belgian federal government|Belgian federal parliament|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium}}\nFederalism in the Kingdom of Belgium is an evolving system.\n\nBelgian federalism is a twin system which reflects both the\n* [[Languages of Belgium|linguistic ''communities'']] of the country, [[French Community of Belgium|French]] (ca. 40% of the total population), [[Flemish Community|Dutch]] (ca. 59%), and to a much lesser extent [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German]] (ca. 1%) and the\n* geographically defined Regions (federated States: [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels-Capital]] (de facto Greater Brussels), [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]]). The last two correspond to [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|the language areas in Belgium]], Wallonia hosting both the bulk of the French-speaking population and the German-speaking minority. In Brussels, ca. 80% of the population speaks French and ca. 20% Dutch with the city being an enclave of the Flemish region and officially a bilingual area.<ref>{{in lang|nl}}[http://www.brusselsstudies.be/PDF/NL_51_BruS13NL.pdf \u201dTaalgebruik in Brussel en de plaats van het Nederlands.

French is the second most spoken mother tongue of Belgium, after Dutch. Within the French-speaking Community of Belgium, there is a geographical and political distinction between Wallonia and Brussels for historical and sociological reasons. Historically, the Walloons were for a federalism with three components and the Flemings for two.<ref>See: Witte, Els & Craeybeckx, Jan. Politieke geschiedenis van Belgi\u00eb. Antwerpen, SWU, pp. 455, 459-460.</ref> This difference is one of the elements which makes the Belgian issue so complicated. The Flemings wanted to defend their culture while the Walloons wanted to defend their political and economical supremacy they had in the 19th century: ''It is true that the Walloon movement, which has never stopped affirming that Wallonia is part of the French cultural area, has never made this cultural struggle a priority, being more concerned to struggle against its status as a political minority and the economic decline which was only a corollary to it''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallonie-en-ligne.net/Wallonie_Politique/1995_Destatte_Philippe_Wallonia-Identity.htm|title= Wallonia today - The search for an identity without nationalist mania - (1995)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn one hand, this means that the [[Politics in Belgium|Belgian political landscape]], generally speaking, consists of only two components: the Dutch-speaking population represented by Dutch-language [[List of political parties in Belgium|political parties]], and the majority populations of Wallonia and Brussels, represented by their French-speaking parties. The Brussels region emerges as a third component.<ref>[[Charles Picqu\u00e9]], Minister-President of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] said in a September, 2008  declaration in [[Namur (city)|Namur]] at the National Walloon Feast : ''It is, besides, impossible to have a debate about the institutions of Belgium in which Brussels would be excluded.''  (French ''Il n'est d'ailleurs, pas question d'imaginer un d\u00e9bat institutionnel dont Bruxelles serait exclu.'' [http://www.actu24.be/article/regions/regionbruxelles/infosbxl/fetes_de_wallonie_picque_emu_par_linvitation_lancee_a_bruxelles/182803.aspx]) The [[Brussels-Capital Region]] has claimed and obtained a special place in the current negotiations about the reformation of the Belgian state. (French ''Pendant 18 ans, Bruxelles est demeur\u00e9e sans statut (...) L'absence de statut pour Bruxelles s'expliquait par la diff\u00e9rence de vision que partis flamands et partis francophones en avaient: [les partis flamands \u00e9taient] allergiques \u00e0 la notion de R\u00e9gion (...) les francophones (...) consid\u00e9raient que Bruxelles devait devenir une R\u00e9gion \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re (...)

With such issues, a final decision is possible only in the form of a compromise.

Instead of adopting a federal model, the UK has relied on gradual [[devolution]] to decentralise political power. Devolution in the UK began with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]] which granted [[home rule]] to Ireland as a constituent country of the former [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Following the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1921 which saw the creation of the sovereign [[Irish Free State]] (which eventually evolved into the modern day Republic of Ireland), Northern Ireland retained its devolved government through the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], the only part of the UK to have such a body at this time. This body was suspended in 1972 and Northern Ireland was governed by [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] during the period of conflict known as [[The Troubles]].\n\nIn modern times, a process of [[devolution in the United Kingdom]] has decentralised power once again. Since the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997 referendums in Scotland]] and [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum|Wales]] and the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in Northern Ireland, three of the four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries of the UK]] now have some level of autonomy.

[[Scottish nationalism|Scottish]] and [[Welsh nationalism]] have been increasing in popularity, and since the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] there has been a wider debate about the UK adopting a federal system with each of the four [[Home Nations|home nations]] having its own, equal devolved legislatures and law-making powers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Shirley|authorlink1=Shirley Williams|title=How Scotland could lead the way towards a federal UK|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/16/scotland-scottish-indpendence-referendum-federal-uk-england-wales|accessdate=20 September 2014|work=The Guardian|date=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nUK federal government was proposed as early as 1912 by the [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for Dundee]], [[Winston Churchill]], in the context of the legislation for Irish Home Rule.

Most European federalists want this development to continue within the [[European Union]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} European federalism originated in post-war Europe; one of the more important initiatives was [[Winston Churchill]]'s  speech in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/astonish.html|title=The Churchill Society London. Churchill's Speeches.|website=www.churchill-society-london.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[#United States|United States]], federalism originally referred to belief in a stronger central government.  When the U.S. Constitution was being drafted, the [[Federalist Party]] supported a stronger central government, while \"[[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]]\" wanted a weaker central government.  This is very different from the modern usage of \"federalism\" in Europe and the United States.  The distinction stems from the fact that \"federalism\" is situated in the middle of the political spectrum between a [[confederation|confederacy]] and a [[unitary state]].  The U.S. Constitution was written as a reaction to the [[Articles of Confederation]], under which the United States was a loose confederation with a weak central government.\n\nIn contrast, Europe has a greater history of unitary states than North America, thus European \"federalism\" argues for a weaker central government, relative to a unitary state.  The modern American usage of the word is much closer to the European sense.  As the power of the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] has increased, some people{{who|date=April 2019}} have perceived a much more unitary state than they believe the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] intended.  Most people politically advocating \"federalism\" in the United States argue in favor of limiting the powers of the federal government, especially the [[Courts of the United States|judiciary]] (see [[Federalist Society]], [[New Federalism]]).\n\nIn [[#Canada|Canada]], federalism typically implies opposition to [[Souverainism|sovereigntist]] movements (most commonly [[Quebec separatism]]).\n\nThe governments of Argentina, [[#Australia|Australia]], [[#Brazil|Brazil]], [[#India|India]], and [[#Mexico|Mexico]], among others, are also organized along federalist principles.\n\nFederalism may encompass as few as two or three internal divisions, as is the case in [[Administrative divisions of Belgium|Belgium]] or Bosnia and Herzegovina. In general, two extremes of federalism can be distinguished: at one extreme, the strong federal state is almost completely unitary, with few powers reserved for local governments; while at the other extreme, the national government may be a federal state in name only, being a [[confederation]] in actuality.\n\nIn 1999, the [[Government of Canada]] established the [[Forum of Federations]] as an international network for exchange of best practices among federal and federalizing countries. Headquartered in [[Ottawa]], the Forum of Federations partner governments include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and Switzerland.\n\n== Anarchism ==\n{{see also|Libertarian socialist decentralization}}\n[[Anarchists]] are against the state, but they are not against political organization or \"governance\", so long as it is self-governance utilizing [[direct democracy]]. The mode of political organization preferred by anarchists, in general, is federalism or [[confederalism]]. However, the anarchist definition of federalism tends to differ from the definition of federalism assumed by pro-state political scientists. The following is a brief description of federalism from section I.5 of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'':\n:\"The social and political structure of anarchy is similar to that of the economic structure, i.e., it is based on a voluntary federation of decentralized, directly democratic policy-making bodies. These are the neighborhood and community assemblies and their confederations. In these grassroots political units, the concept of \"self-management\" becomes that of \"self-government\", a form of municipal organisation in which people take back control of their living places from the bureaucratic state and the capitalist class whose interests it serves.\n:[...]\n:The key to that change, from the anarchist standpoint, is the creation of a network of participatory communities based on self-government through direct, face-to-face democracy in grassroots neighborhood and community assemblies [meetings for discussion, debate, and decision making].\n:[...]\n:Since not all issues are local, the neighborhood and community assemblies will also elect mandated and re-callable delegates to the larger-scale units of self-government in order to address issues affecting larger areas, such as urban districts, the city or town as a whole, the county, the [[bioregion|bio-region]], and ultimately the entire planet. Thus the assemblies will confederate at several levels in order to develop and co-ordinate common policies to deal with common problems.\n:[...]\n:This need for co-operation does not imply a centralized body. To exercise your autonomy by joining self-managing organisations and, therefore, agreeing to abide by the decisions you help make is not a denial of that autonomy (unlike joining a hierarchical structure, where you forsake autonomy within the organisation). In a centralized system, we must stress, power rests at the top and the role of those below is simply to obey (it matters not if those with the power are elected or not, the principle is the same). In a federal system, power is not delegated into the hands of a few (obviously a \"federal\" government or state is a centralized system). Decisions in a federal system are made at the base of the organisation and flow upwards so ensuring that power remains decentralized in the hands of all. Working together to solve common problems and organize common efforts to reach common goals is not centralization and those who confuse the two make a serious error -- they fail to understand the different relations of authority each generates and confuse obedience with co-operation.\"<ref>Anarchist Writers. \"I.5 What could the social structure of anarchy look like?\" An Anarchist FAQ. http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionI5 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629060032/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionI5 |date=2011-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n== Christian Church ==\n{{see also|Subsidiarity}}\nFederalism also finds expression in [[ecclesiology]] (the [[doctrine]] of the [[Christian Church|church]]). For example, [[presbyterian church governance]] resembles [[parliament]]ary [[republicanism]] (a form of ''political federalism'') to a large extent. In [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] denominations, the local church is ruled by elected [[Elder (religious)|elders]], some of which are [[minister of religion|ministerial]]. Each church then sends representatives or commissioners to [[Presbytery (presbyterian church)|presbyteries]] and further to a [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|general assembly]]. Each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members.  In this governmental structure, each component has some level of sovereignty over itself. As in ''political federalism'', in presbyterian ecclesiology there is shared sovereignty.\n\nOther ecclesiologies also have significant representational and federalistic components, including the more anarchic [[Congregationalist church governance|congregational ecclesiology]], and even in more hierarchical [[Episcopalian church governance|episcopal ecclesiology]].\n\nSome Christians argue that the earliest source of political federalism (or federalism in human institutions; in contrast to [[Covenant Theology|theological federalism]]) is the [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] federalism found in the [[Bible]].  They point to the structure of the early [[Christian Church]] as described (and prescribed, as believed by many) in the [[New Testament]].  In their arguments, this is particularly demonstrated in the [[Council of Jerusalem]], described in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] chapter 15, where the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] and [[Elder (religious)|elders]] gathered together to govern the Church; the Apostles being representatives of the universal Church, and elders being such for the local church.  To this day, elements of federalism can be found in almost every Christian denomination, some more than others.\n\n== Constitutional structure ==\n=== Division of powers ===\n{{distinguish|separation of powers}}\nIn a federation, the division of power between federal and regional governments is usually outlined in the [[constitution]]. Almost every country allows some degree of regional self-government, in federations the right to self-government of the component states is constitutionally entrenched. Component states often also possess their own constitutions which they may amend as they see fit, although in the event of conflict the federal constitution usually takes precedence.\n\nIn almost all federations the central government enjoys the powers of foreign policy and national defense as [[exclusive federal powers]]. Were this not the case a federation would not be a single sovereign state, per the UN definition. Notably, the [[states of Germany]] retain the right to act on their own behalf at an international level, a condition originally granted in exchange for the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]'s agreement to join the [[German Empire]] in 1871. Beyond this the precise division of power varies from one nation to another. The constitutions of [[Grundgesetz|Germany]] and the [[United States Constitution|United States]] provide that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the states. The Constitution of some countries like [[Constitution of Canada|Canada]] and [[Constitution of India|India]], state that powers not explicitly granted to the provincial governments are retained by the federal government. Much like the US system, the Australian Constitution allocates to the Federal government (the Commonwealth of Australia) the power to make laws about certain specified matters which were considered too difficult for the States to manage, so that the States retain all other areas of responsibility.  Under the division of powers of the European Union in the Lisbon Treaty, powers which are not either exclusively of European competence or shared between EU and state as [[concurrent powers]] are retained by the constituent states.\n\n[[File:La esp Rep. Federal, Rep. Unitaria (2).JPG|thumb|Satiric depiction of late 19th century political tensions in Spain]]\nWhere every component state of a federation possesses the same powers, we are said to find 'symmetric federalism'. [[Asymmetric federalism]] exists where states are granted different powers, or some possess greater autonomy than others do. This is often done in recognition of the existence of a distinct culture in a particular region or regions. In Spain, the [[History of the Basque people#Late Modern history|Basques]] and [[Catalan people|Catalans]], as well as the Galicians, spearheaded a historic movement to have their national specificity recognized, crystallizing in the \"historical communities\" such as [[Navarre]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Catalonia]], and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. They have more powers than the later expanded arrangement for other Spanish regions, or [[Autonomous communities of Spain|the Spain of the autonomous communities]] (called also the \"coffee for everyone\" arrangement), partly to deal with their separate identity and to appease peripheral nationalist leanings, partly out of respect to [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|specific rights they had held]] earlier in history. However, strictly speaking Spain is not a federation, but a decentralized administrative organization of states.\n\nIt is common that during the historical evolution of a federation there is a gradual movement of power from the component states to the centre, as the federal government acquires additional powers, sometimes to deal with unforeseen circumstances. The acquisition of new powers by a federal government may occur through formal constitutional amendment or simply through a broadening of the interpretation of a government's existing constitutional powers given by the courts.\n\nUsually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (''munic\u00edpios'') with their own legislative council (''c\u00e2mara de vereadores'') and a mayor (''prefeito''), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a \"little constitution\", called \"organic law\" (''lei org\u00e2nica''). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (''municipio libre'', \"free municipality\") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the [[political divisions of Mexico|constituent states]]. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.\n\nFederations often employ the [[paradox]] of being a union of states, while still being states (or having aspects of [[Sovereign state|statehood]]) in themselves. For example, James Madison (author of the [[United States constitution|US Constitution]]) wrote in [[Federalist No. 39|Federalist Paper No. 39]] that the US Constitution \"is in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both. In its foundation, it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the Government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national...\" This stems from the fact that states in the US maintain all [[sovereignty]] that they do not yield to the federation by their own consent. This was reaffirmed by the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which reserves all powers and rights that are not delegated to the Federal Government as left to the States and to the people.\n\n=== Bicameralism ===\nThe structures of most federal governments incorporate mechanisms to protect the rights of component states. One method, known as '[[intrastate federalism]]', is to directly represent the governments of component states in federal political institutions. Where a federation has a [[bicameral]] legislature the [[upper house]] is often used to represent the component states while the [[lower house]] represents the people of the nation as a whole. A federal upper house may be based on a special scheme of [[apportionment (politics)|apportionment]], as is the case in the [[senate]]s of the United States and Australia, where each state is represented by an equal number of senators irrespective of the size of its population.\n\nAlternatively, or in addition to this practice, the members of an upper house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component states, as occurred in the United States prior to 1913, or be actual members or delegates of the state governments, as, for example, is the case in the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|German Bundesrat]] and in the [[Council of the European Union]]. The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected, with apportionment in proportion to population, although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats.\n\n=== Intergovernmental relations ===\nIn Canada, the provincial governments represent regional interests and negotiate directly with the central government. A [[First Ministers conference]] of the prime minister and the provincial premiers is the ''[[de facto]]'' highest political forum in the land, although it is not mentioned in the constitution.\n\n=== Constitutional change ===\nFederations often have special procedures for amendment of the federal constitution. As well as reflecting the federal structure of the state this may guarantee that the self-governing status of the component states cannot be abolished without their consent. An amendment to the constitution of the United States must be ratified by three-quarters of either the state legislatures, or of constitutional conventions specially elected in each of the states, before it can come into effect. In referendums to amend the constitutions of Australia and Switzerland it is required that a proposal be endorsed not just by an overall majority of the electorate in the nation as a whole, but also by separate majorities in each of a majority of the states or cantons. In Australia, this latter requirement is known as a ''double majority''.\n\nSome federal constitutions also provide that certain constitutional amendments cannot occur without the unanimous consent of all states or of a particular state. The US constitution provides that no state may be deprived of equal representation in the senate without its consent. In Australia, if a proposed amendment will specifically impact one or more states, then it must be endorsed in the referendum held in each of those states.  Any amendment to the Canadian constitution that would modify the role of the [[Monarchy in Canada|monarchy]] would require unanimous consent of the provinces.  The [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] provides that no amendment is admissible at all that would abolish the federal system.\n\n=== Other technical terms ===\n* [[Fiscal federalism]] \u2013 the relative financial positions and the financial relations between the levels of government in a federal system.\n* Formal federalism (or '[[constitutional federalism]]') \u2013 the delineation of powers is specified in a written constitution, which may or may not correspond to the actual operation of the system in practice.\n* [[Executive federalism]] refers in the English-speaking tradition to the intergovernmental relationships between the executive branches of the levels of government in a federal system and in the continental European tradition to the way constituent units 'execute' or administer laws made centrally.\n* [[Gleichschaltung]] - the conversion from a federal governance to either a completely unitary or more unitary one, the term was borrowed from the German for conversion from [[Alternating current|alternating]] to [[direct current]].<ref>Page 72 of {{cite book | last=Koonz | first=Claudia | title=The Nazi Conscience | location=Cambridge, MA | publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-674-01172-4 | ref=harv | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/naziconscience00koon }}</ref> During the Nazi era the [[States of the Weimar Republic|traditional German states]] were mostly left intact in the formal sense, but their constitutional rights and sovereignty were eroded and ultimately ended and replaced with the [[Gau (territory)#Nazi period|Gau system]].

Similarly, in European Union politics, federalists mostly seek greater EU integration. In contrast, in Spain and in post-war Germany, federal movements have sought decentralisation: the transfer of power from central authorities to local units. In Canada, where Quebec separatism has been a political force for several decades, the \"federalist\" impulse aims to keep Quebec inside Canada.\n\n== Conflict reducing device ==\nFederalism, and other forms of territorial autonomy, is generally seen{{By whom|date=April 2019}} as a useful way to structure political systems in order to prevent violence among different groups within countries because it allows certain groups to legislate at the subnational level.<ref>Arend Lijphart. 1977.

Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism by the [[United States]] under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of 1787]], is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established.<ref>In 1946, scholar Kenneth Wheare observed that the two levels of government in the US were 'co-equally supreme'. In this he echoed the perspective of the founding fathers, James Madison in ''Federalist 39'' having seen the several states as forming 'distinct and independent portions of the supremacy' in relation to the general government.

Some also today characterize the [[European Union]] as the pioneering example of federalism in a multi-state setting, in a concept termed the federal union of states.<ref>See Law, John (2013), p. 104. http://www.on-federalism.eu/attachments/169_download.pdf<br />\nThis author identifies two distinct federal forms, where before only one was known, based upon whether [[sovereignty]] (conceived in its core meaning of ultimate authority) resides in the whole (in one people) or in the parts (in many peoples). This is determined by the absence or presence of a right of secession for the parts. The structures are termed, respectively, the federal state (or federation) and the federal union of states (or federal union).</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:The pathway of regional integration or separation.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|The pathway of regional integration or separation]]\nThe terms 'federalism' and 'confederalism' both have a root in the Latin word ''foedus'', meaning \"treaty, pact or [[wikt:covenant|covenant]].\" Their common meaning until the late eighteenth century was a simple league or inter-governmental relationship among sovereign states based upon a treaty. They were therefore initially synonyms. It was in this sense that James Madison in ''Federalist 39'' had referred to the new US Constitution as 'neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both' (i.e. neither constituting a single large unitary state nor a league/confederation among several small states, but a hybrid of the two).<ref>Madison, James, Hamilton, Alexander and Jay, John (1987) ''The Federalist Papers'', Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 259.</ref> In the course of the nineteenth century the meaning of federalism would come to shift, strengthening to refer uniquely to the novel compound political form established, while the meaning of confederalism would remain at a league of states.<ref>Law, John (2012) 'Sense on Federalism', in ''Political Quarterly'', Vol. 83, No. 3, p. 544.</ref> Thus, this article relates to the modern usage of the word 'federalism'.\n\n[[File:Map of unitary and federal states.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|\n{{legend|#00e000;|[[Federal state]]s}}\n{{legend|#0000b0;|[[Unitary state]]s}}]]\nModern federalism is a system based upon [[democracy|democratic]] rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments. The term ''[[federalist]]'' describes several political beliefs around the world depending on context.\n\nFederalism is sometimes viewed as in the context of international negotiation as \"the best system for integrating diverse nations, ethnic groups, or combatant parties, all of whom may have cause to fear control by an overly powerful center.\"<ref name=\"Meyer-Resende\">Michael Meyer-Resende, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/18/why-talk-of-federalism-wont-help-peace-in-syria-assad/ Why Talk of Federalism Won't Help Peace in Syria], ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' (March 18, 2017).</ref> However, in some countries, those skeptical of federal prescriptions believe that increased regional autonomy is likely to lead to secession or dissolution of the nation.<ref name=\"Meyer-Resende\"/> In Syria, federalization proposals have failed in part because \"Syrians fear that these borders could turn out to be the same as the ones that the fighting parties have currently carved out.\"<ref name=\"Meyer-Resende\"/>\n\nFederations such as [[Yugoslavia]] or [[Czechoslovakia]] collapsed as soon as it was possible to put the model to the test.<ref>'The Federal Experience in Yugoslavia', Mihailo Markovic, page 75; included in 'Rethinking Federalism: Citizens, Markets, and Governments in a changing world', edited by Karen Knop, Sylvia Ostry, Richard Simeon, Katherine Swinton|Google books</ref>\n\n=== Early origins ===\nAn early historical example of federalism is the [[Achaean League]] in [[Hellenistic Greece]]. Unlike the [[Greek city states]] of [[Classical Greece]], each of which insisted on keeping its complete independence, changing conditions in the Hellenistic period drove many city states to band together even at the cost of losing part of their sovereignty - similar to the process leading to the formation of later federations.\n\n=== Explanations for adoption ===\nAccording to Daniel Ziblatt's ''Structuring the State'', there are four competing theoretical explanations in the academic literature for the adoption of federal systems:\n# Ideational theories, which hold that a greater degree of ideological commitment to decentralist ideas in society makes federalism more likely to be adopted.\n# Cultural-historical theories, which hold that federal institutions are more likely to be adopted in societies with culturally or ethnically fragmented populations.\n# \"Social contract\" theories, which hold that federalism emerges as a bargain between a center and a periphery where the center is not powerful enough to dominate the periphery and the periphery is not powerful enough to secede from the center.\n# \"Infrastructural power\" theories, which hold that federalism is likely to emerge when the subunits of a potential federation already have highly developed infrastructures (e.g. they are already constitutional, parliamentary, and administratively modernized states).<ref>{{Cite book|author=Daniel Ziblatt|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8201.html|title=Structuring the State: The Formation of Italy and Germany and the Puzzle of Federalism|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|date=2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Immanuel Kant ===\n[[Immanuel Kant]] was an advocate of federalism, noting that \"the problem of setting up a state can be solved even by a nation of devils\" so long as they possess an appropriate constitution which pits opposing factions against each other with a system of [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]]. In particular individual states required a federation as a safeguard against the possibility of war.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v7v3CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT79&lpg=PT79&dq=%22the+problem+of+setting+up+a+state+can+be+solved+even+by+a+nation+of+devils%22&source=bl&ots=D7n6bl_eln&sig=ACfU3U0RbgJrfdftxb6-FTwpXXBVAeMIxw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnwJOu_LbgAhUo7IMKHYiJCYYQ6AEwBXoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22the%20problem%20of%20setting%20up%20a%20state%20can%20be%20solved%20even%20by%20a%20nation%20of%20devils%22&f=false Kant: Political Writings], H.S.

The [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]] was colonised by the United Kingdom in 1788, which subsequently established six, eventually self-governing, colonies there. In the 1890s the governments of these colonies all held [[referendums]] on becoming the unified, self-governing \"Commonwealth of Australia\" within the British Empire. When all the colonies voted in favour of federation, the [[Federation of Australia]] commenced, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The model of Australian federalism adheres closely to the original model of the United States of America, although it does so through a parliamentary [[Westminster system]] rather than a presidential system.\n\n=== Brazil ===\n{{see also|States of Brazil}}\n[[File:Brazil Political Map.svg|thumb|left|Brazil is a union of 26 [[States of Brazil|states]] and its [[Federal District (Brazil)|federal district]] which is the site of [[Bras\u00edlia]], the federal capital]]\nIn Brazil, the [[Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil|fall of the monarchy in 1889]] by a military ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' led to the rise of the [[presidential system]], headed by [[Deodoro da Fonseca]]. Aided by well-known jurist [[Ruy Barbosa]], Fonseca established federalism in Brazil by decree, but this system of government would be confirmed by every [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian constitution]] since 1891, although some of them would distort some of the federalist principles. The 1937 federal government had the authority to appoint State Governors (called [[Federal intervention|intervenors]]) at will, thus centralizing power in the hands of President [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]. Brazil also uses the Fonseca system to regulate interstate trade. Brazil is one of the biggest federal governments.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution of 1988]] introduced a new component to the ideas of federalism, including [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]] as federal entities. Brazilian municipalities are now invested with some of the traditional powers usually granted to states in federalism, and they are allowed to adopt a constitution.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{main|Canadian federalism}}\n[[File:Political map of Canada.png|thumb|upright=1.1|In Canada, the provincial governments derive all their powers directly from the [[Constitution of Canada|constitution]]. In contrast, the [[Territories of Canada|territories]] are subordinate to the federal government and are delegated powers by it.]]\nIn Canada the system of federalism is described by the division of powers between the [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]] and the country's [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] governments.  Under the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|Constitution Act]]'' (previously known as the ''[[British North America Act of 1867]]''), specific powers of legislation are allotted.  Section 91 of the constitution gives rise to federal authority for legislation, whereas section 92 gives rise to provincial powers.\n\nFor matters not directly dealt with in the constitution, the federal government retains residual powers; however, conflicts between the two levels of government, relating to which level has legislative jurisdiction over various matters, have been a longstanding and evolving issue.

The United States had a similar system until 1913, where prior to the 17th Amendment, Senators were delegates of the state elected by the state legislatures rather than the citizens.\n\nAlready the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the [[German Confederation]], the [[North German Confederation]], the [[German Empire]] and the [[Weimar Republic]] were federal complexes of territories of different political structures. Modern Germany abandoned federalism only during [[Nazi Germany|Nazism]] (1933\u20131945, only de facto but not de jure) and in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (1952\u20131990). [[Adolf Hitler]] viewed federalism as an obstacle to his goals. As he wrote in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', \"[[Nazism|National Socialism]] must claim the right to impose its principles on the whole German nation, without regard to what were hitherto the confines of federal states.\"{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nAccordingly, the idea of a strong, centralized government has very negative connotations in German politics, although the progressive political movements in Germany (Liberals, Social Democrats) were advocating at the time of the Second German Empire (1871-1918) to abolish (or to reshape) the majority of German federated states of that era, as they were considered to be mostly monarchist remnances of the feudal structures of the Middle Ages.<ref>Bernt Engelmann, Einig gegen Recht und Freiheit, p7ff, publ. Goldmann, Munich 1975</ref>\n\n=== India ===\n{{main|Federalism in India}}\n[[File:India-map-en.svg|thumb|left|A map showing India's 29 states and 7 Union territories including the National Capital Territory of Delhi]]\nThe [[Government of India]] (referred to as the ''Union Government'') was established by the [[Constitution of India]], and is the governing authority of a ''federal union'' of [[States and territories of India|28 states and 8 union territories]].\n\nThe government of India is based on a 3 tiered system, in which the [[Constitution of India]] delineates the subjects on which each tier of government has executive powers.  The Constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government, the Union Government (also known as the Central Government), representing the Union of India, and the [[State governments of India|State governments]]. Later, a third tier was added in the form of [[Panchayati raj (India)|Panchayats]] and [[Municipal governance in India|Municipalities]]. In the current arrangement, The [[Constitution of India#Schedules|Seventh Schedule]] of the Indian Constitution delimits the subjects of each level of governmental jurisdiction, dividing them into three lists:\n* [[Union List]] includes subjects of national importance such as defence of the country, foreign affairs, banking, communications and currency. The Union Government alone can make laws relating to the  subjects mentioned in the Union List. This list is about portfolios concerning the country as one ore inter state transaction\n* [[State List]] contains subjects of State and local importance such as police, trade, commerce, agriculture and irrigation. The State Governments alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the State List.\n* [[Concurrent List]] includes subjects of common interest to both the Union Government as well as the State Governments, such as education, forest, trade unions, marriage, adoption and succession. Both the Union as well as the State Governments can make laws on the subjects mentioned in this list. If their laws conflict with each other, the law made by the Union Government will prevail.\n\n==== Asymmetric federalism ====\nA distinguishing aspect of Indian federalism is that unlike many other forms of federalism, it is asymmetric and gives limited [[autonomy]] to only some [[Indian states]].<ref name=\"NCERT\">{{cite book | url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/NCERTS/textbook/textbook.htm?keps2=10-10 | title=Indian Constitution at Work | publisher=[[National Council of Educational Research and Training|NCERT]] | pages=232, 233}}</ref> [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India]] made special provisions for the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as per its [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]] but it was [[Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir|revoked]] in 2019. Article 371 makes special provisions for the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Assam]], [[Goa]], [[Gujarat]], [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Manipur]], [[Mizoram]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Sikkim]] as per their accession or state-hood deals. Also one more aspect of Indian federalism is system of [[President's Rule]] in which the central government (through its appointed Governor) takes control of state's administration for certain months when no party can form a government in the state or there is violent disturbance in the state.\n\n==== Coalition politics ====\nAlthough the constitution does not say so, India is now a multilingual federation.<ref name=\"NCERT\"/> India has a multi-party system, with political allegiances frequently based on linguistic, regional and caste identities,<ref>Johnson, A \"Federalism: The Indian Experience \", HSRC Press,1996, Pg 3, ISBN</ref> necessitating coalition politics, especially at the [[Government of India|Union]] level. India has generally two main groups known as the NDA and the UPA and the third group known as the Left Front.\n\n=== Malaysia ===\n[[File:Malaysia states named.png|thumb|left|300px|Map of Malaysia with its states]]\n[[Malaysia]] is a [[federal monarchy|federal]] [[constitutional monarchy]]. Its monarchy is elective with the nine rulers and four state leaders (representing states with its sultanates abolished) meet at the [[Conference of Rulers]] to elect the next monarch every five years, or if the position becomes vacant for any reason. There is also a custom of rotation of the monarchy between the nine rulers. A legacy of British colonial rule, the federation's system of government is modelled closely on the [[Westminster parliamentary system]]. There exists a [[lower house|lower]] and [[upper house]]. Governance of the states is divided between the [[Government of Malaysia|federal]] and the [[state governments of Malaysia|state government]]s, with different powers reserved for each, and the federal government has direct administration of the federal territories. Legislative powers are divided between state and federal assemblies, with elections being held every five years.\n\nBefore British rule, Malaysia as it is today, was composed of separate sultanates and states. The [[Federated Malay States]] was the first instance of federalism being introduced in the Malay Peninsula. [[Penang]] was ruled as part of the [[Straits Settlements]] along with [[Malacca]]. In Borneo, [[British North Borneo]] joined the federation as the state of [[Sabah]] along with a briefly independent [[Raj of Sarawak]] as the state of [[Sarawak]]. [[Singapore in Malaysia|Singapore]] became independent after being ejected from the federation, due to differences between the central government and the [[People's Action Party]], which still rules Singapore till today.\n\n=== Ethiopia ===\n\nEthiopia has over 80 ethno-linguistic groups and the new Constitution which was introduced in 1994, dividing Ethiopia on ethnic lines into nine regional states and two multiethnic \"chartered administrations\" (Addis Ababa and Diredawa).[10][14]:54-55 Ethnic groups received rights to self-government:[8] the states were given autonomy in legislative, executive and judicial functions,[15]:8 while there were provisions for ethnic groups to be represented in central institutions. Ethnic groups were granted the \"unconditional right\" to secession,[14]:55 although it is doubtful whether any group could in fact achieve this.[16][15]:22 The government was aiming not only to reduce inter-ethnic conflict but to equalise living standards in different areas and improve the working of public institutions locally.\n\n=== Nigeria ===\n{{main|Federalism in Nigeria}}\n[[File:Nigeria states.png|thumb|upright=1.1|A map of the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]], showing its [[States of Nigeria|36 states and 1 Federal Capital Territory]]]]\nThe [[Nigeria|Federal Republic of Nigeria]] has various states which have [[States of Nigeria#Evolution of Nigerian states|evolved over time]] due to complex [[socioeconomic]] issues as well as the effect of their [[Colonial Nigeria|colonial era]].

It is where the functions, responsibilities and authorities of districts government is divided into more smaller units, these units are known as \"Tehsil\".

The head of the Tehsil government is \"Tehsil Nazim\" who is assisted by the tehsil Naib-Nazim.

Despite the delocalisation enjoyed within the republic, the federal principle is not evident enough and it failed Wheare\u2019s very simple federal test right in the beginning}}</ref>\n\n=== Russian Federation ===\n{{main|Russian federalism}}\n[[File:Map of federal subjects of Russia (2014).svg|thumb|left|upright=1.45|Federal subjects of Russia]]\nThe post-Imperial nature of Russian subdivision of government changed towards a generally autonomous model which began with the establishment of the [[USSR]] (of which Russia was governed as part). It was liberalized in the [[Post-Soviet Russia|aftermath of the Soviet Union]], with the reforms under [[Boris Yeltsin]] preserving much of the Soviet structure while applying increasingly liberal reforms to the governance of the constituent republics and subjects (while also coming into conflict with Chechen secessionist rebels during the [[First Chechen War|Chechen War]]). Some of the reforms under Yeltsin were scaled back by [[Vladimir Putin]].\n\nAll of Russia's subdivisional entities are known as subjects, with some smaller entities, such as the republics enjoying more autonomy than other subjects on account of having an extant presence of a culturally non-Russian ethnic minority or, in some cases, majority.\n\nCurrently, there are 85 federal subjects of Russia.\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\n[[File:UAE Regions map.png|thumb|Map of the United Arab Emirates]]\nThe [[UAE]] is a [[federal monarchy|federal]] [[absolute monarchy]] of [[Royal families of the United Arab Emirates|the six ruling families of the United Arab Emirates]] with [[Emir]] of each Emirate being an absolute monarch and the Emir of [[Abu Dhabi]] being also the [[President of the UAE]].\n\n=== United States of America ===\n{{main|Federalism in the United States}}\nFederalism in the United States is the evolving relationship between [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] and the [[federal government of the United States]]. American government has evolved from a system of dual federalism to one of associative federalism. In \"[[Federalist No. 46]],\" James Madison asserted that the states and national government \"are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people, constituted with different powers.\" [[Alexander Hamilton]], writing in \"[[Federalist No. 28]],\" suggested that both levels of government would exercise authority to the citizens' benefit: \"If their [the peoples'] rights are invaded by either, they can make use of the other as the instrument of redress.\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100502142849/http://www.learner.org/courses/democracyinamerica/dia_3/dia_3_topic.html 1])\n[[File:Map of USA with state names.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The United States is composed of fifty self-governing states and several territories.]]\n\nBecause the states were pre existing political entities, the U.S. Constitution did not need to define or explain federalism in any one section but it often mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments and state officials in relation to  the federal government. The federal government has certain ''express powers'' (also called ''[[enumerated powers]]'') which are powers spelled out in the Constitution, including the right to levy taxes, declare war, and regulate interstate and foreign commerce. In addition, the ''[[Necessary and Proper Clause]]'' gives the federal government the ''implied power'' to pass any law \"necessary and proper\" for the execution of its express powers. Other powers\u2014the ''[[reserved powers]]''\u2014are reserved to the people or the states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/constitution/supreme.htm|title=THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA With Explanatory Notes|access-date=|publisher=U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International Information Programs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316033029/https://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/constitution/supreme.htm|archive-date=2008-03-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> The power delegated to the federal government was significantly expanded by the Supreme Court decision in [[McCulloch v. Maryland]] (1819), amendments to the Constitution following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and by some later amendments\u2014as well as the overall claim of the Civil War, that the states were legally subject to the final dictates of the federal government.\n\nThe [[Federalist Party]] of the United States was opposed by the [[Democratic-Republicans]], including powerful figures such as [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The Democratic-Republicans mainly believed that: the Legislature had too much power (mainly because of the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]]) and that they were unchecked; the Executive had too much power, and that there was no check on the executive; a dictator would arise; and that a bill of rights should be coupled with the constitution to prevent a potential dictator from exploiting or tyrannizing citizens. The federalists said that it was impossible to list all the rights, and those that were not listed could be easily overlooked because they were not in the official bill of rights. Rather, rights in specific cases were to be decided by the judicial system of courts.\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], the federal government increased greatly in influence on everyday life and in size relative to the state governments. Reasons included the need to regulate businesses and industries that span state borders, attempts to secure civil rights, and the provision of social services.  The federal government acquired no substantial new powers until the acceptance by the Supreme Court of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].\n\nFrom 1938 until 1995, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] did not invalidate any federal statute as exceeding Congress' power under the [[Commerce Clause]]. Most actions by the federal government can find some legal support among the express powers, such as the [[Commerce Clause]], whose applicability has been narrowed by the Supreme Court in recent years. In 1995, the Supreme Court rejected the [[Gun-Free School Zones Act]] in the Lopez decision, and also rejected the civil remedy portion of the [[Violence Against Women Act of 1994]] in the ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' decision. Recently, the Commerce Clause was interpreted to include marijuana laws in the ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' decision.\n\n[[Dual federalism]] holds that the federal government and the state governments are co-equals, each sovereign.\n\nHowever, since the Civil War Era, the national courts often interpret the federal government as the final judge of its own powers under dual federalism. The establishment of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] governments (which are [[Indian country|separate and distinct]] from state and federal government) exercising limited powers of [[Tribal sovereignty|sovereignty]], has given rise to the concept of \"bi-federalism.\"\n\n=== Venezuela ===\n[[File:Localizador Politico de Venezuela.svg|thumb|Map of the Venezuelan federation]]\nThe [[Federal War]] ended in 1863 with the signing of the Treaty of Coche by both the centralist government of the time and the Federal Forces.  The [[United States of Venezuela]] were subsequently incorporated under a \"Federation of Sovereign States\" upon principles borrowed from the [[Articles of Confederation]] of the United States of America. In this Federation, each State had a \"President\" of its own that controlled almost every issue, even the creation of \"State Armies,\" while the Federal Army was required to obtain presidential permission to enter any given state.\n\nHowever, more than 140 years later, the original system has gradually evolved into a quasi-centralist form of government. While the [[Constitution of Venezuela|1999 Constitution]] still defines Venezuela as a Federal Republic, it abolished the Senate, transferred competences of the States to the Federal Government and granted the President of the Republic vast powers to intervene in the States and Municipalities.\n\n=== With two components ===\n==== Belgium ====\n{{importance section|date=September 2009}}\n{{main|Belgian federal government|Belgian federal parliament|Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium}}\nFederalism in the Kingdom of Belgium is an evolving system.\n\nBelgian federalism is a twin system which reflects both the\n* [[Languages of Belgium|linguistic ''communities'']] of the country, [[French Community of Belgium|French]] (ca. 40% of the total population), [[Flemish Community|Dutch]] (ca. 59%), and to a much lesser extent [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German]] (ca. 1%) and the\n* geographically defined Regions (federated States: [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels-Capital]] (de facto Greater Brussels), [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]]). The last two correspond to [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|the language areas in Belgium]], Wallonia hosting both the bulk of the French-speaking population and the German-speaking minority. In Brussels, ca. 80% of the population speaks French and ca. 20% Dutch with the city being an enclave of the Flemish region and officially a bilingual area.<ref>{{in lang|nl}}[http://www.brusselsstudies.be/PDF/NL_51_BruS13NL.pdf \u201dTaalgebruik in Brussel en de plaats van het Nederlands.

French is the second most spoken mother tongue of Belgium, after Dutch. Within the French-speaking Community of Belgium, there is a geographical and political distinction between Wallonia and Brussels for historical and sociological reasons. Historically, the Walloons were for a federalism with three components and the Flemings for two.<ref>See: Witte, Els & Craeybeckx, Jan. Politieke geschiedenis van Belgi\u00eb. Antwerpen, SWU, pp. 455, 459-460.</ref> This difference is one of the elements which makes the Belgian issue so complicated. The Flemings wanted to defend their culture while the Walloons wanted to defend their political and economical supremacy they had in the 19th century: ''It is true that the Walloon movement, which has never stopped affirming that Wallonia is part of the French cultural area, has never made this cultural struggle a priority, being more concerned to struggle against its status as a political minority and the economic decline which was only a corollary to it''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallonie-en-ligne.net/Wallonie_Politique/1995_Destatte_Philippe_Wallonia-Identity.htm|title= Wallonia today - The search for an identity without nationalist mania - (1995)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn one hand, this means that the [[Politics in Belgium|Belgian political landscape]], generally speaking, consists of only two components: the Dutch-speaking population represented by Dutch-language [[List of political parties in Belgium|political parties]], and the majority populations of Wallonia and Brussels, represented by their French-speaking parties. The Brussels region emerges as a third component.<ref>[[Charles Picqu\u00e9]], Minister-President of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] said in a September, 2008  declaration in [[Namur (city)|Namur]] at the National Walloon Feast : ''It is, besides, impossible to have a debate about the institutions of Belgium in which Brussels would be excluded.''  (French ''Il n'est d'ailleurs, pas question d'imaginer un d\u00e9bat institutionnel dont Bruxelles serait exclu.'' [http://www.actu24.be/article/regions/regionbruxelles/infosbxl/fetes_de_wallonie_picque_emu_par_linvitation_lancee_a_bruxelles/182803.aspx]) The [[Brussels-Capital Region]] has claimed and obtained a special place in the current negotiations about the reformation of the Belgian state. (French ''Pendant 18 ans, Bruxelles est demeur\u00e9e sans statut (...) L'absence de statut pour Bruxelles s'expliquait par la diff\u00e9rence de vision que partis flamands et partis francophones en avaient: [les partis flamands \u00e9taient] allergiques \u00e0 la notion de R\u00e9gion (...) les francophones (...) consid\u00e9raient que Bruxelles devait devenir une R\u00e9gion \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re (...)

With such issues, a final decision is possible only in the form of a compromise.

Instead of adopting a federal model, the UK has relied on gradual [[devolution]] to decentralise political power. Devolution in the UK began with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]] which granted [[home rule]] to Ireland as a constituent country of the former [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Following the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1921 which saw the creation of the sovereign [[Irish Free State]] (which eventually evolved into the modern day Republic of Ireland), Northern Ireland retained its devolved government through the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], the only part of the UK to have such a body at this time. This body was suspended in 1972 and Northern Ireland was governed by [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] during the period of conflict known as [[The Troubles]].\n\nIn modern times, a process of [[devolution in the United Kingdom]] has decentralised power once again. Since the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997 referendums in Scotland]] and [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum|Wales]] and the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in Northern Ireland, three of the four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries of the UK]] now have some level of autonomy.

[[Scottish nationalism|Scottish]] and [[Welsh nationalism]] have been increasing in popularity, and since the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] there has been a wider debate about the UK adopting a federal system with each of the four [[Home Nations|home nations]] having its own, equal devolved legislatures and law-making powers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Shirley|authorlink1=Shirley Williams|title=How Scotland could lead the way towards a federal UK|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/16/scotland-scottish-indpendence-referendum-federal-uk-england-wales|accessdate=20 September 2014|work=The Guardian|date=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nUK federal government was proposed as early as 1912 by the [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for Dundee]], [[Winston Churchill]], in the context of the legislation for Irish Home Rule.

Most European federalists want this development to continue within the [[European Union]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} European federalism originated in post-war Europe; one of the more important initiatives was [[Winston Churchill]]'s  speech in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/astonish.html|title=The Churchill Society London. Churchill's Speeches.|website=www.churchill-society-london.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[#United States|United States]], federalism originally referred to belief in a stronger central government.  When the U.S. Constitution was being drafted, the [[Federalist Party]] supported a stronger central government, while \"[[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]]\" wanted a weaker central government.  This is very different from the modern usage of \"federalism\" in Europe and the United States.  The distinction stems from the fact that \"federalism\" is situated in the middle of the political spectrum between a [[confederation|confederacy]] and a [[unitary state]].  The U.S. Constitution was written as a reaction to the [[Articles of Confederation]], under which the United States was a loose confederation with a weak central government.\n\nIn contrast, Europe has a greater history of unitary states than North America, thus European \"federalism\" argues for a weaker central government, relative to a unitary state.  The modern American usage of the word is much closer to the European sense.  As the power of the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] has increased, some people{{who|date=April 2019}} have perceived a much more unitary state than they believe the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] intended.  Most people politically advocating \"federalism\" in the United States argue in favor of limiting the powers of the federal government, especially the [[Courts of the United States|judiciary]] (see [[Federalist Society]], [[New Federalism]]).\n\nIn [[#Canada|Canada]], federalism typically implies opposition to [[Souverainism|sovereigntist]] movements (most commonly [[Quebec separatism]]).\n\nThe governments of Argentina, [[#Australia|Australia]], [[#Brazil|Brazil]], [[#India|India]], and [[#Mexico|Mexico]], among others, are also organized along federalist principles.\n\nFederalism may encompass as few as two or three internal divisions, as is the case in [[Administrative divisions of Belgium|Belgium]] or Bosnia and Herzegovina. In general, two extremes of federalism can be distinguished: at one extreme, the strong federal state is almost completely unitary, with few powers reserved for local governments; while at the other extreme, the national government may be a federal state in name only, being a [[confederation]] in actuality.\n\nIn 1999, the [[Government of Canada]] established the [[Forum of Federations]] as an international network for exchange of best practices among federal and federalizing countries. Headquartered in [[Ottawa]], the Forum of Federations partner governments include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and Switzerland.\n\n== Anarchism ==\n{{see also|Libertarian socialist decentralization}}\n[[Anarchists]] are against the state, but they are not against political organization or \"governance\", so long as it is self-governance utilizing [[direct democracy]]. The mode of political organization preferred by anarchists, in general, is federalism or [[confederalism]]. However, the anarchist definition of federalism tends to differ from the definition of federalism assumed by pro-state political scientists. The following is a brief description of federalism from section I.5 of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'':\n:\"The social and political structure of anarchy is similar to that of the economic structure, i.e., it is based on a voluntary federation of decentralized, directly democratic policy-making bodies. These are the neighborhood and community assemblies and their confederations. In these grassroots political units, the concept of \"self-management\" becomes that of \"self-government\", a form of municipal organisation in which people take back control of their living places from the bureaucratic state and the capitalist class whose interests it serves.\n:[...]\n:The key to that change, from the anarchist standpoint, is the creation of a network of participatory communities based on self-government through direct, face-to-face democracy in grassroots neighborhood and community assemblies [meetings for discussion, debate, and decision making].\n:[...]\n:Since not all issues are local, the neighborhood and community assemblies will also elect mandated and re-callable delegates to the larger-scale units of self-government in order to address issues affecting larger areas, such as urban districts, the city or town as a whole, the county, the [[bioregion|bio-region]], and ultimately the entire planet. Thus the assemblies will confederate at several levels in order to develop and co-ordinate common policies to deal with common problems.\n:[...]\n:This need for co-operation does not imply a centralized body. To exercise your autonomy by joining self-managing organisations and, therefore, agreeing to abide by the decisions you help make is not a denial of that autonomy (unlike joining a hierarchical structure, where you forsake autonomy within the organisation). In a centralized system, we must stress, power rests at the top and the role of those below is simply to obey (it matters not if those with the power are elected or not, the principle is the same). In a federal system, power is not delegated into the hands of a few (obviously a \"federal\" government or state is a centralized system). Decisions in a federal system are made at the base of the organisation and flow upwards so ensuring that power remains decentralized in the hands of all. Working together to solve common problems and organize common efforts to reach common goals is not centralization and those who confuse the two make a serious error -- they fail to understand the different relations of authority each generates and confuse obedience with co-operation.\"<ref>Anarchist Writers. \"I.5 What could the social structure of anarchy look like?\" An Anarchist FAQ. http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionI5 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629060032/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionI5 |date=2011-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n== Christian Church ==\n{{see also|Subsidiarity}}\nFederalism also finds expression in [[ecclesiology]] (the [[doctrine]] of the [[Christian Church|church]]). For example, [[presbyterian church governance]] resembles [[parliament]]ary [[republicanism]] (a form of ''political federalism'') to a large extent. In [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] denominations, the local church is ruled by elected [[Elder (religious)|elders]], some of which are [[minister of religion|ministerial]]. Each church then sends representatives or commissioners to [[Presbytery (presbyterian church)|presbyteries]] and further to a [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|general assembly]]. Each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members.  In this governmental structure, each component has some level of sovereignty over itself. As in ''political federalism'', in presbyterian ecclesiology there is shared sovereignty.\n\nOther ecclesiologies also have significant representational and federalistic components, including the more anarchic [[Congregationalist church governance|congregational ecclesiology]], and even in more hierarchical [[Episcopalian church governance|episcopal ecclesiology]].\n\nSome Christians argue that the earliest source of political federalism (or federalism in human institutions; in contrast to [[Covenant Theology|theological federalism]]) is the [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] federalism found in the [[Bible]].  They point to the structure of the early [[Christian Church]] as described (and prescribed, as believed by many) in the [[New Testament]].  In their arguments, this is particularly demonstrated in the [[Council of Jerusalem]], described in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] chapter 15, where the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] and [[Elder (religious)|elders]] gathered together to govern the Church; the Apostles being representatives of the universal Church, and elders being such for the local church.  To this day, elements of federalism can be found in almost every Christian denomination, some more than others.\n\n== Constitutional structure ==\n=== Division of powers ===\n{{distinguish|separation of powers}}\nIn a federation, the division of power between federal and regional governments is usually outlined in the [[constitution]]. Almost every country allows some degree of regional self-government, in federations the right to self-government of the component states is constitutionally entrenched. Component states often also possess their own constitutions which they may amend as they see fit, although in the event of conflict the federal constitution usually takes precedence.\n\nIn almost all federations the central government enjoys the powers of foreign policy and national defense as [[exclusive federal powers]]. Were this not the case a federation would not be a single sovereign state, per the UN definition. Notably, the [[states of Germany]] retain the right to act on their own behalf at an international level, a condition originally granted in exchange for the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]'s agreement to join the [[German Empire]] in 1871. Beyond this the precise division of power varies from one nation to another. The constitutions of [[Grundgesetz|Germany]] and the [[United States Constitution|United States]] provide that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the states. The Constitution of some countries like [[Constitution of Canada|Canada]] and [[Constitution of India|India]], state that powers not explicitly granted to the provincial governments are retained by the federal government. Much like the US system, the Australian Constitution allocates to the Federal government (the Commonwealth of Australia) the power to make laws about certain specified matters which were considered too difficult for the States to manage, so that the States retain all other areas of responsibility.  Under the division of powers of the European Union in the Lisbon Treaty, powers which are not either exclusively of European competence or shared between EU and state as [[concurrent powers]] are retained by the constituent states.\n\n[[File:La esp Rep. Federal, Rep. Unitaria (2).JPG|thumb|Satiric depiction of late 19th century political tensions in Spain]]\nWhere every component state of a federation possesses the same powers, we are said to find 'symmetric federalism'. [[Asymmetric federalism]] exists where states are granted different powers, or some possess greater autonomy than others do. This is often done in recognition of the existence of a distinct culture in a particular region or regions. In Spain, the [[History of the Basque people#Late Modern history|Basques]] and [[Catalan people|Catalans]], as well as the Galicians, spearheaded a historic movement to have their national specificity recognized, crystallizing in the \"historical communities\" such as [[Navarre]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Catalonia]], and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. They have more powers than the later expanded arrangement for other Spanish regions, or [[Autonomous communities of Spain|the Spain of the autonomous communities]] (called also the \"coffee for everyone\" arrangement), partly to deal with their separate identity and to appease peripheral nationalist leanings, partly out of respect to [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|specific rights they had held]] earlier in history. However, strictly speaking Spain is not a federation, but a decentralized administrative organization of states.\n\nIt is common that during the historical evolution of a federation there is a gradual movement of power from the component states to the centre, as the federal government acquires additional powers, sometimes to deal with unforeseen circumstances. The acquisition of new powers by a federal government may occur through formal constitutional amendment or simply through a broadening of the interpretation of a government's existing constitutional powers given by the courts.\n\nUsually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (''munic\u00edpios'') with their own legislative council (''c\u00e2mara de vereadores'') and a mayor (''prefeito''), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a \"little constitution\", called \"organic law\" (''lei org\u00e2nica''). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (''municipio libre'', \"free municipality\") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the [[political divisions of Mexico|constituent states]]. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.\n\nFederations often employ the [[paradox]] of being a union of states, while still being states (or having aspects of [[Sovereign state|statehood]]) in themselves. For example, James Madison (author of the [[United States constitution|US Constitution]]) wrote in [[Federalist No. 39|Federalist Paper No. 39]] that the US Constitution \"is in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both. In its foundation, it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the Government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national...\" This stems from the fact that states in the US maintain all [[sovereignty]] that they do not yield to the federation by their own consent. This was reaffirmed by the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which reserves all powers and rights that are not delegated to the Federal Government as left to the States and to the people.\n\n=== Bicameralism ===\nThe structures of most federal governments incorporate mechanisms to protect the rights of component states. One method, known as '[[intrastate federalism]]', is to directly represent the governments of component states in federal political institutions. Where a federation has a [[bicameral]] legislature the [[upper house]] is often used to represent the component states while the [[lower house]] represents the people of the nation as a whole. A federal upper house may be based on a special scheme of [[apportionment (politics)|apportionment]], as is the case in the [[senate]]s of the United States and Australia, where each state is represented by an equal number of senators irrespective of the size of its population.\n\nAlternatively, or in addition to this practice, the members of an upper house may be indirectly elected by the government or legislature of the component states, as occurred in the United States prior to 1913, or be actual members or delegates of the state governments, as, for example, is the case in the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|German Bundesrat]] and in the [[Council of the European Union]]. The lower house of a federal legislature is usually directly elected, with apportionment in proportion to population, although states may sometimes still be guaranteed a certain minimum number of seats.\n\n=== Intergovernmental relations ===\nIn Canada, the provincial governments represent regional interests and negotiate directly with the central government. A [[First Ministers conference]] of the prime minister and the provincial premiers is the ''[[de facto]]'' highest political forum in the land, although it is not mentioned in the constitution.\n\n=== Constitutional change ===\nFederations often have special procedures for amendment of the federal constitution. As well as reflecting the federal structure of the state this may guarantee that the self-governing status of the component states cannot be abolished without their consent. An amendment to the constitution of the United States must be ratified by three-quarters of either the state legislatures, or of constitutional conventions specially elected in each of the states, before it can come into effect. In referendums to amend the constitutions of Australia and Switzerland it is required that a proposal be endorsed not just by an overall majority of the electorate in the nation as a whole, but also by separate majorities in each of a majority of the states or cantons. In Australia, this latter requirement is known as a ''double majority''.\n\nSome federal constitutions also provide that certain constitutional amendments cannot occur without the unanimous consent of all states or of a particular state. The US constitution provides that no state may be deprived of equal representation in the senate without its consent. In Australia, if a proposed amendment will specifically impact one or more states, then it must be endorsed in the referendum held in each of those states.  Any amendment to the Canadian constitution that would modify the role of the [[Monarchy in Canada|monarchy]] would require unanimous consent of the provinces.  The [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] provides that no amendment is admissible at all that would abolish the federal system.\n\n=== Other technical terms ===\n* [[Fiscal federalism]] \u2013 the relative financial positions and the financial relations between the levels of government in a federal system.\n* Formal federalism (or '[[constitutional federalism]]') \u2013 the delineation of powers is specified in a written constitution, which may or may not correspond to the actual operation of the system in practice.\n* [[Executive federalism]] refers in the English-speaking tradition to the intergovernmental relationships between the executive branches of the levels of government in a federal system and in the continental European tradition to the way constituent units 'execute' or administer laws made centrally.\n* [[Gleichschaltung]] - the conversion from a federal governance to either a completely unitary or more unitary one, the term was borrowed from the German for conversion from [[Alternating current|alternating]] to [[direct current]].<ref>Page 72 of {{cite book | last=Koonz | first=Claudia | title=The Nazi Conscience | location=Cambridge, MA | publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-674-01172-4 | ref=harv | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/naziconscience00koon }}</ref> During the Nazi era the [[States of the Weimar Republic|traditional German states]] were mostly left intact in the formal sense, but their constitutional rights and sovereignty were eroded and ultimately ended and replaced with the [[Gau (territory)#Nazi period|Gau system]]. ''Gleichschaltung'' also has a broader sense referring to political consolidation in general.\n* defederalize - to remove from federal government, such as taking a responsibility from a national level government and giving it to states or provinces\n\n== Political philosophy ==\n{{main|Federalist}}\nThe meaning of ''federalism'', as a political movement, and of what constitutes a 'federalist', varies with country and historical context.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Movements associated with the establishment or development of federations can exhibit either centralising or decentralising trends.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} For example, at the time those nations were being established, factions known as \"federalists\" in the United States and Australia advocated the formation of strong central government. Similarly, in European Union politics, federalists mostly seek greater EU integration. In contrast, in Spain and in post-war Germany, federal movements have sought decentralisation: the transfer of power from central authorities to local units. In Canada, where Quebec separatism has been a political force for several decades, the \"federalist\" impulse aims to keep Quebec inside Canada.\n\n== Conflict reducing device ==\nFederalism, and other forms of territorial autonomy, is generally seen{{By whom|date=April 2019}} as a useful way to structure political systems in order to prevent violence among different groups within countries because it allows certain groups to legislate at the subnational level.<ref>Arend Lijphart. 1977. Democracy in Plural Societies: A Comparative Exploration. New Haven CT: Yale University Press.</ref> Some scholars have suggested, however, that federalism can divide countries and result in state collapse because it creates proto-states.<ref>Henry E. Hale.
