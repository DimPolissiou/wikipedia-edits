These penny coins bore the head and name of the king and the word ''Dyflin'' for Dublin. [[John of England]] was among the first [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[monarch]]s to mint coins in Ireland; these were farthings, halfpennies and pennies. It was not until the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] that Irish coins bore the [[harp]] and, later in Henry's reign, the year. In the following centuries [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[copper]] coins were issued, and at one time, metal from melted-down gun barrels was used; this was called \"gun money\". Coins issued in the 18th and 19th centuries often included the word [[Hibernia]] on the harp side. The last Irish coins issued prior to independence were during the reign of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], in 1823. Irish coins were withdrawn in 1826 following the full political union of Ireland and Britain in the [[Act of Union 1800|1800 Act of Union]]. Occasional \"fantasy\" coins were minted in the next century but these were neither [[circulation (currency)|circulated]] nor [[legal tender]].\n\nThe [[Irish Free State]] decided soon after its foundation in the 1920s to design its own [[coin]]s and [[banknote]]s. It was decided that the Irish currency would be pegged to the [[pound sterling]]. The Coinage Act, 1926<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1926/en/act/pub/0014/index.html Coinage Act, 1926]</ref> was passed as a legislative basis for the minting of coins for the state and these new coins commenced circulation on 12 December 1928. The decision was mainly for [[economic]] reasons because, in 1924, 98% of Irish exports went to [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]], while 80% of imports were from those territories. Additionally, the stability and backing of the pound sterling reassured the government that the new currency was on [[store of value|a firm foundation]] and did not weaken efforts to rebuild the country socially and economically, which was the government's first commitment. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nAs is common with [[numismatic]] [[terminology]] the side of the [[Coat of Arms of the Republic of Ireland|seal of the state]] is termed the \"[[obverse]]\"; this is often called the common side; the \"[[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]\" is the side with the denomination specific design.\n\nCoins are issued by the [[central bank]] which acts as an agent of the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]].\n\n==The pound==\n\n==={{anchor|Free State}}<!--[[Coins of the Irish Free State]] redirects here--> Pre-decimal coins===\n\n[[File:Irish shilling coin.png|thumb|150px|Shilling coins featured a bull design.

The committee members were [[Thomas Bodkin]], Dermot O'Brien, Lucius O'Callaghan and [[Barry Egan (politician)|Barry Egan]].\n\nSome decisions were made at the outset. The [[harp]] was to be on most if not all coins, and all lettering would be in Irish. The committee decided that people associated with \"the present time\" should not feature in any designs, no doubt {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} due to the political divisions which had led to the [[Irish Civil War]]. They decided later that religious or cultural themes should be avoided in case coins became relics or medals. [[Agriculture]] was essential to the [[economy of the Republic of Ireland|economy of Ireland]] and this theme was chosen for the coins, which used designs featuring animals and birds.\n\nFinally, the harp and the words {{lang|ga|Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann}} (\"[[Irish Free State]]\") were chosen for the obverse side of coins. Images of animals and birds were presented to the chosen artists to design the reverse and they were also given pictures of the [[Dalway harp]] and [[Trinity College harp]] for guidance. Later, the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] decided that the value of the coins should be written in numerals as well as in words, and he suggested using plants; this latter suggestion was rejected because the competition was at an advanced stage and due to the difficulty of obtaining good facsimiles of plants.\n\nThree Irish artists [[Jerome Connor]], Albert Power and [[Oliver Sheppard]] were chosen, and also the foreign artists [[Paul Manship]] (American), [[Percy Metcalfe]] (English) [[Carl Milles]] (Swedish) and Publio Morbiducci (Italian); a number of other artists were invited but did not take part. Each artist was paid and allowed to produce designs in [[plaster]] or [[metal]], with a prize for the winner. Identifying marks were removed from the designs so the committee did not know whose designs were being judged. Percy Metcalfe's designs were chosen and design modifications were added with assistance from [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|civil servants]] at the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Department of Agriculture]].\n\nThe first coins were struck in 1928 and were minted at the [[Royal Mint]] in [[London]]. In 1938, following the introduction of the [[Constitution of Ireland]], the obverse of the coins was modified with the [[Irish language]] name of the State, \"[[\u00c9ire]]\", and the harp was also modified so that it wore better. The Central Bank Act, 1942 Section 58<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1942/en/act/pub/0022/index.html Central Bank Act, 1942]</ref> allowed pure [[nickel]] to be substituted with a [[cupro-nickel]] [[alloy]]. The description of the state as the \"[[Republic of Ireland]]\" did not require any change in the name on coins issued after 1948. The Coinage Act, 1950<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1950/en/act/pub/0032/index.html Coinage Act, 1950]</ref> changed the law on coinage principally with the removal of silver from coins then in existence. The final piece of primary legislation for predecimal coins was the Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1966/en/act/pub/0005/index.html Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966]</ref> which allowed for a [[Ten shilling (Irish coin)|ten shilling coin]] to be minted and circulated. The ten shilling was the only modern circulating Irish coin not to feature the harp, to incorporate edge lettering, and to depict an actual Irishman ([[Patrick Pearse|P\u00e1draig Pearse]]), and to depict a political subject (Pearse was an Irish revolutionary and the edge lettering referred to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]).\n\nWhile many of the Irish coins are common, particularly in lower grades, there are some notable rarities.  Most of the 1943 Florins and Half Crowns were melted down at the mint, and only small numbers were released.  Only one and two specimens, respectively, are known of the 1938 Half Crown and Penny.<ref>[http://www.irishcoinage.com/MODCAT.HTM#modhcr Catalogue of Irish Coin Prices Modern Coins 1928-1969]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=8| <big>Summary: Pre-decimal coins</big>\n|-\n!

The redesigned smaller 10p of the 1990s is shown on the right.]]\n\nThree new designs were created in [[bronze]] for the new decimal currency by the artist [[Gabriel Hayes]], and were based upon [[manuscript]] designs of ornamental birds in [[Celtic knot]]work style. The designs of Percy Metcalfe were retained for the new five and ten pence coins, taken from the shilling and florin, respectively. The new fifty pence piece bore the image of the woodcock from the old [[Farthing (Irish coin)|farthing]]. The designs were quite simple using only figures and symbols to indicate the value; using only the letter \"P\" to denote both ''penny'' and ''pingin'' (the [[Irish language|Irish]] word for penny). \n\nIn 1978, the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] opened the [[Currency Centre]] at [[Sandyford]] in Dublin for the production of coins and banknotes. Irish coins had previously been produced in Great Britain at the [[Royal Mint]]. \n\nThe rising expense of minting coins necessitated the introduction of the [[Irish twenty pence (decimal coin)|twenty pence coin]] in 1986; the [[Irish halfpenny (decimal coin)|halfpenny coin]] was withdrawn at this time as [[inflation]] had reduced its buying power. The introduction of the [[Irish pound]] [[coin]] required the Decimal Currency Act, 1990<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0002/index.html Decimal Currency Act, 1990]</ref> and this law provided for certain other matters including the issue of [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU) coins which were specifically stated not to be [[legal tender]] in the legislation, instead intended as [[Collecting|collectors]] items. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} These ECU coins were issued in 50 ECU, 10 ECU and 5 ECU denominations, in [[gold]], [[silver]] and silver respectively. These coins used the Irish red deer design from the Irish pound coin with a mountain relief in the background and other notable differences such as the [[European symbols|12 stars of the European Flag]] surrounding the [[harp]], quite similar to the [[Irish euro coins]].\n\nThe coins issued under the Decimal Currency Acts were finally [[Legal tender#Demonetisation|withdrawn from circulation]] in 2002 by the Irish Pound Coinage (Calling In) (No. 2) Order, 2001<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0311.html S.I.

As with all [[eurozone]] countries, Ireland continued to mint its own coins after the currency changeover to the euro. One side of euro coins is common across the eurozone, it is the obverse which has a design unique to Ireland. Although some other countries used more than one design, or even a separate design for each of the eight coins (1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, \u20ac1 and \u20ac2), Ireland used only one design. A redesigned [[Irish harp|harp]] (superficially identical to that used on earlier coins) was used, having been designed by Jarlath Hayes. Some other eurozone members have unique lettering around the \u20ac2 coin. The edge on Irish \u20ac2 coins merely has the sequence \"[[File:2\u20ac edge inv2.svg|155px|2 * * (upside down 2) * *]]\", repeated three times.\n\nThe first collectors' commemorative coin issued since the changeover was a \u20ac10 silver coin to mark the [[Special Olympics]] in 2003. This was struck in [[Sterling silver|sterling .925 silver]] and hand finished to create a distinctive gold logo and harp. A \u20ac5 coin was also produced. Since then a number of commemorative coins have been issued including one for the accession of the ten new [[European Union]] member states on 1 May 2004. One side of the \u20ac10 coin depicts a [[swan]] sitting on ten eggs, with the reverse depicting the harp and the names of all ten members in their native language.  The first gold coin ever issued by the Central Bank was a \u20ac20 issued in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of [[Samuel Beckett]].  These commemorative coins are only legal tender in Ireland, and are not valid elsewhere in the eurozone.\n\nIn 2007, Ireland issued a \u20ac2 common coin for general circulation, together with the others countries of the Eurozone, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome]] followed by a \u20ac2 common commemorative coin in 2009 celebrating the tenth anniversary of the birth of the euro currency in 1999, by another \u20ac2 common commemorative coin in 2012 for the tenth anniversary of the introduction of coins and banknotes denominated in euro and, finally, by another \u20ac2 common commemorative dedicated to the thirtieth anniversary of the [[Flag of Europe|European Flag]] in 2015. For the first time since it adopted the euro, Ireland will issue on its own, in 2016, a \u20ac2 commemorative coin in honour of the hundredth anniversary of the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916.\n\nIn 2013 the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] issued a silver \u20ac10 commemorative coin in honour of [[James Joyce]] that misquoted a famous line from his masterwork ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0410/380758-central-bank-coin/ | work=RT\u00c9 News | date=10 April 2013 | title=Error in Ulysses line on special \u20ac10 coin issued by Central Bank}}</ref> despite being warned on at least two occasions by the Department of Finance over difficulties with copyright and design.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.herald.ie/news/bank-alerted-to-joyce-coin-risk-29296231.html  | work= Evening Herald  |date=25 May 2013 | title=Bank alerted to Joyce coin risk}}</ref>\n\nAll pre-euro Irish coins may be exchanged for their equivalent in euro any weekday morning at the [[Central Bank of Ireland|Central Bank]] in Dublin.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Banknotes of the Republic of Ireland]]\n*[[Coins of Ireland]]\n*[[Arms of Ireland]]\n*[[Commemorative coins of Ireland]]\n*[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Ireland)]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* ''\"Coinage of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann\", William Butler Yeats, The Stationery Office, Dublin, 1928.''\n* ''\"The Irish Coinage Designs\", Thomas Bodkin DLitt, Metropolitan School of Art, Dublin, November 30, 1928.''\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.irishcoinage.com/ Irish coinage website - history, images and catalogue.]\n\n{{Irish currency and coinage}}\n{{Portal bar|Ireland|Money|Numismatics|Republic of Ireland}}\n\n[[Category:Coins of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Coins of the Republic of Ireland| ]]\n", "text_old": "There have been three sets of [[coins of Ireland|coins in Ireland]] since independence.

The final piece of primary legislation for predecimal coins was the Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1966/en/act/pub/0005/index.html Coinage (Amendment) Act, 1966]</ref> which allowed for a [[Ten shilling (Irish coin)|ten shilling coin]] to be minted and circulated. The ten shilling was the only modern circulating Irish coin not to feature the harp, to incorporate edge lettering, and to depict an actual Irishman ([[Patrick Pearse|P\u00e1draig Pearse]]), and to depict a political subject (Pearse was an Irish revolutionary and the edge lettering referred to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]).\n\nWhile many of the Irish coins are common, particularly in lower grades, there are some notable rarities.  Most of the 1943 Florins and Half Crowns were melted down at the mint, and only small numbers were released.  Only one and two specimens, respectively, are known of the 1938 Half Crown and Penny.<ref>[http://www.irishcoinage.com/MODCAT.HTM#modhcr Catalogue of Irish Coin Prices Modern Coins 1928-1969]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=8| <big>Summary: Pre-decimal coins</big>\n|-\n!

The designs of Percy Metcalfe were retained for the new five and ten pence coins, taken from the shilling and florin, respectively. The new fifty pence piece bore the image of the woodcock from the old [[Farthing (Irish coin)|farthing]]. The designs were quite simple using only figures and symbols to indicate the value; using only the letter \"P\" to denote both ''penny'' and ''pingin'' (the [[Irish language|Irish]] word for penny). \n\nIn 1978, the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] opened the [[Currency Centre]] at [[Sandyford]] in Dublin for the production of coins and banknotes. Irish coins had previously been produced in Great Britain at the [[Royal Mint]]. \n\nThe rising expense of minting coins necessitated the introduction of the [[Irish twenty pence (decimal coin)|twenty pence coin]] in 1986; the [[Irish halfpenny (decimal coin)|halfpenny coin]] was withdrawn at this time as [[inflation]] had reduced its buying power. The introduction of the [[Irish pound]] [[coin]] required the Decimal Currency Act, 1990<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0002/index.html Decimal Currency Act, 1990]</ref> and this law provided for certain other matters including the issue of [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU) coins which were specifically stated not to be [[legal tender]] in the legislation, instead intended as [[Collecting|collectors]] items. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} These ECU coins were issued in 50 ECU, 10 ECU and 5 ECU denominations, in [[gold]], [[silver]] and silver respectively. These coins used the Irish red deer design from the Irish pound coin with a mountain relief in the background and other notable differences such as the [[European symbols|12 stars of the European Flag]] surrounding the [[harp]], quite similar to the [[Irish euro coins]].\n\nThe coins issued under the Decimal Currency Acts were finally [[Legal tender#Demonetisation|withdrawn from circulation]] in 2002 by the Irish Pound Coinage (Calling In) (No. 2) Order, 2001<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0311.html S.I.

As with all [[eurozone]] countries, Ireland continued to mint its own coins after the currency changeover to the euro. One side of euro coins is common across the eurozone, it is the obverse which has a design unique to Ireland. Although some other countries used more than one design, or even a separate design for each of the eight coins (1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, \u20ac1 and \u20ac2), Ireland used only one design. A redesigned [[Irish harp|harp]] (superficially identical to that used on earlier coins) was used, having been designed by Jarlath Hayes. Some other eurozone members have unique lettering around the \u20ac2 coin. The edge on Irish \u20ac2 coins merely has the sequence \"[[File:2\u20ac edge inv2.svg|155px|2 * * (upside down 2) * *]]\", repeated three times.\n\nThe first collectors' commemorative coin issued since the changeover was a \u20ac10 silver coin to mark the [[Special Olympics]] in 2003. This was struck in [[Sterling silver|sterling .925 silver]] and hand finished to create a distinctive gold logo and harp. A \u20ac5 coin was also produced. Since then a number of commemorative coins have been issued including one for the accession of the ten new [[European Union]] member states on 1 May 2004. One side of the \u20ac10 coin depicts a [[swan]] sitting on ten eggs, with the reverse depicting the harp and the names of all ten members in their native language.  The first gold coin ever issued by the Central Bank was a \u20ac20 issued in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of [[Samuel Beckett]].  These commemorative coins are only legal tender in Ireland, and are not valid elsewhere in the eurozone.\n\nIn 2007, Ireland issued a \u20ac2 common coin for general circulation, together with the others countries of the Eurozone, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome]] followed by a \u20ac2 common commemorative coin in 2009 celebrating the tenth anniversary of the birth of the euro currency in 1999, by another \u20ac2 common commemorative coin in 2012 for the tenth anniversary of the introduction of coins and banknotes denominated in euro and, finally, by another \u20ac2 common commemorative dedicated to the thirtieth anniversary of the [[Flag of Europe|European Flag]] in 2015. For the first time since it adopted the euro, Ireland will issue on its own, in 2016, a \u20ac2 commemorative coin in honour of the hundredth anniversary of the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916.\n\nIn 2013 the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] issued a silver \u20ac10 commemorative coin in honour of [[James Joyce]] that misquoted a famous line from his masterwork ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0410/380758-central-bank-coin/ | work=RT\u00c9 News | date=10 April 2013 | title=Error in Ulysses line on special \u20ac10 coin issued by Central Bank}}</ref> despite being warned on at least two occasions by the Department of Finance over difficulties with copyright and design.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.herald.ie/news/bank-alerted-to-joyce-coin-risk-29296231.html  | work= Evening Herald  |date=25 May 2013 | title=Bank alerted to Joyce coin risk}}</ref>\n\nAll pre-euro Irish coins may be exchanged for their equivalent in euro any weekday morning at the [[Central Bank of Ireland|Central Bank]] in Dublin.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Banknotes of the Republic of Ireland]]\n*[[Coins of Ireland]]\n*[[Arms of Ireland]]\n*[[Commemorative coins of Ireland]]\n*[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Ireland)]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* ''\"Coinage of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann\", William Butler Yeats, The Stationery Office, Dublin, 1928.''\n* ''\"The Irish Coinage Designs\", Thomas Bodkin DLitt, Metropolitan School of Art, Dublin, November 30, 1928.''\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.irishcoinage.com/ Irish coinage website - history, images and catalogue.]\n\n{{Irish currency and coinage}}\n{{Portal bar|Ireland|Money|Numismatics|Republic of Ireland}}\n\n[[Category:Coins of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Coins of the Republic of Ireland| ]]\n", "name_user": "Iveagh Gardens", "label": "safe", "comment": "Tags and links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland"}

The Trans-Pecos region is the only part of Texas regarded as mountainous and includes seven named peaks in elevation greater than {{convert|8000|ft|m}}. This region includes sand hills, desert valleys, wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands.<ref name=\"Regions\"/> The vegetation diversity includes at least 268 [[grass]] species and 447 species of [[woody plant]]s.<ref name=\"Trans-Pecos\">{{cite web|url= http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/land/habitats/trans_pecos/|title= Tx Parks and Wildlife|accessdate= 2006-07-14}}</ref> National Parks include the [[Amistad National Recreation Area]], [[Big Bend National Park]], [[Chamizal National Memorial]], [[Fort Davis National Historic Site]], [[Guadalupe Mountains National Park]], and the [[Rio Grande Wild and Scenic River]].<ref name=\"NatParks\"/> This area is part of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]].\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Geology of Texas}}\nTexas is mostly [[sedimentary rocks]], with East Texas underlain by a [[Cretaceous]] and younger sequence of sediments, the trace of ancient shorelines east and south until the [[active continental margin]] of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] is met.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} This sequence is built atop the subsided crest of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]&ndash;[[Ouachita Mountains]]&ndash;[[Marathon Uplift|Marathon Mountains]] zone of [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] [[continental collision]], which [[post-orogenic collapse|collapsed]] when [[rifting]] in [[Jurassic]] time opened the Gulf of Mexico. West from this [[orogeny|orogenic]] crest, which is buried beneath the [[Dallas]]&ndash;[[Waco, Texas|Waco]]&ndash;[[Austin, Texas|Austin]]&ndash;[[San Antonio]] trend, the sediments are [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] in age. [[Petroleum|Oil]] is found in the Cretaceous sediments in the east, the Permian sediments in the west, and along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas [[continental shelf]]. A few exposures of [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s are found in the central and western parts of the state, and [[Oligocene]] [[volcanic]] rocks are found in far west Texas, in the [[Big Bend, Texas|Big Bend]] area. A blanket of [[Miocene]] sediments known as the [[Ogallala formation]] in the western high plains region is an important [[aquifer]]. Texas has no active or dormant volcanoes and few earthquakes, being situated far from an active [[plate tectonic]] boundary. The Big Bend area is the most seismically active; however, the area is sparsely populated and suffers minimal damages and injuries, and no known fatalities have been attributed to a Texas earthquake.\n\n==Resources==\nWith a large supply of [[natural resource]]s, Texas is a major [[Agriculture|agricultural]] and [[Industry|industrial]] state, producing oil, cattle, sheep, and cotton. The state also produces poultry, eggs, dairy products, greenhouse and nursery products, wheat, hay, rice, sugar cane, and peanuts, and a range of fruits and vegetables.<ref name=\"InfoResources\">{{cite web|url= http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108277.html|title= infoplease.com|accessdate= 2006-07-14 }}</ref>\n*[[Asphalt]]-bearing rocks, mainly cretaceous limestones, occur in [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar]], [[Burnet County, Texas|Burnet]], [[Kinney County, Texas|Kinney]], [[Uvalde County, Texas|Uvalde]], and other counties.\n*[[Cement]] is produced in Bexar, Comal, Dallas, Ector, Ellis, El Paso, Harris, Hays, McLennan, Nolan, Nueces, Potter, and Tarrant counties.

STURP issued its final report in 1981.\n\nJoe Nickell of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] has pointed out that \"STURP\u2019s leaders served on the executive council of the Holy Shroud Guild, which is devoted to the \u201ccause\u201d of the reputed relic.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Nickell|first=Joe|title=Fake Turin Shroud Deceives National Geographic Author|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/fake_turin_shroud_deceives_national_geographic_author|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe origins of the group go back to the experiments of physicist [[John P. Jackson]], thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern in 1976. Using the ideas invented in aerospace science for building three dimensional models from images of Mars, Eric Jumper built initial devices to test the photographs of the Shroud of Turin. These were the first experiments relating to the shroud performed by scientists.<ref>Bernard Ruffin, 1999, ''The Shroud of Turin'' {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}-page 79</ref>\n\nIn March 1977, Jackson, Jumper and Mottern invited a few other scientists to join them to form a team for the analysis of the Shroud. The first meeting took place in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. The group had no official sponsorship and the scientists funded their own activities. They also managed to arrange gifts and loans of technical equipment whose value was estimated at over $2&nbsp;million.\n\nNuclear physicist Tom D'Muhala headed STURP. Apart from Jackson, Jumper, and Motten the team included thermal chemist [[Raymond N. Rogers]], and Ron London, and Roger Morris, all from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. Other team members included Don Lynn of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in Pasadena, biophysicist John Heller, photographers Vern Miller and Barrie Schwortz, optical physicist Sam Pellicori, and electric power experts John D. German and Rudy Dichtl, as well as forensic pathologist Robert Bucklin. STURP included no experts on medieval art, archaeology, or textiles.\n\nTo commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the shroud in [[Turin]], it was displayed to the public in Turin from 27 August to 8 October 1978, with about 3 million visitors attending the exposition under bullet-proof glass. For the next 5 days after the exposition the STURP team analyzed the shroud around the clock at the royal palace adjoining Turin Cathedral, some scientists sleeping while others worked. A team of European scientists headed by Luigi Gonella supervised the activities.<ref>Bernard Ruffin, 1999, ''The Shroud of Turin'' {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}-page 80-83</ref> The team gathered sticky tape samples of material from several points on the surface of the shroud.<ref>''The orphaned manuscript: a gathering of publications on the Shroud of Turin'' by Alan D. Adler 2002 {{ISBN|88-7402-003-1}} pages 93\u201394</ref>\n\nSTURP team members continued their research after access to the shroud and published many of theirs results in scientific journals and proceedings.<ref>http://www.shroud.com/78papers.htm</ref><ref>''A Chemist's Perspective On The Shroud of Turin'' by Raymond N.

It is not the product of an artist. The blood stains are composed of hemoglobin and also give a positive test for serum albumin. The image is an ongoing mystery and until further chemical studies are made, perhaps by this group of scientists, or perhaps by some scientists in the future, the problem remains unsolved.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n==Members of the S.Tu.R.P. in 1978==\n* [[Joseph S.

STURP issued its final report in 1981.\n\nJoe Nickell of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] has pointed out that \"STURP\u2019s leaders served on the executive council of the Holy Shroud Guild, which is devoted to the \u201ccause\u201d of the reputed relic.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Nickell|first=Joe|title=Fake Turin Shroud Deceives National Geographic Author|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/fake_turin_shroud_deceives_national_geographic_author|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe origins of the group go back to the experiments of physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern in 1976. Using the ideas invented in aerospace science for building three dimensional models from images of Mars, Eric Jumper built initial devices to test the photographs of the Shroud of Turin. These were the first experiments relating to the shroud performed by scientists.<ref>Bernard Ruffin, 1999, ''The Shroud of Turin'' {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}-page 79</ref>\n\nIn March 1977, Jackson, Jumper and Mottern invited a few other scientists to join them to form a team for the analysis of the Shroud. The first meeting took place in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. The group had no official sponsorship and the scientists funded their own activities. They also managed to arrange gifts and loans of technical equipment whose value was estimated at over $2&nbsp;million.\n\nNuclear physicist Tom D'Muhala headed STURP. Apart from Jackson, Jumper, and Motten the team included thermal chemist [[Raymond N. Rogers]], and Ron London, and Roger Morris, all from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. Other team members included Don Lynn of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in Pasadena, biophysicist John Heller, photographers Vern Miller and Barrie Schwortz, optical physicist Sam Pellicori, and electric power experts John D. German and Rudy Dichtl, as well as forensic pathologist Robert Bucklin. STURP included no experts on medieval art, archaeology, or textiles.\n\nTo commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the shroud in [[Turin]], it was displayed to the public in Turin from 27 August to 8 October 1978, with about 3 million visitors attending the exposition under bullet-proof glass. For the next 5 days after the exposition the STURP team analyzed the shroud around the clock at the royal palace adjoining Turin Cathedral, some scientists sleeping while others worked. A team of European scientists headed by Luigi Gonella supervised the activities.<ref>Bernard Ruffin, 1999, ''The Shroud of Turin'' {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}-page 80-83</ref> The team gathered sticky tape samples of material from several points on the surface of the shroud.<ref>''The orphaned manuscript: a gathering of publications on the Shroud of Turin'' by Alan D. Adler 2002 {{ISBN|88-7402-003-1}} pages 93\u201394</ref>\n\nSTURP team members continued their research after access to the shroud and published many of theirs results in scientific journals and proceedings.<ref>http://www.shroud.com/78papers.htm</ref><ref>''A Chemist's Perspective On The Shroud of Turin'' by Raymond N. Rogers, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-615-23928-6}}</ref> In 1981, in its final report, STURP wrote:<ref>http://www.shroud.com/78conclu.htm</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\"We can conclude for now that the Shroud image is that of a real human form of a scourged, crucified man. It is not the product of an artist. The blood stains are composed of hemoglobin and also give a positive test for serum albumin. The image is an ongoing mystery and until further chemical studies are made, perhaps by this group of scientists, or perhaps by some scientists in the future, the problem remains unsolved.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n==Members of the S.Tu.R.P. in 1978==\n* [[Joseph S.

During a period of a year while they were awaiting trial, all three suffered intimidation and harassment, including house searches, were followed by plain clothes officers, and were required to report to the police each day.\n\nTheir defence was supported by the [[National Union of Journalists]] and civil liberties groups.  A first trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in September 1978 collapsed after one of the members of the jury was identified as a former officer in the [[Special Air Service]].  A second trial opened in October 1978.   The prosecution admitted that much of the information was in the public domain, and charges under section 1 were dropped.  Many witnesses testified under code letters - one, Colonel B, was identified as Colonel [[Hugh Johnstone]], head of Signals Intelligence, and protesters chanted his name outside the court. They were convicted in November 1978 but received non-custodial sentences.\n\n==Later life==\nAubrey moved to [[Nether Stowey]] in Somerset after the trial, where he became a [[smallholder]] and freelance journalist.  He published a book in 1981, '' Who's Watching You? Britain's Security Service and the Official Secrets Act''.  He also became involved in environmental issues.  He advocated wind power, editing the magazine of the [[European Wind Energy Association]], and opposed nuclear power.  He published two books on environmental issues, ''Meltdown, the Collapse of the Nuclear Dream'' (1991), and ''Thorp: the Whitehall Nightmare'' (1993).  He campaigned against the building of a new nuclear reactor at [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station]] in Somerset.
