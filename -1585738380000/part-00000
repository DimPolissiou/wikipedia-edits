Around the St. Nicholas church ([[Bogdana Monastery]]), archaeologists have uncovered a [[Archaeological stratigraphy|habitation layer]] preceding Bogdan's period of rule, one which could point to the existence of a local center prior to the [[foundation of Moldavia]].\n\nAwarded the [[Town privileges|privilege]] of organizing [[fair]]s, R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi evolved due to its favorable location midway between the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and the tableland area (with traders from both regions establishing contact in the local market). The fairs at R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi have been dated to the time of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (a document from 1481; however, since the mention includes details of Stephen's intervention in solving a commercial dispute, it is possible that the fairs were well established by then).\n\nR\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi has a cathedral (built 1402) with the tombs of several Moldavian princes.<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Radautz |volume=22 |page=783}}</ref> R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi was also the seat of a Greek bishopric, moved to [[Chernivtsi]] in 1786.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nR\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi was one of the largest cities of the Duchy of [[Bukovina]] during the period of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] administration (1775\u20131918).

The community was allowed a degree of self-administration, and witnessed a period of prosperity and cultural effervescence during the 19th century.\n\nThe majority of R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi's Jewish population was exterminated during the [[Holocaust]]. Persecutions became widespread around 1938, when Jews were harassed and attacked by authorities under the [[Octavian Goga]] government; they were confirmed by anti-Semitic legislation passed by the [[Ion Gigurtu]] cabinet, and, in late 1940, exceptionally violent following the establishment of the [[National Legionary State]]. In October 1941, all Jews present in R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi (more than 10,000) were deported to [[concentration camp]]s in [[Transnistria]].<ref name=\"JEWISH_RADAUTI\">{{cite web | url = http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/pinkas_romania/rom2_00516.html | title = Translation of ''R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi'' chapter from ''Encyclopedia of Jewish Communities in Romania'', Vol. 2 | year = 1980 | accessdate = January 29, 2013 | publisher = Yad Vashem, Jerusalim }}</ref>\n\n==Bogdana Monastery==\nThe Princely Church at R\u0103d\u0103u\u0163i contained the graves of [[Bogdan I]] and his son [[La\u0163cu]], both [[Voivode]]s/[[Prince]]s of [[Moldavia]], as well as a later ruler, [[Roman I of Moldavia]].

Persecutions became widespread around 1938, when Jews were harassed and attacked by authorities under the [[Octavian Goga]] government; they were confirmed by anti-Semitic legislation passed by the [[Ion Gigurtu]] cabinet, and, in late 1940, exceptionally violent following the establishment of the [[National Legionary State]].

To test the effects that being the youngest or oldest of an age cohort can have in developmental outcomes, Dhuey et al. implement a regression discontinuity design within families that have children born in August and in September: these birth months correspond to being immediately before and after the average age cutoff time for school entrance. Dhuey et al. find significant positive developmental outcomes for September-born students over their August-born classmates. Notable differences in outcomes are also present in receiving disability status, while test scores and high school graduation rates are similar across the oldest and youngest students. On the end of policy considerations, they find that summer school can exacerbate age of entry effects while smaller first grade classrooms can lessen age of entry effects.\n\nPublished in 2013, Dhuey conducted research on the differing academic achievements in students who attended a middle school versus those who attended a school from kindergarten that led directly into high school.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dhuey|first=Elizabeth|date=2013|title=Middle school or junior high?

Upon graduation, Dhuey was appointed to the position of Assistant Professor of Economics in the Department of Management at the [[University of Toronto Scarborough]] in 2007. In 2014, she was promoted to the position of Associate Professor of Economics. She holds cross-appointments with the Department of Economics, the [[Munk School of Global Affairs|Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy]], and the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto.<ref>[https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/people/dhuey/ Curriculum vitae of Elizabeth Dhuey retrieved from the website of the University of Toronto Scarborough.]</ref>\n\nIn addition to her academic work, Dhuey held the role of President of the Canadian Women Economist Network in 2018.

She is a significant contributor to knowledge on topics such as the developmental effects of education system organization on young children and necessary policy considerations for the state funding of special education programs.\n\n=== Research on the effects of education system organization on child development  ===\nIn a forthcoming paper with [[David Figlio]], Krzysztof Karbownik and Jeffrey Roth, Dhuey takes an empirical approach in understanding the disadvantages faced by children based on their age of entry to primary school, specifically those that are the youngest of their group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dhuey, Elizabeth, David Figlio, Krzysztof Karbownik and Jeffrey Roth|date=|title=School Starting Age and Cognitive Development|url=https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/WP%20191.pdf|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> This is in response to the increase in [[Redshirting (academic)|redshirting]] of kindergarten students, based on the supposed benefits from delaying entry to schooling such as increased cognitive development, stronger interpersonal skills, and better professional outcomes down the road. To test the effects that being the youngest or oldest of an age cohort can have in developmental outcomes, Dhuey et al. implement a regression discontinuity design within families that have children born in August and in September: these birth months correspond to being immediately before and after the average age cutoff time for school entrance. Dhuey et al. find significant positive developmental outcomes for September-born students over their August-born classmates. Notable differences in outcomes are also present in receiving disability status, while test scores and high school graduation rates are similar across the oldest and youngest students. On the end of policy considerations, they find that summer school can exacerbate age of entry effects while smaller first grade classrooms can lessen age of entry effects.\n\nPublished in 2013, Dhuey conducted research on the differing academic achievements in students who attended a middle school versus those who attended a school from kindergarten that led directly into high school.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dhuey|first=Elizabeth|date=2013|title=Middle school or junior high?
