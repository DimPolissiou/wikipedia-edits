On farms, whaling and fishing fleets as well as in processing plants and aquaculture operations, antibiotics were used to treat and prevent disease, increase feed conversion, and preserve food. Their rapid diffusion into nearly all areas of food production and processing was initially viewed as a story of progress on both sides of the Iron Curtain.\"\n\nTo retrace, while natural antibiotics or antibacterials were known to ancient man, [[antibiotic]]<nowiki/>s as we know them came to the fore during World War II to help treat war time casualties.

The latter being the most important for causing antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains in animals and humans. One of the methods bacteria can obtain new genes is through a process called conjugation which deals with transferring genes using plasmids. These conjugative plasmids carry a number of genes that can be assembled and rearranged, which could then enable bacteria to exchange beneficial genes among themselves ensuring their survival against antibiotics and rendering them ineffective to treat dangerous diseases in humans, resulting into multi-drug resistant organisms.<ref>Bennett P.

There also has been an increase in the number of bacterial pathogens resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, including MRSA, which have recently emerged into different lineages. Some of them are associated with livestock and companion animals that are then able to be transmitted to humans, also called livestock-associated methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (LA-MRSA). These new lineages can be found on soft tissues of livestock workers, for example in their noses. A study looked at the association between exposure to livestock and the occurrence of LA-MRSA infection and observed that LA-MRSA infection was 9.64 times as likely to be found among livestock workers and veterinarians compared to their unexposed families and community members, showing that exposure to livestock significantly increases the risk of developing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.<ref>Chen, C., & Wu, F.

These bacteria can then reproduce and spread their antibiotic-resistant genes to other generations, increasing their prevalence and leading to infections that cannot be healed by antibiotics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ben|first=Yujie|last2=Fu|first2=Caixia|last3=Hu|first3=Min|last4=Liu|first4=Lei|last5=Wong|first5=Ming Hung|last6=Zheng|first6=Chunmiao|date=February 2019|title=Human health risk assessment of antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic residues in the environment: A review|journal=Environmental Research|volume=169|pages=483\u2013493|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2018.11.040|issn=1096-0953|pmid=30530088|bibcode=2019ER....169..483B|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c46b56253afd303cb0f561aedb3113573cd129e5}}</ref> This is a growing matter of concern as antibiotic resistance is considered to be a serious future threat to human welfare.<ref name=pmid22048738/> Infectious diseases are the third leading cause of death in Europe and a future without effective antibiotics would fundamentally change the way modern medicine is practised.<ref name=pmid22048738/><ref name=pmid25918440>{{cite journal |last1=Shallcross |first1=Laura J. |last2=Howard |first2=Simon J. |last3=Fowler |first3=Tom |last4=Davies |first4=Sally C. |title=Tackling the threat of antimicrobial resistance: from policy to sustainable action |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=5 June 2015 |volume=370 |issue=1670 |pages=20140082 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0082 |pmid=25918440 |pmc=4424432 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89772d0ac83159bdc04737d8b8db9cc099b2b4f9}}</ref> \n[[File:Hartsock Genetic Engineering Bacteria Cell Division.png|thumb|Bacterial conjugation|333x333px]]\nBacteria can alter their genetic inheritance through two main ways, either by mutating their genetic material or acquiring a new one from other bacteria. The latter being the most important for causing antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains in animals and humans. One of the methods bacteria can obtain new genes is through a process called conjugation which deals with transferring genes using plasmids. These conjugative plasmids carry a number of genes that can be assembled and rearranged, which could then enable bacteria to exchange beneficial genes among themselves ensuring their survival against antibiotics and rendering them ineffective to treat dangerous diseases in humans, resulting into multi-drug resistant organisms.<ref>Bennett P.

There also has been an increase in the number of bacterial pathogens resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, including MRSA, which have recently emerged into different lineages. Some of them are associated with livestock and companion animals that are then able to be transmitted to humans, also called livestock-associated methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (LA-MRSA). These new lineages can be found on soft tissues of livestock workers, for example in their noses. A study looked at the association between exposure to livestock and the occurrence of LA-MRSA infection and observed that LA-MRSA infection was 9.64 times as likely to be found among livestock workers and veterinarians compared to their unexposed families and community members, showing that exposure to livestock significantly increases the risk of developing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.<ref>Chen, C., & Wu, F.

GPS receivers have excellent long-term stability (as characterized by their [[Allan variance|Allan deviation]])<ref name=autogenerated2 /> at averaging times greater than several hours. However, their short-term stability is degraded by limitations of the internal resolution of the [[Pulse-per-second signal|one pulse per second (1PPS)]] reference timing circuits, [[Radio propagation|signal propagation]] effects such as [[multipath interference]], atmospheric conditions, and other impairments. On the other hand, a quality oven-controlled oscillator has better short-term stability but is susceptible to thermal, aging, and other long-term effects.

This guarantees frequency accuracy at the expense of high phase noise and jitter, a degradation that true GPSDOs do not suffer.\n\nWhen the GPS signal becomes unavailable, the GPSDO goes into a state of [[Holdover in synchronization applications|holdover]], where it tries to maintain accurate timing using only the internal oscillator.\n\nSophisticated algorithms are used to compensate for the aging and temperature stability of the oscillator while the GPSDO is in holdover.<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1109/FREQ.1996.560284|isbn = 0-7803-3309-8|chapter = Adaptive temperature compensation of GPS disciplined quartz and rubidium oscillators|title = Proceedings of 1996 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium|year = 1996|last1 = Penrod|first1 = B.M.|pages = 980\u2013987}}</ref>\n\nThe use of [[Error analysis for the Global Positioning System#GPS SA|Selective Availability]] (SA) prior to May 2000 restricted the accuracy of GPS signals available for civilian use and in turn presented challenges to the accuracy of GPSDO derived timing.

This guarantees frequency accuracy at the expense of high phase noise and jitter, a degradation that true GPSDOs do not suffer.\n\nWhen the GPS signal becomes unavailable, the GPSDO goes into a state of [[Holdover in synchronization applications|holdover]], where it tries to maintain accurate timing using only the internal oscillator.\n\nSophisticated algorithms are used to compensate for the aging and temperature stability of the oscillator while the GPSDO is in holdover.<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1109/FREQ.1996.560284|isbn = 0-7803-3309-8|chapter = Adaptive temperature compensation of GPS disciplined quartz and rubidium oscillators|title = Proceedings of 1996 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium|year = 1996|last1 = Penrod|first1 = B.M.|pages = 980\u2013987}}</ref>\n\nThe use of [[Error analysis for the Global Positioning System#GPS SA|Selective Availability]] (SA) prior to May 2000 restricted the accuracy of GPS signals available for civilian use and in turn presented challenges to the accuracy of GPSDO derived timing.

The pipelines are in significantly worse condition than those in other large networks nationwide, and there has been a recent history of serious failures.  The water supply to the region is also at significant risk during a severe earthquake, although some projects are underway to improve resilience.\n\nWater supplies to the Wellington urban area meet the requirements of the Health Act and conform with drinking water standards.  However, for some of the towns in the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa regions, there have been occasional non-conformances with the required standards for drinking water quality and safety.\n\nBenchmarking data published by Water New Zealand as part of their 2018/19 National Performance Review showed that capital expenditure on three waters assets in the Wellington urban area is well below the average of the expenditure on networks in most other major centres, and for the wastewater network, expenditure was the lowest out of the seven large networks in the review.\n<ref name=\"Capex\">{{cite web| url=https://www.waternz.org.nz/Category?Action=View&Category_id=1018| title= Annual capital expenditure per property connected to the network| publisher= Water New Zealand| accessdate=13 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Drinking water==\n===Regional water supply networks===\nThe supply of reticulated drinking water is regulated under the Health Act, and suppliers are registered and subject to a testing regime.

There are two large storage lakes that can be used to supplement the supply during these periods.\n\n====Hutt River catchment====\nThe [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt river]] water supply catchment covers almost 9,000 hectares of bush-clad mountains and valleys at the southern edge of the [[Tararua Forest Park]] and adjoining the [[Kaitoke Regional Park]]. Rainwater from tributary streams flows into the Hutt River and is intercepted at a [[weir]] at [[Kaitoke]], north of [[Upper Hutt]].  The water is then strained to remove sticks, leaves and silt, and piped through tunnels to the [[Te Marua]] Water Treatment Plant. Up to 150 million litres of water per day may be diverted from the Hutt River, provided an adequate flow is maintained downstream of the weir. The Hutt water supply catchment provides about 40 percent of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\n====Macaskill storage lakes====\nThere are two large storage lakes at Te Marua \u2013 the Macaskill Lakes. These lakes are filled from the Hutt River intake when the water is clean and there is sufficient flow available. Stored water is pumped from the lakes into the treatment plant when there is not enough water in the river to meet public demand.  The storage lakes are also used to meet demand when the river is too dirty \u2013 after heavy rainfall \u2013 or when it is in flood and the intake is closed to prevent rocks and gravel from entering the intake pipes.\n\nThe Macaskill Lakes are 17.3 metres deep and have a combined usable capacity of approximately 3,350 million litres, or enough to meet average water use for around 23 days.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nBuilding the lakes was first proposed in 1975. The construction of the two lakes proved difficult because of weather and on-site conditions, resulting in cost increases and litigation.  There were also problems with leaks after completion, leading to further litigation.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= O'Neill |first= Andrea |title= Upper Hutt lakes leak water and money |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |work= Stuff |location= |date= 30 June 2015|access-date= 7 April 2020 | archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412011422/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |archive-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Wainuiomata/Orongorongo rivers====\nThe Wainuiomata/Orongorongo water supply catchment area lies within the [[Remutaka Range]]s to the east of [[Wainuiomata]]. The collection area covers 7,600 hectares. Five low dams (weirs) with intake pipes provide water from the rivers to the Wainuiomata Water Treatment Plant. These catchment areas provide approximately 20% of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year.<ref name=\"Sources\"/>\n\n====Waiwhetu aquifer====\nThe Waiwhetu [[artesian aquifer]] is a zone of water-retaining sand, gravel and boulders beneath the Hutt Valley. Water from the Hutt River starts to flow underground around Taita Gorge. From Melling southwards, the water becomes naturally pressurised beneath a layer of hard clay. This pressurised zone, the Waiwhetu artesian aquifer, stretches as far south as the harbour. It is estimated to be up to 70 metres thick at its western edge against the Wellington fault line, and 20 metres thick at the eastern edge of the harbour. The pressure in the aquifer has resulted in several fresh water springs in the harbour floor.\n\nWater takes more than 12 months to pass through the aquifer to wells where it is extracted for distribution via the water network. Extraction is monitored and controlled to minimise the risk of [[saline intrusion]]. The Waiwhetu aquifer provides around 40 percent of the annual water supply.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nThe Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life) in Buick Street, [[Petone]] provides untreated water from the aquifer free to the public. \n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/\n| title= Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life)| publisher= Jackson Street Program| archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409022604/https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/|archive-date=9 April 2020| accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/petone_water.pdf| title= Hutt City \u2013 Petone's Artesian Water |publisher= Hutt City Council |date=13 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513230407/http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/Petone_water.pdf|archive-date= 5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Water sources for remaining areas===\n\nThe water sources for the South Wairarapa District Council area are the [[Waiohine River|Waiohine]] catchment for Featherston, the Kuratawhiti Street bore for Greytown residents, and the Herricks bore field for users in Martinborough. \n<ref name=\"SWDC\">{{cite web| url=https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage#water| title= Water and sewerage| publisher= South Wairarapa District Council | accessdate=7 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409085630/https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage |archive-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supplies for the Kapiti Coast region are sourced from combination of bores and surface water from the [[Waikanae]] River.\n<ref name=\"Kapiti_water\">{{cite web| url=https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/| title= Water supply| publisher= Kapiti Coast District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091317/https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/ |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supply for the Carterton district comes from the Kaipatangata Stream and two underground bores.\n<ref name=\"Carterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water | title= Water supply| publisher= Carterton District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091614/https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water/ |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nMasterton's drinking water is sourced Waingawa River, about 10&nbsp;km west of Masterton.\n<ref name=\"Masterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/| title= Services \u2013 Water| publisher= Masterton District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091846/https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/%7C |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Water treatment===\n====Wellington urban area====\nThere are four [[Water purification|water treatment]] plants located in the Hutt Valley (Te Marua, Waterloo, Gear Island and Wainuiomata).

The base case studies show that in a major earthquake, the Wellington region would be likely to lose its water supplies for a period of between 3 and 6 months, with treated water potentially not available for up to 12 months.  A wide range of risk mitigation projects were identified and included in modelling to show the potential improvements in resilience.  The risk mitigation projects included works to reduce the risk posed to the bulk water supply that runs parallel to the line of the main Wellington fault.  The modelling of outages indicates that the outage time would reduce to between one and three months, if all the identified risk mitigations were implemented.\n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf| title= Wellington Lifelines Project \u2013 Regional Resilience Report | publisher= Wellington Region Emergency Management Office| date= Oct 2019| accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200411040711/https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe report called on its 16 member organisations to help deliver 25 key infrastructure projects across the region over the next two decades, at a cost of $5.3b.

This study estimated that for a magnitude 7.5 Richter scale earthquake, there would be about 30 breaks on the main trunk pipelines and 60 breaks on the smaller branch lines. There could be as many as 8,000 breaks in the Wellington City local supply network. Bulk water supply and treatment facilities are also expected to suffer damage requiring repair. Wellington Water and Greater Wellington Regional Council estimated that it would take around 60\u201070 days to restore bulk water supply to parts of the Wellington metropolitan area.It could take several years to fully repair damage to the local water distribution network resulting from a severe earthquake, as much of the network may have to be rebuilt.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215\n|title= Prince of Wales \u2013 Omaroro Reservoir \u2013 Town Belt Easement Request \u2013 Includes Appendix A|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 1 June 2017|website= |publisher= Wellington Water |access-date= 12 April 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412204753/https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215|archive-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018, an independent panel recommended that Wellington City Council confirm the designation of the easement for the reservoir.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir\n|title= Green light for Om\u0101roro/Prince of Wales Park reservoir|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 14 May 2018|website= |publisher= Wellington City Council |access-date= 12 April 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412212844/https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir|archive-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe reservoir provides a significant increase in water storage for the city, and forms part of the city's resilience strategy to help ensure that fresh water is available to residents after a natural disaster or major network failure.\n\nPreparatory earthworks for the project commenced in February 2019.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= Hunt|first=Tom |date= 5 February 2019|title=  Reservoir earthworks marks beginning of Wellington's Mt Cook becoming a 'building-site suburb'|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|work= Stuff|location= |access-date=12 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412010647/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|archive-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stormwater==\n\n===Pipeline age and condition===\nThe 2018/19 National Performance Review published by Water New Zealand compares the average stormwater pipeline age and condition across networks.

The pipelines are 9&nbsp;km long and are about 25 years old.  There are two in parallel allowing one to operate while maintenance can occur on the other pipe.  In this incident both pipes failed at the same time.  \n\nTo avoid discharging the sludge into the ocean, a fleet of sewage trucks was mobilized to carry about one million litres of sludge a day to the dewatering plant at Carey\u2019s Gully. Up to 150 round trips each day were required, with trucks sometimes operating around the clock to keep up with the volume. \n\nThe break in the pipelines was located 200&nbsp;m inside a sewage tunnel beneath Mt Albert, making repairs a significant challenge. The repair solution required the manufacture in Germany of a custom-made polyester woven liner.  This liner was winched from one end of each pipe to the other, and then expanded to essentially act as a new pipeline within the old one.  Specialists from the manufacturer flew to New Zealand to assist in the installation, but were required to spend 14 days in isolation because of the border restrictions imposed in response to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand|COVID-19 pandemic]].\n<ref>{{cite news| last= Thomas | first= Rachel |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/408078/broken-mt-albert-sewer-tunnel-pipe-costly-effort-to-divert-millions-of-litres-of-sludge| title= Broken Mt Albert sewer tunnel pipe: Costly effort to divert millions of litres of sludge| work= RNZ| date=24 January 2020 |accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415014537/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/408078/broken-mt-albert-sewer-tunnel-pipe-costly-effort-to-divert-millions-of-litres-of-sludge | archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news |last=Campbell|first=Georgina|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12318739| title= Coronavirus: Major Wellington wastewater pipe repairs delayed| work= NZ Herald| date=21 March 2020 |accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415035134/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12318739 | archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=127088 | title= Six German experts will fix broken sludge pipeline next month | work= Scoop| date=5 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415021810/http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=127088| archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n====South Wairarapa====\nAlmost half a million litres of partially and fully treated wastewater was discharged into the [[Ruamahanga River]] near Martinborough in two incidents in January 2020, as a result of issues at a treatment plant.

The pipelines are in significantly worse condition than those in other large networks nationwide, and there has been a recent history of serious failures.  The water supply to the region is also at significant risk during a severe earthquake, although some projects are underway to improve resilience.\n\nWater supplies to the Wellington urban area meet the requirements of the Health Act and conform with drinking water standards.

There are two large storage lakes that can be used to supplement the supply during these periods.\n\n====Hutt River catchment====\nThe [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt river]] water supply catchment covers almost 9,000 hectares of bush-clad mountains and valleys at the southern edge of the [[Tararua Forest Park]] and adjoining the [[Kaitoke Regional Park]]. Rainwater from tributary streams flows into the Hutt River and is intercepted at a [[weir]] at [[Kaitoke]], north of [[Upper Hutt]].  The water is then strained to remove sticks, leaves and silt, and piped through tunnels to the [[Te Marua]] Water Treatment Plant. Up to 150 million litres of water per day may be diverted from the Hutt River, provided an adequate flow is maintained downstream of the weir. The Hutt water supply catchment provides about 40 percent of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\n====Macaskill storage lakes====\nThere are two large storage lakes at Te Marua \u2013 the Macaskill Lakes. These lakes are filled from the Hutt River intake when the water is clean and there is sufficient flow available. Stored water is pumped from the lakes into the treatment plant when there is not enough water in the river to meet public demand.  The storage lakes are also used to meet demand when the river is too dirty \u2013 after heavy rainfall \u2013 or when it is in flood and the intake is closed to prevent rocks and gravel from entering the intake pipes.\n\nThe Macaskill Lakes are 17.3 metres deep and have a combined usable capacity of approximately 3,350 million litres, or enough to meet average water use for around 23 days.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nBuilding the lakes was first proposed in 1975. The construction of the two lakes proved difficult because of weather and on-site conditions, resulting in cost increases and litigation.  There were also problems with leaks after completion, leading to further litigation.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= O'Neill |first= Andrea |title= Upper Hutt lakes leak water and money |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |work= Stuff |location= |date= 30 June 2015|access-date= 7 April 2020 | archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412011422/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |archive-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Wainuiomata/Orongorongo rivers====\nThe Wainuiomata/Orongorongo water supply catchment area lies within the [[Remutaka Range]]s to the east of [[Wainuiomata]]. The collection area covers 7,600 hectares. Five low dams (weirs) with intake pipes provide water from the rivers to the Wainuiomata Water Treatment Plant. These catchment areas provide approximately 20% of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year.<ref name=\"Sources\"/>\n\n====Waiwhetu aquifer====\nThe Waiwhetu [[artesian aquifer]] is a zone of water-retaining sand, gravel and boulders beneath the Hutt Valley. Water from the Hutt River starts to flow underground around Taita Gorge. From Melling southwards, the water becomes naturally pressurised beneath a layer of hard clay. This pressurised zone, the Waiwhetu artesian aquifer, stretches as far south as the harbour. It is estimated to be up to 70 metres thick at its western edge against the Wellington fault line, and 20 metres thick at the eastern edge of the harbour. The pressure in the aquifer has resulted in several fresh water springs in the harbour floor.\n\nWater takes more than 12 months to pass through the aquifer to wells where it is extracted for distribution via the water network. Extraction is monitored and controlled to minimise the risk of [[saline intrusion]]. The Waiwhetu aquifer provides around 40 percent of the annual water supply.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nThe Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life) in Buick Street, [[Petone]] provides untreated water from the aquifer free to the public. \n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/\n| title= Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life)| publisher= Jackson Street Program| archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409022604/https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/|archive-date=9 April 2020| accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/petone_water.pdf| title= Hutt City \u2013 Petone's Artesian Water |publisher= Hutt City Council |date=13 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513230407/http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/Petone_water.pdf|archive-date= 5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Water sources for remaining areas===\n\nThe water sources for the South Wairarapa District Council area are the [[Waiohine River|Waiohine]] catchment for Featherston, the Kuratawhiti Street bore for Greytown residents, and the Herricks bore field for users in Martinborough. \n<ref name=\"SWDC\">{{cite web| url=https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage#water| title= Water and sewerage| publisher= South Wairarapa District Council | accessdate=7 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409085630/https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage |archive-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supplies for the Kapiti Coast region are sourced from combination of bores and surface water from the [[Waikanae]] River.\n<ref name=\"Kapiti_water\">{{cite web| url=https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/| title= Water supply| publisher= Kapiti Coast District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091317/https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/ |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supply for the Carterton district comes from the Kaipatangata Stream and two underground bores.\n<ref name=\"Carterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water | title= Water supply| publisher= Carterton District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091614/https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water/ |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nMasterton's drinking water is sourced Waingawa River, about 10&nbsp;km west of Masterton.\n<ref name=\"Masterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/| title= Services \u2013 Water| publisher= Masterton District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091846/https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/%7C |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Water treatment===\n====Wellington urban area====\nThere are four [[Water purification|water treatment]] plants located in the Hutt Valley (Te Marua, Waterloo, Gear Island and Wainuiomata).

The base case studies show that in a major earthquake, the Wellington region would be likely to lose its water supplies for a period of between 3 and 6 months, with treated water potentially not available for up to 12 months.  A wide range of risk mitigation projects were identified and included in modelling to show the potential improvements in resilience.  The risk mitigation projects included works to reduce the risk posed to the bulk water supply that runs parallel to the line of the main Wellington fault.  The modelling of outages indicates that the outage time would reduce to between one and three months, if all the identified risk mitigations were implemented.\n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf| title= Wellington Lifelines Project \u2013 Regional Resilience Report | publisher= Wellington Region Emergency Management Office| date= Oct 2019| accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200411040711/https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe report called on its 16 member organisations to help deliver 25 key infrastructure projects across the region over the next two decades, at a cost of $5.3b.

This study estimated that for a magnitude 7.5 Richter scale earthquake, there would be about 30 breaks on the main trunk pipelines and 60 breaks on the smaller branch lines. There could be as many as 8,000 breaks in the Wellington City local supply network. Bulk water supply and treatment facilities are also expected to suffer damage requiring repair. Wellington Water and Greater Wellington Regional Council estimated that it would take around 60\u201070 days to restore bulk water supply to parts of the Wellington metropolitan area.It could take several years to fully repair damage to the local water distribution network resulting from a severe earthquake, as much of the network may have to be rebuilt.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215\n|title= Prince of Wales \u2013 Omaroro Reservoir \u2013 Town Belt Easement Request \u2013 Includes Appendix A|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 1 June 2017|website= |publisher= Wellington Water |access-date= 12 April 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412204753/https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215|archive-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018, an independent panel recommended that Wellington City Council confirm the designation of the easement for the reservoir.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir\n|title= Green light for Om\u0101roro/Prince of Wales Park reservoir|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 14 May 2018|website= |publisher= Wellington City Council |access-date= 12 April 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412212844/https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir|archive-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe reservoir provides a significant increase in water storage for the city, and forms part of the city's resilience strategy to help ensure that fresh water is available to residents after a natural disaster or major network failure.\n\nPreparatory earthworks for the project commenced in February 2019.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= Hunt|first=Tom |date= 5 February 2019|title=  Reservoir earthworks marks beginning of Wellington's Mt Cook becoming a 'building-site suburb'|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|work= Stuff|location= |access-date=12 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412010647/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|archive-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stormwater==\n\n===Pipeline age and condition===\nThe 2018/19 National Performance Review published by Water New Zealand compares the average stormwater pipeline age and condition across networks.

The pipelines are 9&nbsp;km long and are about 25 years old.  There are two in parallel allowing one to operate while maintenance can occur on the other pipe.  In this incident both pipes failed at the same time.  \n\nTo avoid discharging the sludge into the ocean, a fleet of sewage trucks was mobilized to carry about one million litres of sludge a day to the dewatering plant at Carey\u2019s Gully. Up to 150 round trips each day were required, with trucks sometimes operating around the clock to keep up with the volume. \n\nThe break in the pipelines was located 200&nbsp;m inside a sewage tunnel beneath Mt Albert, making repairs a significant challenge. The repair solution required the manufacture in Germany of a custom-made polyester woven liner.  This liner was winched from one end of each pipe to the other, and then expanded to essentially act as a new pipeline within the old one.  Specialists from the manufacturer flew to New Zealand to assist in the installation, but were required to spend 14 days in isolation because of the border restrictions imposed in response to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand|COVID-19 pandemic]].\n<ref>{{cite news| last= Thomas | first= Rachel |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/408078/broken-mt-albert-sewer-tunnel-pipe-costly-effort-to-divert-millions-of-litres-of-sludge| title= Broken Mt Albert sewer tunnel pipe: Costly effort to divert millions of litres of sludge| work= RNZ| date=24 January 2020 |accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415014537/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/408078/broken-mt-albert-sewer-tunnel-pipe-costly-effort-to-divert-millions-of-litres-of-sludge | archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news |last=Campbell|first=Georgina|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12318739| title= Coronavirus: Major Wellington wastewater pipe repairs delayed| work= NZ Herald| date=21 March 2020 |accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415035134/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12318739 | archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=127088 | title= Six German experts will fix broken sludge pipeline next month | work= Scoop| date=5 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415021810/http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=127088| archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n====South Wairarapa====\nAlmost half a million litres of partially and fully treated wastewater was discharged into the [[Ruamahanga River]] near Martinborough in two incidents in January 2020, as a result of issues at a treatment plant.

The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa.

He envisioned Sand Springs as a haven for orphans and widows.  He helped found and develop Sand Springs as a model city that included all components of a total community.<ref name=\"EOHC-SS\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 Carl N.

The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa. The townsite was laid out the same year.<ref name = \"EOHC-SS\"/> Sand Springs was incorporated as a city in 1912, with a population of 400.<ref name=\"Davenport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|title=History of Sand Springs, OK|website=www.tulsaokhistory.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112750/http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Page also built the Sand Springs Power Plant, on the southeast corner of Main Street and Morrow Road.

Several significant additions were made to the facility, and it was the sole source of electric power for Sand Springs until 1947.<ref>National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. \"Sand Springs Power Plant.\"</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest manufacturing industries were: Kerr Glass Manufacturing; Commander Mills, Kerr, Hubbard and Kelley Lamp, and Chimney; Southwest Box Company; and Sinclair Prairie Refining Company.

Blavatsky, who claimed to be in contact with a [[Great White Brotherhood|Great White Lodge]] of Himalayan Adepts, mentions Shambhala in several places, but without giving it especially great emphasis.\n\nLater [[esotericism|esoteric]] writers further emphasized and elaborated on the concept of a hidden land inhabited by a [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|hidden mystic brotherhood]] whose members labor for the good of humanity. [[Alice A. Bailey]] claims Shamballa (her spelling) is an extra-dimensional or spiritual reality on the [[etheric plane]], a spiritual centre where the governing [[deity]] of [[Earth]], [[Sanat Kumara]], dwells as the highest [[Avatar]] of the Planetary [[Logos]] of Earth, and is said to be an expression of the Will of God.<ref>Bailey, Alice A, ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' 1932 Lucis Trust. 1925, p 753</ref>\n\n===Expeditions and location hypotheses===\n[[Nicholas Roerich|Nicholas]] and [[Helena Roerich]] led a 1924\u20131928 expedition aimed at Shambhala.<ref>Archer, Kenneth.

Among other things, in a secret laboratory affiliated with the secret police, Bokii and Barchenko experimented with Buddhist spiritual techniques to try to find a key for engineering perfect communist human beings.<ref name=\"Znamenski\">Znamenski (2011)</ref> They contemplated a special expedition to Inner Asia to retrieve the wisdom of Shambhala \u2013 the project fell through as a result of intrigues within the Soviet intelligence service, as well as rival efforts of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Soviet Foreign Commissariat]] that sent its own expedition to Tibet in 1924.\n\nFrench Buddhist [[Alexandra David-N\u00e9el]] associated Shambhala with [[Balkh]] in present-day Afghanistan, also offering the Persian ''Sham-i-Bala'', \"elevated candle\" as an etymology of its name.<ref>David-N\u00e9el, A. ''[[Les Nouvelles litt\u00e9raires]]'' ;1954, p.1</ref> \nIn a similar vein, the [[Gurdjieff]]ian [[J. G.

Cacella in 1627  headed to [[Tashilhunpo]], the seat of the [[Panchen Lama]] and, discovering his mistake, returned to India.<ref>Bernbaum, Edwin. (1980). ''The Way to Shambhala'', pp. 18-19.

Blavatsky, who claimed to be in contact with a [[Great White Brotherhood|Great White Lodge]] of Himalayan Adepts, mentions Shambhala in several places, but without giving it especially great emphasis.\n\nLater [[esotericism|esoteric]] writers further emphasized and elaborated on the concept of a hidden land inhabited by a [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|hidden mystic brotherhood]] whose members labor for the good of humanity. [[Alice A. Bailey]] claims Shamballa (her spelling) is an extra-dimensional or spiritual reality on the [[etheric plane]], a spiritual centre where the governing [[deity]] of [[Earth]], [[Sanat Kumara]], dwells as the highest [[Avatar]] of the Planetary [[Logos]] of Earth, and is said to be an expression of the Will of God.<ref>Bailey, Alice A, ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' 1932 Lucis Trust. 1925, p 753</ref>\n\n===Expeditions and location hypotheses===\n[[Nicholas Roerich|Nicholas]] and [[Helena Roerich]] led a 1924\u20131928 expedition aimed at Shambhala.<ref>Archer, Kenneth. ''Roerich East & West''. Parkstone Press 1999, p.94</ref>\n\nInspired by [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] lore and several visiting Mongol lamas, [[Gleb Bokii]], the chief Bolshevik [[cryptographer]] and one of the bosses of the [[Soviet secret police]], along with his writer friend Alexander Barchenko, embarked on a quest for Shambhala, in an attempt to merge Kalachakra-tantra and ideas of Communism in the 1920s. Among other things, in a secret laboratory affiliated with the secret police, Bokii and Barchenko experimented with Buddhist spiritual techniques to try to find a key for engineering perfect communist human beings.<ref name=\"Znamenski\">Znamenski (2011)</ref> They contemplated a special expedition to Inner Asia to retrieve the wisdom of Shambhala \u2013 the project fell through as a result of intrigues within the Soviet intelligence service, as well as rival efforts of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Soviet Foreign Commissariat]] that sent its own expedition to Tibet in 1924.\n\nFrench Buddhist [[Alexandra David-N\u00e9el]] associated Shambhala with [[Balkh]] in present-day Afghanistan, also offering the Persian ''Sham-i-Bala'', \"elevated candle\" as an etymology of its name.<ref>David-N\u00e9el, A. ''[[Les Nouvelles litt\u00e9raires]]'' ;1954, p.1</ref> \nIn a similar vein, the [[Gurdjieff]]ian [[J. G. Bennett]] published speculation that Shambalha was ''Shams-i-Balkh'', a [[Bactria]]n sun temple.<ref>Bennett, J.G: \"Gurdjieff: Making a New World\". Bennett notes [[Idries Shah]] as the source of the suggestion.</ref>\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nShambhala may have been the inspiration for [[Shangri-La]], a paradise on Earth hidden in a Tibetan valley, which features in the 1933 novel ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' by British author [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]].<ref name=\"Wood11\">{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Michael|title=BBC - History - Ancient History in depth: Shangri-La|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/shangri_la_01.shtml|accessdate=28 February 2018|work=BBC|date=17 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the mythical city was depicted in the critically-acclaimed action-adventure video game [[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]].
