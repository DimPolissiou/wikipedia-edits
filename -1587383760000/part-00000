The spread spectrum LoRa modulation is performed by representing each bit of payload information by multiple chirps of information. The rate at which the spread information is sent is referred to as the symbol rate, the ratio between the nominal symbol rate and chirp rate is the spreading factor (SF) and represents the number of symbols sent per bit of information.<ref name=\"modbas\" /> LoRa can trade off data rate for sensitivity with a fixed channel bandwidth by selecting the amount of spread used (a selectable radio parameter from 7 to 12). Lower SF means more chirps are sent per second; hence, you can encode more data per second. Higher SF implies fewer chirps per second; hence, there are fewer data to encode per second. Compared to lower SF, sending the same amount of data with higher SF needs more transmission time, known as airtime. More airtime means that the modem is up and running longer and consuming more energy. The benefit of high SF is that more extended airtime gives the receiver more opportunities to sample the signal power which results in better sensitivity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/article/how-spreading-factor-affects-lorawan-device-battery-life|title=How Spreading Factor affects LoRaWAN device battery life|last=Qoitech|website=The Things Network|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, LoRa uses [[Forward error correction|Forward Error Correction coding]] to improve resilience against interference. LoRa's high range is characterized by high wireless [[link budget]]s of around 155&nbsp;dB to 170&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.semtech.com/title-10-things-about-lorawan-nb-iot|title=10 Things About LoRaWAN & NB-IoT|last=Mohan|first=Vivek|website=blog.semtech.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n==LoRaWAN==\nSince LoRa defines the lower physical layer, the upper networking layers were lacking. LoRaWAN is one of several protocols that were developed to define the upper layers of the network. LoRaWAN is a cloud-based [[medium access control]] (MAC) layer protocol but acts mainly as a network layer protocol for managing communication between [[LPWAN]] [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] and end-node devices as a routing protocol, maintained by the LoRa Alliance.\n\nLoRaWAN defines the communication protocol and system architecture for the network, while the LoRa physical layer enables the long-range communication link. LoRaWAN is also responsible for managing the communication frequencies, [[Data-rate units|data rate]], and power for all devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers|title=LoRaWAN For Developers|website=www.lora-alliance.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> Devices in the network are asynchronous and transmit when they have data available to send.

The spread spectrum LoRa modulation is performed by representing each bit of payload information by multiple chirps of information. The rate at which the spread information is sent is referred to as the symbol rate, the ratio between the nominal symbol rate and chirp rate is the spreading factor (SF) and represents the number of symbols sent per bit of information.<ref name=\"modbas\" /> LoRa can trade off data rate for sensitivity with a fixed channel bandwidth by selecting the amount of spread used (a selectable radio parameter from 7 to 12). Lower SF means more chirps are sent per second; hence, you can encode more data per second. Higher SF implies fewer chirps per second; hence, there are fewer data to encode per second. Compared to lower SF, sending the same amount of data with higher SF needs more transmission time, known as airtime. More airtime means that the modem is up and running longer and consuming more energy. The benefit of high SF is that more extended airtime gives the receiver more opportunities to sample the signal power which results in better sensitivity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/article/how-spreading-factor-affects-lorawan-device-battery-life|title=How Spreading Factor affects LoRaWAN device battery life|last=Qoitech|website=The Things Network|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, LoRa uses [[Forward error correction|Forward Error Correction coding]] to improve resilience against interference. LoRa's high range is characterized by high wireless [[link budget]]s of around 155&nbsp;dB to 170&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.semtech.com/title-10-things-about-lorawan-nb-iot|title=10 Things About LoRaWAN & NB-IoT|last=Mohan|first=Vivek|website=blog.semtech.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>\n\n==LoRaWAN==\nSince LoRa defines the lower physical layer, the upper networking layers were lacking. LoRaWAN is one of several protocols that were developed to define the upper layers of the network. LoRaWAN is a cloud-based [[medium access control]] (MAC) layer protocol but acts mainly as a network layer protocol for managing communication between [[LPWAN]] [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] and end-node devices as a routing protocol, maintained by the LoRa Alliance.\n\nLoRaWAN defines the communication protocol and system architecture for the network, while the LoRa physical layer enables the long-range communication link. LoRaWAN is also responsible for managing the communication frequencies, [[Data-rate units|data rate]], and power for all devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers|title=LoRaWAN For Developers|website=www.lora-alliance.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> Devices in the network are asynchronous and transmit when they have data available to send.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to one of robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Judicial Comissioner Choo Han Teck, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial, accepting Abdul Nasir's defence that he had accidentally stepped onto Fujii while rejecting the prosecution's arguement that he had intentionally stamped on Fujii and killed her, therefore he acquitted Abdul Nasir of murder and found him guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced him to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal, but by a split decision of 2-1, the appeal was dismissed. However, that did not put an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee (who was eventually hanged for drug trafficking) during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being abducted. On 3 March 1997, Abdul Nasir was found guilty of kidnapping and despite the urgings of the prosecution to impose the death sentence on Abdul Nasir, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray accepted that Abdul Nasir did not make any threats on the hostages' lives and never harmed the hostages, and thus he sentenced Abdul Nasir to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. Justice Sinnathuray also ordered that Abdul Nasir's life sentence should be run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

The charge was then reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder; Somsak pleaded guilty and he was then sentenced to 10 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane.\n\n===2006===\n* 15 February 2006: In the first crime involving firearms since 2000, Tan Chor Jin, nicknamed the \"One-eyed Dragon\" forcefully entered the flat of Lim Hock Soon, a nightclub owner. He seized Lim's family valuables before tying up Lim, his wife, his daughter and Lim's maid. He then proceeded to shoot and kill Lim, where five of the six bullets hit Lim. He managed to flee the country with the help of his accomplice, Ho Yueh Keong. He was nabbed by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]] 10 days later at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur before being extradited back to Singapore on 1 March 2006. Initially charged with murder, his charge was amended to discharging of firearm. During the trial, Tan choose to be unrepresented. In one of his defence, he claimed that Lim was about to hit him with a chair and thus shot Lim in self-defence. But his defence fell flat when the prosecution noted that Lim was tied up and could not have lifted the chair. On 22 May 2007, he was found guilty and sentenced to hang. (Under Singapore law, offenders charged with unlawful discharge of firearms will be sentenced to death, even with no intention to kill.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/AOA1973|title=Arms Offences Act - Singapore Statutes Online|last=|first=|date=|website=sso.agc.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> The Court of Appeal also dismissed Tan's appeal against his death sentence on 30 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tan Chor Jin v Public Prosecutor [2008] 4 SLR 306; [2008] SGCA 32|url=http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/court-of-appeal-judgments/13530-tan-chor-jin-v-public-prosecutor-2008-4-slr-306-2008-sgca-32|website=SingaporeLaw.sg|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130170543/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/court-of-appeal-judgments/13530-tan-chor-jin-v-public-prosecutor-2008-4-slr-306-2008-sgca-32|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He was subsequently executed on 9 January 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Teo|first1=Wan Gek|title=Donor 'designated kidney expressly' for Tang|newspaper=The Straits Times|location=Singapore|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/the+Straits+Times/Story/A1Story20090111-113780.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=11 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131175029/http://news.asiaone.com/News/the+Straits+Times/Story/A1Story20090111-113780.html|archive-date=31 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The suspected murderer who shocked Singapore|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2007/01/22/2003345842|accessdate=25 January 2015|agency=Taipei Times|date=22 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607153720/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2007/01/22/2003345842|archive-date=2014-06-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/guilty-as-charged-one-eyed-dragon-tan-chor-jin-shot-nightclub-owner|title=Guilty As Charged: 'One-eyed Dragon' Tan Chor Jin shot nightclub owner|last=Hoe|first=Pei Shan|date=2016-05-17|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> His accomplice, Ho, was charged on 15 July 2015 for harbouring Tan out of Singapore.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alkhatib |first1=Shaffiq |url=https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore-news/man-charged-harbouring-one-eyed-dragon |title=Man charged with harbouring 'One-Eyed Dragon' |website=The New Paper |access-date=13 October 2019 |date=15 July 2015}}</ref> Ho pleaded guilty on 8 August 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hussain |first1=Amir |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/one-eyed-dragon-tan-chor-jins-accomplice-found-guilty-after-9-years-on-the |title='One-eyed Dragon' Tan Chor Jin's accomplice found guilty after 9 years on the run |website=The Straits Times |access-date=13 October 2019 |date=8 August 2016}}</ref> Two days later, he was sentenced to a 20-month jail term.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hussain |first1=Amir |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/one-eyed-dragon-tan-chor-jins-accomplice-jailed-20-months-after-9-years-on |title='One-eyed Dragon' Tan Chor Jin's accomplice jailed 20 months after 9 years on the run |website=The Straits Times |access-date=13 October 2019 |date=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n*June 2006: Lawyer David Rasif fled with S$11.3 million of his clients' money, one of the largest amount misappropriated by a rogue Singaporean lawyer.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to one of robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Judicial Comissioner Choo Han Teck, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial, accepting Abdul Nasir's defence that he had accidentally stepped onto Fujii while rejecting the prosecution's arguement that he had intentionally stamped on Fujii and killed her, therefore he acquitted Abdul Nasir of murder and found him guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced him to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal, but by a split decision of 2-1, the appeal was dismissed. However, that did not put an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee (who was eventually hanged for drug trafficking) during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being abducted. Abdul Nasir was later convicted of kidnapping and despite the urgings of the prosecution to impose the death sentence on Abdul Nasir, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray sentenced him to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane in January 1997. Justice Sinnathuray also ordered that Abdul Nasir's life sentence should be run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir, against the advice of his lawyer Subhas Anandan, took upon himself to file an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.
