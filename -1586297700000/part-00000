She is best known for her groundbreaking comedy variety show, ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', originally aired on [[CBS]]. It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects. Her film roles include ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972),  ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1974), ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992), and ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008). On television, she has appeared in other sketch shows; in dramatic roles in ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]'' (1974) and ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]'' (1979); in various well-regarded guest roles, such as in ''[[Mad About You]],'' for which she won an Emmy Award; and in specials with [[Julie Andrews]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Beverly Sills]], and others. She returned to the Broadway stage in 1995 in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]],'' for which she was again nominated for a [[Tony Award]].\n\nBurnett has written and narrated several [[memoir]]s, earning [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations for almost all of them, and a win for ''[[In Such Good Company|In Such Good Company: Eleven Years Of Laughter, Mayhem, And Fun In The Sandbox]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/carol-burnett|title=Artist Carol Burnett|website=www.grammy.com|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-grammys-2017-nominations-winners-list-20161205-story.html |title=2017 Grammy Awards: Complete list of nominees |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 12, 2017|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n  \nIn 2005, she was recognized as \"one of America's most cherished entertainers\" and awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] \"for enhancing the lives of millions of Americans and for her extraordinary contributions to American entertainment.\"<ref>{{cite press release|date=November 9, 2005 |title= Citations for Recipients of the 2005 Presidential Medal of Freedom |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051109-10.html|location=Washington, DC|publisher=The White House|agency= Office of the Press Secretary|access-date=June 19, 2018}}</ref> In 2013, Burnett was awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] at the [[John F.

During her junior year at UCLA in 1954, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a party in place of their class final that had been canceled (which required a performance in front of an audience).

His conditions were simply that the loans were to be repaid within five years, his name was never to be revealed, and if she achieved success, she would help other aspiring talents to pursue their artistic dreams.

They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars like [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and this opened doors for several of the girls. She was cast in a minor role on ''The [[Paul Winchell]] and Jerry Mahoney Show'' in 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist's dummy on the popular children's program. This role led to her starring role opposite [[Buddy Hackett]] in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' from 1956-57.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Carol burnett garry moore 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Burnett and Larry Blyden from ''The Garry Moore Show'', 1960]]\nAfter ''Stanley'', Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. She eventually bounced back a few months later as a highly popular performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called \"I Made a Fool of Myself Over [[John Foster Dulles]]\" (Dulles was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] at the time). In 1957, she performed this number on both ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', hosted by [[Jack Paar]], and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Dulles was asked about her on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' and joked,  \u201cI never discuss matters of the heart in public.\u201d<ref name=MTprize/>\n\nShe also worked as a regular on one of television's earliest game shows, ''[[Pantomime Quiz]]'', during this time.

She portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman who later became her signature alter-ego.

Among other things, it parodied films (''Went With the Wind!'' for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''), television (''As the Stomach Turns'' for the soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'') and commercials. Musical numbers were also a frequent feature. Burnett and her team struck gold with the original sketch \"The Family\", which eventually was spun off into its own television show called ''[[Mama's Family]]'', starring [[Vicki Lawrence]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nShe opened most shows with an impromptu question-and-answer session with the audience, lasting a few minutes, during which she often demonstrated her ability to humorously ad lib.

This was done to let her know that she was doing well and that she loved her; during the show's run, her grandmother died. On an ''[[Intimate Portrait]]'' episode on Burnett, she tearfully recalled her grandmother's last moments: \"She said to my husband Joe from her hospital bed 'Joe, you see that spider up there?' There was no spider, but Joe said he did anyhow. She said 'Every few minutes a big spider jumps on that little spider and they go at it like rabbits!!' And then she died. There's laughter in everything!\"<ref>[[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Channel]]'s ''Intimate Portrait'' episode on Burnett</ref> She continued the tradition of tugging her ear. The show ceased production in 1978. Four post-script episodes were produced and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the summer of 1979 under the title, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'' basically using the same format and, with the exception of Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner, the same supporting cast. Beginning in 1977, the comedy sketches of her series were edited into half-hour episodes for syndication entitled ''[[Carol Burnett and Friends]]'', which, for many years, proved to be extremely popular in syndication, and in January 2015, it began airing on [[MeTV]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe show's enduring popularity surprised many when a 2001 retrospective containing outtakes and discussions with the cast, and a tribute to [[Bob Mackie]], drew in 30 million viewers, topping the Emmy Awards as well as all but the final game of that year's [[World Series]].<ref name= \"Heartbreak\"/> Her Grammy-winning memoir ''In Such Good Company'' is about the show, and Burnett tells about how it was developed, with anecdotes about improvisations, the cast, crew, and guests.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s: Film roles===\n[[File:Carol Burnett - 1974.jpg|right|thumb|Burnett in 1974]]\nBurnett starred in a few films while her variety show was running, including ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972). She was nominated for an Emmy in 1974 for her role in the drama ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]''. After her show ended, she assumed a number of roles that departed from comedy. She appeared in several dramatic roles, most notably in the television movie ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]''. She appeared as Beatrice O'Reilly in the film ''Life of The Party: The Story of Beatrice'', a story about a woman fighting her alcoholism. Her other film work includes [[Alan Alda]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), [[John Huston]]'s ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), and [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992). \n\n''Voice Roles'''\nIn 2008, she had her second role as an animated character in the film ''[[Horton Hears a Who!

In 1974, she appeared at [[the Muny]] Theatre in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'' with [[Rock Hudson]], and eleven years later, she took the supporting role of Carlotta Campion in the 1985 concert performance of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]''. She made frequent appearances as a panelist on the game show ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', an association she maintained until the early 1980s (in fact, [[Mark Goodson]] awarded her his Silver Password All-Stars Award for best celebrity player; she's also credited with coming up with the title ''[[Password Plus]]'', when it was originally planned to be titled ''Password '79'').\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, she made several attempts at starting a new variety program. She also appeared briefly on ''The Carol Burnett Show's'' \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches spinoff, ''[[Mama's Family]]'', as her stormy character, [[Eunice Higgins]]. She played the matriarch in the [[cult following|cult]] comedy miniseries ''[[Fresno (TV miniseries)|Fresno]]'', which parodied the primetime soap opera ''[[Falcon Crest]]''. She returned to TV in the mid-1990s as a supporting character on the sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]'', playing Theresa Stemple, the mother of main character Jamie Buchman ([[Helen Hunt]]), for which she won another Emmy Award. In 1995, after an absence of 30 years, she was back on Broadway in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]]'', for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. Four years later, she appeared in the Broadway revue ''[[Putting It Together]]''. In 2014, Burnett joined two-time Tony Award Winner, Brian Dennehy, on Broadway in A. R. Gurney's ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.\n\nBurnett had long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'', and realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.\n\nIn 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress \u2013 Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]].

National Enquirer, Inc'''\n{{main|Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor. The charwoman is shown mopping the floor in the porn shop, and the characters subsequently discuss Burnett's ear tug and make a crude comment about it. Burnett and her company requested that Fox remove all references to her, the theme and the character but the studio did not.<ref name=\"Reut20th\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-burnett/carol-burnett-sues-tvs-family-guy-cartoon-idUSN1624604020070317 |title=Carol Burnett sues TV's \"Family Guy\" cartoon |work=[[Reuters]] |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Gun20th\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/carol-burnett-v-family-guy |title=Carol Burnett v. \"Family Guy\" Comedian sues over porn shop spoof of beloved charwoman character |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |date=March 16, 2018 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref> The suit was ruled in favor of the defendant because the bit was a parody, which is protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects.

Gurney's ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.\n\nBurnett had long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'', and realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.\n\nIn 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress \u2013 Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]].

National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor.

Noe''' (born July 1954) is an [[Ohio]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] fundraiser and activist, guilty of [[money laundering]] for the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|2004 Bush-Cheney campaign]] and of theft and corruption in the \"[[Coingate scandal]]\". A longtime resident of [[Toledo, Ohio]], Noe and his wife, Bernadette, held several party positions and minor offices within the government of Ohio. He was also a prominent Republican fundraiser and served as chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio and chairman of the [[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas County]] Republican party. Noe was also an avid coin dealer and owned various coin dealing companies, such as ''Capital Coin'' and ''Vintage Coins & Collectibles'', as well as their subsidiaries.\n\n== Organizations and offices ==\n=== The Republican Party ===\nBoth Noe and his wife Bernadette Restivo-Noe have been chairperson of the Lucas County Republican party. Noe was also chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio. Noe was convicted of making illegal contributions to George W. Bush's 2004 presidential campaign.[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14805486 Coin dealer sentenced for illegal contributions]\n\n=== Board of Elections ===\nDuring the 2004 election, Noe's wife Bernadette was chairman of the Lucas County Board of Elections. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], the county experienced extreme voting difficulties, including criminal investigations and manipulation of the recount,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409051126/http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/elections/lucas.htm|title=Ohio Secretary of State, J.

The Ohio Secretary of State told Bernadette to resign or be fired. She resigned from both the Lucas County Republican Party and the Lucas County Board of Elections in December 2004.\n\n=== Board of Regents ===\nNoe was appointed to the Ohio Board of Regents, which oversees Ohio's public colleges and universities, by former Ohio Governor [[George Voinovich]] in 1995 to complete a vacated term. Noe was reinstated for a full 9-year term in 1999 by Governor [[Bob Taft]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nIn late 2004, Noe wrote to the Ohio Ethics Commission to seek an opinion on his involvement with ''Hi-Genomics LLC'' which licenses a patent on plant genetic engineering from the [[University of Toledo]]. Noe was vice-president of ''Hi-Genomics LLC'' and owned a 23% stake in the company. Noe's position on the Board of Regents was deemed to be a conflict of interest by the Ohio Ethics Commission. Noe was told to either resign from the Board, divest his interest in the company, or step down as vice-president of the company. Noe eventually sold back his units in Hi-Genomics to one of the other unitholders.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n=== Turnpike Commission ===\nIn 2003 Governor Taft appointed Noe chairman of the [[Ohio Turnpike]] Commission for an 8-year term. On May 10, 2005, Noe resigned from the Turnpike Commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/assets/pdf/TO103991114.PDF|title=The Rise and Dramatic Fall of Tom Noe|format=PDF|accessdate=December 2, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n== Coin politics and business ==\nApart from being President of his company, Thomas Noe Inc. (Noe owns 60%), Noe owns and/or manages many different companies that deal rare coins. His store, Vintage Coins & Collectibles (or Vintage Coins & Cards), is the parent company. Noe was also a statutory agent for the Professional Numismatists Guild, a nonprofit organization of top [[numismatics|numismatists]] whose members follow a strict code of ethics, for more than 25 years. He resigned in May 2005.\n\nNoe served as chairman of the Ohio Commemorative Quarter Program Committee during its operation in the 2000s. Noe was appointed chairman of the U.S. Mint's [[Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee]] (CCAC) by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury [[John W. Snow]] in October 2004. The CCAC advises the secretary on issues relating to commemorative coin design and circulation. He was recommended by U.S. House Representative [[Dennis Hastert]]. He resigned in May 2005.\n\n== Legal troubles ==\nNoe has been convicted in two separate, but overlapping investigations for a variety of corrupt activities in Ohio and in national politics.\n\n=== Campaign contributions ===\nOn October 27, 2005, Noe was indicted in a federal investigation on counts of conspiracy, conduit contribution violations, and false statements.\n\nNoe was accused of illegally funneling $45,400 to President Bush's re-election campaign, using \"two dozen people as \"conduits\" to make illegal campaign contributions at a $2,000-a-seat fund-raiser in Columbus. Conduits named in a federal affidavit include Lucas County Commissioner Maggie Thurber, Toledo City Councilwoman Betty Shultz, former Toledo Mayor Donna Owens and former State Representative Sally Perz. In doing so, Noe skirted federal campaign finance funding limits while meeting a pledge to raise $50,000 for the October 30, 2003, fund-raiser. The Bush campaign later named Noe a \"[[Bush Pioneer|Pioneer]]\" for raising at least $100,000 overall ... In addition to \"conduits\" who received between $1,750 and $4,000 from Noe to make either one or two contributions, prosecutors claim that the former rare-coin dealer used two people as \"super-conduits,\" giving them $6,000 and $14,300 that they then split with others who attended the fund-raiser.\" Noe is now is serving a jail term of at least 10 years.<ref>[https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2018/11/03/Ohio-Parole-Board-recommends/stories/201811040150  Ohio board recommends Tom Noe remain jailed for stealing from state insurance fund]</ref>\n\nOn October 31, 2005, Noe pled not-guilty to all three charges.

A longtime resident of [[Toledo, Ohio]], Noe and his wife, Bernadette, held several party positions and minor offices within the government of Ohio. He was also a prominent Republican fundraiser and served as chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio and chairman of the [[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas County]] Republican party.

The Ohio Secretary of State told Bernadette to resign or be fired. She resigned from both the Lucas County Republican Party and the Lucas County Board of Elections in December 2004.\n\n=== Board of Regents ===\nNoe was appointed to the Ohio Board of Regents, which oversees Ohio's public colleges and universities, by former Ohio Governor [[George Voinovich]] in 1995 to complete a vacated term. Noe was reinstated for a full 9-year term in 1999 by Governor [[Bob Taft]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nIn late 2004, Noe wrote to the Ohio Ethics Commission to seek an opinion on his involvement with ''Hi-Genomics LLC'' which licenses a patent on plant genetic engineering from the [[University of Toledo]]. Noe was vice-president of ''Hi-Genomics LLC'' and owned a 23% stake in the company. Noe's position on the Board of Regents was deemed to be a conflict of interest by the Ohio Ethics Commission. Noe was told to either resign from the Board, divest his interest in the company, or step down as vice-president of the company. Noe eventually sold back his units in Hi-Genomics to one of the other unitholders.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n=== Turnpike Commission ===\nIn 2003 Governor Taft appointed Noe chairman of the [[Ohio Turnpike]] Commission for an 8-year term.

Noe was also a statutory agent for the Professional Numismatists Guild, a nonprofit organization of top [[numismatics|numismatists]] whose members follow a strict code of ethics, for more than 25 years. He resigned in May 2005.\n\nNoe served as chairman of the Ohio Commemorative Quarter Program Committee during its operation in the 2000s. Noe was appointed chairman of the U.S. Mint's [[Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee]] (CCAC) by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury [[John W. Snow]] in October 2004.

Conduits named in a federal affidavit include Lucas County Commissioner Maggie Thurber, Toledo City Councilwoman Betty Shultz, former Toledo Mayor Donna Owens and former State Representative Sally Perz. In doing so, Noe skirted federal campaign finance funding limits while meeting a pledge to raise $50,000 for the October 30, 2003, fund-raiser. The Bush campaign later named Noe a \"[[Bush Pioneer|Pioneer]]\" for raising at least $100,000 overall ... In addition to \"conduits\" who received between $1,750 and $4,000 from Noe to make either one or two contributions, prosecutors claim that the former rare-coin dealer used two people as \"super-conduits,\" giving them $6,000 and $14,300 that they then split with others who attended the fund-raiser.\" Noe is now is serving a jail term of at least 10 years.<ref>[https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2018/11/03/Ohio-Parole-Board-recommends/stories/201811040150  Ohio board recommends Tom Noe remain jailed for stealing from state insurance fund]</ref>\n\nOn October 31, 2005, Noe pled not-guilty to all three charges.

The battle took place near [[Ypres Salient|Ypres]] in Belgian Flanders, on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] against the German [[4th Army (German Empire)|4th Army]]. The French [[First Army (France)|First Army]] had a big success on the northern flank from Bixschoote to Drie Grachten and the British gained a substantial amount of ground northwards from [[Langemark]] to the boundary with the French.\n\nThe attack on the Gheluvelt Plateau on the right (southern) flank captured a considerable amount of ground but failed to reach its objectives. German counter-attacks recaptured most of the lost territory during the afternoon. The weather prevented much of the British programme of air co-operation with the infantry, which made it easier for German reserves to assemble on the battlefield.\n\nAn unusually large amount rain in August, poor drainage and lack of evaporation turned the ground into a morass, which was worse for the British and French, who occupied lower-lying ground and attacked areas which had been frequently and severely bombarded. Mud and flooded shell holes severely reduced the mobility of the infantry and poor visibility hampered artillery observers and artillery-observation aircraft. Rainstorms and the costly German defensive success during the rest of August, led the British to stop the offensive for three weeks.\n\nIn early September, the sun came out and with the return of a breeze, dried much of the ground. The British rebuilt roads and tracks to the front line, transferred more artillery and fresh divisions from the armies further south and revised further their tactics. The main offensive effort was shifted southwards and led to success on the Gheluvelt Plateau on 20, 26 September and 4 October, before the rains returned.\n\n==Background==\n===Strategic background===\n{{see also|Battle of Hill 70}}\n\nArtillery preparation for the [[Battle of Verdun|Second Battle of Verdun]], in support of the Allied offensive in Flanders, which had been delayed from mid-July began on 20 August, after an eight-day bombardment.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=379\u2013383}} Attacking on an {{convert|18|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} front, the French captured [[Mort Homme]], Hill 304 and {{nowrap|10,000 prisoners.}} The 5th Army could not counter-attack because its [[Eingreif division|''Eingreif]] divisions had been sent to Flanders. Fighting at Verdun continued into September, adding to the pressure on the German army.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=231}} The [[Canadian Corps]] fought the Battle of Hill 70 {{nowrap|(15\u201325 August),}} outside [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] on the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] front. The attack was costly but inflicted great losses on five German divisions and pinned down troops reserved for relief of tired divisions on the Flanders front.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=219\u2013230}} The strategy of forcing the German army to defend the Ypres salient, to protect the Belgian coast and submarine bases had succeeded. The French and Russians could make local attacks but needed more time to recuperate free of big German attacks. The British had forced the Germans into a costly defensive battle but the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]] (General [[Hubert Gough]]) had struggled to advance since 31 July, due to the tenacity of the German defence and the unusually wet weather. Gough kept pressure on the [[4th Army (German Empire)|4th Army]], to prevent the Germans from recovering and to enable [[Operation Hush]] on the coast, which needed the high tides due at the end of August.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=190}}\n\n===Tactical developments===\n\nIn July 1917, [[Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]] had begun the Third Battle of Ypres, an attempt to inflict unsustainable losses on the German army and to advance out of the [[Ypres Salient]] to capture the Belgian coast and end the submarine threat from Belgian bases to the southern North Sea and the Dover Straits. At the [[Battle of Messines Ridge]] (7\u201314 June) the ridge had been captured down to the ''Oosttaverne'' line and a substantial success had been gained at the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge]] 31 July \u2013 2 August.{{sfn|Sheffield|2011|p=233}} Ground conditions in August were poor, as the surface had been bombarded, fought over and partially flooded, at times severely so. Shelling had destroyed drainage canals in the area and unseasonable heavy rain in August turned some parts into morasses of mud and waterlogged shell-craters. Supply troops walked to the front on duck boards laid across the mud; carrying loads of up to {{convert|45|kg|lb|order=flip|abbr=on}}, soldiers could slip into the craters and drown. Trees were reduced to blasted trunks, the branches and leaves torn away and corpses from earlier fighting were uncovered by the rain and shelling. The ground was powdery to a depth of {{convert|9|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} and when wet, had the consistency of [[porridge]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|p=360}}\n\nBrigadier-General [[John Humphrey Davidson|John Davidson]], Director of Operations at BEF HQ, submitted a memorandum on 1 August, urging caution on Haig and Gough. Davidson recommended that the preliminary operation by II Corps not be hurried; a full artillery preparation and a relief by fresh divisions should be completed before the operation; tired and depleted units had often failed in such attacks; two fresh divisions were sent to II Corps. Two or three clear days were needed for accurate artillery-fire especially as captured ground on the Gheluvelt plateau gave better observation and German maps revealed the positions of their machine-gun emplacements, which being small and well concealed, needed accurate fire by the artillery to destroy them. The capture of the black line from Inverness Copse north to Westhoek, would be insufficient to protect an advance from the Steenbeek further north and large German counter-attacks could be expected on the plateau, given that it was the German defensive point of main effort ({{lang|de|Schwerpunkt}}).{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=180\u2013182}}\n\n====Weather====\nExcept where shell-holes obstructed drainage, the ground in west Flanders dried quickly and became dusty after a few dry days.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|pp=369\u2013370}} A 1989 study of weather data recorded from 1867 to 1916 at Lille, {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on}} down the road from Ypres, showed August to be more often dry than wet, a trend towards dry autumns (September\u2013November) and that average rainfall in October had decreased over the previous {{nowrap|50 years.}}{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=147\u2013148}} From 1 to 10 August, {{convert|59.1|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell, including {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} in a thunderstorm on 8 August.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|pp=7\u201339}} In August 1917, {{convert|127|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell, of which {{convert|84|mm|in|abbr=on}} fell on {{nowrap|1, 8, 14, 26 and}} {{nowrap|27 August.}} The month was so overcast and windless that water on the ground dried slower than usual. September had {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain and was much sunnier, the ground drying quickly, hard enough in places for shells to [[ricochet]] and for dust to blow in the breeze. In October, {{convert|107|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell, compared to the 1914\u20131916 average of {{convert|44|mm|in|abbr=on}} and from {{nowrap|1\u20139 November}} there was another {{convert|7.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain and only nine hours of sunshine, little of the water drying; another {{convert|13.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell on 10 November.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=149\u2013151}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British offensive preparations===\n\n{{main|Western Front tactics, 1917#The British set-piece attack, mid-1917|l1=The British set-piece attack in mid-1917}}\n\n[[File:12inchMkIXRailwayGunVickersMountingWoestenAugust231917.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|A British 12-inch railway gun at [[Woesten]], with its crew perched on it and the propaganda slogan ''Not on Strike'' on the barrel.}}]]\nFew of the pillboxes captured on 31 July had been damaged by artillery-fire and before the attack, the 109th Brigade [36th (Ulster) Division] commander Brigadier-General [[Ambrose St Q. Ricardo]], arranged three-minute bombardments on selected pillboxes and blockhouses by the XIX Corps heavy artillery, with pauses so that artillery observers could make corrections to contradictory maps and photographs. It was discovered that on many of the targets, the shell dispersion covered hundreds of yards, as did wire-cutting bombardments.{{sfn|Falls|1996|p=121}} On 2 August, at the suggestion of Brigadier-General [[Hugh Elles]], commander of the Tank Corps, it was decided that the surviving tanks were to be held back due to the weather, for use en masse later on, although some were used later in the month. The preliminary operation intended for 2 August was delayed by rain until 10 August and more rain delays forced the postponement of the general offensive from 4 to 15 August and then again to 16 August.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=183\u2013184, 189\u2013190}}\n\nThe [[20th (Light) Division]] replaced the [[38th (Welsh) Infantry Division|38th (Welsh) Division]] on 5 August. The 7th Battalion of the [[Somerset Light Infantry]] took over captured German trenches behind the front line on 5 August, which had been turned into the British reserve line and lost three men to shellfire while waiting for dark. On arrival at the support line {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}} forward and the front line another {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}} beyond, the battalion found that the front line consisted of shell hole posts with muddy bottoms strung along the Steenbeek, from the Langemarck road to the Ypres\u2013Staden railway. British artillery was engaged in destructive bombardments of the German positions opposite and German artillery fire was aimed at the British infantry concentrating for the next attack. After heavy rain all night, the battalion spent 6 August soaked through and had {{nowrap|20 casualties,}} two men being killed. On 7 August, there were {{nowrap|35 casualties}}, including twelve killed, before the battalion was relieved until 14 August. Training began for the next attack, planned from trench maps and aerial photographs. Each company formed three platoons, two for the advance, with two rifle sections in the lead, the Lewis-gun sections behind and the third platoon to mop up.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|pp=146\u2013148}}\n\n[[File:Interior of a dugout.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Interior of a dugout.}}]]\nTraining emphasised the need for units to \"hug\" the creeping barrage and form offensive flanks to assist troops whose advance had been halted by the defenders. Infantry that got forward could provide [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire and envelop German positions, which were to be left behind and mopped-up by reserve platoons. Every known German position was allocated to a unit of the {{circa|470 men}} left in the battalion, to reduce the risk of unseen German positions being overrun and firing at the leading troops from behind. While the Somersets were out of the line, the 10th and 11th battalions, the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)#First World War|Rifle Brigade]] edged forward about {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}} beyond the Steenbeek, which cost the 10th Battalion {{nowrap|215 casualties.}} An attempt on 15 August to re-capture the Au Bon Gite blockhouse, {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} beyond the Steenbeek and lost to a German counter-attack on 31 July, failed. It was decided that the infantry for the general attack, due on 16 August, would have to squeeze into the ground beyond the river in front of the blockhouse for the attack on Langemarck.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\n====Operation Summer Night====\n\nOperation Summer Night ({{lang|de|Unternehmen Sommernacht}}) was a German methodical counter-attack ({{lang|de|Gegenangriff}}) attack near Hollebeke in the Second Army area on the southern flank, which began at {{nowrap|5:20 a.m.}} on 5 August. The [[22nd Reserve Division (German Empire)|22nd Reserve Division]] had been relieved by the [[12th Division (German Empire)|12th Division]] and the [[207th Division (German Empire)|207th Division]] after its losses on 31 July. After a short bombardment, three companies of I Battalion, Infantry Regiment 62 of the 12th Division captured a slight rise {{convert|1|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Hollebeke]], surprising the British, who fell back {{convert|80|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The new German positions were on higher and drier ground and deprived the British of observation over the German rear, reducing casualties from British artillery-fire.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|p=101}}\n\nFurther to the south, Reserve Infantry regiments {{nowrap|209 and 213}} of the 207th Division, attacked Hollebeke through thick fog and captured the village despite many casualties, taking at least {{nowrap|300 prisoners.}} Most of the British were in captured pillboxes and blockhouses, which had to be attacked one by one and at {{nowrap|5:45 a.m.,}} three signal flares were fired to indicate success. The Germans later abandoned Hollebeke and reoccupied the old \"A line\", then withdrew to their start line, because of the severity of British counter-attacks and artillery-fire. ''Sommernacht'' left the front-line ragged, with a {{convert|400|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} gap between regiments {{nowrap|209 and 213,}} which the British tried to exploit with attacks and counter-attacks, before the bigger British effort of 10 August against the Gheluvelt Plateau.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=101\u2013104}}\n\n====Capture of Westhoek====\n\n{{main|Capture of Westhoek}}\n\n[[File:German pillbox, Flanders 1917.jpg|thumb|{{centre|German pillbox, Flanders 1917}}]]\nThe Gheluvelt Plateau became a sea of mud, flooded shell craters, fallen trees and barbed wire. Troops were exhausted quickly by the weather, massed artillery bombardments and lack of food and water; rapid relief of units spread the exhaustion through all the infantry, despite the front being held by fresh divisions. British artillery fired a preparatory bombardment from Polygon Wood to Langemarck but the German guns concentrated on the Plateau. The British gunners were hampered by low cloud and rain, which made air observation extremely difficult and shells were wasted on empty gun emplacements. The British 25th Division, 18th (Eastern) Division and the German 54th Division had relieved the original divisions by 4 August but the German 52nd Reserve Division was left in the line; the infantry of both sides were exhausted by 10 August. The 18th (Eastern) Division attacked on the right; some troops quickly reached their objectives but German artillery isolated them around Inverness Copse and Glencorse Wood. German troops counter-attacked several times and by nightfall the Copse and all but the north-west corner of Glencorse Wood had been recaptured. The 25th Division on the left flank advanced quickly and reached its objectives by {{nowrap|5:30 a.m.,}} rushing the Germans in Westhoek. Snipers and attacks by German aircraft caused an increasing number of casualties; the Germans counter-attacked into the night and the British guns bombarded German troops in their assembly positions. The appalling weather and costly defeats began a slump in British infantry morale; lack of replacements began to concern the German commanders.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=184\u2013190}}\n\n===Plan of attack===\n\n[[File:Ypres area,1917a.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Ypres area, 1917}}]]\nThe attack was planned as an advance in stages, to keep the infantry well under the protection of the field artillery.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|p=142}} II Corps was to reach the green line of 31 July, an advance of about {{convert|1350|\u2013|1500|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} and form a defensive flank from Stirling Castle to Black Watch Corner. The deeper objective was compensated for by reducing battalion frontages from {{convert|350|\u2013|225|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} and leap-frogging supporting battalions through an intermediate line, to take the final objective.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=190\u2013191}}\n\nOn the [[56th (London) Infantry Division|56th (1/1st London) Division]] front, the final objective was about {{convert|500|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} into Polygon Wood. On the right, the [[53rd Brigade (United Kingdom)|53rd Brigade]] of the 18th (Eastern) Division was to advance from Stirling Castle, through Inverness Copse to Black Watch Corner, at the south-west corner of Polygon Wood, to form a defensive flank to the south. Further north, the [[169th (3rd London) Brigade|169th Brigade]] was to advance to Polygon Wood through Glencorse Wood and [[167th (1st London) Brigade|167th Brigade]] was to reach the north-western part of Polygon Wood through Nonne Bosschen.{{sfn|Dudley Ward|2001|pp=154\u2013159}} The 8th Division was to attack with two brigades between Westhoek and the Ypres\u2013Roulers railway, to reach the green line on the rise east of the Hanebeek stream.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} Eight tanks were allotted to II Corps to assist the infantry. The artillery support for the attack was the same as that for 10 August, {{nowrap|180 eighteen-pounder}} guns for the creeping barrage moving at {{convert|100|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} in five minutes, with {{nowrap|seventy-two 4.5-inch}} howitzers and {{nowrap|thirty-six 18-pounders}} placing standing barrages beyond the final objective. Eight machine-gun companies were to fire barrages on the area from the north-east of Polygon Wood to west of Zonnebeke.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nXIX and XVIII corps, further north, were also to capture the green line, slightly beyond the German {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position). Each XIX Corps division had fourteen {{nowrap|18-pounder}} batteries for the creeping barrage, {{nowrap|twenty-four 4.5-inch}} howitzer batteries and forty machine-guns for standing barrages, along with the normal heavy artillery groups.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=195}} Each division also had {{nowrap|a hundred and eight 18-pounders}} and {{nowrap|thirty-six 4.5-inch}} howitzers for bombardment and benefited from supply routes which had been far less heavily shelled than those further south.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=194\u2013195}} In the XVIII Corps area, a brigade each from the 48th (South Midland) Division and 11th (Northern) Division with eight tanks each, was to attack from the north end of St Julien, to the White House east of Langemarck.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=199}}\n\nThe 20th (Light) Division planned to capture Langemarck with the [[60th Brigade (United Kingdom)|60th Brigade]] and [[61st Brigade (United Kingdom)|61st Brigade]]. The [[59th Brigade (United Kingdom)|59th Brigade]] was to go into reserve after holding the line before the attack, less the two battalions in the front line, which were to screen the assembly of the attacking brigades. The attack was to begin on the east bank of the Steenbeek, where the troops had {{convert|70|\u2013|135|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} of room to assemble, crossing over on wooden bridges laid by the engineers the night before the attack.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|p=151}}{{efn|Aid posts on the east bank were to be arranged once the advance began, so seriously wounded men would have to wait and walking wounded recross the stream, to reach Advanced Dressing Stations at Elverdinghe and Cheapside, {{convert|5500|\u2013|7000|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} away. Non-walking wounded were to be carried by {{nowrap|200 men}} from the division reserved as stretcher-bearers to Gallwitz Farm {{convert|2700|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} back, then evacuated by light railway.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|p=151}}}} The first objective (blue line), was set on a road running along the west side of Langemarck, the second objective (green line) was {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}} further on, at the east side of the village and the final objective (red line) was another {{convert|600|yd|m|abbr=on}} ahead, in the German defences beyond Schreiboom. On the right, the 60th Brigade was to attack on a one-battalion front, with two battalions to leapfrog through the leading battalion, to reach the second and final objectives. The attack was to move north-east behind Langemarck, to confront an expected German counter-attack up the road from Poelcappelle, {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}} away, while the 61st Brigade, attacking on a two-brigade front, took the village shielded by the 60th Brigade. The manoeuvre of the 60th Brigade would also threaten the Germans in Langemarck with encirclement.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nAu Bon Gite, the German blockhouse which had resisted earlier attacks, was to be dealt with by infantry from one of the covering battalions and a Royal Engineer Field Company. Artillery for the attack came from the 20th (Light) Division, 38th (Welsh) Division and the heavy guns of XIV Corps. A creeping barrage was to move at {{convert|90|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} in four minutes and a standing barrage was to fall on the objective lines in succession as the infantry advanced. The first objective was to be bombarded for twenty minutes, as the creeping barrage moved towards it, then the second objective was to be shelled for an hour to catch retreating German soldiers, destroy defences and force any remaining Germans under cover. A third barrage was to come from the XIV Corps heavy artillery, sweeping back and forth with high explosive, from {{convert|300|\u2013|1500|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} ahead of the foremost British troops, to stop German machine-gunners in retired positions from firing through the British barrage. Smoke shell was to be fired to hide the attacking troops, as they re-organised at each objective. A machine-gun barrage from {{nowrap|48 guns}} was arranged, with half of the guns moving forward with the infantry, to add to their firepower. German troops were also to be [[Strafing|strafed]] by British aircraft from low altitude.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|p=150}} The French First Army was to extend the attack north, from the Kortebeek to Drie Grachten, aiming to reach the St Jansbeck.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=201}}\n\n===German defences===\n\n{{main|Western Front tactics, 1917#German defensive preparations, June\u2013July 1917|l1=German defensive preparations: June\u2013July 1917}}\n\n[[File:German defences east of Ypres mid-1917.jpg|thumb|{{centre|The British front line and the German defences in the area east of Ypres, mid-1917}}]]\nThe German 4th Army operation order for the defensive battle was issued on 27 June.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=143}} German infantry units had been reorganised on similar lines to the British, with a rifle section, assault troop section, a grenade-launcher section and a light machine-gun section. Field artillery in the {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions had been organised into artillery assault groups, which followed the infantry to engage the attackers with observed or direct fire. Each infantry regiment of the 183rd Division, based around Westroosebeke behind the northern flank of Group Ypres, had a battalion of the divisional field artillery regiment attached.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=99\u2013100}} From mid-1917, the area east of Ypres was defended by six German defensive positions: the front position, {{lang|de|Albrechtstellung}} (second position), {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position), {{lang|de|Flandern I Stellung}} (fourth position), {{lang|de|Flandern II Stellung}} (fifth position) and {{lang|de|Flandern III Stellung}} (under construction).{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=292}}\n\nBetween the German positions were the Belgian villages of [[Zonnebeke]] and Passchendaele.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=284}} On 31 July, the German [[defence in depth]] had begun with a front system of three breastworks: {{nowrap|Ia, Ib and Ic,}} each about {{convert|200|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} apart, garrisoned by the four companies of each front battalion, with listening-posts in no-man's-land.

The line marked the front of the main battle zone ({{lang|de|Grosskampffeld}}), which was about {{convert|2500|yd|mi+km|abbr=on}} deep, behind which was the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position) and most of the field artillery of the front divisions.

Drie Grachten (Three Canals) was the main German defensive fortification in the area, blocking the Noordschoote\u2013Luyghem road at the crossing of the Yperlee Canal north of the Steenbeek. The area was beyond the confluence with the Kortebeek, where the rivers joined to become the St Jansbeek. From Luyghem, a road ran south-east to Verbrandemis and the road from Zudyschoote and Lizenie to Dixmude crossed the Yperlee at Steenstraat. The capture of Luyghem, Merckem and the road would threaten Houthoulst Forest, to the south of Dixmude and north of Langemarck. By 15 August, the French had closed up to Drie Grachten from Bixschoote to the south-east and Noordschoote to the south-west.{{sfn|Times|1918|pp=362\u2013363}}\n\nWest of the Yperlee Canal, the bridgehead consisted of a semi-circular breastwork due to waterlogged soil. Reinforced concrete shelters were connected by a raised trench of concrete, earth and [[fascine]]s, with a communication trench leading back to a command post. Several hundred yards along a communication trench on the north side of the road was a small blockhouse. Barbed wire entanglements had been laid above and below the water in front of the post and blockhouse astride the Noordschoote\u2013Luyghem road. To the north was l'Eclusette Redoubt and another pillbox lay to the south, on the west side of the Yperlee. The redoubts corresponded to the defences on the east bank of the canal and enclosed the flanks of the position {{convert|2|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} above the inundations. Platforms gave machine-guns command of a wide arc of ground in front. On the east bank of the Yperlee was a rampart of reinforced concrete, behind and parallel with the canal, from opposite l'Eclusette to the southern redoubt. Communication between the rampart and the defences of the Luyghem peninsula was via the raised road from Drie Grachten to Luyghem and two footbridges through the floods, one north and one south of the road. Every {{convert|35|\u2013|50|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}}, were traverses with reinforced concrete shelters.{{sfn|Times|1918|p=364}}\n\nIn an appreciation of 2 August, Group Ypres correctly identified the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} as the British objective on 31 July and predicted more attacks on the Gheluvelt Plateau and further north towards Langemarck. In the Group Ypres area, only the 3rd and 79th Reserve divisions remained battleworthy, the other four having suffered {{circa|10,000 casualties.}} On 4 August, a {{lang|de|Gruppe Wijtschate}} assessment concluded that the British needed to force back the 52nd Division on the Gheluvelt Plateau, where the defensive scheme had the front regiment of each division backed by the other two regiments in support and in reserve behind the front line. Crown Prince Rupprecht expressed concern on 5 August, that the weather conditions were rapidly exhausting the German infantry. Casualties averaged {{nowrap|1,500\u20132,000 men}} per division, lower than the {{nowrap|4,000 average}} on the Somme in 1916 but only because divisions were being relieved more frequently. Supplying troops in the front line was extremely difficult because the British were using more gas, which caught carrying parties by surprise; the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division had suffered {{nowrap|1,200 gas}} casualties.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=101\u2013104}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Fifth Army===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"  align=right style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em\"\n|+'''Weather'''<br><small>11\u201331 August 1917</small>{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|pp=39\u201366}}\n|-\n!

German flares were seen rising but the German artillery response was slow and missed the attackers. In the 18th (Eastern) Division area, German machine-gun fire from pillboxes caused many losses to the 53rd Brigade, which was stopped in front of the north-west corner of Inverness Copse. Part of the brigade managed to work forward further north and form a defensive flank along the southern edge of Glencorse Wood. To the north, the 169th Brigade of the 56th (1/1st London) Division advanced quickly at the start but veered to the right around boggy ground, then entered Glencorse Wood. The German main line of resistance was in a sunken road inside the wood, where after a hard-fought and mutually costly engagement, the German defenders were overrun and the rest of the wood occupied. The leading waves then advanced to Polygon Wood.{{sfn|Dudley Ward|2001|pp=156\u2013158}}\n\nThe 167th Brigade also had a fast start but when it reached the north end of Nonne Bosschen, found mud {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep, the brigade veering round it to the left but the gap which this caused between the 167th and 169th brigades was not closed. Another problem emerged, because the quick start had been partly due to the rear waves pushing up to avoid German shelling on the left of the brigade. The follow-up infantry mingled with the foremost troops and failed to mop up the captured ground or German troops who had been overrun. Isolated German parties began sniping from behind at both brigades. Part of one company reached the area north of Polygon Wood at about the same time as small numbers of troops from the 8th Division.{{sfn|Dudley Ward|2001|pp=158\u2013159}} The ground conditions in the 56th (1/1st London) Division area were so bad that none of the tanks in support got into action.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|p=146}}\n\nOn the 8th Division front, the two attacking brigades started well, advancing behind an \"admirable\" barrage and reached the Hanebeek, where hand bridges were used to cross and continue the advance up Anzac Spur, to the green line objectives on the ridge beyond. Difficulties began on the left flank, where troops from [[16th (Irish) Division]] had not kept up with the 8th Division. After reaching the vicinity of Potsdam Redoubt a little later, the 16th (Irish) Division was held up for the rest of the day. The check to the Irish left German machine-gunners north of the railway free to enfilade the area of 8th Division to the south. On the right flank, the same thing happened to the 56th (1/1st London) Division, which was stopped by fire from German strongpoints and pillboxes in their area and from German artillery concentrated to the south-east. After a long fight, the 8th Division captured Iron Cross, Anzac and Zonnebeke redoubts on the rise beyond the Hanebeek, then sent parties over the ridge.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|p=146}}\n\n====XIX Corps====\n\nThe 16th (Irish) and 36th (Ulster) divisions attacked from north of the Ypres\u2013Roulers railway to just south of St Julien. The divisions were to advance {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} up the Anzac and Zonnebeke spurs, near the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position). Providing carrying parties since the last week in July and holding ground from 4 August in the Hanebeek and Steenbeek valleys, which were overlooked by the Germans, had exhausted many men and from 1 to 15 August, the divisions had lost about a third of their front-line strength in casualties. Frequent reliefs during the unexpected delays caused by the rain spread the casualties and fatigue to all of the battalions in both divisions. The advance began on time and after a few hundred yards encountered German strong points, which were found not to have been destroyed by a series of special heavy artillery bombardments before the attack.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\nThe 16th (Irish) Division suffered many casualties from the Germans in Potsdam, Vampire and Borry farms, which had not been properly mopped up, because of the acute the infantry shortage. The garrisons were able to shoot at the advancing Irish troops of the [[48th Brigade (United Kingdom)|48th Brigade]] from behind and only isolated parties of British troops managed to reach their objectives. The [[49th Brigade (United Kingdom)|49th Brigade]] on the left was also held up at Borry Farm, which defeated several costly attacks but the left of the brigade got within {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} of the top of {{nowrap|Hill 37.}}{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=195\u2013196}} The 36th (Ulster) Division also struggled to advance, Gallipoli and Somme farms found to be behind a new wire entanglement, with German machine-guns trained on gaps made by the British bombardment, fire from which stopped the advance of the [[108th Brigade (United Kingdom)|108th Brigade]]. To the north, the [[109th Brigade (United Kingdom)|109th Brigade]] had to get across the swamp astride the Steenbeek. The infantry lost the barrage and machine-gun fire from Pond Farm and Border House forced them to take cover. On the left troops got to Fortuin, about {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} from the start line.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=196}}\n\n====XVIII Corps====\n\nThe 48th (South Midland) Division attacked at {{nowrap|4:45 a.m.}} with one brigade, capturing Border House and gun pits either side of the north-east bearing [[Sint-Juliaan|St Julien]]\u2013Winnipeg road, where they were held up by machine-gun fire and a small counter-attack. The capture of St Julien was completed and the infantry consolidated along a line from Border House, to Jew Hill, the gun pits and St Julien. Troops were fired on from Maison du Hibou and Hillock Farm, which was captured soon after, then British troops seen advancing on Springfield Farm disappeared. At {{nowrap|9:00 a.m.,}} German troops gathered around Triangle Farm and at {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.,}} made an abortive counter-attack. Another German attack after dark was defeated at the gun pits and at {{nowrap|9:30 p.m.,}} a German counter-attack from Triangle Farm was repulsed.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|p=52}}\n\nThe 11th (Northern) Division attacked with one brigade at {{nowrap|4:45 a.m.}} The right flank was delayed by machine-gun fire from the 48th (South Midland) Division area and by pillboxes to their front, where the infantry lost the barrage. On the left, the brigade dug in {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}} west of the Langemarck road and the right flank dug in facing east, against fire from Maison du Hibou and the Triangle. Supporting troops from the 33rd Brigade were caught by fire from the German pillboxes but reached the Cockcroft, passed beyond and dug in despite fire from Bulow Farm. On the left flank, these battalions reached the Langemarck road, passed Rat House and Pheasant Trench and ended their advance just short of the White House, joining with the right side of the brigade on the Lekkerboterbeek.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|pp=53\u201355}}\n\n====XIV Corps====\n\nThe 20th (Light) Division attacked with two brigades at {{nowrap|4:45 a.m.}} The battalions of the right brigade leap-frogged forward on a one-battalion front over the Steenbeek and then advanced in single file, worming round shell craters full of water and mud. Alouette Farm, Langemarck and the first two objective lines were reached easily. At {{nowrap|7:20 a.m.,}} the advance to the final objective began and immediately encountered machine-gun fire from the Rat House and White House. Firing continued until they were captured, the final objective being taken at {{nowrap|7:45 a.m.,}} as German troops withdrew to a small wood behind White House. The left brigade advanced on a two-battalion front and encountered machine-gun fire from the Au Bon Gite blockhouse before it was captured and was then fired on from German blockhouses in front of Langemarck and from the railway station. Once these had been captured, the advance resumed at {{nowrap|7:20 a.m.,}} despite fire from hidden parties of defenders and reached the final objective at {{nowrap|7:47 a.m.,}} under fire from the Rat House. German counter-attacks began around {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.}} and advanced {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} around Schreiboom, being driven back some distance later on.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|pp=53\u201355}}\n\nThe 29th Division to the north attacked at the same time with two brigades. On the right the first objective was reached quickly and assistance given to the 20th (Liight) Division on the right. The [[Royal Newfoundland Regiment|Newfoundland Regiment]] passed through, being held up slightly by marshy conditions and fire from Cannes Farm. The Newfoundlanders continued, reached the third objective and then took Japan House beyond. The left brigade took the first objective easily and then met machine-gun fire from Champeaubert Farm in the French First Army sector and from Montmirail Farm. The advance continued to the final objective, which was reached and consolidated by {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} Patrols moved forward towards the Broombeek and a German counter-attack at {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.,}} was stopped by artillery and small-arms fire.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|p=55}} Langemarck and the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position), north of the Ypres\u2013Staden railway and west of the Kortebeek had been captured.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=200\u2013201, sketch 19}}\n\n===''1<sup>re</sup> Arm\u00e9e''===\n\nThe French [[1st Army Corps (France)|I Corps]], on the northern flank of the Fifth Army, attacked from the army boundary north-west of Weidendreft, south of the hamlet of St Janshoek (Sint Jan), north of [[Bikschote|Bixschoote]] and the edge of the floods, to the [[Noordschote|Noordschoote]]\u2013[[Luigem|Luyghem]] road, which crossed the [[Yperlee]] at [[Drie Grachten Hoekje|Drie Grachten]] (Three Canals).{{sfn|Times|1918|pp=362\u2013363}} The German defences were more visible than those opposite the British and being above ground, were easier to destroy.

The French crossed the upper Steenbeek from west of Weidendreft to a bend in the stream south-west of St Janshoek. Keeping pace with the British, they advanced to the south bank of the Broombeek. Mondovi blockhouse held out all day and pivoting on it, the Germans counter-attacked during the night of {{nowrap|16/17 August}} to get between the French and British. The attack failed and the next morning the troops on the army boundary had observation across the narrow Broombeek valley. Apart from resistance at Les Lilas and Mondovi blockhouses, the French had achieved their objectives of 16 August relatively easily. The German garrisons at Champaubert Farm and Brienne House held out until French artillery deluged them with shells, which induced the garrisons to surrender thirty minutes later. The French took more than {{nowrap|300 prisoners,}} numerous guns, trench mortars and machine-guns.{{sfn|Times|1918|p=365}}\n\n[[File:The German L'eclusette blockhouse at Drie Grachten, 1917.png|thumb|{{centre|Plan view of the German l'Eclusette blockhouse at Drie Grachten, 1917}}]]\nNorth and north-east of Bixschoote, the ground sloped towards the Steenbeek and was dotted with pillboxes.

The French artillery had bombarded the Drie Grachten bridgehead for several days and reduced it to ruins, the concrete works being easily hit by heavy artillery and on 16 August, the French infantry waded through the floods and occupied the area. On the Poelsele peninsula the German defenders resisted until nightfall before being driven back, as the French closed up to the west bank of the Martjewaart [[Reach (geography)|reach]] of the Steenbeek. North and north-east of Bixschoote, the French reached the west bank of the St Janshoek reach and surrounded Les Lilas.

From the southern edge of the inundations between Dixmude and Drie Grachten, the French line had been pushed forward to the west bank of the Steenbeek as far as the south end of St Janshoek. South of Mondovi blockhouse, the Steenbeek had been crossed and on the extreme right, the {{lang|fr|1<sup>re</sup> Arm\u00e9e}} had swung northwards to the south bank of the Broombeek, eliminating the possibility of the Fifth Army being outflanked from the north.

At {{nowrap|2:08 p.m.}} Gough ordered that a line from Borry Farm to Hill 35 and Hindu Cottage be taken to link with XVIII Corps. After consulting the divisional commanders, Watts reported that a renewed attack was impossible, since the reserve brigades were already holding the start line.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=197}}\n\nThere were few German counter-attacks on the fronts of XVIII and XIV Corps, which had also not been subjected to much artillery fire before the attack, as the Germans had concentrated on the corps further south. Despite the \"worst going\" in the salient, the 48th (South Midland) Division got forward on its left, against fire from the area not occupied by 36th (Ulster) Division on its right; the 11th (Northern) Division advanced beyond Langemarck. The 20th (Light) and 29th Division of XIV Corps and the French further north reached most of their objectives without serious counter-attack but the Germans subjected the new positions to intense artillery fire, inflicting many losses for several days, especially on the 20th (Light) Division.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=201}} The German army group commander, Crown Prince Rupprecht wrote that the German defence continued to be based on holding the Gheluvelt Plateau and Houthoulst Forest as bastions, British advances in between were not serious threats.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=201}} Ludendorff was less sanguine, writing that 10 August was a German success but that the British attack on 16 August was another great blow. Poelcappelle had been reached and despite a great effort, the British could only be pushed back a short distance.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|p=232}}{{efn|In 2011, [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Sheffield]] wrote that Ludendorff was correct to describe the battle as \"another great blow\". Sheffield called the battle a sobering reminder that military operations can only be judged by considering their effect on both sides.{{sfn|Sheffield|2011|p=237}}}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Third Ypres - Map Showing Progress in the Ypres Area..jpg|thumb|{{centre|Map showing progress in the Ypres area, 1917}}]]\nThe British plan to overcome the German ''deep battlefield'', was based on a conventional attack in three stages but the artillery was able to arrange a fire plan which was far more sophisticated than in previous attacks. The creeping barrage preceded the infantry and in some places moved slowly enough for the infantry to keep up. New smoke shells were fired when the creeping barrage paused beyond each objective, which helped to obscure the British infantry from artillery observers and German machine-gunners far back in the German defensive zone, who fired at long range through the British artillery barrages. Around Langemarck the British infantry formed up close the German positions, too near to the German defenders for the German artillery to fire on for fear of hitting their infantry, although British troops further back at the Steenbeek were severely bombarded. British platoons and sections were allotted objectives and engineers accompanied troops to bridge obstacles and attack strong points. In the 20th (Light) Division, each company was reduced to three platoons, two to advance using infiltration tactics and one to mop up areas where the forward platoons had by-passed resistance, by attacking from the flanks and from behind.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|pp=162\u2013164}}\n\nIn the II and XIX Corps areas, the foremost British infantry had been isolated by German artillery and then driven back by counter-attacks. At a conference with the Fifth Army corps commanders on 17 August, Gough arranged for local attacks to gain jumping-off positions for a general attack on 25 August.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=202}} Apart from small areas on the left of the 56th (1/1st London) Division (Major-General F. A. Dudgeon), the flanks of the 8th Division and right of the 16th (Irish) Division, the British had been forced back to their start line by German machine-gun fire from the flanks and infantry counter-attacks supported by plentiful artillery.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|loc=sketch 18}} Attempts by the German infantry to advance further were stopped by British artillery-fire, which inflicted many losses.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=194}} Dudgeon reported that there had been a lack of time to prepare the attack and study the ground, since the 167th Brigade had relieved part of the 25th Division after it had only been in the line for {{nowrap|24 hours;}} neither unit had sufficient time to make preparations for the attack. Dudgeon also reported that no tracks had been laid beyond Ch\u00e2teau Wood, that the wet ground had slowed the delivery of supplies to the front line and obstructed the advance beyond it. Pillboxes had caused more delays and subjected the attacking troops to frequent enfilade fire.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|p=153}}\n\nMajor-General [[Oliver Nugent]], the commander of the 36th (Ulster) Division, had used information from captured German orders and noted that German artillery could not bombard advancing British troops since German positions were distributed in depth and the forward zone was easily penetrated. The advance of supporting troops was much easier to obstruct but it was more important to help the foremost infantry. If counter-battery fire was insufficient, the covering fire in front of the advance was more important and counter-battery groups should change target. Nugent recommended that fewer field guns be used for the creeping barrage and that surplus guns should be grouped to fire sweeping barrages (from side-to-side) and that [[Shrapnel shell]]s should be fuzed to burst higher up, to hit the inside of shell holes. Creeping barrages should be slower with more frequent and longer pauses, during which the barrages from field artillery and [[BL 60-pounder gun|60-pounder guns]] should sweep and search (move side-to-side and back-and-forth). Nugent suggested that infantry formations should change from skirmish lines to company columns on narrow fronts, equipped with a machine-gun and Stokes mortar and move within a zone, since lines broke up under machine-gun fire in crater-fields.{{sfn|Falls|1996|pp=122\u2013124}}{{efn|Cyril Falls, the 36th (Ulster) Division historian, wrote that on 20 September, the 9th (Scottish) Division attacked Frezenburg behind a slower barrage, halted on intermediate objectives for an hour and that each creeping barrage to successive objectives was slower than the one before. Lines of infantry sections at {{convert|20|yd|m|abbr=on}} intervals leap-frogged, rather than advance in front of mopping up parties and had \"complete success\".{{sfn|Falls|1996|p=124}}}}\n\nTanks to help capture pillboxes had bogged down behind the British front-line and air support had been restricted by the weather, particularly by low cloud early on and by sending too few aircraft over the battlefield. Only one aircraft per corps was reserved for counter-attack patrol, with two aircraft per division for ground attack. Only eight aircraft covered the army front to engage German infantry as they counter-attacked.{{sfn|Wise|1981|p=424}} Signalling had failed at vital moments and deprived the infantry of artillery support, which had made the German counter-attacks much more formidable in areas where the Germans had artillery observation. The 56th (1/1st London Division) Division recommended that advances be shortened, to give more time for consolidation and to minimise the organisational and communication difficulties caused by the muddy ground and wet weather.{{sfn|Dudley Ward|2001|pp=160\u2013161}} Divisional artillery commanders asked for two aircraft per division, exclusively to conduct counter-attack patrols. With observation from higher ground to the east, German artillery fire inflicted many casualties on the British troops holding the new line beyond Langemarck.{{efn|The German order of battle was the 5th Bavarian ({{lang|de|Eingreif}}), 34th, 214th, 3rd Reserve, 119th, 183rd, 32nd, 9th Bavarian Reserve, 204th, 54th, 12th Reserve ({{lang|de|Eingreif}}), 26th Reserve, 79th Reserve ({{lang|de|Eingreif}}), 26th and 26th Reserve divisions.{{sfn|USWD|1920}}}}\n\nThe success of the German 4th Army in preventing the Fifth Army from advancing far along the Gheluvelt Plateau, led Haig to reinforce the offensive in the south-east, along the southern side of Passchendaele Ridge. Haig transferred principal authority for the offensive to the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] (General [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Herbert Plumer]]) on 25 August. Like Gough after 31 July, Plumer planned to launch a series of attacks with even more limited geographical objectives, using the extra heavy artillery brought in from the armies further south, to deepen and increase the weight of the creeping barrage. Plumer intended to ensure that the infantry were organised on tactically advantageous ground and in contact with their artillery, when they received German counter-attacks.{{sfn|Nicholson|1964|p=308}} Minor operations by both sides continued in September along the Second and Fifth army fronts, the boundary of which had been moved northwards, close to the Ypres\u2013Roulers railway at the end of August.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|pp=66\u201369}}\n\n===Casualties===\nThe Official Historian, [[James Edward Edmonds|James Edmonds]] recorded {{nowrap|68,010}} British casualties for {{nowrap|31 July \u2013 28}} August, of whom {{nowrap|10,266 had}} been killed, with a claim that 37 German divisions had been exhausted and withdrawn.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=209}} Calculations of German losses by Edmonds have been severely criticised ever since.{{sfn|McRandle|Quirk|2006|pp=667\u2013701}} By mid-August the German army had mixed views on the course of events.

Jacob (II Corps) wanted to attack the brown line and then the yellow line, Watts (XIX Corps) wanted to attack the purple line but Maxse (XVIII Corps) preferred to attack the dotted purple line, ready to attack the yellow line with XIX Corps. Gough decided to attack in different places at different times, risking defeat in detail. Infantry tactics would be irrelevant if the artillery failed to suppress the German defenders as the infantry struggled through mud and waterlogged shell-holes.{{sfn|Simpson|2006|p=101}} On 17 August, a 48th (South Midland) Division (XVIII Corps) attack on Maison du Hibou failed; next day the 14th (Light) Division (II Corps) attacked with a brigade through Inverness Copse, although held up further north by fire from Fitzclarence and L-shaped farms. A German counter-attack forced the British half-way back through the copse; with support from two tanks on the Menin Road, the British held on despite three more German attacks. In the XIV Corps area, the 86th Brigade of the 29th Division pushed forward and established nine posts over the Broombeek.{{sfn|Gillon|2002|p=133}}\n\n====Action of the Cockcroft====\n\n{{main|Action of the Cockcroft}}\n{{see also|Operations on the Gheluvelt Plateau, July\u2013August 1917#Inverness Copse|l1=Inverness Copse|Action of 22 August 1917}}\n\n[[File:Cockcroft 19 Aug 1917.png|thumb|upright=.5|{{centre|Roads and German strongpoints east of St Julien}}]]\nOn 19 August, in the Action of the Cockcroft, parties from the 48th (South Midland) Division (XVIII Corps) and a composite company of the 1st Tank Brigade, attacked up the St Julien\u2013Poelcappelle road to capture Hillock Farm, Triangle Farm, Maison du Hibou, the Cockcroft, Winnipeg Cemetery, Springfield and Vancouver, fortified farms, blockhouses and pillboxes.{{sfn|Williams-Ellis|Williams-Ellis|1919|p=151}} The advance was covered by a smoke barrage and low-flying aircraft which disguised the sound of the tanks.

The battle took place near [[Ypres Salient|Ypres]] in Belgian Flanders, on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] against the German [[4th Army (German Empire)|4th Army]]. The French [[First Army (France)|First Army]] had a big success on the northern flank from Bixschoote to Drie Grachten and the British gained a substantial amount of ground northwards from [[Langemark]] to the boundary with the French.\n\nThe attack on the Gheluvelt Plateau on the right (southern) flank captured a considerable amount of ground but failed to reach its objectives. German counter-attacks recaptured most of the lost territory during the afternoon. The weather prevented much of the British programme of air co-operation with the infantry, which made it easier for German reserves to assemble on the battlefield.\n\nAn unusually large amount rain in August, poor drainage and lack of evaporation turned the ground into a morass, which was worse for the British and French, who occupied lower-lying ground and attacked areas which had been frequently and severely bombarded. Mud and flooded shell holes severely reduced the mobility of the infantry and poor visibility hampered artillery observers and artillery-observation aircraft. Rainstorms and the costly German defensive success during the rest of August, led the British to stop the offensive for three weeks.\n\nIn early September, the sun came out and with the return of a breeze, dried much of the ground. The British rebuilt roads and tracks to the front line, transferred more artillery and fresh divisions from the armies further south and revised further their tactics. The main offensive effort was shifted southwards and led to success on the Gheluvelt Plateau on 20, 26 September and 4 October, before the rains returned.\n\n==Background==\n===Strategic background===\n{{see also|Battle of Hill 70}}\n\nArtillery preparation for the [[Battle of Verdun|Second Battle of Verdun]], in support of the Allied offensive in Flanders, which had been delayed from mid-July began on 20 August, after an eight-day bombardment.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|pp=379\u2013383}} Attacking on an {{convert|18|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} front, the French captured [[Mort Homme]], Hill 304 and {{nowrap|10,000 prisoners.}} The 5th Army could not counter-attack because its [[Eingreif division|''Eingreif]] divisions had been sent to Flanders. Fighting at Verdun continued into September, adding to the pressure on the German army.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=231}} The [[Canadian Corps]] fought the Battle of Hill 70 {{nowrap|(15\u201325 August),}} outside [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] on the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] front. The attack was costly but inflicted great losses on five German divisions and pinned down troops reserved for relief of tired divisions on the Flanders front.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=219\u2013230}} The strategy of forcing the German army to defend the Ypres salient, to protect the Belgian coast and submarine bases had succeeded. The French and Russians could make local attacks but needed more time to recuperate free of big German attacks. The British had forced the Germans into a costly defensive battle but the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]] (General [[Hubert Gough]]) had struggled to advance since 31 July, due to the tenacity of the German defence and the unusually wet weather. Gough kept pressure on the [[4th Army (German Empire)|4th Army]], to prevent the Germans from recovering and to enable [[Operation Hush]] on the coast, which needed the high tides due at the end of August.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=190}}\n\n===Tactical developments===\n\nIn July 1917, [[Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]] had begun the Third Battle of Ypres, an attempt to inflict unsustainable losses on the German army and to advance out of the [[Ypres Salient]] to capture the Belgian coast and end the submarine threat from Belgian bases to the southern North Sea and the Dover Straits. At the [[Battle of Messines Ridge]] (7\u201314 June) the ridge had been captured down to the ''Oosttaverne'' line and a substantial success had been gained at the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge]] 31 July \u2013 2 August.{{sfn|Sheffield|2011|p=233}} Ground conditions in August were poor, as the surface had been bombarded, fought over and partially flooded, at times severely so. Shelling had destroyed drainage canals in the area and unseasonable heavy rain in August turned some parts into morasses of mud and waterlogged shell-craters. Supply troops walked to the front on duck boards laid across the mud; carrying loads of up to {{convert|45|kg|lb|order=flip|abbr=on}}, soldiers could slip into the craters and drown. Trees were reduced to blasted trunks, the branches and leaves torn away and corpses from earlier fighting were uncovered by the rain and shelling. The ground was powdery to a depth of {{convert|9|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} and when wet, had the consistency of [[porridge]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|p=360}}\n\nBrigadier-General [[John Humphrey Davidson|John Davidson]], Director of Operations at BEF HQ, submitted a memorandum on 1 August, urging caution on Haig and Gough. Davidson recommended that the preliminary operation by II Corps not be hurried; a full artillery preparation and a relief by fresh divisions should be completed before the operation; tired and depleted units had often failed in such attacks; two fresh divisions were sent to II Corps. Two or three clear days were needed for accurate artillery-fire especially as captured ground on the Gheluvelt plateau gave better observation and German maps revealed the positions of their machine-gun emplacements, which being small and well concealed, needed accurate fire by the artillery to destroy them. The capture of the black line from Inverness Copse north to Westhoek, would be insufficient to protect an advance from the Steenbeek further north and large German counter-attacks could be expected on the plateau, given that it was the German defensive point of main effort ({{lang|de|Schwerpunkt}}).{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=180\u2013182}}\n\n====Weather====\nExcept where shell-holes obstructed drainage, the ground in west Flanders dried quickly and became dusty after a few dry days.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|pp=369\u2013370}} A 1989 study of weather data recorded from 1867 to 1916 at Lille, {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on}} down the road from Ypres, showed August to be more often dry than wet, a trend towards dry autumns (September\u2013November) and that average rainfall in October had decreased over the previous {{nowrap|50 years.}}{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=147\u2013148}} From 1 to 10 August, {{convert|59.1|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell, including {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} in a thunderstorm on 8 August.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|pp=7\u201339}} In August 1917, {{convert|127|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell, of which {{convert|84|mm|in|abbr=on}} fell on {{nowrap|1, 8, 14, 26 and}} {{nowrap|27 August.}} The month was so overcast and windless that water on the ground dried slower than usual. September had {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain and was much sunnier, the ground drying quickly, hard enough in places for shells to [[ricochet]] and for dust to blow in the breeze. In October, {{convert|107|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell, compared to the 1914\u20131916 average of {{convert|44|mm|in|abbr=on}} and from {{nowrap|1\u20139 November}} there was another {{convert|7.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain and only nine hours of sunshine, little of the water drying; another {{convert|13.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell on 10 November.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=149\u2013151}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British offensive preparations===\n\n{{main|Western Front tactics, 1917#The British set-piece attack, mid-1917|l1=The British set-piece attack in mid-1917}}\n\n[[File:12inchMkIXRailwayGunVickersMountingWoestenAugust231917.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|A British 12-inch railway gun at [[Woesten]], with its crew perched on it and the propaganda slogan ''Not on Strike'' on the barrel.}}]]\nFew of the pillboxes captured on 31 July had been damaged by artillery-fire and before the attack, the 109th Brigade [36th (Ulster) Division] commander Brigadier-General [[Ambrose St Q. Ricardo]], arranged three-minute bombardments on selected pillboxes and blockhouses by the XIX Corps heavy artillery, with pauses so that artillery observers could make corrections to contradictory maps and photographs. It was discovered that on many of the targets, the shell dispersion covered hundreds of yards, as did wire-cutting bombardments.{{sfn|Falls|1996|p=121}} On 2 August, at the suggestion of Brigadier-General [[Hugh Elles]], commander of the Tank Corps, it was decided that the surviving tanks were to be held back due to the weather, for use en masse later on, although some were used later in the month. The preliminary operation intended for 2 August was delayed by rain until 10 August and more rain delays forced the postponement of the general offensive from 4 to 15 August and then again to 16 August.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=183\u2013184, 189\u2013190}}\n\nThe [[20th (Light) Division]] replaced the [[38th (Welsh) Infantry Division|38th (Welsh) Division]] on 5 August. The 7th Battalion of the [[Somerset Light Infantry]] took over captured German trenches behind the front line on 5 August, which had been turned into the British reserve line and lost three men to shellfire while waiting for dark. On arrival at the support line {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}} forward and the front line another {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}} beyond, the battalion found that the front line consisted of shell hole posts with muddy bottoms strung along the Steenbeek, from the Langemarck road to the Ypres\u2013Staden railway. British artillery was engaged in destructive bombardments of the German positions opposite and German artillery fire was aimed at the British infantry concentrating for the next attack. After heavy rain all night, the battalion spent 6 August soaked through and had {{nowrap|20 casualties,}} two men being killed. On 7 August, there were {{nowrap|35 casualties}}, including twelve killed, before the battalion was relieved until 14 August. Training began for the next attack, planned from trench maps and aerial photographs. Each company formed three platoons, two for the advance, with two rifle sections in the lead, the Lewis-gun sections behind and the third platoon to mop up.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|pp=146\u2013148}}\n\n[[File:Interior of a dugout.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Interior of a dugout.}}]]\nTraining emphasised the need for units to \"hug\" the creeping barrage and form offensive flanks to assist troops whose advance had been halted by the defenders. Infantry that got forward could provide [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire and envelop German positions, which were to be left behind and mopped-up by reserve platoons. Every known German position was allocated to a unit of the {{circa|470 men}} left in the battalion, to reduce the risk of unseen German positions being overrun and firing at the leading troops from behind. While the Somersets were out of the line, the 10th and 11th battalions, the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)#First World War|Rifle Brigade]] edged forward about {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}} beyond the Steenbeek, which cost the 10th Battalion {{nowrap|215 casualties.}} An attempt on 15 August to re-capture the Au Bon Gite blockhouse, {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} beyond the Steenbeek and lost to a German counter-attack on 31 July, failed. It was decided that the infantry for the general attack, due on 16 August, would have to squeeze into the ground beyond the river in front of the blockhouse for the attack on Langemarck.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\n====Operation Summer Night====\n\nOperation Summer Night ({{lang|de|Unternehmen Sommernacht}}) was a German methodical counter-attack ({{lang|de|Gegenangriff}}) attack near Hollebeke in the Second Army area on the southern flank, which began at {{nowrap|5:20 a.m.}} on 5 August. The [[22nd Reserve Division (German Empire)|22nd Reserve Division]] had been relieved by the [[12th Division (German Empire)|12th Division]] and the [[207th Division (German Empire)|207th Division]] after its losses on 31 July. After a short bombardment, three companies of I Battalion, Infantry Regiment 62 of the 12th Division captured a slight rise {{convert|1|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Hollebeke]], surprising the British, who fell back {{convert|80|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The new German positions were on higher and drier ground and deprived the British of observation over the German rear, reducing casualties from British artillery-fire.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|p=101}}\n\nFurther to the south, Reserve Infantry regiments {{nowrap|209 and 213}} of the 207th Division, attacked Hollebeke through thick fog and captured the village despite many casualties, taking at least {{nowrap|300 prisoners.}} Most of the British were in captured pillboxes and blockhouses, which had to be attacked one by one and at {{nowrap|5:45 a.m.,}} three signal flares were fired to indicate success. The Germans later abandoned Hollebeke and reoccupied the old \"A line\", then withdrew to their start line, because of the severity of British counter-attacks and artillery-fire. ''Sommernacht'' left the front-line ragged, with a {{convert|400|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} gap between regiments {{nowrap|209 and 213,}} which the British tried to exploit with attacks and counter-attacks, before the bigger British effort of 10 August against the Gheluvelt Plateau.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=101\u2013104}}\n\n====Capture of Westhoek====\n\n{{main|Capture of Westhoek}}\n\n[[File:German pillbox, Flanders 1917.jpg|thumb|{{centre|German pillbox, Flanders 1917}}]]\nThe Gheluvelt Plateau became a sea of mud, flooded shell craters, fallen trees and barbed wire. Troops were exhausted quickly by the weather, massed artillery bombardments and lack of food and water; rapid relief of units spread the exhaustion through all the infantry, despite the front being held by fresh divisions. British artillery fired a preparatory bombardment from Polygon Wood to Langemarck but the German guns concentrated on the Plateau. The British gunners were hampered by low cloud and rain, which made air observation extremely difficult and shells were wasted on empty gun emplacements. The British 25th Division, 18th (Eastern) Division and the German 54th Division had relieved the original divisions by 4 August but the German 52nd Reserve Division was left in the line; the infantry of both sides were exhausted by 10 August. The 18th (Eastern) Division attacked on the right; some troops quickly reached their objectives but German artillery isolated them around Inverness Copse and Glencorse Wood. German troops counter-attacked several times and by nightfall the Copse and all but the north-west corner of Glencorse Wood had been recaptured. The 25th Division on the left flank advanced quickly and reached its objectives by {{nowrap|5:30 a.m.,}} rushing the Germans in Westhoek. Snipers and attacks by German aircraft caused an increasing number of casualties; the Germans counter-attacked into the night and the British guns bombarded German troops in their assembly positions. The appalling weather and costly defeats began a slump in British infantry morale; lack of replacements began to concern the German commanders.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=184\u2013190}}\n\n===Plan of attack===\n\n[[File:Ypres area,1917a.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Ypres area, 1917}}]]\nThe attack was planned as an advance in stages, to keep the infantry well under the protection of the field artillery.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|p=142}} II Corps was to reach the green line of 31 July, an advance of about {{convert|1350|\u2013|1500|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} and form a defensive flank from Stirling Castle to Black Watch Corner. The deeper objective was compensated for by reducing battalion frontages from {{convert|350|\u2013|225|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} and leap-frogging supporting battalions through an intermediate line, to take the final objective.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=190\u2013191}}\n\nOn the [[56th (London) Infantry Division|56th (1/1st London) Division]] front, the final objective was about {{convert|500|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} into Polygon Wood. On the right, the [[53rd Brigade (United Kingdom)|53rd Brigade]] of the 18th (Eastern) Division was to advance from Stirling Castle, through Inverness Copse to Black Watch Corner, at the south-west corner of Polygon Wood, to form a defensive flank to the south. Further north, the [[169th (3rd London) Brigade|169th Brigade]] was to advance to Polygon Wood through Glencorse Wood and [[167th (1st London) Brigade|167th Brigade]] was to reach the north-western part of Polygon Wood through Nonne Bosschen.{{sfn|Dudley Ward|2001|pp=154\u2013159}} The 8th Division was to attack with two brigades between Westhoek and the Ypres\u2013Roulers railway, to reach the green line on the rise east of the Hanebeek stream.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} Eight tanks were allotted to II Corps to assist the infantry. The artillery support for the attack was the same as that for 10 August, {{nowrap|180 eighteen-pounder}} guns for the creeping barrage moving at {{convert|100|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} in five minutes, with {{nowrap|seventy-two 4.5-inch}} howitzers and {{nowrap|thirty-six 18-pounders}} placing standing barrages beyond the final objective. Eight machine-gun companies were to fire barrages on the area from the north-east of Polygon Wood to west of Zonnebeke.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nXIX and XVIII corps, further north, were also to capture the green line, slightly beyond the German {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position). Each XIX Corps division had fourteen {{nowrap|18-pounder}} batteries for the creeping barrage, {{nowrap|twenty-four 4.5-inch}} howitzer batteries and forty machine-guns for standing barrages, along with the normal heavy artillery groups.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=195}} Each division also had {{nowrap|a hundred and eight 18-pounders}} and {{nowrap|thirty-six 4.5-inch}} howitzers for bombardment and benefited from supply routes which had been far less heavily shelled than those further south.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=194\u2013195}} In the XVIII Corps area, a brigade each from the 48th (South Midland) Division and 11th (Northern) Division with eight tanks each, was to attack from the north end of St Julien, to the White House east of Langemarck.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=199}}\n\nThe 20th (Light) Division planned to capture Langemarck with the [[60th Brigade (United Kingdom)|60th Brigade]] and [[61st Brigade (United Kingdom)|61st Brigade]]. The [[59th Brigade (United Kingdom)|59th Brigade]] was to go into reserve after holding the line before the attack, less the two battalions in the front line, which were to screen the assembly of the attacking brigades. The attack was to begin on the east bank of the Steenbeek, where the troops had {{convert|70|\u2013|135|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} of room to assemble, crossing over on wooden bridges laid by the engineers the night before the attack.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|p=151}}{{efn|Aid posts on the east bank were to be arranged once the advance began, so seriously wounded men would have to wait and walking wounded recross the stream, to reach Advanced Dressing Stations at Elverdinghe and Cheapside, {{convert|5500|\u2013|7000|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} away.

On the right, the 60th Brigade was to attack on a one-battalion front, with two battalions to leapfrog through the leading battalion, to reach the second and final objectives. The attack was to move north-east behind Langemarck, to confront an expected German counter-attack up the road from Poelcappelle, {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}} away, while the 61st Brigade, attacking on a two-brigade front, took the village shielded by the 60th Brigade. The manoeuvre of the 60th Brigade would also threaten the Germans in Langemarck with encirclement.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nAu Bon Gite, the German blockhouse which had resisted earlier attacks, was to be dealt with by infantry from one of the covering battalions and a Royal Engineer Field Company. Artillery for the attack came from the 20th (Light) Division, 38th (Welsh) Division and the heavy guns of XIV Corps. A creeping barrage was to move at {{convert|90|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} in four minutes and a standing barrage was to fall on the objective lines in succession as the infantry advanced. The first objective was to be bombarded for twenty minutes, as the creeping barrage moved towards it, then the second objective was to be shelled for an hour to catch retreating German soldiers, destroy defences and force any remaining Germans under cover. A third barrage was to come from the XIV Corps heavy artillery, sweeping back and forth with high explosive, from {{convert|300|\u2013|1500|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} ahead of the foremost British troops, to stop German machine-gunners in retired positions from firing through the British barrage. Smoke shell was to be fired to hide the attacking troops, as they re-organised at each objective. A machine-gun barrage from {{nowrap|48 guns}} was arranged, with half of the guns moving forward with the infantry, to add to their firepower. German troops were also to be [[Strafing|strafed]] by British aircraft from low altitude.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|p=150}} The French First Army was to extend the attack north, from the Kortebeek to Drie Grachten, aiming to reach the St Jansbeck.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=201}}\n\n===German defences===\n\n{{main|Western Front tactics, 1917#German defensive preparations, June\u2013July 1917|l1=German defensive preparations: June\u2013July 1917}}\n\n[[File:German defences east of Ypres mid-1917.jpg|thumb|{{centre|The British front line and the German defences in the area east of Ypres, mid-1917}}]]\nThe German 4th Army operation order for the defensive battle was issued on 27 June.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=143}} German infantry units had been reorganised on similar lines to the British, with a rifle section, assault troop section, a grenade-launcher section and a light machine-gun section.

The line marked the front of the main battle zone ({{lang|de|Grosskampffeld}}), which was about {{convert|2500|yd|mi+km|abbr=on}} deep, behind which was the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position) and most of the field artillery of the front divisions.

Drie Grachten (Three Canals) was the main German defensive fortification in the area, blocking the Noordschoote\u2013Luyghem road at the crossing of the Yperlee Canal north of the Steenbeek. The area was beyond the confluence with the Kortebeek, where the rivers joined to become the St Jansbeek. From Luyghem, a road ran south-east to Verbrandemis and the road from Zudyschoote and Lizenie to Dixmude crossed the Yperlee at Steenstraat. The capture of Luyghem, Merckem and the road would threaten Houthoulst Forest, to the south of Dixmude and north of Langemarck. By 15 August, the French had closed up to Drie Grachten from Bixschoote to the south-east and Noordschoote to the south-west.{{sfn|Times|1918|pp=362\u2013363}}\n\nWest of the Yperlee Canal, the bridgehead consisted of a semi-circular breastwork due to waterlogged soil. Reinforced concrete shelters were connected by a raised trench of concrete, earth and [[fascine]]s, with a communication trench leading back to a command post. Several hundred yards along a communication trench on the north side of the road was a small blockhouse. Barbed wire entanglements had been laid above and below the water in front of the post and blockhouse astride the Noordschoote\u2013Luyghem road. To the north was l'Eclusette Redoubt and another pillbox lay to the south, on the west side of the Yperlee. The redoubts corresponded to the defences on the east bank of the canal and enclosed the flanks of the position {{convert|2|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on}} above the inundations. Platforms gave machine-guns command of a wide arc of ground in front. On the east bank of the Yperlee was a rampart of reinforced concrete, behind and parallel with the canal, from opposite l'Eclusette to the southern redoubt. Communication between the rampart and the defences of the Luyghem peninsula was via the raised road from Drie Grachten to Luyghem and two footbridges through the floods, one north and one south of the road. Every {{convert|35|\u2013|50|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}}, were traverses with reinforced concrete shelters.{{sfn|Times|1918|p=364}}\n\nIn an appreciation of 2 August, Group Ypres correctly identified the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} as the British objective on 31 July and predicted more attacks on the Gheluvelt Plateau and further north towards Langemarck. In the Group Ypres area, only the 3rd and 79th Reserve divisions remained battleworthy, the other four having suffered {{circa|10,000 casualties.}} On 4 August, a {{lang|de|Gruppe Wijtschate}} assessment concluded that the British needed to force back the 52nd Division on the Gheluvelt Plateau, where the defensive scheme had the front regiment of each division backed by the other two regiments in support and in reserve behind the front line. Crown Prince Rupprecht expressed concern on 5 August, that the weather conditions were rapidly exhausting the German infantry. Casualties averaged {{nowrap|1,500\u20132,000 men}} per division, lower than the {{nowrap|4,000 average}} on the Somme in 1916 but only because divisions were being relieved more frequently. Supplying troops in the front line was extremely difficult because the British were using more gas, which caught carrying parties by surprise; the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division had suffered {{nowrap|1,200 gas}} casualties.{{sfn|Sheldon|2007|pp=101\u2013104}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Fifth Army===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"  align=right style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em\"\n|+'''Weather'''<br><small>11\u201331 August 1917</small>{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|pp=39\u201366}}\n|-\n!

German flares were seen rising but the German artillery response was slow and missed the attackers. In the 18th (Eastern) Division area, German machine-gun fire from pillboxes caused many losses to the 53rd Brigade, which was stopped in front of the north-west corner of Inverness Copse. Part of the brigade managed to work forward further north and form a defensive flank along the southern edge of Glencorse Wood. To the north, the 169th Brigade of the 56th (1/1st London) Division advanced quickly at the start but veered to the right around boggy ground, then entered Glencorse Wood. The German main line of resistance was in a sunken road inside the wood, where after a hard-fought and mutually costly engagement, the German defenders were overrun and the rest of the wood occupied. The leading waves then advanced to Polygon Wood.{{sfn|Dudley Ward|2001|pp=156\u2013158}}\n\nThe 167th Brigade also had a fast start but when it reached the north end of Nonne Bosschen, found mud {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep, the brigade veering round it to the left but the gap which this caused between the 167th and 169th brigades was not closed. Another problem emerged, because the quick start had been partly due to the rear waves pushing up to avoid German shelling on the left of the brigade. The follow-up infantry mingled with the foremost troops and failed to mop up the captured ground or German troops who had been overrun. Isolated German parties began sniping from behind at both brigades. Part of one company reached the area north of Polygon Wood at about the same time as small numbers of troops from the 8th Division.{{sfn|Dudley Ward|2001|pp=158\u2013159}} The ground conditions in the 56th (1/1st London) Division area were so bad that none of the tanks in support got into action.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|p=146}}\n\nOn the 8th Division front, the two attacking brigades started well, advancing behind an \"admirable\" barrage and reached the Hanebeek, where hand bridges were used to cross and continue the advance up Anzac Spur, to the green line objectives on the ridge beyond. Difficulties began on the left flank, where troops from [[16th (Irish) Division]] had not kept up with the 8th Division. After reaching the vicinity of Potsdam Redoubt a little later, the 16th (Irish) Division was held up for the rest of the day. The check to the Irish left German machine-gunners north of the railway free to enfilade the area of 8th Division to the south. On the right flank, the same thing happened to the 56th (1/1st London) Division, which was stopped by fire from German strongpoints and pillboxes in their area and from German artillery concentrated to the south-east. After a long fight, the 8th Division captured Iron Cross, Anzac and Zonnebeke redoubts on the rise beyond the Hanebeek, then sent parties over the ridge.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|p=146}}\n\n====XIX Corps====\n\nThe 16th (Irish) and 36th (Ulster) divisions attacked from north of the Ypres\u2013Roulers railway to just south of St Julien. The divisions were to advance {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} up the Anzac and Zonnebeke spurs, near the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position). Providing carrying parties since the last week in July and holding ground from 4 August in the Hanebeek and Steenbeek valleys, which were overlooked by the Germans, had exhausted many men and from 1 to 15 August, the divisions had lost about a third of their front-line strength in casualties. Frequent reliefs during the unexpected delays caused by the rain spread the casualties and fatigue to all of the battalions in both divisions. The advance began on time and after a few hundred yards encountered German strong points, which were found not to have been destroyed by a series of special heavy artillery bombardments before the attack.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\nThe 16th (Irish) Division suffered many casualties from the Germans in Potsdam, Vampire and Borry farms, which had not been properly mopped up, because of the acute the infantry shortage. The garrisons were able to shoot at the advancing Irish troops of the [[48th Brigade (United Kingdom)|48th Brigade]] from behind and only isolated parties of British troops managed to reach their objectives. The [[49th Brigade (United Kingdom)|49th Brigade]] on the left was also held up at Borry Farm, which defeated several costly attacks but the left of the brigade got within {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} of the top of {{nowrap|Hill 37.}}{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=195\u2013196}} The 36th (Ulster) Division also struggled to advance, Gallipoli and Somme farms found to be behind a new wire entanglement, with German machine-guns trained on gaps made by the British bombardment, fire from which stopped the advance of the [[108th Brigade (United Kingdom)|108th Brigade]]. To the north, the [[109th Brigade (United Kingdom)|109th Brigade]] had to get across the swamp astride the Steenbeek. The infantry lost the barrage and machine-gun fire from Pond Farm and Border House forced them to take cover. On the left troops got to Fortuin, about {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} from the start line.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=196}}\n\n====XVIII Corps====\n\nThe 48th (South Midland) Division attacked at {{nowrap|4:45 a.m.}} with one brigade, capturing Border House and gun pits either side of the north-east bearing [[Sint-Juliaan|St Julien]]\u2013Winnipeg road, where they were held up by machine-gun fire and a small counter-attack. The capture of St Julien was completed and the infantry consolidated along a line from Border House, to Jew Hill, the gun pits and St Julien. Troops were fired on from Maison du Hibou and Hillock Farm, which was captured soon after, then British troops seen advancing on Springfield Farm disappeared. At {{nowrap|9:00 a.m.,}} German troops gathered around Triangle Farm and at {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.,}} made an abortive counter-attack. Another German attack after dark was defeated at the gun pits and at {{nowrap|9:30 p.m.,}} a German counter-attack from Triangle Farm was repulsed.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|p=52}}\n\nThe 11th (Northern) Division attacked with one brigade at {{nowrap|4:45 a.m.}} The right flank was delayed by machine-gun fire from the 48th (South Midland) Division area and by pillboxes to their front, where the infantry lost the barrage. On the left, the brigade dug in {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}} west of the Langemarck road and the right flank dug in facing east, against fire from Maison du Hibou and the Triangle. Supporting troops from the 33rd Brigade were caught by fire from the German pillboxes but reached the Cockcroft, passed beyond and dug in despite fire from Bulow Farm. On the left flank, these battalions reached the Langemarck road, passed Rat House and Pheasant Trench and ended their advance just short of the White House, joining with the right side of the brigade on the Lekkerboterbeek.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|pp=53\u201355}}\n\n====XIV Corps====\n\nThe 20th (Light) Division attacked with two brigades at {{nowrap|4:45 a.m.}} The battalions of the right brigade leap-frogged forward on a one-battalion front over the Steenbeek and then advanced in single file, worming round shell craters full of water and mud. Alouette Farm, Langemarck and the first two objective lines were reached easily. At {{nowrap|7:20 a.m.,}} the advance to the final objective began and immediately encountered machine-gun fire from the Rat House and White House. Firing continued until they were captured, the final objective being taken at {{nowrap|7:45 a.m.,}} as German troops withdrew to a small wood behind White House. The left brigade advanced on a two-battalion front and encountered machine-gun fire from the Au Bon Gite blockhouse before it was captured and was then fired on from German blockhouses in front of Langemarck and from the railway station. Once these had been captured, the advance resumed at {{nowrap|7:20 a.m.,}} despite fire from hidden parties of defenders and reached the final objective at {{nowrap|7:47 a.m.,}} under fire from the Rat House. German counter-attacks began around {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.}} and advanced {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} around Schreiboom, being driven back some distance later on.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|pp=53\u201355}}\n\nThe 29th Division to the north attacked at the same time with two brigades. On the right the first objective was reached quickly and assistance given to the 20th (Liight) Division on the right. The [[Royal Newfoundland Regiment|Newfoundland Regiment]] passed through, being held up slightly by marshy conditions and fire from Cannes Farm. The Newfoundlanders continued, reached the third objective and then took Japan House beyond. The left brigade took the first objective easily and then met machine-gun fire from Champeaubert Farm in the French First Army sector and from Montmirail Farm. The advance continued to the final objective, which was reached and consolidated by {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} Patrols moved forward towards the Broombeek and a German counter-attack at {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.,}} was stopped by artillery and small-arms fire.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|p=55}} Langemarck and the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position), north of the Ypres\u2013Staden railway and west of the Kortebeek had been captured.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=200\u2013201, sketch 19}}\n\n===''1<sup>re</sup> Arm\u00e9e''===\n\nThe French [[1st Army Corps (France)|I Corps]], on the northern flank of the Fifth Army, attacked from the army boundary north-west of Weidendreft, south of the hamlet of St Janshoek (Sint Jan), north of [[Bikschote|Bixschoote]] and the edge of the floods, to the [[Noordschote|Noordschoote]]\u2013[[Luigem|Luyghem]] road, which crossed the [[Yperlee]] at [[Drie Grachten Hoekje|Drie Grachten]] (Three Canals).{{sfn|Times|1918|pp=362\u2013363}} The German defences were more visible than those opposite the British and being above ground, were easier to destroy.

The French crossed the upper Steenbeek from west of Weidendreft to a bend in the stream south-west of St Janshoek. Keeping pace with the British, they advanced to the south bank of the Broombeek. Mondovi blockhouse held out all day and pivoting on it, the Germans counter-attacked during the night of {{nowrap|16/17 August}} to get between the French and British. The attack failed and the next morning the troops on the army boundary had observation across the narrow Broombeek valley. Apart from resistance at Les Lilas and Mondovi blockhouses, the French had achieved their objectives of 16 August relatively easily. The German garrisons at Champaubert Farm and Brienne House held out until French artillery deluged them with shells, which induced the garrisons to surrender thirty minutes later. The French took more than {{nowrap|300 prisoners,}} numerous guns, trench mortars and machine-guns.{{sfn|Times|1918|p=365}}\n\n[[File:The German L'eclusette blockhouse at Drie Grachten, 1917.png|thumb|{{centre|Plan view of the German l'Eclusette blockhouse at Drie Grachten, 1917}}]]\nNorth and north-east of Bixschoote, the ground sloped towards the Steenbeek and was dotted with pillboxes.

The French artillery had bombarded the Drie Grachten bridgehead for several days and reduced it to ruins, the concrete works being easily hit by heavy artillery and on 16 August, the French infantry waded through the floods and occupied the area. On the Poelsele peninsula the German defenders resisted until nightfall before being driven back, as the French closed up to the west bank of the Martjewaart [[Reach (geography)|reach]] of the Steenbeek. North and north-east of Bixschoote, the French reached the west bank of the St Janshoek reach and surrounded Les Lilas.

From the southern edge of the inundations between Dixmude and Drie Grachten, the French line had been pushed forward to the west bank of the Steenbeek as far as the south end of St Janshoek. South of Mondovi blockhouse, the Steenbeek had been crossed and on the extreme right, the {{lang|fr|1<sup>re</sup> Arm\u00e9e}} had swung northwards to the south bank of the Broombeek, eliminating the possibility of the Fifth Army being outflanked from the north.

At {{nowrap|2:08 p.m.}} Gough ordered that a line from Borry Farm to Hill 35 and Hindu Cottage be taken to link with XVIII Corps. After consulting the divisional commanders, Watts reported that a renewed attack was impossible, since the reserve brigades were already holding the start line.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=197}}\n\nThere were few German counter-attacks on the fronts of XVIII and XIV Corps, which had also not been subjected to much artillery fire before the attack, as the Germans had concentrated on the corps further south. Despite the \"worst going\" in the salient, the 48th (South Midland) Division got forward on its left, against fire from the area not occupied by 36th (Ulster) Division on its right; the 11th (Northern) Division advanced beyond Langemarck. The 20th (Light) and 29th Division of XIV Corps and the French further north reached most of their objectives without serious counter-attack but the Germans subjected the new positions to intense artillery fire, inflicting many losses for several days, especially on the 20th (Light) Division.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=201}} The German army group commander, Crown Prince Rupprecht wrote that the German defence continued to be based on holding the Gheluvelt Plateau and Houthoulst Forest as bastions, British advances in between were not serious threats.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=201}} Ludendorff was less sanguine, writing that 10 August was a German success but that the British attack on 16 August was another great blow. Poelcappelle had been reached and despite a great effort, the British could only be pushed back a short distance.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|p=232}}{{efn|In 2011, [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Sheffield]] wrote that Ludendorff was correct to describe the battle as \"another great blow\". Sheffield called the battle a sobering reminder that military operations can only be judged by considering their effect on both sides.{{sfn|Sheffield|2011|p=237}}}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Third Ypres - Map Showing Progress in the Ypres Area..jpg|thumb|{{centre|Map showing progress in the Ypres area, 1917}}]]\nThe British plan to overcome the German ''deep battlefield'', was based on a conventional attack in three stages but the artillery was able to arrange a fire plan which was far more sophisticated than in previous attacks. The creeping barrage preceded the infantry and in some places moved slowly enough for the infantry to keep up. New smoke shells were fired when the creeping barrage paused beyond each objective, which helped to obscure the British infantry from artillery observers and German machine-gunners far back in the German defensive zone, who fired at long range through the British artillery barrages. Around Langemarck the British infantry formed up close the German positions, too near to the German defenders for the German artillery to fire on for fear of hitting their infantry, although British troops further back at the Steenbeek were severely bombarded. British platoons and sections were allotted objectives and engineers accompanied troops to bridge obstacles and attack strong points. In the 20th (Light) Division, each company was reduced to three platoons, two to advance using infiltration tactics and one to mop up areas where the forward platoons had by-passed resistance, by attacking from the flanks and from behind.{{sfn|Moorhouse|2003|pp=162\u2013164}}\n\nIn the II and XIX Corps areas, the foremost British infantry had been isolated by German artillery and then driven back by counter-attacks. At a conference with the Fifth Army corps commanders on 17 August, Gough arranged for local attacks to gain jumping-off positions for a general attack on 25 August.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=202}} Apart from small areas on the left of the 56th (1/1st London) Division (Major-General F. A. Dudgeon), the flanks of the 8th Division and right of the 16th (Irish) Division, the British had been forced back to their start line by German machine-gun fire from the flanks and infantry counter-attacks supported by plentiful artillery.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|loc=sketch 18}} Attempts by the German infantry to advance further were stopped by British artillery-fire, which inflicted many losses.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=194}} Dudgeon reported that there had been a lack of time to prepare the attack and study the ground, since the 167th Brigade had relieved part of the 25th Division after it had only been in the line for {{nowrap|24 hours;}} neither unit had sufficient time to make preparations for the attack. Dudgeon also reported that no tracks had been laid beyond Ch\u00e2teau Wood, that the wet ground had slowed the delivery of supplies to the front line and obstructed the advance beyond it. Pillboxes had caused more delays and subjected the attacking troops to frequent enfilade fire.{{sfn|Boraston|Bax|1999|p=153}}\n\nMajor-General [[Oliver Nugent]], the commander of the 36th (Ulster) Division, had used information from captured German orders and noted that German artillery could not bombard advancing British troops since German positions were distributed in depth and the forward zone was easily penetrated. The advance of supporting troops was much easier to obstruct but it was more important to help the foremost infantry. If counter-battery fire was insufficient, the covering fire in front of the advance was more important and counter-battery groups should change target. Nugent recommended that fewer field guns be used for the creeping barrage and that surplus guns should be grouped to fire sweeping barrages (from side-to-side) and that [[Shrapnel shell]]s should be fuzed to burst higher up, to hit the inside of shell holes. Creeping barrages should be slower with more frequent and longer pauses, during which the barrages from field artillery and [[BL 60-pounder gun|60-pounder guns]] should sweep and search (move side-to-side and back-and-forth). Nugent suggested that infantry formations should change from skirmish lines to company columns on narrow fronts, equipped with a machine-gun and Stokes mortar and move within a zone, since lines broke up under machine-gun fire in crater-fields.{{sfn|Falls|1996|pp=122\u2013124}}{{efn|Cyril Falls, the 36th (Ulster) Division historian, wrote that on 20 September, the 9th (Scottish) Division attacked Frezenburg behind a slower barrage, halted on intermediate objectives for an hour and that each creeping barrage to successive objectives was slower than the one before. Lines of infantry sections at {{convert|20|yd|m|abbr=on}} intervals leap-frogged, rather than advance in front of mopping up parties and had \"complete success\".{{sfn|Falls|1996|p=124}}}}\n\nTanks to help capture pillboxes had bogged down behind the British front-line and air support had been restricted by the weather, particularly by low cloud early on and by sending too few aircraft over the battlefield. Only one aircraft per corps was reserved for counter-attack patrol, with two aircraft per division for ground attack. Only eight aircraft covered the army front to engage German infantry as they counter-attacked.{{sfn|Wise|1981|p=424}} Signalling had failed at vital moments and deprived the infantry of artillery support, which had made the German counter-attacks much more formidable in areas where the Germans had artillery observation. The 56th (1/1st London Division) Division recommended that advances be shortened, to give more time for consolidation and to minimise the organisational and communication difficulties caused by the muddy ground and wet weather.{{sfn|Dudley Ward|2001|pp=160\u2013161}} Divisional artillery commanders asked for two aircraft per division, exclusively to conduct counter-attack patrols. With observation from higher ground to the east, German artillery fire inflicted many casualties on the British troops holding the new line beyond Langemarck.{{efn|The German order of battle was the 5th Bavarian ({{lang|de|Eingreif}}), 34th, 214th, 3rd Reserve, 119th, 183rd, 32nd, 9th Bavarian Reserve, 204th, 54th, 12th Reserve ({{lang|de|Eingreif}}), 26th Reserve, 79th Reserve ({{lang|de|Eingreif}}), 26th and 26th Reserve divisions.{{sfn|USWD|1920}}}}\n\nThe success of the German 4th Army in preventing the Fifth Army from advancing far along the Gheluvelt Plateau, led Haig to reinforce the offensive in the south-east, along the southern side of Passchendaele Ridge. Haig transferred principal authority for the offensive to the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] (General [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Herbert Plumer]]) on 25 August. Like Gough after 31 July, Plumer planned to launch a series of attacks with even more limited geographical objectives, using the extra heavy artillery brought in from the armies further south, to deepen and increase the weight of the creeping barrage. Plumer intended to ensure that the infantry were organised on tactically advantageous ground and in contact with their artillery, when they received German counter-attacks.{{sfn|Nicholson|1964|p=308}} Minor operations by both sides continued in September along the Second and Fifth army fronts, the boundary of which had been moved northwards, close to the Ypres\u2013Roulers railway at the end of August.{{sfn|McCarthy|1995|pp=66\u201369}}\n\n===Casualties===\nThe Official Historian, [[James Edward Edmonds|James Edmonds]] recorded {{nowrap|68,010}} British casualties for {{nowrap|31 July \u2013 28}} August, of whom {{nowrap|10,266 had}} been killed, with a claim that 37 German divisions had been exhausted and withdrawn.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=209}} Calculations of German losses by Edmonds have been severely criticised ever since.{{sfn|McRandle|Quirk|2006|pp=667\u2013701}} By mid-August the German army had mixed views on the course of events.

Jacob (II Corps) wanted to attack the brown line and then the yellow line, Watts (XIX Corps) wanted to attack the purple line but Maxse (XVIII Corps) preferred to attack the dotted purple line, ready to attack the yellow line with XIX Corps. Gough decided to attack in different places at different times, risking defeat in detail. Infantry tactics would be irrelevant if the artillery failed to suppress the German defenders as the infantry struggled through mud and waterlogged shell-holes.{{sfn|Simpson|2006|p=101}} On 17 August, a 48th (South Midland) Division (XVIII Corps) attack on Maison du Hibou failed; next day the 14th (Light) Division (II Corps) attacked with a brigade through Inverness Copse, although held up further north by fire from Fitzclarence and L-shaped farms. A German counter-attack forced the British half-way back through the copse; with support from two tanks on the Menin Road, the British held on despite three more German attacks. In the XIV Corps area, the 86th Brigade of the 29th Division pushed forward and established nine posts over the Broombeek.{{sfn|Gillon|2002|p=133}}\n\n====Action of the Cockcroft====\n\n{{main|Action of the Cockcroft}}\n{{see also|Operations on the Gheluvelt Plateau, July\u2013August 1917#Inverness Copse|l1=Inverness Copse|Action of 22 August 1917}}\n\n[[File:Cockcroft 19 Aug 1917.png|thumb|upright=.5|{{centre|Roads and German strongpoints east of St Julien}}]]\nOn 19 August, in the Action of the Cockcroft, parties from the 48th (South Midland) Division (XVIII Corps) and a composite company of the 1st Tank Brigade, attacked up the St Julien\u2013Poelcappelle road to capture Hillock Farm, Triangle Farm, Maison du Hibou, the Cockcroft, Winnipeg Cemetery, Springfield and Vancouver, fortified farms, blockhouses and pillboxes.{{sfn|Williams-Ellis|Williams-Ellis|1919|p=151}} The advance was covered by a smoke barrage and low-flying aircraft which disguised the sound of the tanks.

The plan called for two of the first-stage engines to shut down to reduce the rocket's acceleration at approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds into the flight, when the Falcon 9 would nominally be 90 kilometers (56 miles) high and traveling at 10 times the speed of sound. The remaining engines were planned to cut off shortly after\u2014an event known as main-engine cutoff (MECO). Five seconds after MECO, the first and second stages separate. Seven seconds later, the second stage's single Merlin vacuum engine was projected to ignite to begin a 6-minute, 14-second burn to put Dragon into [[low-Earth orbit]]. Forty seconds after second-stage ignition, Dragon's protective nose cone, which covers Dragon's berthing mechanism, was planned to be jettisoned. At the 9-minute, 14-second mark after launch, the second-stage engine was scheduled to cut off (SECO). Thirty-five seconds later, Dragon was planned to separate from Falcon 9's second stage and reach its preliminary orbit. Dragon would, per plan, then deploy its solar arrays and open its guidance and navigation control (GNC) bay door which holds the sensors necessary for rendezvous and Dragon's [[Power Data Grapple Fixture|grapple fixture]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 2 (9 October) ===\nThe mission plan called for the Dragon spacecraft to perform a coelliptic burn that would place it in a circular [[coelliptic orbit]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 3 (10 October) ===\nAs Dragon chased the [[International Space Station]], the spacecraft established UHF communication using its COTS ultrahigh-frequency Communication unit (CUCU). Also, using the crew command panel (CCP) on board the station, the expedition crew monitored the approach. This ability for the crew to send commands to Dragon is important during the rendezvous and departure phases of the mission.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=October 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n\nDuring final approach to the station, a go/no-go was performed by [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#FCR 1 (2006-present)|Mission Control Houston]] and the SpaceX team in Hawthorne to allow Dragon to perform another engine burn that brought it 250 meters (820 feet) from the station. At this distance, Dragon began using its close-range guidance systems, composed of [[LIDAR]] and thermal imagers. These systems confirmed that Dragon's position and velocity are accurate by comparing the LIDAR image that Dragon receives against Dragon's thermal imagers. The Dragon flight control team in Hawthorne, with assistance from the NASA flight control team at the Johnson Space Center's International Space Station Flight Control Room, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. After another go/no-go was performed by the Houston and Hawthorne teams, Dragon was permitted to enter the keep-out sphere (KOS), an imaginary sphere drawn 200 meters (656 feet) around the station that reduces the risk of collision.  Dragon proceeded to a position 30 meters (98 feet) from the station and was automatically held. Another go/no-go was completed. Then Dragon proceeded to the 10-meter (32 feet) position\u2014the capture point.  A final go/no-go was performed, and the Mission Control Houston team notified the crew they were go for capture of Dragon.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=October 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n\nAt that point, Expedition 33 crew member [[Akihiko Hoshide]] of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency used the station's {{convert|17.6|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} robotic arm, known as [[Mobile Servicing System#Canadarm2|Canadarm2]], reached for and grappled the Dragon spacecraft at 10:56 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/> Hoshide, with the help of Expedition 33 Commander [[Sunita Williams]] of NASA, guided Dragon to the Earth-facing side of the station's [[Harmony module]].

Ford|Kevin Ford]] used the Canadarm2 robotic arm to detach Dragon from Harmony, maneuver it out to the 15-meter (50-foot) release point, and release the vehicle. Dragon then performed a series of three burns to place it on a trajectory away from the station. Approximately six hours after Dragon departed the station, it conducted a deorbit burn, which lasted up to 10 minutes. Dragon's trunk, which contains its solar arrays, was then jettisoned.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n[[File:SpX-1 Dragon at port.1.jpg|thumb|left|The SpX-1 capsule seen back at port on 30 October 2012]]\nThe landing was controlled by automatic firing of its [[Draco (rocket engine family)#Draco|Draco]] thrusters during [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]].{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --> In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual [[drogue parachute]]s deploy at an altitude of {{convert|13700|m|ft|abbr=on}} to stabilize and slow the spacecraft.

The Dragon capsule is expected to land in the Pacific Ocean, about {{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of southern California. SpaceX uses a 100-foot boat equipped with an A-frame and an articulating crane, a 90-foot crew boat for telemetry operations, and two 24-foot rigid-hull inflatable boats to perform recovery operations. On board are approximately a dozen SpaceX engineers and technicians as well as a four-person dive team. Once the Dragon capsule splashed down, the recovery team secured the vehicle and then placed it on deck for the journey back to shore.{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --><ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nSpaceX technicians opened the side hatch of the vehicle and retrieved the time-critical items.

During flight, the data suggests this material flaw ultimately developed into a breach in the main combustion chamber. This breach released a jet of hot gas and fuel in the direction of the main fuel line causing a secondary leak and ultimately a rapid drop in engine pressure. As a result, the flight computer commanded shutdown of engine 1 and Falcon 9 continued on its path to ensure Dragon's entry into orbit for subsequent rendezvous and berthing with the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/spacex-engine-anomaly-overview |title=SpaceX: Engine Anomaly Overview |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[List of Falcon 9 launches]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em |refs=\n\n<ref name=HARTMAN>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |title=International Space Station Program Status |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Presskit\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf |title=SpX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit |date=4 October 2012 |publisher=NASA, SpaceX, 45th Space Wing |accessdate=6 October 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SpaceX Launch Manifest\">\n{{cite web |title=SpaceX Launch Manifest |publisher=SpaceX |url=http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php |accessdate=31 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASA Launch Schedule\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA's Consolidated Launch Schedule |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |accessdate=21 June 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASAsept20\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/spacex-crs1-target.html |title=SpaceX, NASA Target Oct. 7 Launch For Resupply Mission To Space Station |date=20 September 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 September 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 18 May 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=18 May 2012 |title=SpaceX's historic commercial mission is 'just a test flight' |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518commercial/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=ClarkOct28>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/#.UI_fCIa_PKg |title=Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=28 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 24 August 2012\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA ready for operational cargo flights by SpaceX |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=24 August 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1208/24cots/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=SPACENOW10>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121010arrival/ |title=Dragon arrives at station with commercial delivery |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=10 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\">\n{{cite press |title=Orbcomm Eagerly Awaits Launch of New Satellite on Next Falcon 9 |date=25 May 2012 |publisher=Space News |url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/120525-spacex-success-welcome-orbcomm.html |accessdate=28 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |title=International Space Station Program Status |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sept29\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/09/falcon-9-hot-fires-engines-iss-prepares-dragons-arrival/ |title=Falcon 9 hot fires its engines as the ISS prepares for Dragon's arrival |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=29 September 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AugustChris\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/08/spacex-conduct-successful-wdr-falcon-9/ |title=SpaceX conduct successful WDR on their latest Falcon 9 |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=31 August 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|SpaceX CRS-1}}\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/index.html SpaceX CRS-1 NASA page]\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf SpaceX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit (4 October 2012)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I7loLnDYyU Video of Static Fire test -

The plan called for two of the first-stage engines to shut down to reduce the rocket's acceleration at approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds into the flight, when the Falcon 9 would nominally be 90 kilometers (56 miles) high and traveling at 10 times the speed of sound. The remaining engines were planned to cut off shortly after\u2014an event known as main-engine cutoff (MECO). Five seconds after MECO, the first and second stages separate. Seven seconds later, the second stage's single Merlin vacuum engine was projected to ignite to begin a 6-minute, 14-second burn to put Dragon into [[low-Earth orbit]]. Forty seconds after second-stage ignition, Dragon's protective nose cone, which covers Dragon's berthing mechanism, was planned to be jettisoned. At the 9-minute, 14-second mark after launch, the second-stage engine was scheduled to cut off (SECO). Thirty-five seconds later, Dragon was planned to separate from Falcon 9's second stage and reach its preliminary orbit. Dragon would, per plan, then deploy its solar arrays and open its guidance and navigation control (GNC) bay door which holds the sensors necessary for rendezvous and Dragon's [[Power Data Grapple Fixture|grapple fixture]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 2 (9 October) ===\nThe mission plan called for the Dragon spacecraft to perform a coelliptic burn that would place it in a circular [[coelliptic orbit]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 3 (10 October) ===\nAs Dragon chased the [[International Space Station]], the spacecraft established UHF communication using its COTS ultrahigh-frequency Communication unit (CUCU). Also, using the crew command panel (CCP) on board the station, the expedition crew monitored the approach.

Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#FCR 1 (2006-present)|Mission Control Houston]] and the SpaceX team in Hawthorne to allow Dragon to perform another engine burn that brought it 250 meters (820 feet) from the station. At this distance, Dragon began using its close-range guidance systems, composed of [[LIDAR]] and thermal imagers. These systems confirmed that Dragon's position and velocity are accurate by comparing the LIDAR image that Dragon receives against Dragon's thermal imagers. The Dragon flight control team in Hawthorne, with assistance from the NASA flight control team at the Johnson Space Center's International Space Station Flight Control Room, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. After another go/no-go was performed by the Houston and Hawthorne teams, Dragon was permitted to enter the keep-out sphere (KOS), an imaginary sphere drawn 200 meters (656 feet) around the station that reduces the risk of collision.  Dragon proceeded to a position 30 meters (98 feet) from the station and was automatically held. Another go/no-go was completed.

As a result, the flight computer commanded shutdown of engine 1 and Falcon 9 continued on its path to ensure Dragon's entry into orbit for subsequent rendezvous and berthing with the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/spacex-engine-anomaly-overview |title=SpaceX: Engine Anomaly Overview |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[List of Falcon 9 launches]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em |refs=\n\n<ref name=HARTMAN>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |title=International Space Station Program Status |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Presskit\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf |title=SpX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit |date=4 October 2012 |publisher=NASA, SpaceX, 45th Space Wing |accessdate=6 October 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SpaceX Launch Manifest\">\n{{cite web |title=SpaceX Launch Manifest |publisher=SpaceX |url=http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php |accessdate=31 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASA Launch Schedule\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA's Consolidated Launch Schedule |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |accessdate=21 June 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASAsept20\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/spacex-crs1-target.html |title=SpaceX, NASA Target Oct. 7 Launch For Resupply Mission To Space Station |date=20 September 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 September 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 18 May 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=18 May 2012 |title=SpaceX's historic commercial mission is 'just a test flight' |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518commercial/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=ClarkOct28>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/#.UI_fCIa_PKg |title=Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=28 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 24 August 2012\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA ready for operational cargo flights by SpaceX |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=24 August 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1208/24cots/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=SPACENOW10>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121010arrival/ |title=Dragon arrives at station with commercial delivery |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=10 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\">\n{{cite press |title=Orbcomm Eagerly Awaits Launch of New Satellite on Next Falcon 9 |date=25 May 2012 |publisher=Space News |url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/120525-spacex-success-welcome-orbcomm.html |accessdate=28 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |title=International Space Station Program Status |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sept29\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/09/falcon-9-hot-fires-engines-iss-prepares-dragons-arrival/ |title=Falcon 9 hot fires its engines as the ISS prepares for Dragon's arrival |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=29 September 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AugustChris\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/08/spacex-conduct-successful-wdr-falcon-9/ |title=SpaceX conduct successful WDR on their latest Falcon 9 |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=31 August 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|SpaceX CRS-1}}\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/index.html SpaceX CRS-1 NASA page]\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf SpaceX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit (4 October 2012)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I7loLnDYyU Video of Static Fire test -

It is similar to [[collage]], a two-dimensional medium. It is part of the [[visual arts]], and it typically uses found objects, but is not limited to these materials.<ref>Walker, John. (1992) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/Assemblage-Art \"Assemblage Art\"]. ''Glossary of Art, Architecture & Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed. Retrieved February 7, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://arthistory.about.com/od/glossary/g/a_assemblage.htm About.com art history] Retrieved March 30, 2011</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the art form dates to the cubist constructions of [[Pablo Picasso]] c. 1912\u20131914.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/|title=The Collection &#124; MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art}}</ref> The origin of the word (in its artistic sense) can be traced back to the early 1950s, when [[Jean Dubuffet]] created a series of [[collage]]s of butterfly wings, which he titled ''assemblages d'empreintes''. However, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Hablo]] and others had been working with [[found objects]] for many years prior to Dubuffet. Russian artist [[Vladimir Tatlin]] created his \"counter-reliefs\" in the mid 1910s. Alongside Tatlin, the earliest woman artist to try her hand at assemblage was [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]], the Dada Baroness. In Paris in the 1920s [[Alexander Calder]], [[Jose De Creeft]], [[Picasso]] and others began making fully 3-dimensional works from metal scraps, found metal objects and wire. In the U.S., one of the earliest and most prolific assemblage artists was [[Louise Nevelson]], who began creating her sculptures from found pieces of wood in the late 1930s.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s assemblage started to become more widely known and used. Artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns started using scrappy materials and objects to make anti-aesthetic art sculptures, a big part of the ideas that make assemblage what it is.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/assemblage|title=Assemblage \u2013 Art Term|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe painter [[Armando Rever\u00f3n]] is one of the first to use this technique when using disposable materials such as bamboo, wires, or kraft paper. In the thirties he made a skeleton with wings of mucilage, adopting this style years before other artists. Later, Rever\u00f3n made instruments and set pieces such as a telephone, a sofa, a sewing machine, a piano and even music books with their scores.\n\nIn 1961, the exhibition \"The Art of Assemblage\" was featured at the New York [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The [[exhibition]] showcased the work of early 20th-century European artists such as [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], and [[Kurt Schwitters]] alongside Americans [[Man Ray]], [[Joseph Cornell]], Robert Mallary and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and also included less well known American West Coast assemblage artists such as [[George Herms]], [[Bruce Conner]] and [[Edward Kienholz]].  William C Seitz, the curator of the exhibition, described assemblages as being made up of preformed natural or manufactured materials, objects, or fragments not intended as art materials.<ref>William C.

It is similar to [[collage]], a two-dimensional medium. It is part of the [[visual arts]], and it typically uses found objects, but is not limited to these materials.<ref>Walker, John.

However, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and others had been working with [[found objects]] for many years prior to Dubuffet. Russian artist [[Vladimir Tatlin]] created his \"counter-reliefs\" in the mid 1910s. Alongside Tatlin, the earliest woman artist to try her hand at assemblage was [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]], the Dada Baroness. In Paris in the 1920s [[Alexander Calder]], [[Jose De Creeft]], [[Picasso]] and others began making fully 3-dimensional works from metal scraps, found metal objects and wire. In the U.S., one of the earliest and most prolific assemblage artists was [[Louise Nevelson]], who began creating her sculptures from found pieces of wood in the late 1930s.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s assemblage started to become more widely known and used. Artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns started using scrappy materials and objects to make anti-aesthetic art sculptures, a big part of the ideas that make assemblage what it is.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/assemblage|title=Assemblage \u2013 Art Term|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe painter [[Armando Rever\u00f3n]] is one of the first to use this technique when using disposable materials such as bamboo, wires, or kraft paper. In the thirties he made a skeleton with wings of mucilage, adopting this style years before other artists. Later, Rever\u00f3n made instruments and set pieces such as a telephone, a sofa, a sewing machine, a piano and even music books with their scores.\n\nIn 1961, the exhibition \"The Art of Assemblage\" was featured at the New York [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The [[exhibition]] showcased the work of early 20th-century European artists such as [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], and [[Kurt Schwitters]] alongside Americans [[Man Ray]], [[Joseph Cornell]], Robert Mallary and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and also included less well known American West Coast assemblage artists such as [[George Herms]], [[Bruce Conner]] and [[Edward Kienholz]].  William C Seitz, the curator of the exhibition, described assemblages as being made up of preformed natural or manufactured materials, objects, or fragments not intended as art materials.<ref>William C.

The player races a team of [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters|series characters]] through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] to amass [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]], defeat robots, and collect the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]] needed to defeat [[Doctor Eggman]]. Within each level, the player switches between the team's three characters, who each have unique abilities, to overcome obstacles. ''Sonic Heroes'' abandons the [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] and [[Exploration game|exploration]]-based gameplay of its predecessors ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' (1998) and ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' (2001) and instead returns to the linear style of [[Sega Genesis]]-era ''Sonic'' games.\n\nThe game was the first [[Cross-platform|multi-platform]] ''Sonic'' game, produced for the [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Windows]], and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] platforms. Sonic Team USA's [[Yuji Naka]] and [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]] led the game's 20-month development. The team wanted ''Sonic Heroes'' to appeal beyond ''Sonic'' series fans and so designed a game that did not depend on the continuation of its predecessors. The team revived elements not seen since the Genesis ''Sonic'' games, such as [[Bonus stage|special stages]] and the [[Chaotix]] characters. Sega released ''Sonic Heroes'' in Japan in December 2003 and worldwide in early 2004.\n\nReviewers were polarized. They praised the game's focus on fast gameplay and noted its similarities to the series' original 2D entries, a choice that some considered an improvement from the ''Sonic Adventure'' games. Reviewers also highlighted its graphic design and detailed environments and textures. Critics, however, derided the game for not addressing the problems of previous series games, such as poor camera controls and voice acting. Despite mixed reviews, it was a major commercial success, with 3.41&nbsp;million copies sold by 2007.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple image\n | align             = left\n | direction         = vertical\n | image1            = Sonic_Heroes_Grand_Metropolis.png\n | caption1          = Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles in the Grand Metropolis stage\n |alt1               = Gameplay screenshot from Sonic Heroes.

By acquiring certain items or enemies, characters can [[Skill (role-playing games)|level up]], becoming more efficient when fighting enemies.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy collecting keys hidden within levels and reaching the end of a level without getting hit, players can enter [[Bonus stage|special stages]].<ref name=\"gzonedev\" /> In special stages, players dash across a tube, collecting spheres containing boost power while avoiding obstacles. There are two types of special stages: Bonus Challenge and Emerald Challenge. Bonus Challenges are optional and award the player with extra lives. Emerald Challenges task the player with catching a [[Chaos Emerald]] before it disappears. If players collect all seven Emeralds and clear each story, an additional Last Story is unlocked.

The player races a team of [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters|series characters]] through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] to amass [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]], defeat robots, and collect the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]] needed to defeat [[Doctor Eggman]]. Within each level, the player switches between the team's three characters, who each have unique abilities, to overcome obstacles. ''Sonic Heroes'' abandons the [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] and [[Exploration game|exploration]]-based gameplay of its predecessors ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' (1998) and ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' (2001) and instead returns to the linear style of [[Sega Genesis]]-era ''Sonic'' games.\n\nThe game was the first [[Cross-platform|multi-platform]] ''Sonic'' game, produced for the [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Windows]], and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] platforms. Sonic Team USA's [[Yuji Naka]] and [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]] led the game's 20-month development. The team wanted ''Sonic Heroes'' to appeal beyond ''Sonic'' series fans and so designed a game that did not depend on the continuation of its predecessors. The team revived elements not seen since the Genesis ''Sonic'' games, such as [[Bonus stage|special stages]] and the [[Chaotix]] characters. Sega released ''Sonic Heroes'' in Japan in December 2003 and worldwide in early 2004.\n\nReviewers were polarized. They praised the game's focus on fast gameplay and noted its similarities to the series' original 2D entries, a choice that some considered an improvement from the ''Sonic Adventure'' games. Reviewers also highlighted its graphic design and detailed environments and textures. Critics, however, derided the game for not addressing the problems of previous series games, such as poor camera controls and voice acting. Despite mixed reviews, it was a major commercial success, with 3.41&nbsp;million copies sold by 2007.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple image\n | align             = left\n | direction         = vertical\n | image1            = Sonic_Heroes_Grand_Metropolis.png\n | caption1          = Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles in the Grand Metropolis stage\n |alt1               = Gameplay screenshot from Sonic Heroes.
