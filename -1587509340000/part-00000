On December 19, 1862, it was redesignated as the 9th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment.  On February 5, 1863, an additional Company M was created within the regiment with the transfer of the 22d N.Y. Volunteer Battery.  Company L was organized in Albany between November 4 and December 9, 1863.<ref name=\"Roe1899\">{{cite book|author=Alfred Seelye Roe|title=The Ninth New York heavy artillery: A history of its organization, services in the defenses of Washington, marches, camps, battles, and muster-out \u2026 and a complete roster of the regiment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waXJe-MEzXgC&pg=PA225|accessdate=April 28, 2012|year=1899|publisher=The author}}</ref>\n\nAmongst the regimental commanders, [[William H. Seward Jr.]] stands out as he is the son of then-Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]]. Due to this, [[William H. Seward]] visited the regiment often, and as a consequence, it gained the nickname, \"Seward's Pets.\"<ref>Roe,\"The Ninth New York heavy artillery\", pg. 34</ref>\n\nThe Regiment was divided into three battalions.  After the formation of the regiment, its duties were the protection of the capital. While there, it built and garrisoned Fort Mansfield, Fort Bayard, Fort Gaines, and Fort Foote until spring, 1864. A letter to the editor of the Dem. Press gives the condition of the regiment on March 11, 1864, about two months before the 9th began combat operations. The letter is taken from the New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center.<ref>http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/civil/artillery/9thHeavyArty/9thHeavyArtyCWN.htm</ref>\n\n:The 9th Artillery\u2014their number, services, condition, &c.\n:Hospital Dep't, 9th N. Y. Artillery,\n:Fort Mansfield, Md., March 11, '64.\n:TO THE EDITOR DEM. PRESS:\u2014There has been a great deal said in Lyons and vicinity respecting the number of men in the Ninth Artillery--the number ranging, as stated by different reports, at all points from eighteen hundred up to three thousand. For the information of those who are not posted, I will state that the aggregate number in the Report which was this morning sent to Brigade Headquarters was 1,674; of this number 79 are recruits who have lately arrived, and are not yet assigned to companies. The number of men in each Company is as follows: Co. A, 127; B, 147; C, 99; D, 121; E, 91; F, 132; G, 102; H, 146; I, 148; K, 147; L, 147; M, 137. These numbers, of course, do not include commissioned officers.\n\n:Allow me, also, to disabuse the minds of your readers in regard to another point. This regiment has been styled the \"pet Regiment,\" Life Insurance Regiment, &c. Probably there is not a Regiment in the Defences of Washington that has done more fatigue duty and real hard work than the Ninth. If it has not fought as many battles as some Regiments, the work which it has done has been as valuable to the Government. Besides building Forts Simmons, Mansfield, Bayard, Gaines and Foote, (one of the largest in the Defences,) it helped build Forts Reno and Sumner, two very large Forts, and has dug miles upon miles of rifle pits and built miles upon miles of Military roads and in addition chopped over more land then a good many of the farms in Wayne County put together would compose. Notwithstanding this vast amount of \"drill\" with the pick, shovel and axe, Col. Welling has brought the Regiment to as high a state of discipline as can be desired. If the boys have not worked, who has?\n:Yours,\tW. L. G.\n\n===Combat Operations===\n\n====Overland Campaign====\n\nIn May 1864, [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] took command of the Union Army, embarking on an aggressive campaign, called the [[Overland Campaign]], against the south.  Due to heavy casualties suffered by Union Army, more troops were needed to embark on the campaign. To achieve this, General Grant ordered most of the troops defending the capital, including the 9th New York Heavy Artillery, to the front to increase troop numbers.<ref>Hattaway and Jones, pp. 527\u201328; Salmon, p. 252; Eicher, pp. 660\u201361.</ref> They would now be Heavy Artillery in name only, donning their rifles and assuming the duties of infantrymen. Two battalions, 1st and 2nd, of the 9th joined the VI Corps and the [[Army of the Potomac]] as infantry, while one, the 3rd battalion (Cos. C, I, L, and F), joined the Artillery Brigade. They numbered 1,944 men on May 26, 1864, as reported by Maj. Charles Burgess, before commencement of combat operations.<ref>The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Volume XXXVI, pg. 740</ref>\n\n=====Battle of Cold Harbor=====\n\nThe 9th New York Heavy Artillery joined the [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] on the banks of North Anna River on May 26, 1864, and then marched to the Pamunkey during the nights of May 27 and 28. From there, it departed for Cold Harbor on May 29, guarding the wagon train along the way, where it saw its first offensive action on June 1, 1864, at the Battle of Cold Harbor, where the brigade they were part of charged at 6 pm and captured several hundred prisoners, and also managed to hold against several counterattacks on June 2.<ref>The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Volume XXXVI, pg. 734</ref> It also participated in the major attack on June 3, being placed second and third in the line of battle in Keifer's Brigade (110th Ohio and 122nd Ohio Infantry in the first line of battle, and 6th Maryland, 126th Ohio, and 138th Pennsylvania Infantry in the fourth line)  in the 3rd Division, where they were ordered at 6 am to proceeded to advance 200 yards, where upon they entrenched under heavy fire.<ref>The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Volume XXXVI, pg. 734-35, 740</ref> Over the course of the Battle of Cold Harbor the 9th numbered 43 killed and mortally wounded, 99 wounded, and 6 missing, for a total of 148.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n'''Defense of [[Washington D.C.]]  (September 1862 \u2013 May 1864)'''\n\n:*September 1862-August 1863: The Regiment stationed near Washington DC<ref name=\"cwdw\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/cwdw/index.htm | title=Civil War Defenses of Washington | publisher=National Park Service | work=www.nps.gov | date=June 23, 2014 | accessdate=June 25, 2014}}</ref>  ( [[Fort Kearny (Washington D.C.)|Fort Kearney]], Fort Mansfield, and [[Fort Reno Park|Fort Reno]]).\n\n:*August 1863 \u2013 May 1864: Construction of [[Fort Foote]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/fofo/index.htm | title=National Park Service:  Fort Foote | publisher=National Park Service | work=www.nps.gov | date=June 20, 2014 | accessdate=June 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/fofo/historyculture/index.htm | title=National Park Service:  Fort Foote \u2013 History & Culture | publisher=National Park Service | work=www.nps.gov | date=June 20, 2014 | accessdate=June 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''May 18, 1864: Joines the [[Army of the Potomac]], begins to march torwards it'''\n\n'''[[Overland Campaign]]  (May through June 1864)'''\n\n:*May 26: [[Battle of North Anna]], 9th NYHA meets up with the main body.<ref>Report of Maj.

On December 19, 1862, it was redesignated as the 9th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment.  On February 5, 1863, an additional Company M was created within the regiment with the transfer of the 22d N.Y.

Seward Jr.]] stands out as he is the son of then-Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]]. Due to this, [[William H. Seward]] visited the regiment often, and as a consequence, it gained the nickname, \"Seward's Pets.\"<ref>Roe,\"The Ninth New York heavy artillery\", pg. 34</ref>\n\nThe Regiment was divided into three battalions.  After the formation of the regiment, its duties were the protection of the capital. While there, it built and garrisoned Fort Mansfield, Fort Bayard, Fort Gaines, and Fort Foote until spring, 1864. A letter to the editor of the Dem. Press gives the condition of the regiment on March 11, 1864, about two months before the 9th began combat operations. The letter is taken from the New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center.<ref>http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/civil/artillery/9thHeavyArty/9thHeavyArtyCWN.htm</ref>\n\n:The 9th Artillery\u2014their number, services, condition, &c.\n:Hospital Dep't, 9th N. Y. Artillery,\n:Fort Mansfield, Md., March 11, '64.\n:TO THE EDITOR DEM. PRESS:\u2014There has been a great deal said in Lyons and vicinity respecting the number of men in the Ninth Artillery--the number ranging, as stated by different reports, at all points from eighteen hundred up to three thousand. For the information of those who are not posted, I will state that the aggregate number in the Report which was this morning sent to Brigade Headquarters was 1,674; of this number 79 are recruits who have lately arrived, and are not yet assigned to companies. The number of men in each Company is as follows: Co. A, 127; B, 147; C, 99; D, 121; E, 91; F, 132; G, 102; H, 146; I, 148; K, 147; L, 147; M, 137. These numbers, of course, do not include commissioned officers.\n\n:Allow me, also, to disabuse the minds of your readers in regard to another point. This regiment has been styled the \"pet Regiment,\" Life Insurance Regiment, &c. Probably there is not a Regiment in the Defences of Washington that has done more fatigue duty and real hard work than the Ninth. If it has not fought as many battles as some Regiments, the work which it has done has been as valuable to the Government. Besides building Forts Simmons, Mansfield, Bayard, Gaines and Foote, (one of the largest in the Defences,) it helped build Forts Reno and Sumner, two very large Forts, and has dug miles upon miles of rifle pits and built miles upon miles of Military roads and in addition chopped over more land then a good many of the farms in Wayne County put together would compose. Notwithstanding this vast amount of \"drill\" with the pick, shovel and axe, Col. Welling has brought the Regiment to as high a state of discipline as can be desired. If the boys have not worked, who has?\n:Yours,\tW. L. G.\n\n===Combat Operations===\n\n====Overland Campaign====\n\nIn May 1864, [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] took command of the Union Army, embarking on an aggressive campaign, called the [[Overland Campaign]], against the south.  Due to heavy casualties suffered by Union Army, more troops were needed to embark on the campaign. To achieve this, General Grant ordered most of the troops defending the capital, including the 9th New York Heavy Artillery, to the front to increase troop numbers.<ref>Hattaway and Jones, pp. 527\u201328; Salmon, p. 252; Eicher, pp. 660\u201361.</ref> They would now be Heavy Artillery in name only, donning their rifles and assuming the duties of infantrymen. Two battalions, 1st and 2nd, of the 9th joined the VI Corps and the [[Army of the Potomac]] as infantry, while one, the 3rd battalion (Cos. C, I, L, and F), joined the Artillery Brigade. They numbered 1,944 men on May 26, 1864, as reported by Maj. Charles Burgess, before commencement of combat operations.<ref>The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Volume XXXVI, pg. 740</ref>\n\n=====Battle of Cold Harbor=====\n\nThe 9th New York Heavy Artillery joined the [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]] on the banks of North Anna River on May 26, 1864, and then marched to the Pamunkey during the nights of May 27 and 28. From there, it departed for Cold Harbor on May 29, guarding the wagon train along the way, where it saw its first offensive action on June 1, 1864, at the Battle of Cold Harbor, where the brigade they were part of charged at 6 pm and captured several hundred prisoners, and also managed to hold against several counterattacks on June 2.<ref>The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Volume XXXVI, pg. 734</ref> It also participated in the major attack on June 3, being placed second and third in the line of battle in Keifer's Brigade (110th Ohio and 122nd Ohio Infantry in the first line of battle, and 6th Maryland, 126th Ohio, and 138th Pennsylvania Infantry in the fourth line)  in the 3rd Division, where they were ordered at 6 am to proceeded to advance 200 yards, where upon they entrenched under heavy fire.<ref>The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Volume XXXVI, pg. 734-35, 740</ref> Over the course of the Battle of Cold Harbor the 9th numbered 43 killed and mortally wounded, 99 wounded, and 6 missing, for a total of 148.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n'''Defense of [[Washington D.C.]]  (September 1862 \u2013 May 1864)'''\n\n:*September 1862-August 1863: The Regiment stationed near Washington DC<ref name=\"cwdw\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/cwdw/index.htm | title=Civil War Defenses of Washington | publisher=National Park Service | work=www.nps.gov | date=June 23, 2014 | accessdate=June 25, 2014}}</ref>  ( [[Fort Kearny (Washington D.C.)|Fort Kearney]], Fort Mansfield, and [[Fort Reno Park|Fort Reno]]).\n\n:*August 1863 \u2013 May 1864: Construction of [[Fort Foote]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/fofo/index.htm | title=National Park Service:  Fort Foote | publisher=National Park Service | work=www.nps.gov | date=June 20, 2014 | accessdate=June 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/fofo/historyculture/index.htm | title=National Park Service:  Fort Foote \u2013 History & Culture | publisher=National Park Service | work=www.nps.gov | date=June 20, 2014 | accessdate=June 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''May 18, 1864: Joines the [[Army of the Potomac]], begins to march torwards it'''\n\n'''[[Overland Campaign]]  (May through June 1864)'''\n\n:*May 26: [[Battle of North Anna]], 9th NYHA meets up with the main body.<ref>Report of Maj.

The House Guest who was named in the most overall answers was deemed the \"top trending\" House Guest of the week and earned a \"Power App\", which would give them an advantage in the game, while the House Guest who was answered the least was deemed \"least trending\" was given a \"Crap App\", which gave them a punishment. Once HouseGuests received an app, they were no longer eligible to receive one in the future.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"2%\" |Week\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"5%\" |Top trending\n! colspan=\"3\" width=5%   |Power App\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"5%\" |Least trending\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"5%\" |Crap App\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"25%\" |Punishment\n|-\n! width=\"5%\"  |Name\n! width=\"25%\" |Ability\n! width=\"5%\"  |Status\n|-\n! 1\n| style=\"background:#90EE90;\" |Sam\n| Bonus Life\n| To be used immediately after a HouseGuest is evicted from the house, this power will give that House Guest a chance to return to the game via a competition.

It lets one HouseGuest hack the game for a week. After the nominations, all of the HouseGuests compete in a competition at the same time in different rooms, making the winner anonymous to the other HouseGuests. The winner of the competition is able to \"hack\" the game in three different ways:\n* First, they can replace one of the Head of Household's nominations and change it to someone of their choosing. \n* Second, they get to select one of the three participants chosen for the Power of Veto competition. \n* Finally, they can nullify one vote at the live eviction. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:50%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:4%\"| Week\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:6%\"| H@cker\n! colspan=2 style=\"width:6%\"| Nominations\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:6%\"| Veto Player\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:6%\"| Nullified Eviction Vote\n|-\n! style=\"width:6%\"| Saved\n! style=\"width:6%\"| Nominated\n|-\n! 6\n| style=\"background:#90EE90;\"| Haleigh\n| Scottie\n| Tyler\n| Kaycee\n| Tyler\n|-\n! 7\n| style=\"background:#90EE90;\"| Kaycee\n| Kaycee\n| Rockstar\n| Tyler\n| Faysal\n|}\n\n====Jury Battleback====\nThe first four Jury members had the opportunity to battle each other for a chance to return to the game.

Once HouseGuests received an app, they were no longer eligible to receive one in the future.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"2%\" |Week\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"5%\" |Top trending\n! colspan=\"3\" width=5%   |Power App\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"5%\" |Least trending\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"5%\" |Crap App\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"25%\" |Punishment\n|-\n! width=\"5%\"  |Name\n! width=\"25%\" |Ability\n! width=\"5%\"  |Status\n|-\n! 1\n| style=\"background:#90EE90;\" |Sam\n| Bonus Life\n| To be used immediately after a HouseGuest is evicted from the house, this power will give that House Guest a chance to return to the game via a competition.

It lets one HouseGuest hack the game for a week. After the nominations, all of the HouseGuests compete in a competition at the same time in different rooms, making the winner anonymous to the other HouseGuests.
