Produced by [[DC Films]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it was developed as <!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.-->the tenth film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) and<!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.--> a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021.\n\nBatman doesn\u2019t kill.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante. Batman is around 30 years old in the film and neither an experienced superhero nor a beginning crime fighter.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Pattinson had avoided major franchises since his ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films, wanting to avoid paparazzi and finding those roles dull, but signed on to play Batman because he found the character's lack of superpowers interesting.<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> He described his Batman as flawed, unlike traditional comic book characters,<ref name=\"PattinsonIGN\" /> and said his voice was inspired by his ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|Lighthouse]]'' costar [[Willem Dafoe]]'s voice in that film.<ref name=\"PattinsonDafoe\" /> In preparation, Pattinson trained in [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] with instructor and ''[[John Wick]]'' alumnus [[Rigan Machado]].<ref name=\"PattinsonJiuJitsu\" /> [[Christian Bale]], who played Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), supported Pattinson,<ref name=\"BaleSupport\" /> encouraging him to \"make [the role] his own\" and ignore critics.<ref name=\"BaleAdvice\" /> Pattinson also received advice from ''The Dark Knight Trilogy''{{'s}} director, [[Christopher Nolan]], whom he worked with on ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]''.<ref name=\"NolanAdvice\" /> [[Ben Affleck]] portrayed the character in previous [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) films<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian\" /> and was set to reprise his role before stepping down in January 2019.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]:<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><br />Kravitz, who previously voiced the character in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> was chosen over a number of actresses, including [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Ella Balinska]], [[Ana de Armas]], and [[Alicia Vikander]].<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" /> Kravitz said that in contrast to Batman, who represents masculinity, Catwoman represents femininity, and \"femininity represents power, and I think it's a different kind of power than masculine power... slightly more complicated, and softer, too.\" Kravitz drew inspiration from [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who portrayed the character in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" />\n* [[Paul Dano]] as [[Riddler|Edward Nashton / Riddler]]<ref name=\"DanoCast\" />\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]]:<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> The [[Gotham City Police Department]] commissioner and an ally of Batman.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /> Wright is the first actor of color to portray the character,<ref name=\"WrightGordon\" /> who was previously portrayed by [[J.

According to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]''. The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through again.\"<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:Robert Pattinson Premiere of The Lost City of Z at Zoo Palast Berlinale 2017 02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Pattinson]] (pictured in 2017) was cast to replace Affleck in May 2019]]\nBy May 2019, [[Robert Pattinson]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Armie Hammer]], and [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] were on the shortlist to replace Affleck as Batman, Pattinson being the frontrunner.<ref name=\"PattinsonFrontrunner\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonEyed\" /><ref name=\"BatmanShortlist\" /> Reeves began to consider Pattinson early in development, but was unsure if he would want to take the part and did not contact him.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Pattinson's avoidance of \"big studio franchise films\" meant he had not appeared in any of rival [[Marvel Studios]]' projects, something that made him desirable to Warner Bros. Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> In July, [[Greig Fraser]] joined the film as cinematographer.<ref name=\"FraserDP\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> On March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, \"till it is safe for us all to resume.\"<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/>\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on June 25, 2021,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> although ''Variety'' reported there is a strong possibility it will be delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/>\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of ''Variety'' reported that key cast members are signed on to reprise their roles in future DC films.<ref name=\"DCFilmsFutureNov2019\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- CAST -->\n\n<ref

Produced by [[DC Films]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it was developed as <!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.-->the tenth film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) and<!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.--> a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante. Batman is around 30 years old in the film and neither an experienced superhero nor a beginning crime fighter.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Pattinson had avoided major franchises since his ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films, wanting to avoid paparazzi and finding those roles dull, but signed on to play Batman because he found the character's lack of superpowers interesting.<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> He described his Batman as flawed, unlike traditional comic book characters,<ref name=\"PattinsonIGN\" /> and said his voice was inspired by his ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|Lighthouse]]'' costar [[Willem Dafoe]]'s voice in that film.<ref name=\"PattinsonDafoe\" /> In preparation, Pattinson trained in [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] with instructor and ''[[John Wick]]'' alumnus [[Rigan Machado]].<ref name=\"PattinsonJiuJitsu\" /> [[Christian Bale]], who played Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), supported Pattinson,<ref name=\"BaleSupport\" /> encouraging him to \"make [the role] his own\" and ignore critics.<ref name=\"BaleAdvice\" /> Pattinson also received advice from ''The Dark Knight Trilogy''{{'s}} director, [[Christopher Nolan]], whom he worked with on ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]''.<ref name=\"NolanAdvice\" /> [[Ben Affleck]] portrayed the character in previous [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) films<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian\" /> and was set to reprise his role before stepping down in January 2019.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]:<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><br />Kravitz, who previously voiced the character in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> was chosen over a number of actresses, including [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Ella Balinska]], [[Ana de Armas]], and [[Alicia Vikander]].<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" /> Kravitz said that in contrast to Batman, who represents masculinity, Catwoman represents femininity, and \"femininity represents power, and I think it's a different kind of power than masculine power... slightly more complicated, and softer, too.\" Kravitz drew inspiration from [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who portrayed the character in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" />\n* [[Paul Dano]] as [[Riddler|Edward Nashton / Riddler]]<ref name=\"DanoCast\" />\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]]:<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> The [[Gotham City Police Department]] commissioner and an ally of Batman.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /> Wright is the first actor of color to portray the character,<ref name=\"WrightGordon\" /> who was previously portrayed by [[J.

According to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]''. The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through again.\"<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:Robert Pattinson Premiere of The Lost City of Z at Zoo Palast Berlinale 2017 02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Pattinson]] (pictured in 2017) was cast to replace Affleck in May 2019]]\nBy May 2019, [[Robert Pattinson]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Armie Hammer]], and [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] were on the shortlist to replace Affleck as Batman, Pattinson being the frontrunner.<ref name=\"PattinsonFrontrunner\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonEyed\" /><ref name=\"BatmanShortlist\" /> Reeves began to consider Pattinson early in development, but was unsure if he would want to take the part and did not contact him.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Pattinson's avoidance of \"big studio franchise films\" meant he had not appeared in any of rival [[Marvel Studios]]' projects, something that made him desirable to Warner Bros. Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> In July, [[Greig Fraser]] joined the film as cinematographer.<ref name=\"FraserDP\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> On March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, \"till it is safe for us all to resume.\"<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/>\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on June 25, 2021,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> although ''Variety'' reported there is a strong possibility it will be delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/>\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of ''Variety'' reported that key cast members are signed on to reprise their roles in future DC films.<ref name=\"DCFilmsFutureNov2019\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- CAST -->\n\n<ref

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/feature-2005-03.html |title=Phelan, Joseph; The Salvador Dal\u00ed Show |publisher=Artcyclopedia.com |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=Dali>Dal\u00ed, Salvador.

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which ''The Persistence of Memory'' attracted the most attention.

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her. The \"tense, complex and ambiguous relationship\" lasting over 50 years would later become the subject of an opera, ''Jo, Dal\u00ed'' (''I, Dal\u00ed'') by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] composer Xavier Benguerel.<ref name=\"Opera\">{{cite web|last=Amengual|first=Margalida|title=An opera on the relationship between Salvador Dal\u00ed and Gala arrives at Barcelona's Liceu|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/culture/item/an-opera-on-the-relationship-between-salvador-dali-and-gala-arrives-at-barcelonas-liceu|work=Catalan News Agency (CNA)|publisher=Intracatal\u00f2nia, SA|accessdate=27 May 2012|date=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed's first visit to the United States in November 1934 attracted widespread press coverage.

Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which ''The Persistence of Memory'' attracted the most attention.

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her. The \"tense, complex and ambiguous relationship\" lasting over 50 years would later become the subject of an opera, ''Jo, Dal\u00ed'' (''I, Dal\u00ed'') by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] composer Xavier Benguerel.<ref name=\"Opera\">{{cite web|last=Amengual|first=Margalida|title=An opera on the relationship between Salvador Dal\u00ed and Gala arrives at Barcelona's Liceu|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/culture/item/an-opera-on-the-relationship-between-salvador-dali-and-gala-arrives-at-barcelonas-liceu|work=Catalan News Agency (CNA)|publisher=Intracatal\u00f2nia, SA|accessdate=27 May 2012|date=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed's first visit to the United States in November 1934 attracted widespread press coverage.

Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century. [[Roslagen]] is located along the coast of the northern tip of the pink area marked ''\"Swedes and Goths\"''.]]\n\nThe etymology and semantic history of the word ''Rus{{'}}'' has been a highly contentious topic, on which debate is ongoing. This is partly because of a widespread assumption that by identifying the linguistic origin of the name ''Rus{{'}}'', scholars can identify the origins of the people whom it described. This assumption has, however, been criticized in twenty-first-century scholarship.<ref>James E.

There was no law among them, but tribe rose against tribe. Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against the other. They said to themselves, \"Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law\". They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Russes: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], and others [[Normans]], [[Angles|English]], and [[Gutes|Gotlanders]], for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated. The oldest, Rurik, located himself in Novgorod; the second, [[Sineus and Truvor|Sineus]], at [[Beloozero]]; and the third, [[Sineus and Truvor|Truvor]], in [[Izborsk]].

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing centre of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another centre of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions moulded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West. The culture of the Rus contained Norse elements used as a manifestation of their Scandinavian background. These elements, which were current in tenth century Scandinavia, appear at various places in form of collections of many types of metal ornaments, mainly female but even male, such as weapons, decorated parts of horse bridle, and diverse objects embellished in current Norse art styles.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Debate on the origins of the Rus' ==\nThe historiography of the origins of the Rus' is infamously contentious, due to its perceived importance for the legitimation of nation-building, imperialism, and independence movements within the Slavonic-speaking world, and for legitimating different political relationships between eastern and western European countries.

The Rus' appeared to emulate aspects of [[Khazar]] political organization\u2014hence the mention of a Rus' ''[[Khagan|chaganus]]'' in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] court in 839 (''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'').

Devoid of any silver dirham finds in the 8th century AD, it was situated west of the profitable fur and silver trade networks that spanned from the Baltic to the Muslim lands, via the [[Volga region|Volga]]-[[Kama River|Kama]] basins. At the prime hill in Kiev, fortifications and other symbols of consolidation and power appear from the 9th century, thus preceding the literary appearance of 'Rus' in the middle Dnieper region. By the 10th century, the lowlands around Kiev had extensive 'Slavic' styled settlements, and there is evidence of growing trade with the Byzantine lands. This might have attracted Rus' movements, and a shift in power, from the north to Kiev.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|pp=90\u2013122}}</ref> Thus, Kiev does not appear to have evolved from the infrastructure of the Scandinavian trade networks, but rather it forcibly took them over, as evidenced by the destruction of numerous earlier trade settlements in the north, including the famous [[Staraya Ladoga|Staraja Ladoga]].<ref>Tolochko p. 186</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''The Annals of Saint-Bertin'', transl.

Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century.

This is partly because of a widespread assumption that by identifying the linguistic origin of the name ''Rus{{'}}'', scholars can identify the origins of the people whom it described. This assumption has, however, been criticized in twenty-first-century scholarship.<ref>James E.

There was no law among them, but tribe rose against tribe. Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against the other. They said to themselves, \"Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law\". They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Russes: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], and others [[Normans]], [[Angles|English]], and [[Gutes|Gotlanders]], for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated.

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing centre of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another centre of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions moulded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West. The culture of the Rus contained Norse elements used as a manifestation of their Scandinavian background. These elements, which were current in tenth century Scandinavia, appear at various places in form of collections of many types of metal ornaments, mainly female but even male, such as weapons, decorated parts of horse bridle, and diverse objects embellished in current Norse art styles.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Debate on the origins of the Rus' ==\nThe historiography of the origins of the Rus' is infamously contentious, due to its perceived importance for the legitimation of nation-building, imperialism, and independence movements within the Slavonic-speaking world, and for legitimating different political relationships between eastern and western European countries.

At the beginning of an important speech in 1749, later published as ''Origines gentis et nominis Russorum'' ('The Origins of the People and the Name of the Russians'), M\u00fcller argued that Russia owed its name and early ruling dynasty to ethnically Scandinavian Varangians.<ref name=\"auto11\">Serhii Plokhy, ''Ukraine and Russia: Representations of the Past'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008), chapter 1.</ref><ref>Elena Melnikova, 'The \"Varangian Problem\": Science in the Grip of Ideology and Politics', in ''Russia's Identity in International Relations: Images, Perceptions, Misperceptions'', ed. by Ray Taras (Abingdon: Routledge, 2013), pp. 42-52 (p. 43).</ref> This statement caused anger in his Russian audience, and earned him much animosity during his professional career in Russia.<ref name=\"auto11\"/><ref name=\"auto10\"/> Scathing criticism from [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]], [[Stepan Krasheninnikov|Krasheninnikov]], and other Russian historians led to M\u00fcller being forced to suspend his work on the issue until Lomonosov's death.

While the product was initially made available at the same cost, the results were so convincing that Turkish farmers significantly increased the use of the zinc-fortified fertilizer (1 percent of zinc) within a few years, despite the repricing of the products to reflect the added value of the content. Nearly ten years after the identification of the zinc deficiency problem, the total amount of zinc-containing compound fertilizers produced and applied in Turkey reached a record level of 300,000 tonnes per annum. It is estimated that the economic benefits associated with the application of zinc fertilizers on zinc deficient soils in Turkey is around US$100 million per year. Zinc deficiency in children has been dramatically reduced.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite book|first1=Wolfgang|last1=Maret|editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci | name-list-format = vanc |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12|pages=479\u2013501|chapter= Chapter 14 Zinc and the Zinc Proteome|title=Metallomics and the Cell |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_14|pmid=23595681|issn=1559-0836}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 14272 \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|E|60||e|50}} \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|269.3}} \n|  ICDO           = \n|  OMIM           = \n|  MedlinePlus    = \n|  eMedicineSubj  = \n|  eMedicineTopic = \n|  MeshID         =\n}}\n* {{DermAtlas|228}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081230033239/http://www.zinc-crops.org/ International Zinc Association (IZA)]\n*[http://www.harvestzinc.org/ HarvestZinc: HarvestPlus Zinc Fertilizer Project]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100305184101/http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/Home-Page/LIBRARY/Conference-proceedings/Agriculture-Conferences/2007-Zinc-Crops Proceedings from the Zinc Crops Conference on Improving Crop Production and Human Health, Istanbul, Turkey, 24\u201326 May 2007]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080915031424/http://www.cimmyt.org/english/docs/ann_report/2004/fieldMarket/zinc_problem.htm CIMMYT Solving the Zinc Problem from Field to Food ]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081219113637/http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/Home-Page/LIBRARY/Publications.html/Zinc-in-Soils-and-Crop-Nutrition.html Zinc in Soils and Crop Nutrition, International Zinc Association]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090616193252/http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/Home-Page/SUSTAINABILITY/Nutrition-Human-Health Fertilizers, Nutrition and Human Health]\n\n{{Diseases of the skin and appendages by morphology}}\n{{Nutritional pathology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zinc Deficiency}}\n[[Category:Zinc]]\n[[Category:Mineral deficiencies]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Zinc deficiency\n| synonyms        = \n| image           = Zn-TableImage.svg\n| caption         = Zinc\n| pronounce       = \n| field           = \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = Zinc supplementation\n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n<!-- Definition and symptoms -->\n'''Zinc deficiency'''  is defined either as insufficient [[zinc]] to meet the needs of the body, or as a serum [[zinc]] level below the normal range.

[https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11104-007-9466-3 Cakmak Ismail, in Plant and Soil, 2007]</ref> Zinc was added to fertilizers. While the product was initially made available at the same cost, the results were so convincing that Turkish farmers significantly increased the use of the zinc-fortified fertilizer (1 percent of zinc) within a few years, despite the repricing of the products to reflect the added value of the content. Nearly ten years after the identification of the zinc deficiency problem, the total amount of zinc-containing compound fertilizers produced and applied in Turkey reached a record level of 300,000 tonnes per annum. It is estimated that the economic benefits associated with the application of zinc fertilizers on zinc deficient soils in Turkey is around US$100 million per year. Zinc deficiency in children has been dramatically reduced.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite book|first1=Wolfgang|last1=Maret|editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci | name-list-format = vanc |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12|pages=479\u2013501|chapter= Chapter 14 Zinc and the Zinc Proteome|title=Metallomics and the Cell |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_14|pmid=23595681|issn=1559-0836}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 14272 \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|E|60||e|50}} \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|269.3}} \n|  ICDO           = \n|  OMIM           = \n|  MedlinePlus    = \n|  eMedicineSubj  = \n|  eMedicineTopic = \n|  MeshID         =\n}}\n* {{DermAtlas|228}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081230033239/http://www.zinc-crops.org/ International Zinc Association (IZA)]\n*[http://www.harvestzinc.org/ HarvestZinc: HarvestPlus Zinc Fertilizer Project]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100305184101/http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/Home-Page/LIBRARY/Conference-proceedings/Agriculture-Conferences/2007-Zinc-Crops Proceedings from the Zinc Crops Conference on Improving Crop Production and Human Health, Istanbul, Turkey, 24\u201326 May 2007]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080915031424/http://www.cimmyt.org/english/docs/ann_report/2004/fieldMarket/zinc_problem.htm CIMMYT Solving the Zinc Problem from Field to Food ]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081219113637/http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/Home-Page/LIBRARY/Publications.html/Zinc-in-Soils-and-Crop-Nutrition.html Zinc in Soils and Crop Nutrition, International Zinc Association]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090616193252/http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/Home-Page/SUSTAINABILITY/Nutrition-Human-Health Fertilizers, Nutrition and Human Health]\n\n{{Diseases of the skin and appendages by morphology}}\n{{Nutritional pathology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zinc Deficiency}}\n[[Category:Zinc]]\n[[Category:Mineral deficiencies]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_deficiency"}

After [[World War I]], as early aviation became an increasingly important part of modern warfare, a philosophical rift developed between more traditional ground-based army personnel and those who felt that aircraft were being underutilized and that air operations were being stifled for political reasons unrelated to their effectiveness. The USAAC was renamed from the earlier [[United States Army Air Service]] on 2 July 1926, and was part of the larger [[United States Army]]. The Air Corps became the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on 20 June 1941, giving it greater autonomy from the Army's middle-level command structure. During [[World War II]], although not an administrative echelon, the Air Corps (AC) remained as one of the [[combat arms]] of the Army until 1947, when it was legally abolished by legislation establishing the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]].<ref name=\"natarc\"/>\n\nThe Air Corps was renamed by the [[United States Congress]] largely as a compromise between the advocates of a separate air arm and those of the traditionalist Army high command who viewed the aviation arm as an auxiliary branch to support the ground forces. Although its members worked to promote the concept of air power and an autonomous air force in [[interwar period|the years]] between the [[world war]]s, its primary purpose by Army policy remained support of ground forces rather than independent operations.\n\nOn 1 March 1935, still struggling with the issue of a separate air arm, the Army activated the '''General Headquarters Air Force''' for centralized control of aviation combat units within the continental United States, separate from but coordinate with the Air Corps. The separation of the Air Corps from control of its combat units caused [[United States Army Air Corps#Problems with unity of command|problems of unity of command]] that became more acute as the Air Corps enlarged in preparation for World War II. This was resolved by the creation of the Army Air Forces (AAF), making both organizations subordinate to the new higher echelon.\n\nOn [[1941 in aviation#June|20 June 1941]], the Army Air Corps' existence as the primary air arm of the U.S. Army changed to that of solely being the training and logistics elements of the then-new [[United States Army Air Forces]], which embraced the formerly-named General Headquarters Air Force under the new Air Force Combat Command organization for front-line combat operations; this new element, along with the Air Corps, comprised the USAAF.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II|origyear= 1961|url= http://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/21/2001330256/-1/-1/0/AFD-100921-044.pdf |edition=reprint|year=1983|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-02-1|lccn=61060979|page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe Air Corps ceased to have an administrative structure after 9 March 1942, but as \"the permanent statutory organization of the air arm, and the principal component of the Army Air Forces,\" the overwhelming majority of personnel assigned to the AAF were members of the Air Corps.<ref name=\"goss2\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 31.</ref>\n\n==Creation of the Air Corps==\n{{quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=#B0C4DE |align=left |halign=right|quote=<div style=\"text-align:left;\">'''Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress Assembled''', that the Act entitled \"An act for making further and more effectual provision for the national defense, and other purposes,\" approved June 3, 1916, as amended, be, and the same is hereby, amended so that the Air Service referred to in that Act and all subsequent Acts of Congress shall be known as the Air Corps.</div> |source='''Public Law 69-446, 2 July 1926'''<ref name=\"mooney\">Mooney and Layman (1944), p. 117.</ref>}}\n\nThe [[United States Army Air Service|U.S. Army Air Service]] had a brief but turbulent history. Created during [[World War I]] by [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] after America entered the war in April 1917 as the increasing use of airplanes and the military uses of aviation were readily apparent as the war continued to its climax, the [[United States Army Air Service|U.S. Army Air Service]] gained permanent legislative authority in 1920 as a combatant arm of the line of the [[United States Army]]. There followed a six-year struggle between adherents of airpower and the supporters of the traditional military services about the value of an independent Air Force, intensified by struggles for funds caused by skimpy budgets, as much an impetus for independence as any other factor.<ref>Tate (1998), pp. 185\u2013188.</ref>\n\nThe Lassiter Board, a group of [[General Staff]] officers, recommended in 1923 that the [[U.S. Army Air Service|Air Service]] be augmented by an offensive force of bombardment and pursuit units under the command of Army general headquarters in time of war, and many of its recommendations became Army regulations. The War Department desired to implement the Lassiter Board's recommendations, but the administration of [[U.S. president|President]] [[Calvin Coolidge]] chose instead to economize by radically cutting military budgets, particularly the Army's.<ref>Tate (1998), p. 30</ref><ref group=n>The Coolidge administration boasted of cutting the War Department's budget by 75%.</ref> The Lampert Committee of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in December 1925 proposed a unified air force independent of the Army and Navy, plus a department of defense to coordinate the three armed services.<ref>Maurer (1987), pp. 72\u201373.</ref> However another board, headed by [[Dwight Morrow]], was appointed in September 1925 by Coolidge ostensibly to study the \"best means of developing and applying aircraft in national defense\" but in reality to minimize the political impact of the pending court-martial of [[Billy Mitchell (general)|Billy Mitchell]] (and to preempt the findings of the Lampert Committee). It declared that no threat of air attack was likely to exist to the United States, rejected the idea of a department of defense and a separate department of air, and recommended minor reforms that included renaming the air service to allow it \"more prestige.\"<ref>Maurer (1987), pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nIn early 1926 the Military Affairs Committee of the Congress rejected all bills set forth before it on both sides of the issue. They fashioned a compromise in which the findings of the Morrow Board were enacted as law, while providing the air arm a \"five-year plan\" for expansion and development. Maj. Gen. [[Mason Patrick]], the Chief of Air Service, had proposed that it be made a semi-independent service within the War Department along the lines of the Marine Corps within the Navy Department, but this was rejected; only the cosmetic name change was accepted.<ref>Tate (1998), pp. 45\u201347</ref><ref group=n>Gen. Patrick's proposal of an Air Corps equivalent to the Marine Corps was characterized by Brig. Gen. [[Fox Conner]] (and not for the first nor last time by General Staff opponents of Air Corps independence) as a \"promotion scheme\".</ref> The legislation changed the name of the Air Service to the Air Corps, (in the words of one analyst) \"thereby strengthening the conception of military aviation as an offensive, striking arm rather than an auxiliary service.\"<ref>Greer (1985), p. 29.\"</ref>\n[[File:USAAC,1930.jpg|thumb|Formations of [[Keystone LB-6|Keystone LB-7s]] (lower) and [[Boeing P-12]]s (upper) on aerial maneuvers over Burbank, California, 1930]]\n\nThe Air Corps Act (44 ''Stat.'' 780) became law on 2 July 1926. In accordance with the Morrow Board's recommendations, the act created an additional [[United States Assistant Secretary of War|Assistant Secretary of War]] to \"help foster military aeronautics\", and established an air section in each division of the General Staff for a period of three years. Two additional brigadier generals would serve as assistant chiefs of the Air Corps.<ref name=\"ccI1\"/><ref group=n>All Air Corps generals held temporary ranks. The Air Corps did not have a member promoted to permanent establishment general officer until 1937, and he was promptly removed from the Air Corps.</ref> Previous provisions of the National Defense Act of 1920 that all flying units be commanded only by [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|rated personnel]] and that flight pay be awarded were continued. The Air Corps also retained the \"[[Prop and Wings]]\" as its branch insignia through its disestablishment in 1947. Patrick became Chief of the Air Corps and Brig. Gen. [[James E. Fechet]] continued as his first assistant chief. On 17 July 1926, two lieutenant colonels were promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] for four-year terms as assistant chiefs of Air Corps: [[Frank P. Lahm]], to command the new [[Air Training Command|Air Corps Training Center]], and William E. Gillmore, in command of the [[Air Force Logistics Command|Materiel Division]].<ref>Maurer (1987), p. 74</ref><ref group=n>Gillmore had been chief of the Supply Division of the Air Service. Both he and Lahm served a single tour. Of the three assistant chiefs, Fechet succeeded Patrick in December 1927, Gillmore retired on 30 June 1930, and Lahm reverted to his permanent rank on 16 July 1930.</ref>\n\nOf the new law and organization, however, Wesley F. Craven and James L. Cate in the official history of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] concluded that: \n<blockquote>\"The bill which was finally enacted purported to be a compromise, but it leaned heavily on the Morrow recommendations. The Air Corps Act of 2 July 1926 effected no fundamental innovation. The change in designation meant no change in status: the Air Corps was still a [[combat arm|combatant branch of the Army]] with less prestige than the Infantry.\"<ref name=\"ccI1\">Craven and Cate Vol. 1, p. 29.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe position of the air arm within the Department of War remained essentially the same as before, that is, the flying units were under the operational control of the various ground forces [[corps area]] commands and not the Air Corps, which remained responsible for procurement and maintenance of aircraft, supply, and training. Because of a lack of legally specified duties and responsibilities, the new position of [[United States Assistant Secretary of War#Assistant Secretary of War for Air|Assistant Secretary of War for Air]], held by [[F. Trubee Davison]] from July 1926 to March 1933, proved of little help in promoting autonomy for the air arm.<ref>Tate (1998), p. 60.</ref>\n\n===Five-year expansion program===\nThe Air Corps Act gave authorization to carry out a five-year expansion program. However, a lack of appropriations caused the beginning of the program to be delayed until 1 July 1927. Patrick proposed an increase to 63 [[squadron (aviation)|tactical squadrons]] (from an existing 32) to maintain the program of the Lassiter Board already in effect, but Chief of Staff Gen. [[John L. Hines|John Hines]] rejected the recommendation in favor of a plan drawn up by ground force Brig. Gen. [[Hugh Drum]] that proposed 52 squadrons.<ref>Maurer (1987), p. 196.</ref><ref>Tate (1998), pp. 138\u2013140</ref><ref group=n>The General Staff viewed the \"five-year plan\" as an opponent of the Army in general and fought it bitterly, citing it as a destructive force at every opportunity. General Drum also chaired the 1933 Drum Board, created specifically to oppose (and revise) plans and appropriation requests submitted by Chief of Air Corps Foulois that were not to the General Staff's liking.</ref> The act authorized expansion to 1,800 airplanes, 1,650 officers, and 15,000 enlisted men, to be reached in regular increments over a five-year period. None of the goals was reached by July 1932. Neither of the relatively modest increases in airplanes or officers was accomplished until 1938 because adequate funds were never appropriated and the coming of the [[Great Depression]] forced reductions in pay and modernization across the board in the Army.<ref>Maurer (1987), p. 200.</ref> Organizationally the Air Corps doubled from seven to fifteen [[group (military aviation unit)|groups]], but the expansion was meaningless because all were seriously understrength in aircraft and pilots.<ref>Maurer (1987), p. 216.</ref> ([[US Army Air Service#Groups of the Air Service|Origin of first seven groups shown here]])\n\n<center>'''Air Corps groups added 1927\u20131937'''</center>\n{| table align=center class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! !! !!\n|-style=\"background: khaki\"\n| align=center|'''Group''' ||align=center|'''Station''' ||align=center|'''Date activated'''||align=center|'''Aircraft type'''\n|-\n|[[18th Operations Group|18th Pursuit Group]]||align=center|[[Wheeler Field]], Hawaii||20 January 1927|| [[PW-9]]\n|-\n|[[7th Operations Group|7th Bombardment Group]]|| align=center|[[Rockwell Field]], California|| 1 June 1928|| [[Keystone LB-6|LB-7]], [[Keystone B-3A|B-3A]]\n|-\n|[[12th Observation Group]]\u00b9|| align=center|[[Brooks Air Force Base|Brooks Field]], Texas||1 October 1930|| [[Thomas-Morse O-19|O-19]]\n|-\n|[[20th Operations Group|20th Pursuit Group]]||align=center|[[Mather Air Force Base|Mather Field]], California|| 15 November 1930|| [[Boeing P-12|P-12]]\n|-\n|[[8th Operations Group|8th Pursuit Group]]|| align=center|[[Langley Air Force Base|Langley Field]], [[Virginia]]|| 1 April 1931||[[Curtiss P-6 Hawk|P-6]]\n|-\n|[[17th Pursuit Group]]\u00b2||align=center|[[March Air Force Base|March Field]], California|| 1 July 1931||[[Boeing P-12|P-12]]\n|-\n|[[19th Bomb Group]]|| [[Rockwell Field]], California|| 24 June 1932|| [[Martin B-10|B-10]]\n|-\n|[[16th Pursuit Group]]|| align=center|[[Albrook Air Force Base|Albrook Field, Canal Zone]]|| 1 December 1932|| [[Boeing P-12|P-12]]\n|-\n|[[10th Transport Group]] || align=center|[[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Patterson Field]], [[Ohio]]|| 20 May 1937|| [[Bellanca Aircruiser|C-27]] [[Douglas DC-2|C-33]]\n|}\n<center>\u00b9Inactivated on 20 May 1937</center>\n<center>\u00b2Redesignated 17th Attack Group (1935), 17th Bomb Group (1939)</center>\n\nAs units of the Air Corps increased in number, so did higher command echelons. The ''[[2d Bombardment Wing (World War II)|2nd Wing]]'', activated in 1922 as part of the Air Service, remained the only wing organization in the new Air Corps until 1929, when it was redesignated the ''2nd Bombardment Wing'' in anticipation of the activation of the ''[[1st Bombardment Wing (World War II)|1st Bombardment Wing]]'' to provide a bombardment wing on each coast.<ref>Maurer (1987), p. 197.</ref> The 1st Bomb Wing was activated in 1931, followed by the ''[[98th Bombardment Wing (World War II)|3rd Attack Wing]]'' in 1932 to protect the Mexican border, at which time the 1st became the ''1st Pursuit Wing''. The three wings became the foundation of General Headquarters Air Force upon its activation in 1935.\n\n===Aircraft and personnel 1926\u20131935===\n[[File:Douglas O-46.jpg|thumb|right| O-46A at Wright Field]]\nThe Air Corps adopted a new color scheme for painting its aircraft in 1927, heretofore painted [[olive drab]]. The wings and tails of aircraft were painted [[chrome yellow]], with the words \"U.S. ARMY\" displayed in large black lettering on the undersurface of the lower wings. Tail rudders were painted with a vertical dark blue band at the rudder hinge and 13 alternating red-and-white horizontal stripes trailing.

As their numbers and utility declined, they were replaced by a series of 50 twin-engine and single-engine small transports and used for staff duties. Pilot training was conducted between 1927 and 1937 in the [[Consolidated PT-3]] trainer, followed by the [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75|Stearman PT-13]] and variants after 1937.\n\nBy 1933 the Air Corps expanded to a tactical strength of 50 squadrons: 21 pursuit, 13 observation, 12 bombardment, and 4 attack. All were understrength in aircraft and men, particularly officers, which resulted in most being commanded by junior officers (commonly first lieutenants)<ref group=n>An example is [[Ralph Francis Stearley|Ralph F.

Despite an embarrassing performance that resulted numerous crashes and 13 fatalities and was deemed a \"fiasco\" in the media, investigating boards in 1933\u20131934<ref group=n>The Drum Board was a panel of five generals formed in August 1933 by the General Staff to oppose recommendations by Air Corps planners for development and expansion to meet defense needs (Tate (1998) pp. 138\u2013139), while the Baker Board was formed after the Air Mail scandal and had as its military members (who controlled the agenda) the five generals of the Drum Board (Tate pp. 143\u2013145).</ref> recommended organizational and modernization changes that again set the Air Corps on the path to autonomy and eventual separation from the Army.

Instead, the Air Corps inventory actually declined to 855 total aircraft in 1936, a year after the creation of GHQ Air Force, which by itself was recommended to have a strength of 980.<ref>Shiner, \"The Heyday of the GHQ Air Force, 1935\u20131939\", p. 136, 120, for the GHQAF figure.</ref>\n\nThe most serious fallout from the Air Mail fiasco was the retirement under fire of Major General [[Benjamin Foulois]] as Chief of Air Corps. Soon after the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] placed the blame on him for the Air Corps' failures, he was investigated by a congressional subcommittee alleging corruption in aircraft procurement. The matter resulted in an impasse between committee chairman [[William N. Rogers]] and Secretary of War [[George Dern]] before being sent to the Army's Inspector General, who ruled largely in favor of Foulois. Rogers continued to severely criticize Foulois through the summer of 1935, threatening future Air Corps appropriations, and despite public support by Dern for the embattled chief, the administration was close to firing Foulois for his perceived attitude as a radical airman and his public criticisms of the administration during the controversy. He retired in December 1935 for the good of the service.<ref>Foulois (1968), p. 274</ref><ref name=\"rice133\">Rice (2004), p. 133</ref>\n\nThe Roosevelt administration began a search for his replacement in September 1935, narrowing the choice to two of the three assistant chiefs, [[Henry Conger Pratt]] and [[Oscar Westover]].  Pratt appeared to have the superior credentials, but he had been in charge of aircraft procurement during the Foulois years and was looked upon warily by Dern as possibly being another Mitchell or Foulois. Westover was chosen because he was the philosophical opposite of the two insurgent airmen in all respects, being a \"team player\".<ref name=\"rice133\"/>\n\nThe open insurgency between 1920 and 1935 of airmen foreseeing a need for an independent air force in order to develop fully the potential of airpower had cost the careers of two of its near-legendary lights, Foulois and Mitchell, and nearly cost the reputation of two others, Pratt and [[Henry H. Arnold]]. In terms of the principle of civilian control of the military in peacetime, their tactics and behavior were clearly inappropriate. The political struggle had temporarily alienated supporters in Congress, had been counterproductive of the development of the Air Corps in the short run, and had hardened the opposition of an already antagonistic General Staff.  But through their mistakes and repeated rebuffs, the airmen had learned what they were lacking: proof for the argument that the Air Corps could perform a unique mission\u2014strategic bombardment\u2014and the real threat of another world war would soon reverse their fortunes.<ref name=\"rice127\">Rice (2004), p. 1237</ref>\n\n==Doctrinal development==\n\n===Strategic bombardment in roles and missions===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"The Naval Air Force will be based on the fleet and move with it as an important element in solving the primary missions confronting the fleet.

Douglas MacArthur, Adm. William V. Pratt, 7 January 1931<ref>Tate (1998), p. 78.</ref>\n|}\n\nIn March 1928, commenting on the lack of survivability in combat of his unit's [[Keystone LB-7]] and [[Martin NBS-1]] bombers, Lt. Col. [[Hugh J. Knerr]], commander of the [[2d Operations Group|2nd Bombardment Group]] at [[Langley Air Force Base|Langley Field]], [[Virginia]], recommended that the Air Corps adopt two types of all-metal monoplane bombers, a short-range day bomber and a long-range night bomber. Instructors at the [[Air Corps Tactical School]] (ACTS), also then at Langley, took the concept one step further in March 1930 by recommending that the types instead be ''light'' and ''heavy'', the latter capable of long range carrying a heavy bomb load that could also be used during daylight.<ref>Tate (1998), p. 161.</ref>\n\nThe Air Corps in January 1931 \"got its foot in the door\" for developing a mission for which only it would have capability, while at the same time creating a need for technological advancement of its equipment. [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[William V. Pratt]] wanted approval of his proposition that all naval aviation including land-based aircraft was by definition tied to carrier-based fleet operations. Pratt reached an agreement with new Army Chief of Staff [[Douglas MacArthur]] that the Air Corps would assume responsibility for coastal defense (traditionally a primary function of the Army but a secondary, wartime function of the Navy) beyond the range of the Army's Coast Artillery guns, ending the Navy's apparent duplication of effort in coastal air operations. The agreement, intended as a modification of the Joint Action statement on coastal defense issued in 1926, was not endorsed by the Joint Army-Navy Board<ref group=n>The Joint Army-Navy Board was the rudimentary precursor of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].</ref> and never had authority other than personal agreement between the two heads of service. Though the Navy repudiated the statement when Pratt retired in 1934, the Air Corps clung to the mission, and provided itself with the basis for development of long-range bombers and creating new doctrine to employ them.<ref>Shiner, \"The Coming of the GHQ Air Force\", p. 116.</ref><ref>Tate (1998), pp. 64\u201379.</ref>\n\nThe formulation of theories of [[strategic bombing]] gave new impetus to the argument for an independent air force. Strategic or long-range bombardment was intended to destroy an enemy's industry and war-making potential, and only an independent service would have a free hand to do so. But despite what it perceived as \"obstruction\" from the War Department, much of which was attributable to a shortage of funds, the Air Corps made great strides during the 1930s. A doctrine emerged that stressed precision bombing of industrial targets by heavily armed long-range aircraft.\n\nThis doctrine resulted because of several factors. The Air Corps Tactical School moved in July 1931 to [[Maxwell Air Force Base|Maxwell Field]], [[Alabama]], where it taught a 36-week course for junior and mid-career officers that included military aviation theory. The Bombardment Section, under the direction of its chief, Major [[Harold L. George]], became influential in the development of doctrine and its dissemination throughout the Air Corps. Nine of its instructors became known throughout the Air Corps as the \"[[Bomber Mafia]]\", eight of whom (including George) went on to be generals during World War II. Conversely, pursuit tacticians, primarily Capt. [[Claire Chennault]], Chief of the school's Pursuit Section, found their influence waning because of repeated performance failures of pursuit aviation. Finally, the doctrine represented the Air Corps' attempt to develop autonomy from the General Staff, which enforced subordination of the air arm by limiting it to support of ground forces and defense of United States territory.\n\n===Technological advances in bombers===\n[[File:Boeing Y1B-9 test flight USAF p29.jpg|right|thumb|\"Gear down\" test flight of the Boeing Y1B-9 bomber in 1932. At the time it was faster than any existing pursuit plane.]]\n\nNew bomber types under development clearly outperformed new pursuit types, particularly in speed and altitude, then considered the primary defenses against interception. In both 1932 and 1933, large-scale maneuvers found fighters unable to climb to altitude quickly enough to intercept attacking [[Boeing Y1B-9|B-9]] and [[Martin B-10|B-10]] prototypes, a failure so complete that Westover, following the 1933 maneuvers, actually proposed elimination of pursuits altogether.<ref>Bowman (1997), p. 7.</ref>\n\n1933 was a pivotal year in the advancement of aviation technology in which the all-metal airplane came of age, \"practically overnight\" in the words of one historian, because of the availability of the first practical [[variable-pitch propeller]]. Coupled with \"best weight\" design of airframes, the controllable pitch propeller resulted in an immediate doubling of speeds and operating ranges without decreasing aircraft weights or increasing engine horsepower, exemplified by the civil [[Douglas DC-1]] transport and the military Martin B-10 bomber.<ref name=\"rks10\">Smith (1998), p. 10.</ref>\n\nThe B-10 featured innovations that became standard internationally for the next decade: an all-metal low wing monoplane, closed cockpits, rotating gun turrets, retractable landing gear, internal bomb bay, [[high-lift device]]s and full engine cowlings.<ref name=\"rks10\"/><ref name=\"eam931\">Eden and Moeng (2002), p. 931.</ref> The B-10 proved to be so superior that as its 14 operational test models were delivered in 1934 they were fed into the Air Corps mail operation, and despite some glitches caused by pilot unfamiliarity with the innovations,<ref group=n>Two YB-10s were landed with their landing gear still up, both by experienced aviators, one a major with 100 hours in aircraft with retractable gear. (Maurer 1987, p. 311)</ref> were a bright spot. The first action to repair the damaged image of the Air Corps involved the movement of ten YB-10s from Bolling Field to Alaska, ostensibly for an airfield survey, but timed to coincide with the release of the Baker Board's report in July.\n\nThe successful development of the B-10 and subsequent orders for more than 150 (including its B-12 variant) continued the hegemony of the bomber within the Air Corps that resulted in a feasibility study for a 35-ton 4-engined bomber (the [[Boeing XB-15]]). While it was later found to be unsuitable for combat because the power of existing engines was inadequate for its weight, the XB-15 led to the design of the smaller Model 299, later to become the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]], whose first flight was at the end of July 1935. By that time the Air Corps had two projects in place for the development of longer-ranged bombers, Project A for a bomber with a ferry range of {{convert|5000|mi|km|sigfig=2}}, and Project D, for one of a range of up to {{convert|10000|mi|km|sigfig=2}}.<ref name=\"Cate 1945, p. 13\">Cate (1945), p. 13</ref><ref name=\"rks12\">Smith (1998), p. 12.</ref> In June 1936 the Air Corps requested 11 B-15s and 50 B-17s for reinforcing hemispheric defense forces in Hawaii, Alaska, and Panama. The request was rejected on the basis that there were no strategic requirements for aircraft of such capabilities.<ref name=\"Cate 1945, p. 17\">Cate (1945), p. 17.</ref>\n\n===General Staff resistance to Air Corps doctrine===\nThe Army and Navy, both cognizant of the continuing movement within the Air Corps for independence, cooperated to resist it. On 11 September 1935, the Joint Board, at the behest of the Navy and with the concurrence of MacArthur, issued a new \"Joint Action Statement\" that once again asserted the limited role of the Air Corps as an auxiliary to the \"mobile Army\" in all its missions, including coastal defense.<ref>Cate (1945), p. 15.</ref> The edict was issued with the intent of again shoving an upstart Air Corps back into its place. However, the bomber advocates interpreted its language differently, concluding that the Air Corps could conduct long-range reconnaissance, attack approaching fleets, reinforce distant bases, and attack enemy air bases, all in furthering its mission to prevent an air attack on America.<ref>Cate (1945), p. 16.</ref><ref group=n>The Joint Action Statement fostered a lack of inter-service cooperation on coastal defense that continued until the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]. As late as 14 October 1941, CNO Adm. Harold Stark insisted that the \"proper\" role of Army aviation in coastal defense was support of Navy operations. (Shiner, \"The Coming of the GHQ Air Force\", p. 121)</ref>\n\nA month later (15 October 1935), the General Staff released a revision of the doctrinal guide for the Air Corps, training regulation TR 440-15 ''Employment of the Air Forces of the Army''.<ref group=n>Since 1923 Army doctrine had been stated in ''[[List of United States Army Field Manuals#Field Service Regulations|Field Service Regulations]]'', which were general in character, and ''Training Regulations,'' which stated combat principles for each combatant arm.

Its report, submitted to Chief of Staff Marshall on 1 September 1939, represented an Army-wide perspective. It became the basis for FM 1\u20135, and recognized that the United States was then on the strategic defensive. Its view was conservative and \"a considerable attenuation of air doctrine\" as espoused by the ACTS. However it did correct the omissions of TR 440-15 and reasserted that centralized control by an airman in any combat role was essential for efficiency. Ironically, Gen. Andrews had by then become Army G-3 and reported to Marshall that the manual \"did not endorse the radical theory of air employment\". FM 1\u20135 was followed by supplemental doctrine Air Corps Field Manuals FM 1\u201315 ''Tactics and Technique of Air Fighting'' (pursuit) on 9 September 1940, FM 1\u201310 ''Tactics and Technique of Air Attack'' (bombardment) on 20 November 1940, FM 1\u201320 ''Tactics and Technique of Air Reconnaissance and Observation'' on 10 February 1941, War Department Basic Field Manual FM 31\u201335 ''Aviation in Support of Ground Forces'' on 9 April 1942, and Army Air Forces Field Manual FM 1\u201375 ''Combat Orders'' on 16 June 1942.

Using attach\u00e9 reports from both [[Spanish Civil War|Spain]] and [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Ethiopia]], and endorsed by a senior Air Corps instructor, Col. [[Byron Q. Jones]],<ref group=n>Jones, an aviation pioneer and formerly a cavalry officer, was the rarest of Air Corps officers, a \"true believer\" in the General Staff doctrine. He was one of the few senior Air Corps officers never to have attended or instructed at the [[Air Corps Tactical School]]. Following his controversial endorsement, the War Department offered him a command with a temporary promotion to brigadier general. His autobiographical entry in the ''Cullum Register of USMA graduates'', however, states he declined \"because of desire of superiors to retain his services within (the) continental U.S.\" Jones remained at the Army War College with its temporary promotion to colonel until September 1939, then accepted a cavalry assignment and transferred from the Air Corps.</ref> the course declared that the Flying Fortress concept had \"died in Spain\", and that airpower was useful mainly as \"long range artillery.\" Air Corps officers in the G-3 Department of the General Staff pointed out that Jones' conclusions were inconsistent with the revised TR 440-15, but their views were dismissed by Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. [[Stanley Embick]] with the comment: \"No doctrine is sacrosanct, and of all military doctrines, that of the Air Corps should be the last to be so regarded.\"<ref>Futrell (1989), pp. 85\u201386</ref><ref group=n>Embick was formerly chief of the War Plans Division.

His influence ended the next year when he was replaced as Deputy Chief of Staff by George C. Marshall. (Greer 1985, p. 95)</ref>\n\nAt the same time the General Staff ordered studies from all the service branches to develop drafts for the coming field manuals. The Air Corps Board, a function of the ACTS, submitted a draft in September 1938 that included descriptions of independent air operations, strategic air attacks, and air action against naval forces, all of which the General Staff rejected in March 1939. Instead it ordered that the opening chapter of the Air Corps manual be a doctrinal statement developed by the G-3 that \"left little doubt\" that the General Staff's intention was \"to develop and employ aviation in support of ground forces.\" The Air Corps Board, on the orders of Arnold, developed a secret study for \"defense of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]\" that recommended development of long-range, high altitude, high-speed aircraft for bombardment and reconnaissance to accomplish that defense.<ref>Futrell (1989), pp.&nbsp;89\u201390</ref>\n\nThe War Department, seeking to stifle procurement of the B-17 while belatedly recognizing that coordinated air-ground support had been long neglected, decided that it would order only two-engined \"light\" bombers in fiscal years 1939 through 1941.

The 1,800 aircraft goal was never reached because of General Staff resistance to the \"five-year plan\", but the War Plans Division did deem it \"acceptable\" for implementation of War Plan Red-Orange. The Air Corps, based on studies of joint exercises held at [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], Florida, found the number dangerously inadequate, concluding that 4,459 aircraft was the minimum needed to defend the United States against air attack in the event of War Plan Red-Orange.</ref> President Roosevelt approved an open-ended program to increase strength to 2,320 aircraft (albeit without any proviso for funding) in August 1934, and Secretary Dern approved the activation of GHQ Air Force in December 1934.<ref>Tate (1998), pp. 146 and 150.</ref>\n\nGHQ Air Force took control of all combat air units in the United States from the jurisdiction of [[corps area]] commanders, where it had resided since 1920, and organized them operationally into a strike force of three wings.<ref group=n>The wings were organized both functionally and geographically. The 1st was both the bombardment and the Pacific wing, the 2d the pursuit and Atlantic wing, and the 3rd the attack and Gulf Coast wing.</ref> The GHQ Air Force remained small in comparison to European air forces.

The organizations reported separately to the Chief of Staff, the Air Corps as the service element of the air arm, and GHQAF as the tactical element. However all GHQ Air Force's members, along with members of units stationed overseas and under the control of local ground commanders, remained part of the Air Corps. This dual status and division of authority hampered the development of Air Corps for the next six years, as it had the Air Service during World War I, and was not overcome until the necessity of expanding the force occurred with the onset of World War II.<ref name=\"cate1\">Craven and Cate Vol. 1, pp. 31\u201333</ref> The commanding general of GHQ Air Force, Maj. Gen. [[Frank Maxwell Andrews|Frank M.

Andrews, by virtue of being out from Westover's control, had picked up the mantle of the radical airmen, and Westover soon found himself on \"the wrong side of history\" as far as the future of the Air Corps was concerned.<ref>Rice (2004), p. 131</ref><ref group=n>Andrews and Westover were both 1906 graduates of West Point, with Andrews graduating one position higher in class standings.

He had not learned to fly until he was 40 years of age and was a reluctant participant in Washington's social environs, usually depending on his assistant Hap Arnold to fulfill the protocol role. As early as 5 May 1919, in a memo to Director of Air Service Charles Menoher for whom he was assistant executive officer, Westover had demonstrated a loyalty to subordination, urging the relief of Billy Mitchell from his position as Third Assistant Executive (S-3) of the Air Service\u2014along with his division heads\u2014if their advocacy of positions not conforming to Army policy did not cease.</ref>\n\nLines of authority were also blurred as GHQ Air Force controlled only combat flying units within the continental United States. The Air Corps was responsible for training, aircraft development, doctrine, and supply, while the ground forces corps area commanders still controlled installations and the personnel manning them.<ref name=\"cc31\"/> An example of the difficulties this arrangement imposed on commanders was that while the commander of GHQ Air Force was responsible for the discipline of his command, he had no [[court martial]] authority over his personnel, which was retained by the corps area commander.

At a confidential and historic conference in the White House in late 1938, Roosevelt met with Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]]; WPA Chief [[Harry L. Hopkins]]; Solicitor General [[Robert H. Jackson]]; Secretary of War Woodring; Secretary of the Navy [[Charles Edison]]; General Counsel of the Treasury [[Herman Oliphant]]; Chief of Naval Operations Adm. [[Harold R. Stark]]; Craig; Marshall; and Arnold. He outlined a vigorous and singular call for 10,000 aircraft, but was persuaded by advisers to cut back the number for political reasons. The date of this conference is in dispute. Arnold, from the notes he made on a manila envelope, stated in ''Global Mission'' (p. 177, with which Coffey agrees) that it took place on 28 September while [[Neville Chamberlain]] was preparing to return to Germany to complete the [[Munich Agreement]]. Other historians, including Gen. John W. Huston, editor of ''American Airpower Comes of Age: General Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold's World War II Diaries'', and Mark Skinner Watson, in the Army's official history ''Chief of Staff: Prewar Plans and Preparations'' (''United States Army in World War II'' series), date the meeting as 14 November. Huston asserts that the Navy was pointedly excluded from the conference and argues that a number of White House \"crisis\" conferences were held in October and November, most without written record, and that Arnold confused them, inserting the date (in pencil on an otherwise ink record) in his notes after-the-fact (Huston, Vol. I, pp. 120\u2013121, note 216). Watson indicates that only Roosevelt's \"naval aides\" represented the Navy (p. 137). Coffey argues that beginning with Roosevelt's weekly press conference of 14 October, the president issued public and private statements that indicated his Air Corps expansion plans were already well underway. William Goss, in his summary for ''Army Air Forces in World War II'', uses 14 November, but concedes that expansion plans were well under way before November, and that Arnold was possibly correct. Greer (''The Development of Air Doctrine in the Army Air Arm, 1917\u20131941'') agrees with Arnold and Coffey (p. 100). Because both dates are marked by notable events involving Nazi Germany (the U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Germany on 14 November), the actual date remains unresolved.</ref> On 3 April 1939, Congress allocated the $300&nbsp;million requested by Roosevelt for expansion of the Air Corps, half of which was dedicated to purchasing planes to raise the inventory from 2,500 to 5,500 airplanes, and the other half for new personnel, training facilities, and bases.<ref>Williams (1953), p. 12.

New combat groups were created by detaching cadres from the existing 15 Regular groups to provide the core of the new units, with each older group providing the basis for an average of three new groups.

On 16 May 1940, with the fall of France imminent, President Roosevelt delivered an address to Congress calling for a supplemental appropriation of nearly a billion dollars and the manufacture of 50,000 aircraft a year for the armed forces (36,500 of them for the Air Corps). Eighteen months later the AAF still had only 3,304 combat aircraft (only 1,024 overseas), and 7,024 non-combat aircraft, of which 6,594 were trainers.<ref>Tate (1998), p. 173.</ref> Its command staff increased in October 1940 to 24 with the addition of 15 new general officer billets.<ref>''Official Register of the United States 1941, Volume I'', U.S. Civil Service Commission publication, p. 48</ref><ref group=n>The 15 general officer billets consisted of four major generals, and eleven brigadier generals.

The separation of the combat organization (GHQ Air Force) from the logistic organization (Air Corps) created serious problems of coordination nearly identical to the [[United States Army Air Service#Aircraft production failures|Division of Military Aeronautics/Bureau of Aircraft Production dual-authority]] mess of World War I. In March 1939, with the replacement of Andrews as commander of GHQ Air Force by Maj. Gen. [[Delos Emmons|Delos C.

On 5 October 1940, Arnold drew up a proposal to reorganize the air arm along functional lines, creating an air staff, unifying the various organizations under one commander, and giving it autonomy with the ground and supply forces\u2014a plan which was eventually adopted in March 1942\u2014and submitted it to Chief of Staff [[George C. Marshall]], but it was immediately opposed by the General Staff in all respects.<ref name=\"goss\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 18.</ref>\n\nInstead, the two organizations were separated again by a directive from Marshall on 19 November 1940. Army General Headquarters was activated (more than five years after the activation of \"its\" air force) and GHQ AF placed under it, even though Army GHQ had been activated as a training organization.<ref>Correll, \"GHQ Air Force\", p.66.</ref> Its logistical and training structure were again out of its hands, this time under the direct control of the chief of staff, and its airfields again came under control of the corps commanders. Maj. Gen. [[George Brett (military)|George H. Brett]], acting Chief of the Air Corps, denounced the plan as \"disastrous in war\".<ref name=\"goss\"/><ref>Craven and Cate Vol. 1, p. 114</ref> The problems already existing due to the lack of unity of command were exacerbated by the assignment of GHQ Air Force to Army GHQ. Emmons, who had begun his tour junior to Arnold, was promoted to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] to make him equal to the commanders of the field armies also controlled by Army GHQ. This forced him to report to and act under an inferior in rank (both Arnold and Brett were [[Major general (United States)|major general]]s).\n\nAs a compromise on all these issues, Marshall made Arnold \"Acting Deputy Chief of Staff for Air.\" Although the Air Corps found the compromise unsatisfactory, this provisional position on the general staff did enable him to coordinate the two sections of the air arm until the organizational problems were repaired. Even in the short run, however, coordination proved to be no substitute for unity of command.<ref>Craven and Cate Vol. 1, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\n===Creation of the Army Air Forces===\nIn the spring of 1941, the combat successes of the British [[Royal Air Force]] and the German [[Luftwaffe]] under centralized control made clear that the fragmenting of authority in the American air arm had resulted in a dangerous lack of clear channels of command. After a joint U.S.-British strategic planning agreement ([[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC-1]]) rebuffed the long-held argument that the Air Corps had no wartime mission except support of ground forces,<ref>Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 20</ref> the War Department revised Army Regulation 95-5 on 20 June in an attempt to end the divisions without legislative intervention by Congress. In creating the [[U.S. Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] with the Air Corps and the Air Force Combat Command (a redesignation of General Headquarters Air Force) as its major components, the War Department also authorized an Air Staff to manage planning and execution of expansion of the air arm and named Arnold as Chief of the Army Air Forces. It did not, however, end the dual chain of command difficulties, as air units of Air Force Combat Command still reported to Army GHQ as well as Headquarters AAF.<ref>Craven and Cate Vol. 1, p. 115</ref> Two further attempts by Arnold to implement his reorganization were again rejected by the WDGS in October and November.<ref name=\"csm7\"/>\n\nAt this stage, support of airpower in public opinion reached unprecedented highs, increasing pressures from outside the military for an independent air arm with representation in the cabinet.<ref>Craven and Cate Vol. 6, p. vii</ref><ref group=n>The popularity of the concept is reflected in the advocacy by candidate [[Wendell Willkie]] during the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential campaign]] for a Department of Defense and an independent Air Force. (Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 17)</ref> Arnold made a decision to postpone any attempts to exploit the opportunity to push for an independent Air Force. Assured of a free hand by Marshall, Arnold thought that it would \"be a serious mistake to change the existing setup\" in the midst of the crucial expansion effort,<ref name=\"Nalty 1997 180\"/> which in less than five years would be more than 100 times its June 1939 size in personnel (much of it highly trained technically) alone. By November, however, the division of authority within the Army as a whole caused by the activation of Army GHQ prompted Marshall to assert that he had \"the poorest command post in the Army.\" Defense commands, particularly those affecting air defense, had in Marshall's words showed a \"disturbing failure to follow through on orders.\"<ref name=\"csm7\">Mooney (1956), p. 7</ref> Confronted with Marshall's dissatisfaction with Army GHQ, the General Staff reversed its opposition. Marshall appointed an Air Corps officer, Brig. Gen. [[Joseph T. McNarney]], to chair a \"War Department Reorganization Committee\" within the War Plans Division, using Arnold's plan as a blueprint.<ref>Mooney (1956), p. 8</ref>\n\nBased on the recommendations of McNarney's committee, Roosevelt issued [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16227 Executive Order 9082], which changed Arnold's title to ''Commanding General, Army Air Forces'' effective 9 March 1942, making him co-equal with the commanding generals of the other components of the [[Army of the United States]].<ref name=\"mc3241\">McClendon (1996), pp. 132\u2013141. The three documents referenced, AR 95-5, EO 9082, and WD Circular 59, are reproduced in their entirety.</ref> On that date, War Department Circular 59 formalized the changes, abolishing Army GHQ and organizing the Army into three autonomous components: the Army Air Forces, the [[Army Ground Forces]], and the [[Services of Supply]], each with a commanding general reporting to the Chief of Staff. The Office of Chief of Air Corps (OCAC) was abolished (as was Air Force Combat Command) and the functions of the Air Corps transferred to the AAF, reducing the status of the Air Corps to a [[combat arm]] classification.<ref name=\"Nalty 1997 180\">Nalty (1997), p. 180.</ref><ref group=n>[[Infantry]] and the other combat arms also had their chiefs abolished and functions transferred to the Army Ground Forces.</ref>\n\nThe Congress did not dis-establish the Army Air Corps as a combat arm until 26 July 1947, when the National Security Act of 1947 (61 ''Stat.'' 502) became law. Most members of the Army Air Forces also remained members of the Air Corps. In May 1945, 88 percent of officers serving in the Army Air Forces were commissioned in the Air Corps, while 82 percent of enlisted members assigned to AAF units and bases had the Air Corps as their combat arm branch.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Correll| first = John T.|date=July 2009| title = But What About the Air Corps?|journal=Air Force Magazine| volume = 92| issue = 7}}, p.&nbsp;64\u201365.</ref>\n\n==Organization of the Air Corps==\n\n===Army Air Corps, 1 March 1935===\n:<small>SOURCES: Maurer Maurer, ''Aviation in the U.S. Army, 1919\u20131939'' (Appendix 5), and ''Air Force Combat Units of World War II'', both USAF Historical Research Center</small>\nThis list of units is a snapshot of the Air Corps on the date of activation of the General Headquarters Air Force.

After [[World War I]], as early aviation became an increasingly important part of modern warfare, a philosophical rift developed between more traditional ground-based army personnel and those who felt that aircraft were being underutilized and that air operations were being stifled for political reasons unrelated to their effectiveness. The USAAC was renamed from the earlier [[United States Army Air Service]] on 2 July 1926, and was part of the larger [[United States Army]]. The Air Corps became the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on 20 June 1941, giving it greater autonomy from the Army's middle-level command structure. During [[World War II]], although not an administrative echelon, the Air Corps (AC) remained as one of the [[combat arms]] of the Army until 1947, when it was legally abolished by legislation establishing the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]].<ref name=\"natarc\"/>\n\nThe Air Corps was renamed by the [[United States Congress]] largely as a compromise between the advocates of a separate air arm and those of the traditionalist Army high command who viewed the aviation arm as an auxiliary branch to support the ground forces. Although its members worked to promote the concept of air power and an autonomous air force in [[interwar period|the years]] between the [[world war]]s, its primary purpose by Army policy remained support of ground forces rather than independent operations.\n\nOn 1 March 1935, still struggling with the issue of a separate air arm, the Army activated the '''General Headquarters Air Force''' for centralized control of aviation combat units within the continental United States, separate from but coordinate with the Air Corps. The separation of the Air Corps from control of its combat units caused [[United States Army Air Corps#Problems with unity of command|problems of unity of command]] that became more acute as the Air Corps enlarged in preparation for World War II. This was resolved by the creation of the Army Air Forces (AAF), making both organizations subordinate to the new higher echelon.\n\nOn [[1941 in aviation#June|June 20, 1941]], the Army Air Corps' existence as the primary air arm of the U.S. Army changed to that of solely being the training and logistics elements of the then-new [[United States Army Air Forces]], which embraced the formerly-named General Headquarters Air Force under the new Air Force Combat Command organization for front-line combat operations; this new element, along with the Air Corps, comprised the USAAF.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II|origyear= 1961|url= http://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/21/2001330256/-1/-1/0/AFD-100921-044.pdf |edition=reprint|year=1983|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-02-1|lccn=61060979|page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe Air Corps ceased to have an administrative structure after 9 March 1942, but as \"the permanent statutory organization of the air arm, and the principal component of the Army Air Forces,\" the overwhelming majority of personnel assigned to the AAF were members of the Air Corps.<ref name=\"goss2\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 31.</ref>\n\n==Creation of the Air Corps==\n{{quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=#B0C4DE |align=left |halign=right|quote=<div style=\"text-align:left;\">'''Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress Assembled''', that the Act entitled \"An act for making further and more effectual provision for the national defense, and other purposes,\" approved June 3, 1916, as amended, be, and the same is hereby, amended so that the Air Service referred to in that Act and all subsequent Acts of Congress shall be known as the Air Corps.</div> |source='''Public Law 69-446, 2 July 1926'''<ref name=\"mooney\">Mooney and Layman (1944), p. 117.</ref>}}\n\nThe [[United States Army Air Service|U.S. Army Air Service]] had a brief but turbulent history. Created during [[World War I]] by [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] after America entered the war in April 1917 as the increasing use of airplanes and the military uses of aviation were readily apparent as the war continued to its climax, the [[United States Army Air Service|U.S. Army Air Service]] gained permanent legislative authority in 1920 as a combatant arm of the line of the [[United States Army]]. There followed a six-year struggle between adherents of airpower and the supporters of the traditional military services about the value of an independent Air Force, intensified by struggles for funds caused by skimpy budgets, as much an impetus for independence as any other factor.<ref>Tate (1998), pp. 185\u2013188.</ref>\n\nThe Lassiter Board, a group of [[General Staff]] officers, recommended in 1923 that the [[U.S. Army Air Service|Air Service]] be augmented by an offensive force of bombardment and pursuit units under the command of Army general headquarters in time of war, and many of its recommendations became Army regulations. The War Department desired to implement the Lassiter Board's recommendations, but the administration of [[U.S. president|President]] [[Calvin Coolidge]] chose instead to economize by radically cutting military budgets, particularly the Army's.<ref>Tate (1998), p. 30</ref><ref group=n>The Coolidge administration boasted of cutting the War Department's budget by 75%.</ref> The Lampert Committee of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in December 1925 proposed a unified air force independent of the Army and Navy, plus a department of defense to coordinate the three armed services.<ref>Maurer (1987), pp. 72\u201373.</ref> However another board, headed by [[Dwight Morrow]], was appointed in September 1925 by Coolidge ostensibly to study the \"best means of developing and applying aircraft in national defense\" but in reality to minimize the political impact of the pending court-martial of [[Billy Mitchell (general)|Billy Mitchell]] (and to preempt the findings of the Lampert Committee). It declared that no threat of air attack was likely to exist to the United States, rejected the idea of a department of defense and a separate department of air, and recommended minor reforms that included renaming the air service to allow it \"more prestige.\"<ref>Maurer (1987), pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nIn early 1926 the Military Affairs Committee of the Congress rejected all bills set forth before it on both sides of the issue. They fashioned a compromise in which the findings of the Morrow Board were enacted as law, while providing the air arm a \"five-year plan\" for expansion and development. Maj. Gen. [[Mason Patrick]], the Chief of Air Service, had proposed that it be made a semi-independent service within the War Department along the lines of the Marine Corps within the Navy Department, but this was rejected; only the cosmetic name change was accepted.<ref>Tate (1998), pp. 45\u201347</ref><ref group=n>Gen. Patrick's proposal of an Air Corps equivalent to the Marine Corps was characterized by Brig. Gen. [[Fox Conner]] (and not for the first nor last time by General Staff opponents of Air Corps independence) as a \"promotion scheme\".</ref> The legislation changed the name of the Air Service to the Air Corps, (in the words of one analyst) \"thereby strengthening the conception of military aviation as an offensive, striking arm rather than an auxiliary service.\"<ref>Greer (1985), p. 29.\"</ref>\n[[File:USAAC,1930.jpg|thumb|Formations of [[Keystone LB-6|Keystone LB-7s]] (lower) and [[Boeing P-12]]s (upper) on aerial maneuvers over Burbank, California, 1930]]\n\nThe Air Corps Act (44 ''Stat.'' 780) became law on 2 July 1926. In accordance with the Morrow Board's recommendations, the act created an additional [[United States Assistant Secretary of War|Assistant Secretary of War]] to \"help foster military aeronautics\", and established an air section in each division of the General Staff for a period of three years. Two additional brigadier generals would serve as assistant chiefs of the Air Corps.<ref name=\"ccI1\"/><ref group=n>All Air Corps generals held temporary ranks. The Air Corps did not have a member promoted to permanent establishment general officer until 1937, and he was promptly removed from the Air Corps.</ref> Previous provisions of the National Defense Act of 1920 that all flying units be commanded only by [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating|rated personnel]] and that flight pay be awarded were continued. The Air Corps also retained the \"[[Prop and Wings]]\" as its branch insignia through its disestablishment in 1947. Patrick became Chief of the Air Corps and Brig. Gen. [[James E. Fechet]] continued as his first assistant chief. On 17 July 1926, two lieutenant colonels were promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] for four-year terms as assistant chiefs of Air Corps: [[Frank P. Lahm]], to command the new [[Air Training Command|Air Corps Training Center]], and William E. Gillmore, in command of the [[Air Force Logistics Command|Materiel Division]].<ref>Maurer (1987), p. 74</ref><ref group=n>Gillmore had been chief of the Supply Division of the Air Service. Both he and Lahm served a single tour. Of the three assistant chiefs, Fechet succeeded Patrick in December 1927, Gillmore retired on 30 June 1930, and Lahm reverted to his permanent rank on 16 July 1930.</ref>\n\nOf the new law and organization, however, Wesley F. Craven and James L. Cate in the official history of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] concluded that: \n<blockquote>\"The bill which was finally enacted purported to be a compromise, but it leaned heavily on the Morrow recommendations. The Air Corps Act of 2 July 1926 effected no fundamental innovation. The change in designation meant no change in status: the Air Corps was still a [[combat arm|combatant branch of the Army]] with less prestige than the Infantry.\"<ref name=\"ccI1\">Craven and Cate Vol. 1, p. 29.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe position of the air arm within the Department of War remained essentially the same as before, that is, the flying units were under the operational control of the various ground forces [[corps area]] commands and not the Air Corps, which remained responsible for procurement and maintenance of aircraft, supply, and training. Because of a lack of legally specified duties and responsibilities, the new position of [[United States Assistant Secretary of War#Assistant Secretary of War for Air|Assistant Secretary of War for Air]], held by [[F. Trubee Davison]] from July 1926 to March 1933, proved of little help in promoting autonomy for the air arm.<ref>Tate (1998), p. 60.</ref>\n\n===Five-year expansion program===\nThe Air Corps Act gave authorization to carry out a five-year expansion program. However, a lack of appropriations caused the beginning of the program to be delayed until 1 July 1927. Patrick proposed an increase to 63 [[squadron (aviation)|tactical squadrons]] (from an existing 32) to maintain the program of the Lassiter Board already in effect, but Chief of Staff Gen. [[John L. Hines|John Hines]] rejected the recommendation in favor of a plan drawn up by ground force Brig. Gen. [[Hugh Drum]] that proposed 52 squadrons.<ref>Maurer (1987), p. 196.</ref><ref>Tate (1998), pp. 138\u2013140</ref><ref group=n>The General Staff viewed the \"five-year plan\" as an opponent of the Army in general and fought it bitterly, citing it as a destructive force at every opportunity. General Drum also chaired the 1933 Drum Board, created specifically to oppose (and revise) plans and appropriation requests submitted by Chief of Air Corps Foulois that were not to the General Staff's liking.</ref> The act authorized expansion to 1,800 airplanes, 1,650 officers, and 15,000 enlisted men, to be reached in regular increments over a five-year period. None of the goals was reached by July 1932. Neither of the relatively modest increases in airplanes or officers was accomplished until 1938 because adequate funds were never appropriated and the coming of the [[Great Depression]] forced reductions in pay and modernization across the board in the Army.<ref>Maurer (1987), p. 200.</ref> Organizationally the Air Corps doubled from seven to fifteen [[group (military aviation unit)|groups]], but the expansion was meaningless because all were seriously understrength in aircraft and pilots.<ref>Maurer (1987), p. 216.</ref> ([[US Army Air Service#Groups of the Air Service|Origin of first seven groups shown here]])\n\n<center>'''Air Corps groups added 1927\u20131937'''</center>\n{| table align=center class=\"wikitable\"\n! !! !! !!\n|-style=\"background: khaki\"\n| align=center|'''Group''' ||align=center|'''Station''' ||align=center|'''Date activated'''||align=center|'''Aircraft type'''\n|-\n|[[18th Operations Group|18th Pursuit Group]]||align=center|[[Wheeler Field]], Hawaii||20 January 1927|| [[PW-9]]\n|-\n|[[7th Operations Group|7th Bombardment Group]]|| align=center|[[Rockwell Field]], California|| 1 June 1928|| [[Keystone LB-6|LB-7]], [[Keystone B-3A|B-3A]]\n|-\n|[[12th Observation Group]]\u00b9|| align=center|[[Brooks Air Force Base|Brooks Field]], Texas||1 October 1930|| [[Thomas-Morse O-19|O-19]]\n|-\n|[[20th Operations Group|20th Pursuit Group]]||align=center|[[Mather Air Force Base|Mather Field]], California|| 15 November 1930|| [[Boeing P-12|P-12]]\n|-\n|[[8th Operations Group|8th Pursuit Group]]|| align=center|[[Langley Air Force Base|Langley Field]], [[Virginia]]|| 1 April 1931||[[Curtiss P-6 Hawk|P-6]]\n|-\n|[[17th Pursuit Group]]\u00b2||align=center|[[March Air Force Base|March Field]], California|| 1 July 1931||[[Boeing P-12|P-12]]\n|-\n|[[19th Bomb Group]]|| [[Rockwell Field]], California|| 24 June 1932|| [[Martin B-10|B-10]]\n|-\n|[[16th Pursuit Group]]|| align=center|[[Albrook Air Force Base|Albrook Field, Canal Zone]]|| 1 December 1932|| [[Boeing P-12|P-12]]\n|-\n|[[10th Transport Group]] || align=center|[[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Patterson Field]], [[Ohio]]|| 20 May 1937|| [[Bellanca Aircruiser|C-27]] [[Douglas DC-2|C-33]]\n|}\n<center>\u00b9Inactivated on 20 May 1937</center>\n<center>\u00b2Redesignated 17th Attack Group (1935), 17th Bomb Group (1939)</center>\n\nAs units of the Air Corps increased in number, so did higher command echelons. The ''[[2d Bombardment Wing (World War II)|2nd Wing]]'', activated in 1922 as part of the Air Service, remained the only wing organization in the new Air Corps until 1929, when it was redesignated the ''2nd Bombardment Wing'' in anticipation of the activation of the ''[[1st Bombardment Wing (World War II)|1st Bombardment Wing]]'' to provide a bombardment wing on each coast.<ref>Maurer (1987), p. 197.</ref> The 1st Bomb Wing was activated in 1931, followed by the ''[[98th Bombardment Wing (World War II)|3rd Attack Wing]]'' in 1932 to protect the Mexican border, at which time the 1st became the ''1st Pursuit Wing''. The three wings became the foundation of General Headquarters Air Force upon its activation in 1935.\n\n===Aircraft and personnel 1926\u20131935===\n[[File:Douglas O-46.jpg|thumb|right| O-46A at Wright Field]]\nThe Air Corps adopted a new color scheme for painting its aircraft in 1927, heretofore painted [[olive drab]]. The wings and tails of aircraft were painted [[chrome yellow]], with the words \"U.S. ARMY\" displayed in large black lettering on the undersurface of the lower wings. Tail rudders were painted with a vertical dark blue band at the rudder hinge and 13 alternating red-and-white horizontal stripes trailing. The painting of fuselages olive drab was changed to blue in the early 1930s, and this motif continued until late 1937, when all new aircraft (now all-metal) were left unpainted except for national markings.<ref>Maurer (1987), pp. 213 and 365.</ref>\n\n[[File:Keystone B-6A.jpg|thumb|right| B-6A of 1st Bomb Squadron, 9th BG, 1935. The dual stripes on the fuselage denote the aircraft of the squadron commander.]]\n[[File:Boeing P-26A USAF.jpg|thumb|right| P-26A in livery of 19th Pursuit Squadron, 18th PG, Wheeler Field, Hawaii]]\nMost pursuit fighters before 1935 were of the [[Curtiss P-1 Hawk]] (1926\u20131930) and [[Boeing P-12]] (1929\u20131935) families, and before the 1934 introduction of the all-metal monoplane, most front-line bombers were canvas-and-wood variants of the [[radial engine]]d [[Keystone LB-6]] (60 LB-5A, LB-6 and LB-7 bombers) and [[Keystone B-3A|B-3A]] (127 B-3A, B-4A, B-5, and B-6A bombers) designs.<ref group=n>The primary difference between the types is the twin-finned tail of the former, and the single vertical stabilizer of the latter design, which gave it marginally superior performance.</ref>  Between 1927 and 1934, the [[Curtiss Falcon|Curtiss O-1 Falcon]] was the most numerous of the 19 different types and series of observation craft and its A-3 variant the most numerous of the attack planes that fulfilled the observation/close support role designated by the General Staff as the primary mission of the Air Corps.<ref>Maurer (1987), pp. 214\u2013215.</ref>\n\nTransport aircraft used during the first ten years of the Air Corps were of largely [[trimotor]] design, such as the [[Fokker F.VII|Atlantic-Fokker C-2]] and the [[Ford trimotor|Ford C-3]], and were procured in such small numbers (66 total) that they were doled out one airplane to a base. As their numbers and utility declined, they were replaced by a series of 50 twin-engine and single-engine small transports and used for staff duties. Pilot training was conducted between 1927 and 1937 in the [[Consolidated PT-3]] trainer, followed by the [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75|Stearman PT-13]] and variants after 1937.\n\nBy 1933 the Air Corps expanded to a tactical strength of 50 squadrons: 21 pursuit, 13 observation, 12 bombardment, and 4 attack. All were understrength in aircraft and men, particularly officers, which resulted in most being commanded by junior officers (commonly first lieutenants)<ref group=n>An example is [[Ralph Francis Stearley|Ralph F. Stearley]], who commanded the 13th Attack Squadron for four years as a 1st Lieutenant.</ref> instead of by majors as authorized.<ref>Maurer (1987), pp. 216\u2013219.</ref>  The last open-cockpit fighter used by the Air Corps, the [[Boeing P-26 Peashooter]], came into service in 1933 and bridged the gap between the biplane and more modern fighters.\n\nThe Air Corps was called upon in early 1934 to deliver mail in the wake of the [[Air Mail scandal]], involving the [[United States Postmaster General|postmaster general]] and heads of the airlines. Despite an embarrassing performance that resulted numerous crashes and 13 fatalities and was deemed a \"fiasco\" in the media, investigating boards in 1933\u20131934<ref group=n>The Drum Board was a panel of five generals formed in August 1933 by the General Staff to oppose recommendations by Air Corps planners for development and expansion to meet defense needs (Tate (1998) pp. 138\u2013139), while the Baker Board was formed after the Air Mail scandal and had as its military members (who controlled the agenda) the five generals of the Drum Board (Tate pp. 143\u2013145).</ref> recommended organizational and modernization changes that again set the Air Corps on the path to autonomy and eventual separation from the Army. A force of 2,320 aircraft was recommended by the Drum Board,<ref group=n>The Drum Board derived its figure as the number necessary to maintain 2,072 \"serviceable\" planes for its worst-case scenario, [[United States color-coded war plans|War Plan Red-Orange]]. War plans involving Great Britain (\"Red\") as an opponent were not officially excluded from United States war planning until January 1938.</ref> and authorized by Congress in June 1936, but appropriations to build up the force were denied by the administration until 1939, when the probability of war became apparent. Instead, the Air Corps inventory actually declined to 855 total aircraft in 1936, a year after the creation of GHQ Air Force, which by itself was recommended to have a strength of 980.<ref>Shiner, \"The Heyday of the GHQ Air Force, 1935\u20131939\", p. 136, 120, for the GHQAF figure.</ref>\n\nThe most serious fallout from the Air Mail fiasco was the retirement under fire of Major General [[Benjamin Foulois]] as Chief of Air Corps. Soon after the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] placed the blame on him for the Air Corps' failures, he was investigated by a congressional subcommittee alleging corruption in aircraft procurement. The matter resulted in an impasse between committee chairman [[William N. Rogers]] and Secretary of War [[George Dern]] before being sent to the Army's Inspector General, who ruled largely in favor of Foulois. Rogers continued to severely criticize Foulois through the summer of 1935, threatening future Air Corps appropriations, and despite public support by Dern for the embattled chief, the administration was close to firing Foulois for his perceived attitude as a radical airman and his public criticisms of the administration during the controversy. He retired in December 1935 for the good of the service.<ref>Foulois (1968), p. 274</ref><ref name=\"rice133\">Rice (2004), p. 133</ref>\n\nThe Roosevelt administration began a search for his replacement in September 1935, narrowing the choice to two of the three assistant chiefs, [[Henry Conger Pratt]] and [[Oscar Westover]].  Pratt appeared to have the superior credentials, but he had been in charge of aircraft procurement during the Foulois years and was looked upon warily by Dern as possibly being another Mitchell or Foulois. Westover was chosen because he was the philosophical opposite of the two insurgent airmen in all respects, being a \"team player\".<ref name=\"rice133\"/>\n\nThe open insurgency between 1920 and 1935 of airmen foreseeing a need for an independent air force in order to develop fully the potential of airpower had cost the careers of two of its near-legendary lights, Foulois and Mitchell, and nearly cost the reputation of two others, Pratt and [[Henry H. Arnold]]. In terms of the principle of civilian control of the military in peacetime, their tactics and behavior were clearly inappropriate. The political struggle had temporarily alienated supporters in Congress, had been counterproductive of the development of the Air Corps in the short run, and had hardened the opposition of an already antagonistic General Staff.  But through their mistakes and repeated rebuffs, the airmen had learned what they were lacking: proof for the argument that the Air Corps could perform a unique mission\u2014strategic bombardment\u2014and the real threat of another world war would soon reverse their fortunes.<ref name=\"rice127\">Rice (2004), p. 1237</ref>\n\n==Doctrinal development==\n\n===Strategic bombardment in roles and missions===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"The Naval Air Force will be based on the fleet and move with it as an important element in solving the primary missions confronting the fleet.

Douglas MacArthur, Adm. William V. Pratt, 7 January 1931<ref>Tate (1998), p. 78.</ref>\n|}\n\nIn March 1928, commenting on the lack of survivability in combat of his unit's [[Keystone LB-7]] and [[Martin NBS-1]] bombers, Lt. Col. [[Hugh J. Knerr]], commander of the [[2d Operations Group|2nd Bombardment Group]] at [[Langley Air Force Base|Langley Field]], [[Virginia]], recommended that the Air Corps adopt two types of all-metal monoplane bombers, a short-range day bomber and a long-range night bomber. Instructors at the [[Air Corps Tactical School]] (ACTS), also then at Langley, took the concept one step further in March 1930 by recommending that the types instead be ''light'' and ''heavy'', the latter capable of long range carrying a heavy bomb load that could also be used during daylight.<ref>Tate (1998), p. 161.</ref>\n\nThe Air Corps in January 1931 \"got its foot in the door\" for developing a mission for which only it would have capability, while at the same time creating a need for technological advancement of its equipment. [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[William V. Pratt]] wanted approval of his proposition that all naval aviation including land-based aircraft was by definition tied to carrier-based fleet operations. Pratt reached an agreement with new Army Chief of Staff [[Douglas MacArthur]] that the Air Corps would assume responsibility for coastal defense (traditionally a primary function of the Army but a secondary, wartime function of the Navy) beyond the range of the Army's Coast Artillery guns, ending the Navy's apparent duplication of effort in coastal air operations. The agreement, intended as a modification of the Joint Action statement on coastal defense issued in 1926, was not endorsed by the Joint Army-Navy Board<ref group=n>The Joint Army-Navy Board was the rudimentary precursor of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].</ref> and never had authority other than personal agreement between the two heads of service. Though the Navy repudiated the statement when Pratt retired in 1934, the Air Corps clung to the mission, and provided itself with the basis for development of long-range bombers and creating new doctrine to employ them.<ref>Shiner, \"The Coming of the GHQ Air Force\", p. 116.</ref><ref>Tate (1998), pp. 64\u201379.</ref>\n\nThe formulation of theories of [[strategic bombing]] gave new impetus to the argument for an independent air force. Strategic or long-range bombardment was intended to destroy an enemy's industry and war-making potential, and only an independent service would have a free hand to do so. But despite what it perceived as \"obstruction\" from the War Department, much of which was attributable to a shortage of funds, the Air Corps made great strides during the 1930s. A doctrine emerged that stressed precision bombing of industrial targets by heavily armed long-range aircraft.\n\nThis doctrine resulted because of several factors. The Air Corps Tactical School moved in July 1931 to [[Maxwell Air Force Base|Maxwell Field]], [[Alabama]], where it taught a 36-week course for junior and mid-career officers that included military aviation theory. The Bombardment Section, under the direction of its chief, Major [[Harold L. George]], became influential in the development of doctrine and its dissemination throughout the Air Corps. Nine of its instructors became known throughout the Air Corps as the \"[[Bomber Mafia]]\", eight of whom (including George) went on to be generals during World War II. Conversely, pursuit tacticians, primarily Capt. [[Claire Chennault]], Chief of the school's Pursuit Section, found their influence waning because of repeated performance failures of pursuit aviation. Finally, the doctrine represented the Air Corps' attempt to develop autonomy from the General Staff, which enforced subordination of the air arm by limiting it to support of ground forces and defense of United States territory.\n\n===Technological advances in bombers===\n[[File:Boeing Y1B-9 test flight USAF p29.jpg|right|thumb|\"Gear down\" test flight of the Boeing Y1B-9 bomber in 1932. At the time it was faster than any existing pursuit plane.]]\n\nNew bomber types under development clearly outperformed new pursuit types, particularly in speed and altitude, then considered the primary defenses against interception. In both 1932 and 1933, large-scale maneuvers found fighters unable to climb to altitude quickly enough to intercept attacking [[Boeing Y1B-9|B-9]] and [[Martin B-10|B-10]] prototypes, a failure so complete that Westover, following the 1933 maneuvers, actually proposed elimination of pursuits altogether.<ref>Bowman (1997), p. 7.</ref>\n\n1933 was a pivotal year in the advancement of aviation technology in which the all-metal airplane came of age, \"practically overnight\" in the words of one historian, because of the availability of the first practical [[variable-pitch propeller]]. Coupled with \"best weight\" design of airframes, the controllable pitch propeller resulted in an immediate doubling of speeds and operating ranges without decreasing aircraft weights or increasing engine horsepower, exemplified by the civil [[Douglas DC-1]] transport and the military Martin B-10 bomber.<ref name=\"rks10\">Smith (1998), p. 10.</ref>\n\nThe B-10 featured innovations that became standard internationally for the next decade: an all-metal low wing monoplane, closed cockpits, rotating gun turrets, retractable landing gear, internal bomb bay, [[high-lift device]]s and full engine cowlings.<ref name=\"rks10\"/><ref name=\"eam931\">Eden and Moeng (2002), p. 931.</ref> The B-10 proved to be so superior that as its 14 operational test models were delivered in 1934 they were fed into the Air Corps mail operation, and despite some glitches caused by pilot unfamiliarity with the innovations,<ref group=n>Two YB-10s were landed with their landing gear still up, both by experienced aviators, one a major with 100 hours in aircraft with retractable gear. (Maurer 1987, p. 311)</ref> were a bright spot. The first action to repair the damaged image of the Air Corps involved the movement of ten YB-10s from Bolling Field to Alaska, ostensibly for an airfield survey, but timed to coincide with the release of the Baker Board's report in July.\n\nThe successful development of the B-10 and subsequent orders for more than 150 (including its B-12 variant) continued the hegemony of the bomber within the Air Corps that resulted in a feasibility study for a 35-ton 4-engined bomber (the [[Boeing XB-15]]). While it was later found to be unsuitable for combat because the power of existing engines was inadequate for its weight, the XB-15 led to the design of the smaller Model 299, later to become the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]], whose first flight was at the end of July 1935. By that time the Air Corps had two projects in place for the development of longer-ranged bombers, Project A for a bomber with a ferry range of {{convert|5000|mi|km|sigfig=2}}, and Project D, for one of a range of up to {{convert|10000|mi|km|sigfig=2}}.<ref name=\"Cate 1945, p. 13\">Cate (1945), p. 13</ref><ref name=\"rks12\">Smith (1998), p. 12.</ref> In June 1936 the Air Corps requested 11 B-15s and 50 B-17s for reinforcing hemispheric defense forces in Hawaii, Alaska, and Panama. The request was rejected on the basis that there were no strategic requirements for aircraft of such capabilities.<ref name=\"Cate 1945, p. 17\">Cate (1945), p. 17.</ref>\n\n===General Staff resistance to Air Corps doctrine===\nThe Army and Navy, both cognizant of the continuing movement within the Air Corps for independence, cooperated to resist it. On 11 September 1935, the Joint Board, at the behest of the Navy and with the concurrence of MacArthur, issued a new \"Joint Action Statement\" that once again asserted the limited role of the Air Corps as an auxiliary to the \"mobile Army\" in all its missions, including coastal defense.<ref>Cate (1945), p. 15.</ref> The edict was issued with the intent of again shoving an upstart Air Corps back into its place. However, the bomber advocates interpreted its language differently, concluding that the Air Corps could conduct long-range reconnaissance, attack approaching fleets, reinforce distant bases, and attack enemy air bases, all in furthering its mission to prevent an air attack on America.<ref>Cate (1945), p. 16.</ref><ref group=n>The Joint Action Statement fostered a lack of inter-service cooperation on coastal defense that continued until the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]. As late as 14 October 1941, CNO Adm. Harold Stark insisted that the \"proper\" role of Army aviation in coastal defense was support of Navy operations. (Shiner, \"The Coming of the GHQ Air Force\", p. 121)</ref>\n\nA month later (15 October 1935), the General Staff released a revision of the doctrinal guide for the Air Corps, training regulation TR 440-15 ''Employment of the Air Forces of the Army''.<ref group=n>Since 1923 Army doctrine had been stated in ''[[List of United States Army Field Manuals#Field Service Regulations|Field Service Regulations]]'', which were general in character, and ''Training Regulations,'' which stated combat principles for each combatant arm.

Its report, submitted to Chief of Staff Marshall on 1 September 1939, represented an Army-wide perspective. It became the basis for FM 1\u20135, and recognized that the United States was then on the strategic defensive. Its view was conservative and \"a considerable attenuation of air doctrine\" as espoused by the ACTS. However it did correct the omissions of TR 440-15 and reasserted that centralized control by an airman in any combat role was essential for efficiency. Ironically, Gen. Andrews had by then become Army G-3 and reported to Marshall that the manual \"did not endorse the radical theory of air employment\". FM 1\u20135 was followed by supplemental doctrine Air Corps Field Manuals FM 1\u201315 ''Tactics and Technique of Air Fighting'' (pursuit) on 9 September 1940, FM 1\u201310 ''Tactics and Technique of Air Attack'' (bombardment) on 20 November 1940, FM 1\u201320 ''Tactics and Technique of Air Reconnaissance and Observation'' on 10 February 1941, War Department Basic Field Manual FM 31\u201335 ''Aviation in Support of Ground Forces'' on 9 April 1942, and Army Air Forces Field Manual FM 1\u201375 ''Combat Orders'' on 16 June 1942. FM 1\u20135 was itself superseded after just three years following disputes over control of air power in North Africa by FM 100-20 ''Command and Employment of Air Power'' (Field Service Regulations) on 21 July 1943 in what many in the Army Ground Forces viewed as the Army Air Forces' \"Declaration of Independence.\" (AGF Historical Study No. 35, p. 47)</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1937 the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]]'s course on the use of airpower reiterated the General Staff position and taught that airpower was of limited value when employed independently. Using attach\u00e9 reports from both [[Spanish Civil War|Spain]] and [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Ethiopia]], and endorsed by a senior Air Corps instructor, Col. [[Byron Q. Jones]],<ref group=n>Jones, an aviation pioneer and formerly a cavalry officer, was the rarest of Air Corps officers, a \"true believer\" in the General Staff doctrine. He was one of the few senior Air Corps officers never to have attended or instructed at the [[Air Corps Tactical School]]. Following his controversial endorsement, the War Department offered him a command with a temporary promotion to brigadier general. His autobiographical entry in the ''Cullum Register of USMA graduates'', however, states he declined \"because of desire of superiors to retain his services within (the) continental U.S.\" Jones remained at the Army War College with its temporary promotion to colonel until September 1939, then accepted a cavalry assignment and transferred from the Air Corps.</ref> the course declared that the Flying Fortress concept had \"died in Spain\", and that airpower was useful mainly as \"long range artillery.\" Air Corps officers in the G-3 Department of the General Staff pointed out that Jones' conclusions were inconsistent with the revised TR 440-15, but their views were dismissed by Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. [[Stanley Embick]] with the comment: \"No doctrine is sacrosanct, and of all military doctrines, that of the Air Corps should be the last to be so regarded.\"<ref>Futrell (1989), pp. 85\u201386</ref><ref group=n>Embick was formerly chief of the War Plans Division.

His influence ended the next year when he was replaced as Deputy Chief of Staff by George C. Marshall. (Greer 1985, p. 95)</ref>\n\nAt the same time the General Staff ordered studies from all the service branches to develop drafts for the coming field manuals. The Air Corps Board, a function of the ACTS, submitted a draft in September 1938 that included descriptions of independent air operations, strategic air attacks, and air action against naval forces, all of which the General Staff rejected in March 1939. Instead it ordered that the opening chapter of the Air Corps manual be a doctrinal statement developed by the G-3 that \"left little doubt\" that the General Staff's intention was \"to develop and employ aviation in support of ground forces.\" The Air Corps Board, on the orders of Arnold, developed a secret study for \"defense of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]\" that recommended development of long-range, high altitude, high-speed aircraft for bombardment and reconnaissance to accomplish that defense.<ref>Futrell (1989), pp.&nbsp;89\u201390</ref>\n\nThe War Department, seeking to stifle procurement of the B-17 while belatedly recognizing that coordinated air-ground support had been long neglected, decided that it would order only two-engined \"light\" bombers in fiscal years 1939 through 1941.

Gen. [[Charles E. Kilbourne]], at the core of the General Staff's disputes with the Air Corps and supervisor of the revision of TR 440-15, authored these suggestions. He also freely espoused his opinion that expansion of the Air Corps was primarily a \"selfish\" means of promotion for aviators at the expense of the rest of the Army. Although rapid promotion of youthful airmen became a cliche in World War II, during the inter-war years Air Service/Air Corps promotion lagged notoriously behind that of the other branches. On the  669-name promotion list for colonel in 1922, on which Kilbourne had been 76th, the first airman (later Chief of Air Corps [[James Fechet]]) had been 354th. The 1,800 aircraft goal was never reached because of General Staff resistance to the \"five-year plan\", but the War Plans Division did deem it \"acceptable\" for implementation of War Plan Red-Orange. The Air Corps, based on studies of joint exercises held at [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], Florida, found the number dangerously inadequate, concluding that 4,459 aircraft was the minimum needed to defend the United States against air attack in the event of War Plan Red-Orange.</ref> President Roosevelt approved an open-ended program to increase strength to 2,320 aircraft (albeit without any proviso for funding) in August 1934, and Secretary Dern approved the activation of GHQ Air Force in December 1934.<ref>Tate (1998), pp. 146 and 150.</ref>\n\nGHQ Air Force took control of all combat air units in the United States from the jurisdiction of [[corps area]] commanders, where it had resided since 1920, and organized them operationally into a strike force of three wings.<ref group=n>The wings were organized both functionally and geographically.

The organizations reported separately to the Chief of Staff, the Air Corps as the service element of the air arm, and GHQAF as the tactical element. However all GHQ Air Force's members, along with members of units stationed overseas and under the control of local ground commanders, remained part of the Air Corps.

The cost of the aircraft disturbed [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Harry Woodring]], who denied requests for further purchases, so that although the air arm embraced strategic bombing as its primary doctrine after the creation of GHQ Air Force, by 1938 there were still only thirteen strategic bombers on hand. On 18 March 1938 Secretary Woodring implemented a plan that would have included the purchase of 144 four-engine bombers but approval was reversed in July when the moratorium against the long-range bomber program was imposed by the Joint Board.<ref name=\"Tate 1998 169\">Tate (1998), p. 169</ref><ref group=n>The Woodring Plan (based on the \"Balanced Air Corps Program\" developed after a two-year War Department study) was another \"five-year plan\" that called for adding 1,094 aircraft: 144 four-engine bombers, 266 two-engine bombers, 259 attack aircraft, and 425 pursuits, to begin in FY 1940 (July 1939).

All of these aircraft were obsolete by the time they came into service, and the outbreak of war in Europe spurred development of more capable types.

At a confidential and historic conference in the White House in late 1938, Roosevelt met with Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]]; WPA Chief [[Harry L. Hopkins]]; Solicitor General [[Robert H. Jackson]]; Secretary of War Woodring; Secretary of the Navy [[Charles Edison]]; General Counsel of the Treasury [[Herman Oliphant]]; Chief of Naval Operations Adm. [[Harold R. Stark]]; Craig; Marshall; and Arnold. He outlined a vigorous and singular call for 10,000 aircraft, but was persuaded by advisers to cut back the number for political reasons. The date of this conference is in dispute. Arnold, from the notes he made on a manila envelope, stated in ''Global Mission'' (p. 177, with which Coffey agrees) that it took place on 28 September while [[Neville Chamberlain]] was preparing to return to Germany to complete the [[Munich Agreement]]. Other historians, including Gen. John W. Huston, editor of ''American Airpower Comes of Age: General Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold's World War II Diaries'', and Mark Skinner Watson, in the Army's official history ''Chief of Staff: Prewar Plans and Preparations'' (''United States Army in World War II'' series), date the meeting as 14 November. Huston asserts that the Navy was pointedly excluded from the conference and argues that a number of White House \"crisis\" conferences were held in October and November, most without written record, and that Arnold confused them, inserting the date (in pencil on an otherwise ink record) in his notes after-the-fact (Huston, Vol. I, pp. 120\u2013121, note 216). Watson indicates that only Roosevelt's \"naval aides\" represented the Navy (p. 137). Coffey argues that beginning with Roosevelt's weekly press conference of 14 October, the president issued public and private statements that indicated his Air Corps expansion plans were already well underway. William Goss, in his summary for ''Army Air Forces in World War II'', uses 14 November, but concedes that expansion plans were well under way before November, and that Arnold was possibly correct. Greer (''The Development of Air Doctrine in the Army Air Arm, 1917\u20131941'') agrees with Arnold and Coffey (p. 100). Because both dates are marked by notable events involving Nazi Germany (the U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Germany on 14 November), the actual date remains unresolved.</ref> On 3 April 1939, Congress allocated the $300&nbsp;million requested by Roosevelt for expansion of the Air Corps, half of which was dedicated to purchasing planes to raise the inventory from 2,500 to 5,500 airplanes, and the other half for new personnel, training facilities, and bases.<ref>Williams (1953), p. 12.

The expansion program of the Air Corps was characterized by repeated upward revision of goals for increasing aircraft production, combat unit totals, the training of new personnel, and construction of new bases. New combat groups were created by detaching cadres from the existing 15 Regular groups to provide the core of the new units, with each older group providing the basis for an average of three new groups. Graduates of an expanded flight training program filled out the new groups and replaced the experienced personnel transferred from the older groups, resulting in a steady decline in the overall level of experience in the operational units.<ref>White (1949), p. 2</ref><ref>Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, pp.&nbsp;600\u2013602</ref> In essence, groups \"self-trained\"<ref>White (1949), p. 9</ref> to proficiency standards set by training directives from the GHQAF.<ref>Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 600</ref> Unable to keep pace with the revised programs for expansion of combat groups, unit tactical training for all groups suffered from a shortage of equipment (particularly combat aircraft), an unavoidable preoccupation with administrative details during organization, and a lack of training facilities, especially bombing and gunnery ranges, leaving a \"vast gap between the desired status of training in combat units and their actual status immediately prior to&nbsp;...

On 16 May 1940, with the fall of France imminent, President Roosevelt delivered an address to Congress calling for a supplemental appropriation of nearly a billion dollars and the manufacture of 50,000 aircraft a year for the armed forces (36,500 of them for the Air Corps). Eighteen months later the AAF still had only 3,304 combat aircraft (only 1,024 overseas), and 7,024 non-combat aircraft, of which 6,594 were trainers.<ref>Tate (1998), p. 173.</ref> Its command staff increased in October 1940 to 24 with the addition of 15 new general officer billets.<ref>''Official Register of the United States 1941, Volume I'', U.S. Civil Service Commission publication, p. 48</ref><ref group=n>The 15 general officer billets consisted of four major generals, and eleven brigadier generals.

Only four Air Corps officers achieved the permanent rank of brigadier general before the AAF was created, and only two of those (Arnold, who was the last of the four, and Andrews) still had air force duties.</ref> By June 1941, when the Air Corps became part of the AAF, it had 33 general officers, including four serving in observer roles to the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\n==Dissolution of the Air Corps==\n===Unity of Command difficulties===\nArnold, at the direction of President Roosevelt in January 1939, oversaw an expansion of the Air Corps that doubled it in size from 15 to 30 groups by the end of 1940. The separation of the combat organization (GHQ Air Force) from the logistic organization (Air Corps) created serious problems of coordination nearly identical to the [[United States Army Air Service#Aircraft production failures|Division of Military Aeronautics/Bureau of Aircraft Production dual-authority]] mess of World War I. In March 1939, with the replacement of Andrews as commander of GHQ Air Force by Maj. Gen. [[Delos Emmons|Delos C. Emmons]], Arnold was nominally assigned to \"supervise\" the tactical force but this did not resolve the divisions in command. On 5 October 1940, Arnold drew up a proposal to reorganize the air arm along functional lines, creating an air staff, unifying the various organizations under one commander, and giving it autonomy with the ground and supply forces\u2014a plan which was eventually adopted in March 1942\u2014and submitted it to Chief of Staff [[George C. Marshall]], but it was immediately opposed by the General Staff in all respects.<ref name=\"goss\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 18.</ref>\n\nInstead, the two organizations were separated again by a directive from Marshall on 19 November 1940. Army General Headquarters was activated (more than five years after the activation of \"its\" air force) and GHQ AF placed under it, even though Army GHQ had been activated as a training organization.<ref>Correll, \"GHQ Air Force\", p.66.</ref> Its logistical and training structure were again out of its hands, this time under the direct control of the chief of staff, and its airfields again came under control of the corps commanders. Maj. Gen. [[George Brett (military)|George H. Brett]], acting Chief of the Air Corps, denounced the plan as \"disastrous in war\".<ref name=\"goss\"/><ref>Craven and Cate Vol. 1, p. 114</ref> The problems already existing due to the lack of unity of command were exacerbated by the assignment of GHQ Air Force to Army GHQ. Emmons, who had begun his tour junior to Arnold, was promoted to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] to make him equal to the commanders of the field armies also controlled by Army GHQ. This forced him to report to and act under an inferior in rank (both Arnold and Brett were [[Major general (United States)|major general]]s).\n\nAs a compromise on all these issues, Marshall made Arnold \"Acting Deputy Chief of Staff for Air.\" Although the Air Corps found the compromise unsatisfactory, this provisional position on the general staff did enable him to coordinate the two sections of the air arm until the organizational problems were repaired. Even in the short run, however, coordination proved to be no substitute for unity of command.<ref>Craven and Cate Vol. 1, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\n===Creation of the Army Air Forces===\nIn the spring of 1941, the combat successes of the British [[Royal Air Force]] and the German [[Luftwaffe]] under centralized control made clear that the fragmenting of authority in the American air arm had resulted in a dangerous lack of clear channels of command. After a joint U.S.-British strategic planning agreement ([[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC-1]]) rebuffed the long-held argument that the Air Corps had no wartime mission except support of ground forces,<ref>Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 20</ref> the War Department revised Army Regulation 95-5 on 20 June in an attempt to end the divisions without legislative intervention by Congress. In creating the [[U.S. Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] with the Air Corps and the Air Force Combat Command (a redesignation of General Headquarters Air Force) as its major components, the War Department also authorized an Air Staff to manage planning and execution of expansion of the air arm and named Arnold as Chief of the Army Air Forces. It did not, however, end the dual chain of command difficulties, as air units of Air Force Combat Command still reported to Army GHQ as well as Headquarters AAF.<ref>Craven and Cate Vol. 1, p. 115</ref> Two further attempts by Arnold to implement his reorganization were again rejected by the WDGS in October and November.<ref name=\"csm7\"/>\n\nAt this stage, support of airpower in public opinion reached unprecedented highs, increasing pressures from outside the military for an independent air arm with representation in the cabinet.<ref>Craven and Cate Vol. 6, p. vii</ref><ref group=n>The popularity of the concept is reflected in the advocacy by candidate [[Wendell Willkie]] during the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential campaign]] for a Department of Defense and an independent Air Force. (Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 17)</ref> Arnold made a decision to postpone any attempts to exploit the opportunity to push for an independent Air Force. Assured of a free hand by Marshall, Arnold thought that it would \"be a serious mistake to change the existing setup\" in the midst of the crucial expansion effort,<ref name=\"Nalty 1997 180\"/> which in less than five years would be more than 100 times its June 1939 size in personnel (much of it highly trained technically) alone. By November, however, the division of authority within the Army as a whole caused by the activation of Army GHQ prompted Marshall to assert that he had \"the poorest command post in the Army.\" Defense commands, particularly those affecting air defense, had in Marshall's words showed a \"disturbing failure to follow through on orders.\"<ref name=\"csm7\">Mooney (1956), p. 7</ref> Confronted with Marshall's dissatisfaction with Army GHQ, the General Staff reversed its opposition. Marshall appointed an Air Corps officer, Brig. Gen. [[Joseph T. McNarney]], to chair a \"War Department Reorganization Committee\" within the War Plans Division, using Arnold's plan as a blueprint.<ref>Mooney (1956), p. 8</ref>\n\nBased on the recommendations of McNarney's committee, Roosevelt issued [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16227 Executive Order 9082], which changed Arnold's title to ''Commanding General, Army Air Forces'' effective 9 March 1942, making him co-equal with the commanding generals of the other components of the [[Army of the United States]].<ref name=\"mc3241\">McClendon (1996), pp. 132\u2013141. The three documents referenced, AR 95-5, EO 9082, and WD Circular 59, are reproduced in their entirety.</ref> On that date, War Department Circular 59 formalized the changes, abolishing Army GHQ and organizing the Army into three autonomous components: the Army Air Forces, the [[Army Ground Forces]], and the [[Services of Supply]], each with a commanding general reporting to the Chief of Staff. The Office of Chief of Air Corps (OCAC) was abolished (as was Air Force Combat Command) and the functions of the Air Corps transferred to the AAF, reducing the status of the Air Corps to a [[combat arm]] classification.<ref name=\"Nalty 1997 180\">Nalty (1997), p. 180.</ref><ref group=n>[[Infantry]] and the other combat arms also had their chiefs abolished and functions transferred to the Army Ground Forces.</ref>\n\nThe Congress did not dis-establish the Army Air Corps as a combat arm until 26 July 1947, when the National Security Act of 1947 (61 ''Stat.'' 502) became law. Most members of the Army Air Forces also remained members of the Air Corps. In May 1945, 88 percent of officers serving in the Army Air Forces were commissioned in the Air Corps, while 82 percent of enlisted members assigned to AAF units and bases had the Air Corps as their combat arm branch.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Correll| first = John T.|date=July 2009| title = But What About the Air Corps?|journal=Air Force Magazine| volume = 92| issue = 7}}, p.&nbsp;64\u201365.</ref>\n\n==Organization of the Air Corps==\n\n===Army Air Corps, 1 March 1935===\n:<small>SOURCES: Maurer Maurer, ''Aviation in the U.S. Army, 1919\u20131939'' (Appendix 5), and ''Air Force Combat Units of World War II'', both USAF Historical Research Center</small>\nThis list of units is a snapshot of the Air Corps on the date of activation of the General Headquarters Air Force.

Isfahani when talking about Sassanid Iran.  Hamzeh Isfahani writes in the book Al-Tanbih \u2018ala Hoduth alTashif that five \"tongues\" or dialects, were common in Sassanian Iran: [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] (Fahlavi), [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]], [[Persian language|Parsi]] (Farsi), Khuzi and Soryani.  Hamzeh (893-961 A.D.) explains these dialects in the following way:{{cquote|[[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] (Fahlavi) was a dialect which kings spoke in their assemblies and it is related to Fahleh. This name is used to designate five cities of Iran, Esfahan, Rey, Hamadan, Man Nahavand, and Azerbaijan. [[Persian language|Parsi]] (Farsi) is a dialect which was spoken by the clergy (Zoroastrian) and those who associated with them and is the language of the cities of [[Fars Province|Pars]] (Fars). [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]] is the dialect of the cities of Ctesiphon and was spoken in the kings' /dabariyan/ 'courts'. The root of its name is related to its use; /darbar/ 'court* is implied in /dar/. The vocabulary of the natives of Balkh was dominant in this language, which includes the dialects of the eastern peoples.  Khuzi is associated with the cities of Khuzistan where kings and dignitaries used it in private conversation and during leisure time, in the bath houses for instance.<ref>(Mehdi Marashi, Mohammad Ali Jazayery, ''Persian Studies in North America: Studies in Honor of Mohammad Ali Jazayery'', Ibex Publishers, Inc, 1994. p 255)</ref>}}\n\nIbn Hawqal mentions that some areas of Armenia are controlled by Muslims and others by Christians.<ref>Ibn Howqal,Surat al-ardh.

The few researches undertaken (Planhol, 1960) demonstrate the indisputable predominance of Iranian tradition in agricultural techniques (irrigation, rotation systems, terraced cultivation) and in several settlement traits (winter troglodytism of people and livestock, evident in the widespread underground stables). The large villages of Iranian peasants in the irrigated valleys have worked as points for crystallization of the newcomers even in the course of linguistic transformation; these places have preserved their sites and transmitted their knowledge. The toponymy, with more than half of the place names of Iranian origin in some areas, such as the Sahand, a huge volcanic massif south of Tabriz, or the Qara Dagh, near the border (Planhol, 1966, p. 305; Bazin, 1982, p. 28) bears witness to this continuity. The language itself provides eloquent proof. Azeri, not unlike Uzbek (see above), lost the vocal harmony typical of Turkish languages.

[[Tadeusz Swietochowski]] states: \"According to the most widely accepted etymology, the name \"Azerbaijan\" is derived from Atropates, the name of a Persian satrap of the late fourth century b.c. Another theory traces the origin of the name to the Persian word azar (\"fire\"') - hence Azerbaijan, \"the Land of Fire\", because of Zoroastrian temples, with their fires fueled by plentiful supplies of oil.\nAzerbaijan maintained its national character after its conquest by the Arabs in the mid-seventh century a.d. and its subsequent conversion to Islam. At this time it became a province in the early Muslim empire. Only in the 11th century, when Oghuz Turkic tribes under the Seljuk dynasty entered the country, did Azerbaijan acquire a significant number of Turkic inhabitants. The original Persian population became fused with the Turks, and gradually the Persian language was supplanted by a Turkic dialect that evolved into the distinct [[Azeri language|Azerbaijani language]]. The process of Turkification was long and complex, sustained by successive waves of incoming nomads from Central Asia.<ref>Azerbaijan:Historical Background Vol. 3, Colliers Encyclopedia CD-ROM, 02-28-1996</ref>\n\n=== Place names, culture, and archaeological evidence ===\n{{See also|List of geographic names of Iranian origin}}\nThe terms \"Azerbaijani\" and \"Azerbaijani\" were born only in the 20th century upon the formation of the short lived Republic of Azerbaijan in 1918, prior to which Azerbaijanis were referred to as Tatars.<ref name=\"pcross\">{{cite book|last1=Michael P.

Though the population of Azerbaijan is culturally diverse, [[genetic testing]] has revealed common genetic markers that support an autochthonous background for most Azerbaijanis. A 2002 study found that: \"[[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome haplogroups]] indicate that Indo-European-speaking Armenians and Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanians from the republic are genetically more closely related to their geographic neighbors in the Caucasus than to their linguistic neighbors elsewhere.\"<ref name=\"Human Genes 2002\"/>  The authors of this study suggest that this indicates a language replacement of indigenous Caucasian peoples.

Other genetic analysis of [[mtDNA]] and [[Y-chromosome]]s indicates that Caucasian populations are genetically intermediate between Europeans and Near Easterners, but that they are more closely related to Near Easterners overall.  Another study, conducted in 2003 by the ''Russian Journal of Genetics'', compared Iranian-language speakers in Azerbaijan (the [[Talysh people|Talysh]] and [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tats]]) with Turkic-language Azerbaijanis and found that, \"... the genetic structure of the populations examined with the other Iranian-speaking populations (Persians and Kurds from Iran, Ossetins, and Tajiks) and Azerbaijanis showed that Iranian-speaking populations from Azerbaijan were more close to Azerbaijanis, than to Iranian-speaking populations inhabiting other world regions.\"<ref name=\"Talysh & Tat Genes\"/>\n\nAncient historians, including [[Herodotus]], [[Polybius]] and [[Strabo]], mention the region as a mixed one, with Iranian and non-Iranian groups, such as the ''[[Udi language|Utii]]'', a Caucasian group that still exists in Azerbaijan.<ref name=\"Media\">Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Volume V18, Page 22)</ref>\n\n==Oghuz arrival==\n{{Main|Turkic migration|Oghuz Turks}}\n[[Ibn al-Athir]], an [[Arab]] historian, declared that the Oghuz Turks had come to [[Transoxiana]] in the period of the [[caliph]] [[Al-Mahdi]] in the years between 775 and 785. In the period of the [[Abbasid]] caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] (813 &ndash; 833), the name Oghuz starts to appear in the works of Islamic writers. By 780, the eastern parts of the [[Syr Darya]] were ruled by the [[Karluk Turks]] and the western region (Oghuz steppe) was ruled by the Oghuz Turks.\n\nOghuz dominance in Southwestern Asia begins in the 11th century, with the [[Seljuk Empire]]. The [[Oghuz language|Southwestern Turkic]] dialects gradually supplanted the [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]], [[Ancient Azari language|Azari]], and [[Middle Persian]] dialects in northern Iran, and a variety of [[Caucasian languages]] in the Caucasus, particularly [[Udi language|Udi]], and had become the dominant during the High to Late Medieval period, under the rule of the [[White Sheep Turkomans]] and [[Black Sheep Turkomans]]  (14th to 15th centuries), the process of [[Turkification]] being mostly complete by the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] period (16th century).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[History of Azerbaijan]]\n*[[Azerbaijanis]]\n*[[Turkification]]\n*[[Genetic history of the Turkish people]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"N\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{human genetics}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Origin Of The Azeris}}\n[[Category:Origin hypotheses of ethnic groups|Azeris]]\n[[Category:Demographics of Azerbaijan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Over-quotation|date=September 2014}}\nThe [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani people]] are of mixed ethnic origins.

Isfahani when talking about Sassanid Iran.  Hamzeh Isfahani writes in the book Al-Tanbih \u2018ala Hoduth alTashif that five \"tongues\" or dialects, were common in Sassanian Iran: [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] (Fahlavi), [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]], [[Persian language|Parsi]] (Farsi), Khuzi and Soryani.  Hamzeh (893-961 A.D.) explains these dialects in the following way:{{cquote|[[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] (Fahlavi) was a dialect which kings spoke in their assemblies and it is related to Fahleh. This name is used to designate five cities of Iran, Esfahan, Rey, Hamadan, Man Nahavand, and Azerbaijan. [[Persian language|Parsi]] (Farsi) is a dialect which was spoken by the clergy (Zoroastrian) and those who associated with them and is the language of the cities of [[Fars Province|Pars]] (Fars). [[Dari (Zoroastrian)|Dari]] is the dialect of the cities of Ctesiphon and was spoken in the kings' /dabariyan/ 'courts'. The root of its name is related to its use; /darbar/ 'court* is implied in /dar/. The vocabulary of the natives of Balkh was dominant in this language, which includes the dialects of the eastern peoples.  Khuzi is associated with the cities of Khuzistan where kings and dignitaries used it in private conversation and during leisure time, in the bath houses for instance.<ref>(Mehdi Marashi, Mohammad Ali Jazayery, ''Persian Studies in North America: Studies in Honor of Mohammad Ali Jazayery'', Ibex Publishers, Inc, 1994. p 255)</ref>}}\n\nIbn Hawqal mentions that some areas of Armenia are controlled by Muslims and others by Christians.<ref>Ibn Howqal,Surat al-ardh.

The few researches undertaken (Planhol, 1960) demonstrate the indisputable predominance of Iranian tradition in agricultural techniques (irrigation, rotation systems, terraced cultivation) and in several settlement traits (winter troglodytism of people and livestock, evident in the widespread underground stables). The large villages of Iranian peasants in the irrigated valleys have worked as points for crystallization of the newcomers even in the course of linguistic transformation; these places have preserved their sites and transmitted their knowledge. The toponymy, with more than half of the place names of Iranian origin in some areas, such as the Sahand, a huge volcanic massif south of Tabriz, or the Qara Dagh, near the border (Planhol, 1966, p. 305; Bazin, 1982, p. 28) bears witness to this continuity. The language itself provides eloquent proof. Azeri, not unlike Uzbek (see above), lost the vocal harmony typical of Turkish languages.

[[Tadeusz Swietochowski]] states: \"According to the most widely accepted etymology, the name \"Azerbaijan\" is derived from Atropates, the name of a Persian satrap of the late fourth century b.c. Another theory traces the origin of the name to the Persian word azar (\"fire\"') - hence Azerbaijan, \"the Land of Fire\", because of Zoroastrian temples, with their fires fueled by plentiful supplies of oil.\nAzerbaijan maintained its national character after its conquest by the Arabs in the mid-seventh century a.d. and its subsequent conversion to Islam. At this time it became a province in the early Muslim empire. Only in the 11th century, when Oghuz Turkic tribes under the Seljuk dynasty entered the country, did Azerbaijan acquire a significant number of Turkic inhabitants. The original Persian population became fused with the Turks, and gradually the Persian language was supplanted by a Turkic dialect that evolved into the distinct [[Azeri language|Azerbaijani language]].

Other genetic analysis of [[mtDNA]] and [[Y-chromosome]]s indicates that Caucasian populations are genetically intermediate between Europeans and Near Easterners, but that they are more closely related to Near Easterners overall.
