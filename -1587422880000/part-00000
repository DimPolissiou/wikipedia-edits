The battle was fought at the same time as the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] (21 May) German units were held ready to resist a resumption of the attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of XIX Corps, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of the XIX Corps was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, by when the Allied troops at Boulogne had been reinforced from England by most of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]].\n\nThe Guards had time to dig in around the port before the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]], which had been delayed by French troops at [[Samer]], then attacked the perimeter held by the Irish Guards at around {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and were driven off after an hour. The Welsh Guards front was attacked at {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} and again at dusk before cutting off a party of the Irish Guards at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} The defence of Boulogne was assisted by about eighty light bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and at dawn on 23 May, the German attacks resumed, eventually pushing the defenders back into the town.\n\nRoyal Navy ships shot their way into and out of the harbour and with French navy destroyers, bombarded German positions as wounded and non-combatants were embarked and landed a navy demolition party. During a lull in the afternoon, a ''Luftwaffe'' force bombed the harbour, despite being intercepted by RAF fighters and at {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} the Guards Brigade was ordered to re-embark. The navy destroyers ran the gauntlet of German tanks and artillery to evacuate the garrison. The French defenders around the Citadel above the lower town could not be contacted and only in the morning of 24 May did General Lanquetot realise that the British had gone, which led to reproaches.\n\nThe French and remaining British troops held out until 25 May and then surrendered. Guderian wrote that the delays in allowing an advance and then the retention of considerable forces to guard against Allied counter-attacks, had forfeited an opportunity quickly to capture the [[Channel Ports]] and destroy the Allied forces in northern France and Belgium. An advance on Dunkirk began on 23 May but the next day was halted until 27 May and Dunkirk was not captured until 4 June, by when most of the BEF and many French and Belgian troops had escaped.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Boulogne===\n\n{{main|Boulogne-sur-Mer}}\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the ''C\u00f4te d'Opale''}}]]\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], are [[Channel Ports]] on the French side at the narrowest part of the English Channel. Boulogne is at the mouth of the [[Liane (river)|Liane]] river, which meanders through a valley between hills. The harbour is on a level area of ground on either side of the river, well built-up and with steep roads uphill to the old town (''Haute Ville'' or the Citadel). The rolling hills make for hidden approaches to the port and offer commanding high ground to an attacker, particularly Mont St. Lambert ridge.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use, once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Boulogne was used for communication and for troop movements.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Bond|Taylor|2001|p=130}}\n\n===Battle of France===\n\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began ''[[Manstein Plan|Fall Gelb]]'' (Case Yellow) the offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, the panzers achieved a breakthrough against the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley. As the BEF withdrew through Belgium into northern France, fewer supply troops were needed as the lines of communication shortened. The British began to withdraw surplus manpower through Boulogne and Calais and on 17 May, General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the Adjutant-General of the BEF, moved the Rear General Headquarters (GHQ) from [[Arras]] to Boulogne, without informing his French liaison officers.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}{{efn|Relations among Franco-British commanders had been good until the German breakthrough on the Meuse, after which the British staff officers became apprehensive that they might be cut off from the coast, began slighting the liaison officers and withheld information. The French liaison party left Boulogne after a ''Luftwaffe'' air raid on the night of {{nowrap|19/20 May}} and reached Abbeville just before the Germans.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}}} The Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]] on 21 May, cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium from their bases south of the river.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}}\n\nThe defence of Boulogne was the responsibility of the [[French Navy]], which manned some 19th-century forts under the command of Commandant Dutfoy de Mont de Benque. To protect Boulogne from air attack, eight [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch anti-aircraft]] guns of the 2nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, eight machine-guns of the 58th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and a battery of the 2nd Searchlight Regiment had arrived from England on 20 May; the French had two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns, two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns and two tanks, one of which was unserviceable.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153, 385}} On 20 May, the leading elements of the German [[XIX Army Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]], (General [[Heinz Guderian]]), reached Abbeville. The importance of holding the Channel Ports as the only means of supply and if necessary, evacuation, became vital for the Allies.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=53}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}} Early in the morning of 21 May, Dutfoy ordered the naval garrison of {{nowrap|1,100 men}} to retire behind the medieval walls of the ''Haute Ville'' (Old Town or Citadel), east of the Liane river.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}}\n\nAfter hearing alarmist reports of the approach of a large German force, apparently from General Jean Pelissier de F\u00e9ligonde, who had commanded a unit attacked by German tanks at Hesdin, {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east of the port. Dutfoy ordered his men to disable the [[Coastal artillery]] in the forts and to head for the harbour for evacuation. Dutfoy left for Dunkirk and discipline broke down, looting took place and civilians waiting for places on evacuation ships began to panic, until the commander in charge of the sea front threatened people with a gun. The commander decamped at {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} and the [[Touch hole|spiking]] of the naval guns continued, until the order was questioned and Admiral Leclerc in Dunkirk was contacted, who ordered the remaining guns to be preserved for the defence of the town and then visited Boulogne early on 22 May. Leclerc ordered the sailors to fight it out and wait for relief by the French and British armies. Admiral [[Jean-Marie Charles Abrial|Jean Abrial]] at Dunkirk ordered\n\n{{quote|You are to die at your posts one by one rather than give in.|Admiral Abrial{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013191}}}}\n\nand a reorganisation began; at {{nowrap|6:30 a.m.}} on 22 May, the first British troops arrived from England.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013192}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied defensive preparations===\n\n{{see also|Siege of Calais (1940)#Siege of Calais|l1=Siege of Calais}}\n\n[[File:Map commune FR insee code 62160.png|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Boulogne and vicinity (commune FR insee code 62160)}}]]\nIn response to General Brownrigg's requests for reinforcements, a detachment of [[Royal Marines]] arrived in Boulogne in the early morning of 21 May.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Meanwhile, part of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]] under the command of [[Brigadier]] [[William Fox-Pitt (British Army)|William Fox-Pitt]], consisting of the 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]] and 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]], were training at [[Camberley]] on 21 May, when they were ordered to embark for France. Together with the Brigade Anti-Tank Company and a battery of 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]], they arrived in Boulogne on the morning of 22 May, aboard three merchant ships and the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Vimy|HMS ''Vimy'']], having been escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Whitshed|D77|6}} and {{HMS|Vimiera|1917|6}}. The French [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General [[Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot]]) was to hold a line between [[Samer]] and [[Desvres]], about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the town, where three battalions had already arrived. Further British reinforcements, including a regiment of [[cruiser tank]]s, were expected from Calais on the following day.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=154}}\n\nFox-Pitt deployed his men on the high ground outside the town, liaising with General Lanquetot who organised the French troops in the town. The Irish Guards held the right flank to the south-west from the river at St. L\u00e9onard to the sea at Le Portel and the Welsh Guards held the left flank north-east of the river, on the west slopes of Mont Lambert ridge and high ground through St. Martin Boulogne, which made a defensive perimeter of {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Some road blocks had already been established by a party of about fifty men of the 7th [[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment|Royal West Kents]] from [[Albert, Somme|Albert]], about 100 men of the 262nd Field Company [[Royal Engineers]] and anti-aircraft personnel held the right of the Welsh Guards, along the roads approaching from the south.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} Fox-Pitt had left a gap in the perimeter between the Welsh Guards' left flank and the coast, allocated to the reinforcements which were expected from Calais.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}} There were 1,500 men of No 5 Group [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (AMPC) in the town awaiting evacuation, a mixture of recalled reservists and incompletely-trained troops working as labourers.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Under French command were the fort garrisons and some French and Belgian training units of limited military value.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\n===German offensive preparations===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-004-32, Heinz Guderian in Bouillon, Frankreich.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|{{centre|Guderian during the Battle of France}}]]\nThe Franco-British counter-attack at Arras led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the Channel Ports, rather than south over the Somme and late on 21 May, ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' (OKH) ordered ''Panzergruppe Kleist'' to advance about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} north, to capture Boulogne and Calais. Apprehension about another counter-attack led to the XV Corps (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) being held back, a division of the XXXXI Corps (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]) being moved eastwards and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]]) of XIX Corps was detached to guard against a counter-attack from the south. Parts of the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]]) and [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Rudolf Veiel]]) were also held back to defend bridgeheads over the Somme.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}} The 2nd Panzer Division was ordered to advance to Boulogne on a line from [[Baincthun]] to Samer, with the 1st Panzer Division as a flank guard on the right advancing to Desvres and [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] in case of a counter-attack from Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===22 May===\nThe 2nd Panzer Division was divided into two columns, one of which was to circle round the town and attack from the north. The other column made contact first in the early afternoon of 22 May, when it encountered the headquarters company of the French 48th Infantry Regiment, the only troops of the 21st Division who had arrived between the Germans and Boulogne. The small French force, including clerks, drivers and signallers, set up two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns and two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns to cover the cross-roads at [[Nesles]], where they delayed the Germans for almost two hours, until they were outflanked.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=192}} The same column arrived at the outskirts of Boulogne that evening and began shelling and probing the Irish Guards positions in the south of the town. The Irish Guards knocked out the leading German tank and beat off subsequent attacks despite the Germans overrunning one of their forward platoons. In the early hours of the morning, the Germans attacked the Welsh Guards positions along the coast from the north-east as they began to envelop the town but were driven back by the Guardsmen on each occasion.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} General Brownrigg, who was Fox-Pitt's only communication link with England, departed with his headquarters staff at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} on the destroyer [[HMS Verity|HMS ''Verity'']], without informing the Guards. At {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} Fox-Pitt was told that the French 21st Division had fallen back from its blocking position after being attacked by tanks. Parts of the division, en route by train, were machine-gunned by German tanks and dispersed.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n===23 May===\n[[File:HMS Venomous WWI IWM P 1975.jpg|thumb|{{centre|HMS ''Venomous'', one of the World War I vintage British destroyers used in the evacuation}}]]\nAn hour after dawn, [[Fort de la Cr\u00e8che]] near Wimereux, north of Boulogne, was captured by German troops. The appearance of German armour at the northern perimeter confirmed to Fox-Pitt that there would be no reinforcements from Calais. This meant that Fox-Pitt would have to defend the port with only the two Guards battalions and the assorted French and British troops already in Boulogne.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} Therefore, a force of 800 was hastily selected from those AMPC troops with previous military experience and armed with rifles taken from the others, they were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions, and a further 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards. Meanwhile, the anti-aircraft gunners guarding the southern approach roads destroyed two German tanks with their 3.7-inch guns AA before retiring.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}}\n\nThe Germans launched a pincer attack on the positions of the Welsh and Irish Guards. By {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.,}} the attack from the south, backed up by artillery and air support, made the open slopes around the town untenable and forced the Guards back into the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} At midday, ''Vimy'' arrived, carrying a naval demolition party and Force Buttercup, a [[Royal Marine]] shore party, began to embark the wounded and the AMPC. Orders were passed on from ''Vimy'' to Fox-Pitt that the Guards were to hold Boulogne at all costs, as his radio contact with England had been lost earlier in the day.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} The Royal Navy destroyers also provided the only fire support to the troops resisting the German advance on the outskirts of the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}}\n\nDuring the afternoon there was a lull, followed by a raid by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} which was intercepted by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Spitfire]]s from [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|92 Squadron]]. The commanders of both British destroyers were killed by bomb splinters and Ju 87 {{lang|de|[[Stuka]]]] dive bombers hit {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}} which was disabled; {{ship|French destroyer|Orage||2}} had to be [[Scuttling|scuttled]] as they bombarded German shore positions.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} Shortly before the air raid, the destroyer {{HMS|Keith|1930|6}} had berthed in the harbour and begun embarking AMPC troops. By {{nowrap|3:00 p.m.,}} Fox-Pitt withdrew the brigade to new positions in the town and moved his headquarters to a position by the quay better to contact the destroyers, his only means of communicating with London. With direct German fire sweeping the docks, he sent a message to London saying \"situation grave\".{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} Shortly before {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.,}} ''Keith'' had received orders for an immediate evacuation of the British force and that five more destroyers were either standing off Boulogne, giving gunfire support or were ''en route''. Fox-Pitt decided to continue with the AMPC evacuation, while the Guards conducted a fighting withdrawal to the harbour. Due to a lack of radios, the forward British troops had to be reached by dispatch rider. The bridges held by the Guards were demolished by the Royal Engineers before the Irish Guards barricaded the streets with vehicles and withdrew to the harbour.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} ''Vimiera'' and ''Whitshed'' replaced ''Vimy'' and ''Keith'', embarking most of the Marines, Irish and Welsh Guards.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne gare maritime bateau cpa.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A pre-war photograph of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} at Boulogne, showing the quay used by British destroyers during the evacuation}}]]\n{{HMS|Venomous|D75|6}} and {{HMS|Wild Swan|D62|6}} arrived and began embarking Force Buttercup and the remainder of the Irish Guards. The Germans had taken up positions overlooking the harbour and engaged the Guards and the ships, which used their guns to counter the German fire. German tanks advanced towards the quayside but were knocked out by the [[4.7 inch gun]]s of ''Venomous'', one tank turning \"over and over, like a child doing a cart-wheel\".{{sfn|Hawkins|2003|p=70}} German [[field gun]]s bombarded the harbour and as {{HMS|Venetia}} moved through the narrow entrance channel, it was hit several times and set on fire but managed to reverse out and make way for ''Venomous'' and ''Wild Swan'' which also backed out, ''Venomous'' steering with its engines as the rudder had jammed.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n===24\u201325 May===\n{{HMS|Windsor|D42|6}} arrived after dark and was able to continue the embarkation.

During the night, about {{nowrap|100 French}} soldiers tried to break out towards Dunkirk but failed.

Communication between Fox-Pitt and the French headquarters at the Citadel had been cut off by the advance of German troops between the Citadel and the Guards positions in the lower town. When he was ordered to evacuate he could not offer to take the French, according to the orders. On the morning of 24 May, Lanquetot discovered that the British had gone and French complaints about British \"desertion\" at Boulogne, along with the belief that the Germans at Calais would immediately move towards Dunkirk if the siege ended, may have influenced [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] to order the British garrison to fight to the finish.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=198}}{{efn|In ''Their Finest Hour'' (1949), Churchill wrote that he \"regretted the evacuation\" of Boulogne.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=70, 72}}}}\n\nIn the army volume of the British official history (1954), [[Lionel Ellis]] wrote that the five-hour delay of the XIX Corps attack on Boulogne until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, which had been ordered by General [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]], commander of {{lang|de|Panzergruppe von Kleist}}, had been criticised in the Corps war diary. The retention of the 10th Panzer Division in reserve during the attacks on Boulogne and Calais, meant that the Aa Canal could not be attacked simultaneously. Had the panzers not been delayed, the preparations of the 20th Guards Brigade might have been interrupted. The long, exposed flank of [[Army Group A]], the uncertain hold on Amiens and Abbeville and the Allied possession of Arras, meant that the situation on 22 May could have changed and the delay was not excessive, since the Allied counter-attack at Arras could have continued.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=159}} In the corresponding naval history volume [[Stephen Roskill]], the Navy official historian, wrote (also in 1954), that the defence of Boulogne delayed the advance of the XIX Corps towards Dunkirk (\"undoubtedly contributed to that end\"), which assisted the Allied defence during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] {{nowrap|(26 May\u20134 June).}}{{sfn|Roskill|1954|p=213}} The Welsh and Irish Guards were awarded the [[battle honour]] \"Boulogne 1940\".{{sfn|Baker|1986|p=146}}\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===XIX Corps===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* {{lang|de|[[Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} (General of Cavalry [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist]], Chief of Staff Brigadier-General [[Kurt Zeitzler]])\n** [[XIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]] (General of Cavalry [[Heinz Guderian]])\n*** [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]])\n*** [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Rudolf Veiel]])\n*** [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]])\n** [[XXXXI Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXXI Corps]] (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]])\n*** [[6th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Panzer Division]] (Brigadier-General [[Werner Kempf]])\n*** [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]] (Colonel [[Erich Brandenberger]])\n\n===Boulogne garrison===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot)\n** Headquarters company, 48th Infantry Regiment\n* French and Belgian training units\n* [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade Group]] (Brigadier William Fox-Pitt)\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]]\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]]\n** 20th Guards Brigade Anti-Tank Company\n** 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]] (one battery)\n* 1,500 men [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (untrained)\n* Force Buttercup (Royal Marine demolition party)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|World War II}}\n* [[Boulogne Bowl]], a commemorative silver trophy in recognition of the role of the Pioneer Corps in the 1940 Battle of Boulogne\n* [[Operation Wellhit]], the Canadian liberation of Boulogne in 1944\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n===Books===\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Baker|1986}}\n|last=Baker |first=A. |year=1986 |title=Battle Honours of the British and Commonwealth Armies |publisher=Ian Allan |location=London |isbn=978-0-71101-600-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bond|Taylor|2001}}\n|title=The Battle for France & Flanders Sixty Years On |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=B. |editor1-link=Brian Bond |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=M.

The battle was fought at the same time as the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] (21 May) German units were held ready to resist a resumption of the attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of XIX Corps, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of the XIX Corps was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, by when the Allied troops at Boulogne had been reinforced from England by most of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]].\n\nThe Guards had time to dig in around the port before the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]], which had been delayed by French troops at [[Samer]], then attacked the perimeter held by the Irish Guards at around {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and were driven off after an hour. The Welsh Guards front was attacked at {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} and again at dusk before cutting off a party of the Irish Guards at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} The defence of Boulogne was assisted by about eighty light bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and at dawn on 23 May, the German attacks resumed, eventually pushing the defenders back into the town.\n\nRoyal Navy ships shot their way into and out of the harbour and with French navy destroyers, bombarded German positions as wounded and non-combatants were embarked and landed a navy demolition party. During a lull in the afternoon, a ''Luftwaffe'' force bombed the harbour, despite being intercepted by RAF fighters and at {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} the Guards Brigade was ordered to re-embark. The navy destroyers ran the gauntlet of German tanks and artillery to evacuate the garrison. The French defenders around the Citadel above the lower town could not be contacted and only in the morning of 24 May did General Lanquetot realise that the British had gone, which led to reproaches.\n\nThe French and remaining British troops held out until 25 May and then surrendered. Guderian wrote that the delays in allowing an advance and then the retention of considerable forces to guard against Allied counter-attacks, had forfeited an opportunity quickly to capture the [[Channel Ports]] and destroy the Allied forces in northern France and Belgium. An advance on Dunkirk began on 23 May but the next day was halted until 27 May and Dunkirk was not captured until 4 June, by when most of the BEF and many French and Belgian troops had escaped.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Boulogne===\n\n{{main|Boulogne-sur-Mer}}\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the ''C\u00f4te d'Opale''}}]]\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], are [[Channel Ports]] on the French side at the narrowest part of the English Channel. Boulogne is at the mouth of the [[Liane (river)|Liane]] river, which meanders through a valley between hills. The harbour is on a level area of ground on either side of the river, well built-up and with steep roads uphill to the old town (''Haute Ville'' or the Citadel). The rolling hills make for hidden approaches to the port and offer commanding high ground to an attacker, particularly Mont St. Lambert ridge.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use, once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Boulogne was used for communication and for troop movements.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Bond|Taylor|2001|p=130}}\n\n===Battle of France===\n\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began ''[[Manstein Plan|Fall Gelb]]'' (Case Yellow) the offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, the panzers achieved a breakthrough against the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley. As the BEF withdrew through Belgium into northern France, fewer supply troops were needed as the lines of communication shortened. The British began to withdraw surplus manpower through Boulogne and Calais and on 17 May, General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the Adjutant-General of the BEF, moved the Rear General Headquarters (GHQ) from [[Arras]] to Boulogne, without informing his French liaison officers.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}{{efn|Relations among Franco-British commanders had been good until the German breakthrough on the Meuse, after which the British staff officers became apprehensive that they might be cut off from the coast, began slighting the liaison officers and withheld information.

To protect Boulogne from air attack, eight [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch anti-aircraft]] guns of the 2nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, eight machine-guns of the 58th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and a battery of the 2nd Searchlight Regiment had arrived from England on 20 May; the French had two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns, two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns and two tanks, one of which was unserviceable.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153, 385}} On 20 May, the leading elements of the German [[XIX Army Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]], (General [[Heinz Guderian]]), reached Abbeville.

Together with the Brigade Anti-Tank Company and a battery of 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]], they arrived in Boulogne on the morning of 22 May, aboard three merchant ships and the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Vimy|HMS ''Vimy'']], having been escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Whitshed|D77|6}} and {{HMS|Vimiera|1917|6}}. The French [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General [[Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot]]) was to hold a line between [[Samer]] and [[Desvres]], about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the town, where three battalions had already arrived. Further British reinforcements, including a regiment of [[cruiser tank]]s, were expected from Calais on the following day.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=154}}\n\nFox-Pitt deployed his men on the high ground outside the town, liaising with General Lanquetot who organised the French troops in the town. The Irish Guards held the right flank to the south-west from the river at St. L\u00e9onard to the sea at Le Portel and the Welsh Guards held the left flank north-east of the river, on the west slopes of Mont Lambert ridge and high ground through St. Martin Boulogne, which made a defensive perimeter of {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Some road blocks had already been established by a party of about fifty men of the 7th [[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment|Royal West Kents]] from [[Albert, Somme|Albert]], about 100 men of the 262nd Field Company [[Royal Engineers]] and anti-aircraft personnel held the right of the Welsh Guards, along the roads approaching from the south.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} Fox-Pitt had left a gap in the perimeter between the Welsh Guards' left flank and the coast, allocated to the reinforcements which were expected from Calais.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}} There were 1,500 men of No 5 Group [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (AMPC) in the town awaiting evacuation, a mixture of recalled reservists and incompletely-trained troops working as labourers.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Under French command were the fort garrisons and some French and Belgian training units of limited military value.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\n===German offensive preparations===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-004-32, Heinz Guderian in Bouillon, Frankreich.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|{{centre|Guderian during the Battle of France}}]]\nThe Franco-British counter-attack at Arras led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the Channel Ports, rather than south over the Somme and late on 21 May, ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' (OKH) ordered ''Panzergruppe Kleist'' to advance about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} north, to capture Boulogne and Calais. Apprehension about another counter-attack led to the XV Corps (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) being held back, a division of the XXXXI Corps (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]) being moved eastwards and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]]) of XIX Corps was detached to guard against a counter-attack from the south. Parts of the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]]) and [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Rudolf Veiel]]) were also held back to defend bridgeheads over the Somme.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}} The 2nd Panzer Division was ordered to advance to Boulogne on a line from [[Baincthun]] to Samer, with the 1st Panzer Division as a flank guard on the right advancing to Desvres and [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] in case of a counter-attack from Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===22 May===\nThe 2nd Panzer Division was divided into two columns, one of which was to circle round the town and attack from the north. The other column made contact first in the early afternoon of 22 May, when it encountered the headquarters company of the French 48th Infantry Regiment, the only troops of the 21st Division who had arrived between the Germans and Boulogne. The small French force, including clerks, drivers and signallers, set up two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns and two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns to cover the cross-roads at [[Nesles]], where they delayed the Germans for almost two hours, until they were outflanked.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=192}} The same column arrived at the outskirts of Boulogne that evening and began shelling and probing the Irish Guards positions in the south of the town. The Irish Guards knocked out the leading German tank and beat off subsequent attacks despite the Germans overrunning one of their forward platoons. In the early hours of the morning, the Germans attacked the Welsh Guards positions along the coast from the north-east as they began to envelop the town but were driven back by the Guardsmen on each occasion.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} General Brownrigg, who was Fox-Pitt's only communication link with England, departed with his headquarters staff at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} on the destroyer [[HMS Verity|HMS ''Verity'']], without informing the Guards. At {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} Fox-Pitt was told that the French 21st Division had fallen back from its blocking position after being attacked by tanks. Parts of the division, en route by train, were machine-gunned by German tanks and dispersed.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n===23 May===\n[[File:HMS Venomous WWI IWM P 1975.jpg|thumb|{{centre|HMS ''Venomous'', one of the World War I vintage British destroyers used in the evacuation}}]]\nAn hour after dawn, [[Fort de la Cr\u00e8che]] near Wimereux, north of Boulogne, was captured by German troops. The appearance of German armour at the northern perimeter confirmed to Fox-Pitt that there would be no reinforcements from Calais. This meant that Fox-Pitt would have to defend the port with only the two Guards battalions and the assorted French and British troops already in Boulogne.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} Therefore, a force of 800 was hastily selected from those AMPC troops with previous military experience and armed with rifles taken from the others, they were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions, and a further 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards. Meanwhile, the anti-aircraft gunners guarding the southern approach roads destroyed two German tanks with their 3.7-inch guns AA before retiring.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}}\n\nThe Germans launched a pincer attack on the positions of the Welsh and Irish Guards. By {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.,}} the attack from the south, backed up by artillery and air support, made the open slopes around the town untenable and forced the Guards back into the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} At midday, ''Vimy'' arrived, carrying a naval demolition party and Force Buttercup, a [[Royal Marine]] shore party, began to embark the wounded and the AMPC. Orders were passed on from ''Vimy'' to Fox-Pitt that the Guards were to hold Boulogne at all costs, as his radio contact with England had been lost earlier in the day.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} The Royal Navy destroyers also provided the only fire support to the troops resisting the German advance on the outskirts of the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}}\n\nDuring the afternoon there was a lull, followed by a raid by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} which was intercepted by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Spitfire]]s from [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|92 Squadron]]. The commanders of both British destroyers were killed by bomb splinters and Ju 87 {{lang|de|[[Stuka]]]] dive bombers hit {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}} which was disabled; {{ship|French destroyer|Orage||2}} had to be [[Scuttling|scuttled]] as they bombarded German shore positions.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} Shortly before the air raid, the destroyer {{HMS|Keith|1930|6}} had berthed in the harbour and begun embarking AMPC troops. By {{nowrap|3:00 p.m.,}} Fox-Pitt withdrew the brigade to new positions in the town and moved his headquarters to a position by the quay better to contact the destroyers, his only means of communicating with London. With direct German fire sweeping the docks, he sent a message to London saying \"situation grave\".{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} Shortly before {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.,}} ''Keith'' had received orders for an immediate evacuation of the British force and that five more destroyers were either standing off Boulogne, giving gunfire support or were ''en route''. Fox-Pitt decided to continue with the AMPC evacuation, while the Guards conducted a fighting withdrawal to the harbour. Due to a lack of radios, the forward British troops had to be reached by dispatch rider. The bridges held by the Guards were demolished by the Royal Engineers before the Irish Guards barricaded the streets with vehicles and withdrew to the harbour.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} ''Vimiera'' and ''Whitshed'' replaced ''Vimy'' and ''Keith'', embarking most of the Marines, Irish and Welsh Guards.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne gare maritime bateau cpa.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A pre-war photograph of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} at Boulogne, showing the quay used by British destroyers during the evacuation}}]]\n{{HMS|Venomous|D75|6}} and {{HMS|Wild Swan|D62|6}} arrived and began embarking Force Buttercup and the remainder of the Irish Guards. The Germans had taken up positions overlooking the harbour and engaged the Guards and the ships, which used their guns to counter the German fire.

During the night, about {{nowrap|100 French}} soldiers tried to break out towards Dunkirk but failed. At dawn on 25 May, the Germans assaulted the walls again using ladders, grenades and [[flamethrower]]s, supported by [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88 mm guns]] and at {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.,}} Lanquetot surrendered.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}}\n\nMajor J.

Communication between Fox-Pitt and the French headquarters at the Citadel had been cut off by the advance of German troops between the Citadel and the Guards positions in the lower town. When he was ordered to evacuate he could not offer to take the French, according to the orders. On the morning of 24 May, Lanquetot discovered that the British had gone and French complaints about British \"desertion\" at Boulogne, along with the belief that the Germans at Calais would immediately move towards Dunkirk if the siege ended, may have influenced [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] to order the British garrison to fight to the finish.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=198}}{{efn|In ''Their Finest Hour'' (1949), Churchill wrote that he \"regretted the evacuation\" of Boulogne.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=70, 72}}}}\n\nIn the army volume of the British official history (1954), [[Lionel Ellis]] wrote that the five-hour delay of the XIX Corps attack on Boulogne until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, which had been ordered by General [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]], commander of {{lang|de|Panzergruppe von Kleist}}, had been criticised in the Corps war diary. The retention of the 10th Panzer Division in reserve during the attacks on Boulogne and Calais, meant that the Aa Canal could not be attacked simultaneously. Had the panzers not been delayed, the preparations of the 20th Guards Brigade might have been interrupted. The long, exposed flank of [[Army Group A]], the uncertain hold on Amiens and Abbeville and the Allied possession of Arras, meant that the situation on 22 May could have changed and the delay was not excessive, since the Allied counter-attack at Arras could have continued.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=159}} In the corresponding naval history volume [[Stephen Roskill]], the Navy official historian, wrote (also in 1954), that the defence of Boulogne delayed the advance of the XIX Corps towards Dunkirk (\"undoubtedly contributed to that end\"), which assisted the Allied defence during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] {{nowrap|(26 May\u20134 June).}}{{sfn|Roskill|1954|p=213}} The Welsh and Irish Guards were awarded the [[battle honour]] \"Boulogne 1940\".{{sfn|Baker|1986|p=146}}\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===XIX Corps===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* {{lang|de|[[Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} (General of Cavalry [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist]], Chief of Staff Brigadier-General [[Kurt Zeitzler]])\n** [[XIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]] (General of Cavalry [[Heinz Guderian]])\n*** [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]])\n*** [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Rudolf Veiel]])\n*** [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]])\n** [[XXXXI Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXXI Corps]] (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]])\n*** [[6th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Panzer Division]] (Brigadier-General [[Werner Kempf]])\n*** [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]] (Colonel [[Erich Brandenberger]])\n\n===Boulogne garrison===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot)\n** Headquarters company, 48th Infantry Regiment\n* French and Belgian training units\n* [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade Group]] (Brigadier William Fox-Pitt)\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]]\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]]\n** 20th Guards Brigade Anti-Tank Company\n** 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]] (one battery)\n* 1,500 men [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (untrained)\n* Force Buttercup (Royal Marine demolition party)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|World War II}}\n* [[Boulogne Bowl]], a commemorative silver trophy in recognition of the role of the Pioneer Corps in the 1940 Battle of Boulogne\n* [[Operation Wellhit]], the Canadian liberation of Boulogne in 1944\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n===Books===\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Baker|1986}}\n|last=Baker |first=A. |year=1986 |title=Battle Honours of the British and Commonwealth Armies |publisher=Ian Allan |location=London |isbn=978-0-71101-600-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bond|Taylor|2001}}\n|title=The Battle for France & Flanders Sixty Years On |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=B. |editor1-link=Brian Bond |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=M.

{"title_page": "Laser construction", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}\n[[File:Lasercons.svg|frame|300px|right|Schematic diagram of a typical laser, showing the three major parts]]\n\nA '''laser is constructed''' from three principal parts: DanySanYT\n\n*An energy source (usually referred to as the ''[[Laser pumping|pump]]'' or ''pump source''),\n*A ''gain medium'' or ''[[Active laser medium|laser medium]]'', and\n*Two or more mirrors that form an ''[[optical resonator]]''.\n\n==Pump source==\nThe ''pump source'' is the part that provides energy to the [[laser]] system.  Examples of pump sources include electrical discharges, flashlamps, arc lamps, light from another laser, chemical reactions and even explosive devices.  The type of pump source used principally depends on the ''gain medium'', and this also determines how the energy is transmitted to the medium.  A [[helium\u2013neon laser|helium\u2013neon (HeNe) laser]] uses an electrical discharge in the helium-neon gas mixture, a Nd:YAG laser uses either light focused from a [[xenon flash lamp]] or [[Laser diode|diode lasers]], and excimer lasers use a chemical reaction.\n\n==Gain medium / Laser medium==\nThe ''gain medium'' is the major determining factor of the wavelength of operation, and other properties, of the laser. ''Gain media'' in different materials have linear spectra or wide spectra. ''Gain media'' with  wide spectra allow tuning of the laser frequency. There are hundreds if not thousands of different gain media in which laser operation has been achieved (see [[list of laser types]] for a list of the most important ones).  The gain medium is excited by the pump source to produce a [[population inversion]], and it is in the gain medium where spontaneous and [[stimulated emission]] of photons takes place, leading to the phenomenon of optical gain, or amplification.\n\nExamples of different gain media include:\n*Liquids, such as dye lasers. These are usually [[organic chemistry|organic]] chemical [[solvents]], such as [[methanol]], [[ethanol]] or [[ethylene glycol]], to which are added chemical dyes such as [[coumarin]], [[rhodamine]], and [[fluorescein]]. The exact chemical configuration of the dye molecules determines the operation wavelength of the [[dye laser]].\n*Gases, such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[argon]], [[krypton]] and mixtures such as [[helium]]&ndash;[[neon]]. These lasers are often pumped by electrical discharge.\n*Solids, such as [[crystal]]s and [[glass]]es. The solid ''host'' materials are usually doped with an impurity such as [[chromium]], [[neodymium]], [[erbium]] or [[titanium]] [[ion]]s. Typical hosts include [[YAG]] ([[yttrium]] [[aluminium]] [[garnet]]), YLF (yttrium [[lithium]] [[fluorine|fluoride]]), [[sapphire]] (aluminium oxide) and various glasses. Examples of solid-state laser media include Nd:YAG, [[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:sapphire]], Cr:sapphire (usually known as [[ruby]]), Cr:LiSAF (chromium-doped lithium [[strontium]] aluminium fluoride), Er:YLF, Nd:glass, and Er:glass. Solid-state lasers are usually pumped by flashlamps or light from another laser.\n*[[Semiconductor]]s, a type of solid, crystal with uniform dopant distribution or material with differing dopant levels  in which the movement of [[electron]]s  can cause laser action. Semiconductor lasers are typically very small, and can be pumped with a simple electric current, enabling them to be used in consumer devices such as [[compact disc]] players. See [[laser diode]].\n\n==Optical resonator==\n[[File:Gaussian beam burn comparison.png|thumb|300px|right|The [[Gaussian beam]] photographic paper burn comparison of a carbon dioxide [[transversely-excited atmospheric-pressure laser]], obtained during the optimization process by adjusting the alignment mirrors.]]\nThe ''optical resonator'', or ''[[optical cavity]]'', in its simplest form is two parallel mirrors placed around the gain medium, which provide [[feedback]] of the light. The mirrors are given [[optical coating]]s which determine their reflective properties. Typically, one will be a [[Optical coating#High-reflection coatings|high reflector]], and the other will be a [[partial reflector]]. The latter is called the [[output coupler]], because it allows some of the light to leave the cavity to produce the laser's output beam.\n\nLight from the medium, produced by [[spontaneous emission]], is reflected by the mirrors back into the medium, where it may be amplified by [[stimulated emission]]. The light may reflect from the mirrors and thus pass through the gain medium many hundreds of times before exiting the cavity. In more complex lasers, configurations with four or more mirrors forming the cavity are used. The design and alignment of the mirrors with respect to the medium is crucial for determining the exact operating wavelength and other attributes of the laser system.\n\nOther optical devices, such as spinning mirrors, modulators, filters, and absorbers, may be placed within the optical resonator to produce a variety of effects on the laser output, such as altering the wavelength of operation or the production of pulses of laser light.\n\nSome lasers do not use an optical cavity, but instead rely on very high optical gain to produce significant [[amplified spontaneous emission]] (ASE) without needing feedback of the light back into the gain medium. Such lasers are said to be [[superluminescence|superluminescent]], and emit light with low [[coherence (physics)|coherence]] but high [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. Since they do not use optical feedback, these devices are often not categorized as lasers.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Injection seeder]]\n*[[Mode locking]]\n*[[Q-switching]]\n*[[List of laser articles]]\n\n==References==\n*Koechner, Walter (1992).

Examples of solid-state laser media include Nd:YAG, [[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:sapphire]], Cr:sapphire (usually known as [[ruby]]), Cr:LiSAF (chromium-doped lithium [[strontium]] aluminium fluoride), Er:YLF, Nd:glass, and Er:glass. Solid-state lasers are usually pumped by flashlamps or light from another laser.\n*[[Semiconductor]]s, a type of solid, crystal with uniform dopant distribution or material with differing dopant levels  in which the movement of [[electron]]s  can cause laser action. Semiconductor lasers are typically very small, and can be pumped with a simple electric current, enabling them to be used in consumer devices such as [[compact disc]] players. See [[laser diode]].\n\n==Optical resonator==\n[[File:Gaussian beam burn comparison.png|thumb|300px|right|The [[Gaussian beam]] photographic paper burn comparison of a carbon dioxide [[transversely-excited atmospheric-pressure laser]], obtained during the optimization process by adjusting the alignment mirrors.]]\nThe ''optical resonator'', or ''[[optical cavity]]'', in its simplest form is two parallel mirrors placed around the gain medium, which provide [[feedback]] of the light. The mirrors are given [[optical coating]]s which determine their reflective properties. Typically, one will be a [[Optical coating#High-reflection coatings|high reflector]], and the other will be a [[partial reflector]]. The latter is called the [[output coupler]], because it allows some of the light to leave the cavity to produce the laser's output beam.\n\nLight from the medium, produced by [[spontaneous emission]], is reflected by the mirrors back into the medium, where it may be amplified by [[stimulated emission]]. The light may reflect from the mirrors and thus pass through the gain medium many hundreds of times before exiting the cavity. In more complex lasers, configurations with four or more mirrors forming the cavity are used. The design and alignment of the mirrors with respect to the medium is crucial for determining the exact operating wavelength and other attributes of the laser system.\n\nOther optical devices, such as spinning mirrors, modulators, filters, and absorbers, may be placed within the optical resonator to produce a variety of effects on the laser output, such as altering the wavelength of operation or the production of pulses of laser light.\n\nSome lasers do not use an optical cavity, but instead rely on very high optical gain to produce significant [[amplified spontaneous emission]] (ASE) without needing feedback of the light back into the gain medium. Such lasers are said to be [[superluminescence|superluminescent]], and emit light with low [[coherence (physics)|coherence]] but high [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. Since they do not use optical feedback, these devices are often not categorized as lasers.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Injection seeder]]\n*[[Mode locking]]\n*[[Q-switching]]\n*[[List of laser articles]]\n\n==References==\n*Koechner, Walter (1992).

This entails discharging fresh water from the pond into a bay or ocean. This was an issue primarily because it was thought to disturbs the pond's ecosystem and lower the water table in the area. This addition of saltwater and anadromous species into the pond could be detrimental to the Pond's living ecosystem. However, in the Georgica Pond case, \"letting\" done in the late 1980s and 1990s relieved flooding and made the pond more ecologically sound. It was found that letting seemed to be an overall benefit to the pond's ecology. It was also found that letting made flooding less frequent and lessened the magnitude of the flood.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Drew|date=|title=Georgica Pond Water Management Issues|url=http://ir.stonybrook.edu/jspui/bitstream/11401/65063/1/BENNET00.pdf|journal=New York Conference of Geology of Long Island and Metropolitan New York|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nGeorgica Pond is where the famed [[Grey Gardens (estate)|Grey Gardens]] estate is located.\n\nA sandy area near the pond is a nesting ground for the [[piping plover]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.acthompson.net/Georgica.htm Georgica Pond Images (Alfred C Thompson III)]\n\n{{coord|40.938156|-72.229614|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:East Hampton (town), New York]]\n[[Category:Lagoons of New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Suffolk County, New York]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=December 2015}}\n'''Georgica Pond''' is a {{convert|290|acre|km2|adj=on}} coastal [[lagoon]] on the west border of [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton Village]] and [[Wainscott, New York|Wainscott]], and was the site of a [[Summer White House]] of [[Bill Clinton]] in 1998 and 1999.\n\nThe lagoon is separated by a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} sandbar and is managed by the East Hampton Trustees who monitor a cycle of draining the lagoon and replenishing it with [[Atlantic Ocean]] water.

The airline was officially renamed to ''Jugoslovenski Aerotransport'' (''JAT'') on 1 April 1947.\n\nIn 1949, Yugoslavia was faced with a dire international position: isolated both by the West and the East. This caused further rationing of fuel, difficulties in procuring spare parts and the cancellation of all flights to Eastern European destinations. JAT was forced to survive on six domestic lines. When Yugoslavia turned to the West, an agreement was made with [[Swissair]] to open the Belgrade-[[Z\u00fcrich]] route, which was inaugurated on 24 August 1949. Company stagnation marked operations in 1949, because the traffic volume was well below fleet potentials and transport needs in the country. However, 1954 was in many ways a turning point. [[Convair CV-340]] and [[Convair CV-440 Metropolitan]] aircraft were purchased for short-haul and medium-haul routes, after which the [[Douglas DC-3]] was used only on domestic routes. Multiple international and domestic routes were opened soon after. In 1957, six [[Ilyushin Il-14M]] aircraft were purchased. JAT purchased several [[Douglas DC-6B|Douglas DC-6Bs]] for long-haul routes in 1959.<ref name=\"jat\"/>\n\n===Jet age===\nIn 1963, the first [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] joined the JAT fleet. In 1969, the first [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32]] (of 16) arrived, followed in 1974 by the first two (of nine) [[Boeing 727-200]]s, followed by [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] in 1969 (of 16), [[Boeing 707]] in 1970, [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] in 1971 (of 7).<ref name=\"jatold\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/discussions/general_aviation/read.main/3463739/?searchid=3463739&s=jat#ID3463739|author=jatairways.com (old website \u2013 no longer available)|title=JAT: 80 Years}}</ref><ref name=\"flight1427\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Flight International]]|title=World Airlines Directory |date=28 May 1988|page=33|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1988/1988%20-%201427.html?search=justa}}</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nLong-haul routes to North America, Australia and the Far East were flown by [[Boeing 707]]s, introduced in 1970.\n\nIn 1975 Belgrade was connected with [[Karachi]], [[Singapore]] and [[Sydney]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book|title=Glory Days: Yugoslavia's National Airline Through Communism 1947\u20131987|isbn=9788691707101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiDYjyulVLwC|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> Same year three brand new [[Boeing 727|Boeing 727s]] were introduced.

The same year, Belgrade was connected with [[New York City]], [[Malta]], [[Baghdad]], [[Kuwait City]] and [[Damascus]]. All Caravelles were withdrawn from the fleet, while the line to Karachi was terminated. That year JAT had almost three million passengers.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nIn 1977, new routes to [[Madrid]] and [[Lyon]] were introduced.\n\nIn 1978, a wide-body [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30]] (which was chosen over the [[Boeing 747-200]]) was purchased to succeed the Boeing 707s on longer-haul routes, although the 707s remained in service into the 1980s on ad hoc charters and as scheduled-flight replacement aircraft. The purchase of a DC-10-30 was followed several years later by the purchase of a medium-range aircraft.<ref name=\"jatold\"/> The same year, a new route to Beijing was added.\n\nIn 1979, JAT carried almost 4&nbsp;million passengers.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980, the route Belgrade\u2013Chicago was established.

Jat was the official carrier and sponsor of the [[1984 Winter Olympics]].\n\nIn 1985, JAT was the first European airline to purchase [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]s. During those years, the company carried five million passengers annually and served 80 destinations on five continents (19 domestic, 45 medium haul and 16 long haul routes). JAT also constructed a large hangar to accommodate wide-body aircraft and a jet-engine test stand at their Belgrade hub. The same year, Bombay and Calcutta were connected with Belgrade.\n\nIn 1987, Belgrade was connected with Melbourne, Perth, Montreal, Los Angeles, Hong Kong etc. Profit that year was $205&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}{{dubious|reason=This is highly dubios number.

JAT was forced to stop all domestic services. The United Nations imposed sanctions on 20 May 1992 against Yugoslavia. For the first time since World War II, international transport was forcibly terminated in Yugoslavia. This was preceded by the decisions of Germany and Italy to interrupt any traffic with Yugoslavia: on 21 December 1991&nbsp;\u2014 Germany, the largest market for JAT in Europe, with seven flights daily and 40& million German marks gross annual profit, followed by Italy on 10 January 1992. The United States imposed an embargo on air traffic with Yugoslavia on 2 May 1992: the last JAT flights to the United States were to Chicago and New York. JAT management decided to re-route North American long-range flights to Canada. However, Canada quickly followed and banned all JAT flights entering the country, terminating all JAT operations across the North Atlantic.\n\nDuring that time, JAT operated only domestic services between [[Belgrade]], [[Podgorica]], [[Tivat]], [[Ni\u0161]], [[Pristina|Pri\u0161tina]] and&nbsp;\u2014 for a very short time&nbsp;\u2014 [[Ponikve Airport|U\u017eice\u2013Ponikve Airport]]. In 1994, JAT resumed some of their international services. In 1998, JAT ordered eight [[Airbus A319]]s. This was seen as a political stunt by the president, [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://exyuaviation.blogspot.com/2009/06/jat-begins-fleet-renewal.html|title=Jat begins fleet renewal | publisher=exyuaviation.blogspot.com|date=3 June 2009|access-date=7 October 2012}}</ref> The original delivery date was June 2000, but this date had been postponed until a total of $23.5&nbsp;million was paid off to Airbus while JAT was hoping to divert the deal to another airline. Soon after, all flights were canceled as Europe introduced a new ban and the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was bombed for 78 days during the [[Kosovo War]].<ref name=\"jatold\" />\n\nIn April 2000, director general [[\u017dika Petrovi\u0107]] was gunned down in front of his home in [[Belgrade]].<ref name=\"jatold\" />\n\n===2000s===\nInternational sanctions were lifted in 2000, and JAT resumed regular flight services. To celebrate the move that coincided with the country restructuring from FR Yugoslavia to [[Serbia and Montenegro]], JAT Yugoslav Airlines changed their name to Jat Airways on 8 August 2003. In 2004, [[Belgrade]] based Intair Link Airlines was merged into Jat, one year after Intair Link had begun service.<ref name=\"airlinehistory\">{{cite web|title=Airlines \u2013 Serbia|url=http://www.airlinehistory.co.uk/Europe/Serbia/Airlines.asp|website=airlinehistory.co.uk|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> Jat sold its last [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10-30]] on 24 June 2005 to France-based company TAT Industries. During 2005, the company also phased out all remaining [[Boeing 727]]s and [[DC-9]]s. The last airworthy [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9-32]] was leased to the United Arab Emirates company [[Eastern SkyJets]].\n\nBy then, Jat Airways was not a member of any alliances or partnerships but did code share on some routes with [[Adria Airways]], [[Aeroflot]], [[Air France]], [[Alitalia]], [[Austrian Airlines]], [[B&H Airlines]], [[KLM]], [[LOT Polish Airlines]] and [[TAROM]].\n\nJat Airways introduced their online booking system in September 2006 and electronic tickets in April 2007.

During these years there was a Yugoslav flag on the tail, and on the body the words ''Jugoslovenski Aerotransport''. Shortly afterwards the airline changed its livery and added a logo on the tail section with a red shaped egg on the tail in which JAT was written in white, a logo kept for the rest of the SFR Yugoslavia period. The rest of the tail was blue, with Yugoslav Airlines written on the [[fuselage]] in red. There were variations of this livery during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The biggest change in this period was when the first [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft arrived with a silver body, and were kept as such, with just logo and basic livery added.\n\n===JAT Yugoslav Airlines===\nWith the reintroduction of international flights in 1994 after two years of economic sanctions, JAT introduced a new livery and corporate image. A \"euro-white\" livery was adopted and the centre-piece was a new tail logo which contained a stylized Yugoslav flag with the white colour being represented by a pair of white wings, the larger wing symbolizing Serbia and the smaller Montenegro. For the first time, the word JAT was written on the aircraft in small blue letters. The words ''Jugoslovenski Aerotransport'' were painted on the starboard side and Yugoslav Airlines on the port side and these were written in silver italic script. In 1996, the livery was slightly modified, with JAT being painted in billboard size at the front with a small Yugoslav flag in the \"A\" in JAT. During this time, as a result of the extensive leasing of aircraft by JAT, most aircraft lost the tail logo completely. The livery was updated again in 2001 with the flag in the billboard titles disappearing, and the words Yugoslav Airlines and ''Jugoslovenski Aerotransport'' being painted in blue using the same font as the main logo. Not all of the aircraft received this update as the livery was updated again with the introduction of the new name \"Jat Airways\".\n\n===Jat Airways===\n[[File:Jat Airways logo.svg|thumb|left|Jat Airways logo from 2003 until 2013]]\nOn 20 March 2003, the airline changed its name to Jat Airways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2003&mm=03&dd=20&nav_category=9&nav_id=103911|title=Jugoslovenski aerotransport postao JAT ervejz|language=Serbian|publisher=B92|date=20 March 2003|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> A national competition was held to design the new logo and livery. The winning design had three dots on the tail: blue, red and blue. The fuselage of the aircraft had a large Jat Airways title, with Jat in red and Airways in blue. The new logo was the name Jat Airways written with three dots in blue, red and blue following it. Jat Airways painted only one aircraft in these colours, a [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-300]].\n\nJat started painting its aircraft all white and in 2006, most aircraft were white with a small Jat Airways logo. In December 2006 the airline decided to return to its dot livery. By August 2007, all aircraft had been painted. The livery is slightly different from the previous dot livery. It has the dots on the tail, but the small Jat titles remain rather than the big Jat Airways logo across the fuselage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n{{Jat liveries}}\n\n==Destinations==\n{{Main|List of Jat Airways destinations}}\n\n===Codeshare agreements===\nJat Airways had [[codeshare agreement]]s with the following airlines:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aviokarta.net/vesti/742-lufthansa-prekida-saradnju-sa-jatom/ |title=Lufthansa prekida saradnju sa Jatom |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906225102/http://www.aviokarta.net/vesti/742-lufthansa-prekida-saradnju-sa-jatom/ |archivedate=6 September 2013  }}</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* [[Adria Airways]] <small>([[Star Alliance]])</small>\n* [[Aeroflot]] <small>([[SkyTeam]])</small>\n* [[Air France]] <small>([[SkyTeam]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aviokarta.net/vesti/1471-air-france-i-jat-ponovo-sklopili-kodser-sporazum/ |title=Air France i Jat ponovo sklopili kod\u0161er sporazum |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420075309/http://aviokarta.net/vesti/1471-air-france-i-jat-ponovo-sklopili-kodser-sporazum/ |archivedate=20 April 2013  }}</ref></small>\n|\n* [[Alitalia]] <small>([[SkyTeam]])</small>\n* [[Austrian Airlines]] <small>([[Star Alliance]])</small>\n* [[Etihad Airways]]\n|\n* [[KLM]] <small>([[SkyTeam]])</small>\n* [[LOT Polish Airlines]] <small>([[Star Alliance]])</small>\n* [[TAROM]] <small>([[SkyTeam]])</small>\n|}\n\n==Services==\n\n===Jat Catering===\n[[File:JATairwaysAerospatialeATR-72-201(YU-ALS)atBelgradeAirport(picture1).jpg|thumb|right|A Jat Airways [[ATR 72-201]] at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]]\n\nJat Catering is a subsidiary of Jat Airways, providing in-flight meals for Jat Airways.

After the war, Aeroput renewed work on 2 July 1945, when the general meeting of shareholders elected the first post-war management of the company. The meeting was attended by delegates of the new government of [[Democratic Federative Yugoslavia]] (DFY), and with the participation of then the Head of State [[Ivan Ribar]], who was a pre-war shareholder and board member. The work permit was a farce, since April 1947 was created JAT who only started to perform air traffic. Communist government adopted a decree prohibiting private joint-stock companies, pursuant solution, on 24 December 1948 the Aeroput was liquidated and Aeroput's all property, pilots and mechanics where transferred to the new airline.

Aeroput continued to operate until the start of [[World War II]]. JAT Yugoslav Airlines was launched on 1 April 1947, and replaced Aeroput in 1948. the name was changed to ''Jugoslovenski Aerotransport'' (abbreviated ''JAT''; \"Yugoslav Air Transport\"), then to JAT Yugoslav Airlines and finally to Jat Airways on 8 August 2003.<ref name=\"jat\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jat.com/active/sr-latin/home/main_menu/about_us/history.html|author=Jat Airways|title=Aeroput Istorijat|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n===JAT \u2013 Yugoslav Airlines===\nIn 1946, it was apparent that the Yugoslav Air Force could not be involved in the nation's post-war build-up of civil aviation. Consequently, preparations were made for the formation of an air transport company. Three [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] and three [[Junkers Ju 52]] were converted to carry passengers. The airline was officially renamed to ''Jugoslovenski Aerotransport'' (''JAT'') on 1 April 1947.\n\nIn 1949, Yugoslavia was faced with a dire international position: isolated both by the West and the East. This caused further rationing of fuel, difficulties in procuring spare parts and the cancellation of all flights to Eastern European destinations. JAT was forced to survive on six domestic lines. When Yugoslavia turned to the West, an agreement was made with [[Swissair]] to open the Belgrade-[[Z\u00fcrich]] route, which was inaugurated on 24 August 1949. Company stagnation marked operations in 1949, because the traffic volume was well below fleet potentials and transport needs in the country. However, 1954 was in many ways a turning point. [[Convair CV-340]] and [[Convair CV-440 Metropolitan]] aircraft were purchased for short-haul and medium-haul routes, after which the [[Douglas DC-3]] was used only on domestic routes. Multiple international and domestic routes were opened soon after. In 1957, six [[Ilyushin Il-14M]] aircraft were purchased. JAT purchased several [[Douglas DC-6B]] for long-haul routes in 1959.<ref name=\"jat\"/>\n\n===Jet age===\nIn 1963, the first [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] joined the JAT fleet. In 1969, the first [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32]] (of 16) arrived, followed in 1974 by the first two (of nine) [[Boeing 727-200]]s, followed by [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] in 1969 (of 16), [[Boeing 707]] in 1970, [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] in 1971 (of 7).<ref name=\"jatold\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/discussions/general_aviation/read.main/3463739/?searchid=3463739&s=jat#ID3463739|author=jatairways.com (old website \u2013 no longer available)|title=JAT: 80 Years}}</ref><ref name=\"flight1427\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Flight International]]|title=World Airlines Directory |date=28 May 1988|page=33|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1988/1988%20-%201427.html?search=justa}}</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nLong-haul routes to North America, Australia and the Far East were flown by [[Boeing 707]]s, introduced in 1970.\n\nIn 1975 Belgrade was connected with [[Karachi]], [[Singapore]] and [[Sydney]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book|title=Glory Days: Yugoslavia's National Airline Through Communism 1947\u20131987|isbn=9788691707101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eiDYjyulVLwC|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> Same year three brand new [[Boeing 727]] were introduced.

All Caravelles were withdrawn from fleet, while the line to Karachi was terminated. That year JAT had almost three million passengers.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nIn 1977, new routes to [[Madrid]] and [[Lyon]] were introduced.\n\nIn 1978, a wide-body [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30]] (which was chosen over the [[Boeing 747-200]]) was purchased to succeed the Boeing 707s on longer-haul routes, although the 707s remained in service into the 1980s on ad hoc charters and as scheduled-flight replacement aircraft.

During those years, the company carried five million passengers annually and served 80 destinations on five continents (19 domestic, 45 medium haul and 16 long haul routes). JAT also constructed a large hangar to accommodate wide-body aircraft and a jet-engine test stand at their Belgrade hub. Same year Bombay and Calcutta were connected with Belgrade.\n\nIn 1987, Belgrade was connected with Melbourne, Perth, Montreal, Los Angeles, Hong Kong etc. Profit that year was $205&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}{{dubious|reason=This is highly dubios number.

JAT was forced to stop all domestic services. The United Nations imposed sanctions on 20 May 1992 against Yugoslavia. For the first time since World War II, international transport was forcibly terminated in Yugoslavia. This was preceded by the decisions of Germany and Italy to interrupt any traffic with Yugoslavia: on 21 December 1991&nbsp;\u2014 Germany, the largest market for JAT in Europe, with seven flights daily and 40& million German marks gross annual profit, followed by Italy on 10 January 1992. The United States imposed an embargo on air traffic with Yugoslavia on 2 May 1992: the last JAT flights to the United States were to Chicago and New York. JAT management decided to re-route North American long-range flights to Canada. However, Canada quickly followed and banned all JAT flights entering the country, terminating all JAT operations across the North Atlantic.\n\nDuring that time, JAT operated only domestic services between [[Belgrade]], [[Podgorica]], [[Tivat]], [[Ni\u0161]], [[Pristina|Pri\u0161tina]] and&nbsp;\u2014 for a very short time&nbsp;\u2014 [[Ponikve Airport|U\u017eice\u2013Ponikve Airport]]. In 1994, JAT resumed some of their international services. In 1998, JAT ordered eight [[Airbus A319]]s. This was seen as a political stunt by the president, [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://exyuaviation.blogspot.com/2009/06/jat-begins-fleet-renewal.html|title=Jat begins fleet renewal | publisher=exyuaviation.blogspot.com|date=3 June 2009|access-date=7 October 2012}}</ref> The original delivery date was June 2000, but this date had been postponed until a total of $23.5&nbsp;million was paid off to Airbus while JAT was hoping to divert the deal to another airline.

To celebrate the move that coincided with the country restructuring from FR Yugoslavia to [[Serbia and Montenegro]], JAT Yugoslav Airlines changed their name to Jat Airways on 8 August 2003. In 2004, [[Belgrade]] based Intair Link Airlines was merged into Jat, one year after Intair Link had begun service.<ref name=\"airlinehistory\">{{cite web|title=Airlines \u2013 Serbia|url=http://www.airlinehistory.co.uk/Europe/Serbia/Airlines.asp|website=airlinehistory.co.uk|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> Jat sold its last [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10-30]] on 24 June 2005 to France-based company TAT Industries. During 2005, the company also phased out all remaining [[Boeing 727]]s and [[DC-9]]s.

Subsequently, Jat Airways changed its name to Air Serbia and everything else was kept unchanged, continuing to be a joint stock company, the commercial entity registered in the APR, and with all the rights and obligations of Jat Airways.

During these years there was a Yugoslav flag on the tail, and on the body the words ''Jugoslovenski Aerotransport''. Shortly afterwards the airline changed its livery and added a logo on the tail section with a red shaped egg on the tail in which JAT was written in white, a logo kept for the rest of the SFR Yugoslavia period. The rest of the tail was blue, with Yugoslav Airlines written on the [[fuselage]] in red. There were variations of this livery during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The biggest change in this period was when the first [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft arrived with a silver body, and were kept as such, with just logo and basic livery added.\n\n===JAT Yugoslav Airlines===\nWith the reintroduction of international flights in 1994 after two years of economic sanctions, JAT introduced a new livery and corporate image. A \"euro-white\" livery was adopted and the centre-piece was a new tail logo which contained a stylized Yugoslav flag with the white colour being represented by a pair of white wings, the larger wing symbolizing Serbia and the smaller Montenegro. For the first time, the word JAT was written on the aircraft in small blue letters. The words ''Jugoslovenski Aerotransport'' were painted on the starboard side and Yugoslav Airlines on the port side and these were written in silver italic script. In 1996, the livery was slightly modified, with JAT being painted in billboard size at the front with a small Yugoslav flag in the \"A\" in JAT. During this time, as a result of the extensive leasing of aircraft by JAT, most aircraft lost the tail logo completely. The livery was updated again in 2001 with the flag in the billboard titles disappearing, and the words Yugoslav Airlines and ''Jugoslovenski Aerotransport'' being painted in blue using the same font as the main logo. Not all of the aircraft received this update as the livery was updated again with the introduction of the new name \"Jat Airways\".\n\n===Jat Airways===\n[[File:Jat Airways logo.svg|thumb|left|Jat Airways logo from 2003 until 2013]]\nOn 20 March 2003, the airline changed its name to Jat Airways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2003&mm=03&dd=20&nav_category=9&nav_id=103911|title=Jugoslovenski aerotransport postao JAT ervejz|language=Serbian|publisher=B92|date=20 March 2003|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> A national competition was held to design the new logo and livery. The winning design had three dots on the tail: blue, red and blue. The fuselage of the aircraft had a large Jat Airways title, with Jat in red and Airways in blue. The new logo was the name Jat Airways written with three dots in blue, red and blue following it. Jat Airways painted only one aircraft in these colours, a [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-300]].\n\nJat started painting its aircraft all white and in 2006, most aircraft were white with a small Jat Airways logo. In December 2006 the airline decided to return to its dot livery. By August 2007 all aircraft had been painted. The livery is slightly different from the previous dot livery. It has the dots on the tail, but the small Jat titles remain rather than the big Jat Airways logo across the fuselage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n{{Jat liveries}}\n\n==Destinations==\n{{Main|List of Jat Airways destinations}}\n\n===Codeshare agreements===\nJat Airways has [[codeshare agreement]]s with the following airlines:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aviokarta.net/vesti/742-lufthansa-prekida-saradnju-sa-jatom/ |title=Lufthansa prekida saradnju sa Jatom |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906225102/http://www.aviokarta.net/vesti/742-lufthansa-prekida-saradnju-sa-jatom/ |archivedate=6 September 2013  }}</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* [[Adria Airways]] <small>([[Star Alliance]])</small>\n* [[Aeroflot]] <small>([[SkyTeam]])</small>\n* [[Air France]] <small>([[SkyTeam]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aviokarta.net/vesti/1471-air-france-i-jat-ponovo-sklopili-kodser-sporazum/ |title=Air France i Jat ponovo sklopili kod\u0161er sporazum |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420075309/http://aviokarta.net/vesti/1471-air-france-i-jat-ponovo-sklopili-kodser-sporazum/ |archivedate=20 April 2013  }}</ref></small>\n|\n* [[Alitalia]] <small>([[SkyTeam]])</small>\n* [[Austrian Airlines]] <small>([[Star Alliance]])</small>\n* [[Etihad Airways]]\n|\n* [[KLM]] <small>([[SkyTeam]])</small>\n* [[LOT Polish Airlines]] <small>([[Star Alliance]])</small>\n* [[TAROM]] <small>([[SkyTeam]])</small>\n|}\n\n==Services==\n\n===Jat Catering===\n[[File:JATairwaysAerospatialeATR-72-201(YU-ALS)atBelgradeAirport(picture1).jpg|thumb|right|A Jat Airways [[ATR 72-201]] at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]]\n\nJat Catering is a subsidiary of Jat Airways, providing in-flight meals for Jat Airways.
