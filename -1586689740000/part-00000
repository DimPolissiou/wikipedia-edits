La Trobe is one of the Australian [[verdant universities]] and also part of the [[Innovative Research Universities]] group.\n\nLa Trobe's original and principal campus is located in the Melbourne metropolitan area, within the northern Melbourne suburb of Bundoora.

At this time, [[Flinders University]] and [[Macquarie University]] were also establishing a schools-based system.\n\nMany prominent Victorians were involved in La Trobe's establishment process, and there was a strong belief that it was important to increase research and learning in Victoria. One of the major individuals involved was [[Davis McCaughey]], who later became [[Governor of Victoria]]. The university was named after [[Charles Joseph La Trobe]], the first Governor of Victoria, and the university motto, 'whoever seeks shall find', is adapted from Charles La Trobe's family motto.<ref name=\"Gregory\"/>{{rp|3}} The La Trobe University [[Coat of Arms]] incorporates the scallop shells from the La Trobe family bearings, the Australian wedge-tailed eagle to represent Australia, and sprigs of heath to represent Victoria.<ref>[https://www.latrobe.edu.au/about/history \"Our History, La Trobe University\"].

At the time, \"this novel approach became commonly known in the university as 'The La Trobe Concept'\".<ref>Henry, M. (1971) \"La Trobe: a study of the idea of a university\". Sociology Department: School of Social Sciences: La Trobe University. La Trobe University Library, Bundoora (Victoria).</ref> Within 4 years, however, this format had all but broken down, with the collegiate ideal reduced to halls of residence and the schools becoming departmentalised.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nUp until the late 1980s, La Trobe focused almost exclusively on the liberal arts and science. This was complemented with a strong professional school when it merged with the Lincoln Institute of Health Sciences in 1988, which is now the university's Faculty of Health Sciences offering several professional health science programs including physiotherapy, podiatry and occupational therapy.\n\n=== Second era: 1990\u20132014 ===\n\nThe university established other professional schools, including its law school in 1992, which was previously a legal studies department which was established in 1972. In 2008, Victoria's second dentistry school was established at La Trobe. However, despite being a leading Australian university in professional health and biomedical sciences, La Trobe does not have a medical school. When planned and developed in the 1960s, there was strong expectation that La Trobe would eventually establish a medical school and a teaching hospital.<ref>{{cite book|last=La Trobe University|title=La Trobe University Handbooks|year=1967\u20131970|publisher=Jonker Printing Pty Ltd|location=Bundoora, Victoria}}</ref>\n\nThe Bendigo campus of La Trobe dates back to 1873: the Bendigo College of Advanced Education amalgamated with La Trobe University in 1991, completing a process that began in the late 1980s as part of the [[Dawkins reforms]] to higher education. During the merger process, a controversial issue erupted when the university's head office in Bundoora raised concerns about the academic standards at Bendigo CAE. This led to a public outcry in which Bendigo CAE students threatened the ''Bendigo Advertiser'' over publishing the matter in its newspapers. Several newspapers were burned in the protest.\n\nThe inclusion of the Wodonga Institute of Tertiary Education took place in the same year. The university has continued to expand, with the opening of the Research and Development Park at Bundoora and the upcoming opening of a second Melbourne CBD site.\n\n====Funding and cutbacks====\nHigher education reforms by the [[John Howard|Howard government]] allowed Australian universities to increase fees and take in a greater number of full-fee paying students. Despite a large student backlash, La Trobe took advantage of the reforms, increasing fees by 25% in 2005.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/01/1078117370918.html La Trobe latest to lift HECS fees] ''The Age''.

Retrieved 3 August 2009.</ref> a problem experienced across most of the Australian higher education sector.\n\nLa Trobe has lost funding disproportionately across its departments. For instance, the History Department at the university was once by far the largest of any institution in Australia; however, funding restrictions have led to a significant reduction in its size. Similarly, in 1999, the Music Department was closed due to funding cuts; in 2004 the Geology Department was excised even though it had the highest graduate satisfaction rating in the country.

Main campus buildings are connected by a series of raised walkways. The Bundoora campus is the largest university campus in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nBundoora has around 22,000 students on campus and therefore has many facilities such as restaurants, bars, shops, banks and an art gallery. The main library on the campus, the Borchardt, has well over one million volumes.\n\nLa Trobe University has three on-campus residential colleges: [[Menzies College, La Trobe|Menzies]], [[Glenn College, La Trobe University|Glenn]] and Chisholm.\n\nThe Bundoora campus is home to the [[La Trobe University Medical Centre and Hospital]].\nThe La Trobe Wildlife Sanctuary,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/wildlife/|title=La Trobe Wildlife Sanctuary|publisher=|author=La Trobe University|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> part of the university, is adjacent to the campus.\n\nBundoora also has sporting and recreation facilities such as an indoor pool, gyms, playing fields, and indoor stadiums.

The Heyward Library is also located there. The Osbourne Street Campus is predominantly used for examination facilities and is home to the La Trobe University Bendigo Athletics Track. There is also the associated [[Central Victorian Innovation Park]], located on university land, which opened in December 2003.\n\nSome of the facilities used in the 2004 [[Commonwealth Youth Games]] were located at La Trobe University Bendigo.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2005, La Trobe Bendigo's curriculum was separate from that based at Bundoora, operated by a multidisciplinary Faculty of Regional Development. All campuses could choose to offer individual courses from both Bundoora and Bendigo. This situation ceased in 2005 after the Bendigo campus formed part of the Melbourne campus structure.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\n===City===\n\nLa Trobe has a campus in Melbourne's [[central business district]], on Collins Street. The campus delivers postgraduate courses.\n\n====Bouverie Centre====\nThe Bouverie Centre (first known as the Collins Street Clinic) was established as a clinical mental health service for children and adolescents. In 1956, the centre was renamed the Bouverie Clinic following its relocation from Collins Street, in the CBD of Melbourne to Bouverie Street, Carlton. The Bouverie Centre made the transition from a child psychiatric clinic to the first family therapy centre in Australia in the mid 1970s. In 2007 the Bouverie Centre moved into a $5 million, state government funded, purpose built building at 8 Gardiner Street, [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]].\n\nLa Trobe University took over the management of the Bouverie Centre from the Mental Health Branch of the Victorian Department of Human Services, and added to Bouverie's name the subtitle Victoria's Family Institute. In the decades that followed, the range of clinical academic courses offered by Bouverie expanded and to date, the Centre delivers a number of Graduate Certificate programs, including the Graduate Certificate in Narrative Therapy; a program specifically tailored for professionals working with people impacted by Acquired Brain Injury seeking to enhance their skill and confidence in working with families, and the nationally recognised Graduate Certificate in Family Therapy for [[Indiginous Australians|Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander]] Workers. The centre's flagship Master's level program is a regular feature on the academic calendar and we also boast a vibrant higher degree research program.\n\nThe Bouverie Centre has over 40 staff, with clinical staff typically working across a number of different service areas.<ref>Bouverie Centre, '[http://www.bouverie.org.au/about-us/our-history Our History]', ''Bouverie Centre'' [website], (2015), accessed 14 April 2015.</ref>\n\n===Albury-Wodonga===\n\nThe Albury Wodonga (A-W) Campus is located three kilometres from the centre of [[Wodonga]] on a 26 hectare site. It used to be the sole campus of the Wodonga Institute of TAFE. The La Trobe campus was established in 1991. The campus continues to share various resources with the TAFE. The A-W campus houses the faculties of education, health sciences, biology, business and others.\n\n===Mildura===\n[[File:MilduraLaTrobeUniversity.JPG|thumb|Mildura offices]]\nThe Mildura Campus was established in 1996, co-located with the main campus of the [[Sunraysia Institute of TAFE]]. These institutions and other tertiary education and research institutions on the site share various resources. A second Mildura City campus opened in 2006 in the old Mildura Cultivator offices, next to \"Gallery 25\", an art gallery La Trobe became involved with a few years earlier.\n\n===Shepparton===\nThe Shepparton campus was established in 1994.

The wedge-tailed eagle (''aquila audax''), being such a well-known Australian bird that is found across the continent, was selected to symbolise La Trobe as an Australian university.\n\n==== Motto ====\nThe motto ''qui cherche trouve'' (\"whoever seeks shall find\") is taken from the amorial bearings of the La Trobe family - ''qui la c\u00e8rca la tr\u00f2ba'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]] for \"who seeks shall find\"). In Occitan, ''la tr\u00f2ba'' means \"he finds it\", and in regards to the La Trobe family there is debate over what was the object of the search.<ref>Latrobe, Pierre, [http://www.latrobesociety.org.au/LaTrobeana/LaTrobeanaV9n2.pdf \"The patronymic: the latrobe/la trobe family name\"], La Trobeana, 9/2 (2010), 2, accessed 25 October 2015.</ref> Such uncertainty is also expressed in the university's adaption, as John S.

The heath refers to the [[Epacris impressa|common heath]] (''Epacris impressa''), the pink form, or '''pink heath''' form of which is the floral emblem of the [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]]. In a sense, this floral symbol also reflects the university's attempts to cater to all Victorians. The blue ribbon serves a decorative purpose in tying both sprigs of heath together to form a [[Chaplet (headgear)|chaplet]]. The three [[escallop]] shells upon a [[fess]] were taken from the armorial bearings of the La Trobe family and signify the La Trobe name.\n\n=== Brandmark ===\n[[File:Old_La_Trobe_Brandmark.jpg|thumb|right|Initial brandmark of La Trobe University.<ref>Opening Ceremony and Inaugural Lectures 1967 (Melbourne: F. W. Cheshire Publishing, 1969)</ref>]]\n\nThe university has traditionally incorporated parts of its [[coat of arms]] into its brandmark. The first [[brandmark]] was heavily based on its armorial bearings, following the common university practice of using only the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and the [[motto]]. It is acceptable for a university to use the shield of Arms by itself, or with a motto. A university can choose how and where to display the different elements of its Arms.\n\n==Organisation and administration==\n===Organisation===\nThe university has two colleges, made up of several schools, offering courses at all levels:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/faculties|title=Colleges|author=La Trobe University|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>\n*College of Arts, Social Sciences and Commerce:\n**School of Business\n**School of Education\n**School of Humanities and Social Sciences\n**School of Law\n*College of Science, Health and Engineering:\n**School of Allied Health, Human Services and Sport\n**School of Applied Systems Biology\n**School of Cancer Medicine\n**School of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences\n**School of Life Sciences\n**School of Molecular Sciences\n**School of Nursing and Midwifery\n**School of Psychology and Public Health\n**School of Rural Health\n\n===Central administration===\n{{see also|List of La Trobe University people#Administration{{!}}La Trobe University administrative people}}\nThe principal governing body of the university is the University Council.

Recognising the importance of an art collection within an educational environment, the university's master architect, Roy Simpson AO, incorporated the installation and display of art works into his overall vision for La Trobe.\n\nWith Frank Barnes, the university's first business manager, and the generosity of individual benefactors, Roy Simpson initiated the commissioning of paintings by Gareth Jones-Roberts, Leonard Lloyd Annois and Charles William Bush to establish the Art Collection. Major sculptural works, such as Allen David's monumental glass screen that graces the main entrance to the University Library, were also included in the original design. The further installation of sculpture in the grounds and paintings throughout the buildings were proposed in the original master plan, and were made possible with funds raised through the 1976 Retirement Appeal for the inaugural vice-chancellor, David Myers.\n\nToday the La Trobe University Art Collection is considered{{who|date=December 2015}} a major public art collection, comprising over 2,000 post war and contemporary Australian art works. The collection covers most media and periods of Australian art. It includes the largest holding of works by the Australian surrealist Bernard Boles, expatriate artist Allen David and the Etta Hirsh Ceramics Collection which consists of over 300 pieces.\n\nIn addition to an active acquisition program, art works have been acquired through an artist in residence program and sponsorship of public art prizes.\n\nPublic accessibility to the collections remains a priority, with many of the works displayed across the university's metropolitan and regional campuses, included in touring exhibitions and exhibitions held at the La Trobe University Museum of Art and other venues.<ref>https://www.latrobe.edu.au/luma/collections/la-trobe.</ref>\n\nThe other campuses have access to local exhibition spaces. The Shepparton Gallery is located in the Shepparton town centre. Albury-Wodonga students can access Albury Regional Art Gallery.

There used to be three main student representative bodies on campus known as the La Trobe University Student Guild, the Student's Representative Council and the La Trobe Postgraduate Student's Association. The [[La Trobe University Student Representative Council]], became the principal representative body on campus and a student advocacy group as well as student representatives for welfare, disability, women, queer, indigenous, environment, education and welfare and the Guild managed student services. In 2011 however, the Student's Representative Council, the La Trobe Postgraduate Students Association, the Students Guild and the university merged the three separate organisations into one body: the La Trobe Student Union.\n\nThe largest faculty-based student representative organisation on campus is the Law Students Association (LSA). Postgraduate students are represented in the new union. The students at the Bendigo campus are represented by the Bendigo Student Association (BSA), a much less activist and political organisation than the student union. The BSA publishes the ''3rd Degree'' magazine.\n\n===''Rabelais''===\n''[[Rabelais Student Media]]'' is a student newspaper at La Trobe University, named after French Renaissance writer [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]].

The paper is funded by a combination of advertising revenue and a student levy. Editors are elected annually and serve for a single year.\n\nNotably it was the subject of a [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] case after the Office of Film and Literature Classification ruled in 1995 that it \"promotes, incites and instructs in matters of crime\" because of an article on shoplifting (reprinted from elsewhere).

La Trobe is one of the Australian [[verdant universities]] and also part of the [[Innovative Research Universities]] group.\n\nLa Trobe's original and principal campus is located in the Melbourne metropolitan area, within the northern Melbourne suburb of Bundoora.

La Trobe University Library, Bundoora (Victoria), p.1.</ref> and the university adopted an academic structure based on schools of studies (rather than on faculties) and a collegiate format, where a large number of students lived on campus. At this time, [[Flinders University]] and [[Macquarie University]] were also establishing a schools-based system.\n\nMany prominent Victorians were involved in La Trobe's establishment process, and there was a strong belief that it was important to increase research and learning in Victoria. One of the major individuals involved was [[Davis McCaughey]], who later became [[Governor of Victoria]]. The university was named after [[Charles Joseph La Trobe]], the first Governor of Victoria, and the university motto, 'whoever seeks shall find', is adapted from Charles La Trobe's family motto.<ref name=\"Gregory\"/>{{rp|3}} The La Trobe University [[Coat of Arms]] incorporates the scallop shells from the La Trobe family bearings, the Australian wedge-tailed eagle to represent Australia, and sprigs of heath to represent Victoria.<ref>[https://www.latrobe.edu.au/about/history \"Our History, La Trobe University\"].

When planned and developed in the 1960s, there was strong expectation that La Trobe would eventually establish a medical school and a teaching hospital.<ref>{{cite book|last=La Trobe University|title=La Trobe University Handbooks|year=1967\u20131970|publisher=Jonker Printing Pty Ltd|location=Bundoora, Victoria}}</ref>\n\nThe Bendigo campus of La Trobe dates back to 1873: the Bendigo College of Advanced Education amalgamated with La Trobe University in 1991, completing a process that began in the late 1980s as part of the [[Dawkins reforms]] to higher education. During the merger process, a controversial issue erupted when the university's head office in Bundoora raised concerns about the academic standards at Bendigo CAE. This led to a public outcry in which Bendigo CAE students threatened the ''Bendigo Advertiser'' over publishing the matter in its newspapers. Several newspapers were burned in the protest.\n\nThe inclusion of the Wodonga Institute of Tertiary Education took place in the same year. The university has continued to expand, with the opening of the Research and Development Park at Bundoora and the upcoming opening of a second Melbourne CBD site.\n\n====Funding and cutbacks====\nHigher education reforms by the [[John Howard|Howard government]] allowed Australian universities to increase fees and take in a greater number of full-fee paying students. Despite a large student backlash, La Trobe took advantage of the reforms, increasing fees by 25% in 2005.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/01/1078117370918.html La Trobe latest to lift HECS fees] ''The Age''.

For instance, the History Department at the university was once by far the largest of any institution in Australia; however, funding restrictions have led to a significant reduction in its size. Similarly, in 1999, the Music Department was closed due to funding cuts; in 2004 the Geology Department was excised even though it had the highest graduate satisfaction rating in the country. The university's African Research Institute, the only major African studies centre in Australasia, was closed at the end of 2006.<ref>[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&list=h-africa&month=0703&week=e&msg=ZJcW%2b048Gpfl7eJS68DFfw&user=&pw= Message posted by Peter Limb on 30 March 2007 to H-Africa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521051828/http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&list=h-africa&month=0703&week=e&msg=ZJcW+048Gpfl7eJS68DFfw&user=&pw= |date=21 May 2011 }} ([[H-Net]] list on African studies)</ref> In 2008, the university cut the Philosophy and Religious Studies Program at the Bendigo campus, the change resulted in the stream only being taught as a minor.\n\nIn 2008, La Trobe was operating with a $1.46 million surplus but has highlighted that by 2010 it will \"review, and where appropriate, restructure all academic, administrative and committee structures\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/about/downloads/Strategic-Plan-July09.pdf |title=La Trobe University Strategic Plan 2008\u20132012 |publisher=La Trobe University }}</ref> to deal with diminished student intakes, falling entrance marks, below-par scores on student satisfaction surveys and a decreasing proportion of national research funding.<ref name=\"funding1\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,24897,23742583-12332,00.html |work=The Australian |first=Andrew |last=Trounson |title=La Trobe University to cut spending and freeze staff positions |date=22 May 2008}}</ref> In an attempt to address these issues, the university is making cut backs and restructuring several courses under the direction of the vice-chancellor, John Dewar.<ref name=\"funding1\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> As of 2013, the university is operating on a 28 million dollar surplus.<ref name=\"2010ar\">https://www.latrobe.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/132331/annual-report-2010.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Third era: 2015\u2013present ===\n{{empty-section|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Campuses==\n\n===Melbourne===\n[[File:La Trobe University.jpg|thumb|Moat and George Singer Building, La Trobe University Bundoora Campus]]\n[[File:Health Sciences Building and Charles La Trobe Statue at La Trobe University.jpg|thumb|Health Sciences Building]]\n[[File:La Trobe University - student hub.jpg|thumb|Student hub]]\nThe Melbourne campus at Bundoora is the foundation campus of La Trobe and was officially opened in 1967 when La Trobe began operations.

Main campus buildings are connected by a series of raised walkways. The Bundoora campus is the largest university campus in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nBundoora has around 22,000 students on campus and therefore has many facilities such as restaurants, bars, shops, banks and an art gallery. The main library on the campus, the Borchardt, has well over one million volumes.\n\nLa Trobe University has three on-campus residential colleges: [[Menzies College, La Trobe|Menzies]], [[Glenn College, La Trobe University|Glenn]] and Chisholm.\n\nThe Bundoora campus is home to the [[La Trobe University Medical Centre and Hospital]].\nThe La Trobe Wildlife Sanctuary,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/wildlife/|title=La Trobe Wildlife Sanctuary|publisher=|author=La Trobe University|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> part of the university, is adjacent to the campus.\n\nBundoora also has sporting and recreation facilities such as an indoor pool, gyms, playing fields, and indoor stadiums.

The Heyward Library is also located there. The Osbourne Street Campus is predominantly used for examination facilities and is home to the La Trobe University Bendigo Athletics Track. There is also the associated [[Central Victorian Innovation Park]], located on university land, which opened in December 2003.\n\nSome of the facilities used in the 2004 [[Commonwealth Youth Games]] were located at La Trobe University Bendigo.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2005, La Trobe Bendigo's curriculum was separate from that based at Bundoora, operated by a multidisciplinary Faculty of Regional Development. All campuses could choose to offer individual courses from both Bundoora and Bendigo. This situation ceased in 2005 after the Bendigo campus formed part of the Melbourne campus structure.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\n===City===\n\nLa Trobe has a campus in Melbourne's [[central business district]], on Collins Street. The campus delivers postgraduate courses.\n\n====Bouverie Centre====\nThe Bouverie Centre (first known as the Collins Street Clinic) was established as a clinical mental health service for children and adolescents. In 1956, the centre was renamed the Bouverie Clinic following its relocation from Collins Street, in the CBD of Melbourne to Bouverie Street, Carlton. The Bouverie Centre made the transition from a child psychiatric clinic to the first family therapy centre in Australia in the mid 1970s. In 2007 the Bouverie Centre moved into a $5 million, state government funded, purpose built building at 8 Gardiner Street, [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]].\n\nLa Trobe University took over the management of the Bouverie Centre from the Mental Health Branch of the Victorian Department of Human Services, and added to Bouverie's name the subtitle Victoria's Family Institute. In the decades that followed, the range of clinical academic courses offered by Bouverie expanded and to date, the Centre delivers a number of Graduate Certificate programs, including the Graduate Certificate in Narrative Therapy; a program specifically tailored for professionals working with people impacted by Acquired Brain Injury seeking to enhance their skill and confidence in working with families, and the nationally recognised Graduate Certificate in Family Therapy for [[Indiginous Australians|Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander]] Workers. The centre's flagship Master's level program is a regular feature on the academic calendar and we also boast a vibrant higher degree research program.\n\nThe Bouverie Centre has over 40 staff, with clinical staff typically working across a number of different service areas.<ref>Bouverie Centre, '[http://www.bouverie.org.au/about-us/our-history Our History]', ''Bouverie Centre'' [website], (2015), accessed 14 April 2015.</ref>\n\n===Albury-Wodonga===\n\nThe Albury Wodonga (A-W) Campus is located three kilometres from the centre of [[Wodonga]] on a 26 hectare site. It used to be the sole campus of the Wodonga Institute of TAFE. The La Trobe campus was established in 1991. The campus continues to share various resources with the TAFE. The A-W campus houses the faculties of education, health sciences, biology, business and others.\n\n===Mildura===\n[[File:MilduraLaTrobeUniversity.JPG|thumb|Mildura offices]]\nThe Mildura Campus was established in 1996, co-located with the main campus of the [[Sunraysia Institute of TAFE]]. These institutions and other tertiary education and research institutions on the site share various resources. A second Mildura City campus opened in 2006 in the old Mildura Cultivator offices, next to \"Gallery 25\", an art gallery La Trobe became involved with a few years earlier.\n\n===Shepparton===\nThe Shepparton campus was established in 1994.

In Occitan, ''la tr\u00f2ba'' means \"he finds it\", and in regards to the La Trobe family there is debate over what was the object of the search.<ref>Latrobe, Pierre, [http://www.latrobesociety.org.au/LaTrobeana/LaTrobeanaV9n2.pdf \"The patronymic: the latrobe/la trobe family name\"], La Trobeana, 9/2 (2010), 2, accessed 25 October 2015.</ref> Such uncertainty is also expressed in the university's adaption, as John S.

The heath refers to the [[Epacris impressa|common heath]] (''Epacris impressa''), the pink form, or '''pink heath''' form of which is the floral emblem of the [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]]. In a sense, this floral symbol also reflects the university's attempts to cater to all Victorians. The blue ribbon serves a decorative purpose in tying both sprigs of heath together to form a [[Chaplet (headgear)|chaplet]]. The three [[escallop]] shells upon a [[fess]] were taken from the armorial bearings of the La Trobe family and signify the La Trobe name.\n\n=== Brandmark ===\n[[File:Old_La_Trobe_Brandmark.jpg|thumb|right|Initial brandmark of La Trobe University.<ref>Opening Ceremony and Inaugural Lectures 1967 (Melbourne: F.

The first [[brandmark]] was heavily based on its armorial bearings, following the common university practice of using only the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and the [[motto]]. It is acceptable for a university to use the shield of Arms by itself, or with a motto. A university can choose how and where to display the different elements of its Arms.\n\n==Organisation and administration==\n===Organisation===\nThe university has two colleges, made up of several schools, offering courses at all levels:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/faculties|title=Colleges|author=La Trobe University|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>\n*College of Arts, Social Sciences and Commerce:\n**School of Business\n**School of Education\n**School of Humanities and Social Sciences\n**School of Law\n*College of Science, Health and Engineering:\n**School of Allied Health, Human Services and Sport\n**School of Applied Systems Biology\n**School of Cancer Medicine\n**School of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences\n**School of Life Sciences\n**School of Molecular Sciences\n**School of Nursing and Midwifery\n**School of Psychology and Public Health\n**School of Rural Health\n\n===Central administration===\n{{see also|List of La Trobe University people#Administration{{!}}La Trobe University administrative people}}\nThe principal governing body of the university is the University Council.

Recognising the importance of an art collection within an educational environment, the university's master architect, Roy Simpson AO, incorporated the installation and display of art works into his overall vision for La Trobe.\n\nWith Frank Barnes, the university's first business manager, and the generosity of individual benefactors, Roy Simpson initiated the commissioning of paintings by Gareth Jones-Roberts, Leonard Lloyd Annois and Charles William Bush to establish the Art Collection. Major sculptural works, such as Allen David's monumental glass screen that graces the main entrance to the University Library, were also included in the original design. The further installation of sculpture in the grounds and paintings throughout the buildings were proposed in the original master plan, and were made possible with funds raised through the 1976 Retirement Appeal for the inaugural vice-chancellor, David Myers.\n\nToday the La Trobe University Art Collection is considered{{who|date=December 2015}} a major public art collection, comprising over 2,000 post war and contemporary Australian art works. The collection covers most media and periods of Australian art. It includes the largest holding of works by the Australian surrealist Bernard Boles, expatriate artist Allen David and the Etta Hirsh Ceramics Collection which consists of over 300 pieces.\n\nIn addition to an active acquisition program, art works have been acquired through an artist in residence program and sponsorship of public art prizes.\n\nPublic accessibility to the collections remains a priority, with many of the works displayed across the university's metropolitan and regional campuses, included in touring exhibitions and exhibitions held at the La Trobe University Museum of Art and other venues.<ref>https://www.latrobe.edu.au/luma/collections/la-trobe.</ref>\n\nThe other campuses have access to local exhibition spaces.

The [[La Trobe University Student Representative Council]], became the principal representative body on campus and a student advocacy group as well as student representatives for welfare, disability, women, queer, indigenous, environment, education and welfare and the Guild managed student services. In 2011 however, the Student's Representative Council, the La Trobe Postgraduate Students Association, the Students Guild and the university merged the three separate organisations into one body: the La Trobe Student Union.\n\nThe largest faculty-based student representative organisation on campus is the Law Students Association (LSA).

The paper is funded by a combination of advertising revenue and a student levy.

Connelly feels even worse about it after preventing an assassination attempt aboard Cahill's plane where a flight attendant is accidentally killed in the process. Sensing Connelly's discomfort around Cahill, his boss reassigns him to the team that protects the \"[[nuclear football]]\" as soon as Cahill becomes president.\n\nIn the film, the \"nuclear football\" briefcase contains a high-tech laptop computer, which can only be operated through a two key system (one key operated by the president and the other by the agent on \"football duty\") along with thumbprint and eye retina scans from the President.  In real life, the football still uses paper playbooks and an officer of the military guards/carries the football.\n\nAfter the newly inaugurated president has been planning a meeting with Fung, the [[President of Taiwan]], to discuss the strained relationship between [[Taiwan]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China]], one of the Secret Service agents returns home to find that his family is being held hostage by some men who are later revealed to be Fung's henchmen. They force him to participate in a plot to steal \"the football\".  When Presidents Cahill and Fung are in Taiwan aboard Fung's ship, the latter insists that he feels that peaceful co-existence with mainland China may no longer be possible and that drastic action must be taken to ensure China does not invade Taiwan. Soon afterwards, Fung's henchmen begin killing all the other agents, leaving Mike Connelly as the only loyal Secret Service agent left.\n\nFung's men, along with Fung's girlfriend Iris, are successful in stealing the football, and Fung forces Cahill to activate it (by knocking him unconscious to get his thumbprint and eye retina scans), explaining that he will use the US's [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]s to launch a nuclear strike on China. He hopes that this will lead a revolution among his people towards \"a new beginning\" of Taiwanese freedom, pointing out that since he alone controls all of the US's missiles, he would not have to worry about a [[mutually assured destruction]] of both China and the United States. Only the United States should worry when China retaliates.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Valdez is informed of the situation and Fung makes a phone call to her explaining that he has seized control of the United States' nuclear missiles and will [[nuclear blackmail|launch one]] against Beijing unless both China and the United States  within 24 hours recognize Taiwan's independence and that the United States promises to use its full military might against China if it tries to invade Taiwan. Valdez insists that this would never be possible and later Fung follows through with his threat, launching a [[first strike]] against Beijing using an ICBM from [[Nebraska]].\n\nValdez first contacts the [[President of Russia]] to assure that the missile is [[Cold War|not targeted]] towards [[Russia]].  Then Valdez contacts Chairman Tzu of China to explain the situation and that the United States did not launch the missile and is therefore not responsible.  She also offers to give Tzu the chance to [[Strategic Defense Initiative|shoot the missile out of the sky]] but Tzu angrily points out that this would be impossible.  It is then that he gives the order to launch a retaliatory strike against the United States using one of China's ICBMs, which he calls \"an eye for an eye\".  True to his word, the missile is targeted for [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nAfter Beijing and later Washington are destroyed, Tzu launches a [[second strike]] using several of China's missiles as [[massive retaliation|further retaliation]] for the destruction of China's capital.  Meanwhile, Iris is revealed to Agent Connelly to be an undercover Chinese agent whose assignment was to recover the football and return it to Beijing.  But even she had no idea Fung would actually launch missiles against her country, and points out that China would no doubt retaliate against the US in response to the attack, thus she points out now they both have a common interest.  Together they are able to escape Fung's ship and follow Fung and the still kidnapped President to [[Hong Kong]].  They are both ultimately successful in taking out all but one of Fung's henchmen, all of which are rogue elements of the [[People's Liberation Army]].  The last remaining one strangles Iris to death however and continues his search for Agent Connelly.\n\nMeanwhile, Connelly finds President Cahill held at gunpoint by Fung who still has the football.  Fung along with Agent Thornton orders Connelly to surrender or else either Fung or Thornton will kill the President.  It is then Cahill says for Connelly to \"remember your duty\".  Fung at first thinks he means the duty of protecting the President, but then Connelly points out that he is on football duty and that it's \"some other guy's job\" to protect the President.  Connelly shoots the President in the leg which [[element of surprise|shocks]] Fung and distracts him just long enough to allow Connelly to take him and Agent Thornton out.  Connelly and President Cahill now are in control of the football and begin the process of deactivating it.  The last of Fung's henchmen however, is able to fatally wound the President before Connelly can take him out.  But not before President Cahill is successfully able to deactivate the football.  By doing so, Vice President Valdez and [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] have regained control of the United States' nuclear arsenal.\n\nValdez gives this news to Chairman Tzu and says that he may now order the destruction of his missiles.  Tzu refuses, thinking Valdez is bluffing.  Valdez then gives the order to NORAD that \"Stage One is a go\", which Tzu is horrified to find out is in fact a launch of [[counterforce|several of the US's ICBMs]].  Valdez warns Tzu has one minute to destroy his missiles, and if he does, Valdez will destroy her missiles and points out to Tzu that he does not want to know what \"[[Nuclear holocaust|Stage Two]]\" is.  Just when it seems all hope is lost however, Tzu complies with Valdez's instructions and destroys all his missiles which soon afterwards Valdez does the same with hers.  Thus a major [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] was narrowly averted. At the end of the film, it has been implied that Valdez was elevated to the presidency, giving a speech to the American people about the challenges that go with her new responsibilities. She reminds them not to lose hope.\n\n==Main cast==\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as President Jack Cahill\n* [[Patrick Muldoon]] as Agent Mike Connelly\n* [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]] as Vice President Valdez\n* [[Michael Biehn]] as Agent Craig Thornton\n* [[Ric Young]] as President Ken Fung\n* [[Sung Hi Lee]] as Iris\n* [[William R.

The studio tracks were recorded in [[New York City]], while the live recordings were made in [[Munich]] and [[Ludwigshafen]], West Germany. Unlike most live albums, the audience is completely muted from the mix during the concert recordings.\n\n[[Bruce Springsteen]] contributed uncredited spoken vocals during the \"Slipaway\" section of \"[[Street Hassle (song)|Street Hassle]]\", alluding to his own ''[[Born to Run]]'' album in the final line \"Tramps like us, we were born to pay.\" At the time, the singer was enduring a three-year forced hiatus from releasing any of his own work due to legal disputes with his former manager, although he was in the process of writing and recording music for his forthcoming album ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]'', to be released in June 1978. Springsteen was not credited for his performance in the liner notes to ''Street Hassle'', possibly due to his ongoing legal battles.\n\n===Binaural recording===\nThe recording of ''Street Hassle'' was notable in that Reed and his co-producer chose to employ an experimental [[microphone]] placement technique called [[binaural recording]].<ref name=\"billboard\" /> In binaural recording, two microphones are placed in the studio in an attempt to mimic the [[Stereophonic sound|stereo sound]] of actually being in the room with the performers/instruments.

The studio tracks were recorded in [[New York City]], while the live recordings were made in [[Munich]] and [[Ludwigshafen]], West Germany. Unlike most live albums, the audience is completely muted from the mix during the concert recordings.\n\n[[Bruce Springsteen]] contributed uncredited spoken vocals during the \"Slipaway\" section of \"[[Street Hassle (song)|Street Hassle]]\", alluding to his own ''[[Born to Run]]'' album in the final line \"Tramps like us, we were born to pay.\" At the time, the singer was enduring a three-year forced hiatus from releasing any of his own work due to legal disputes with his former manager, although he was in the process of writing and recording music for his forthcoming album ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]'', to be released in June 1978. Springsteen was not credited for his performance in the liner notes to ''Street Hassle'', possibly due to his ongoing legal battles.\n\n===Binaural recording===\nThe recording of ''Street Hassle'' was notable in that Reed and his co-producer chose to employ an experimental [[microphone]] placement technique called [[binaural recording]].<ref name=\"billboard\" /> In binaural recording, two microphones are placed in the studio in an attempt to mimic the [[Stereophonic sound|stereo sound]] of actually being in the room with the performers/instruments. In the case of the recording sessions and concerts that composed ''Street Hassle'', engineers used a [[mannequin]] head with a microphone implanted in each ear. Binaural recordings are generally only effective when the user listens to the album through [[headphones]], and do not generally translate correctly through stereo speakers.\n[[Image:Dummyhead.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Dummy head being used for binaural recording, similar to the setup used for ''Street Hassle'']]\n\nReed's particular binaural recording system was developed by Manfred Schunke of the German company Delta Acoustics; Schunke is credited as an engineer on ''Street Hassle''.

Most often, mitigation efforts involve reductions in the [[concentrations]] of [[greenhouse gases]], either by reducing their [[:wikt:source|source]] or by increasing their [[sinks]].<ref>Molina, M.; Zaelke, D.; Sarmac, K. M.; Andersen, S. O.; Ramanathane, V.; Kaniaruf, D. (2009). \"Tipping Elements in Earth Systems Special Feature: Reducing [[abrupt climate change]] risk using the Montreal Protocol and other regulatory actions to complement cuts in CO2 emissions\".

PMC 2791591. http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/10/19/0902568106.full.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Adaptation efforts ===\n[[Adaptation to global warming]] involves actions to tolerate the effects of global warming. Collaborative research from the [[Institute of Development Studies]] draws links between adaptation and poverty to help develop an agenda for pro-poor adaptation that can inform climate-resilient poverty reduction. Adaptation to climate change will be \"ineffective and inequitable if it fails to learn and build upon an understanding of the multidimensional and differentiated nature of poverty and vulnerability\".<ref name=autogenerated3>IDS Bulletin. Poverty in a Changing Climate IDS Bulletin 39(4):2, September 2008</ref> Poorer countries tend to be more seriously affected by climate change, yet have reduced assets and capacities with which to adapt.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> This has led to more activities to integrate adaptation within development and poverty reduction programs. The rise of adaptation as a development issue has been influenced by concerns around minimizing threats to progress on poverty reduction, notably the [[Millennium Development Goals]], and by the injustice of impacts that are felt hardest by those who have done least to contribute to the problem, framing adaptation as an equity and [[human rights]] issue.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n== Proposed policy challenges ==\nMost difficult policy challenge is related to [[distribution (economics)|distribution]]. While this is a potential catastrophic risk for the entire globe, the short and medium-term distribution of the costs and benefits will be far from uniform.<ref name=\"Human Development Report\" />  Distribution challenge is made particularly difficult because those who have largely caused the problem \u2013 richer nations \u2013 are not going to be those who suffer the most in the short term. It is the poorest who did not and still are not contributing significantly to green house gas emissions that are the most vulnerable.<ref>La Trobe, S. 2002.
