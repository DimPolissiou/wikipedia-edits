Debuted in the 1992 [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class]] ([[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]]), this engine family is relatively [[stroke ratio|oversquare]] and uses 4 valves per cylinder. All engines in the family use a cast iron engine block and aluminum alloy cylinder head.\n\n== M111.920 ==\nThe '''M111.920''' is a {{convert|1799|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} 16 valve engine. It produces {{convert|90|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} of power at 5500&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|170|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4200&nbsp;rpm. It has a variant called the '''M111.921''' which has a MAF (Mass Air Flow)-sensor instead of MAP-sensor on the first one, and using [[Engine control unit|ECU]] instead of PMS. \n\nApplications:\n* 1996-2000 [[Mercedes-Benz_C-Class#W202_.281993.E2.80.932000.29|C180]] (W202)\n\n== M111.940 ==\nThe '''M111.940''' is a {{convert|1998|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} 16-valve engine with bore and stroke of {{convert|89.9x78.7|mm|2|abbr=on}} and compression ratio of 9.6:1. It produces {{convert|100|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} of power and {{convert|190|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nApplications:\n* 1992-1995 [[Mercedes-Benz W124|E200]] (W124)\n* 1997-2002 CLK200 (C208)\n* 1993-2000 [[Mercedes-Benz_C-Class#W202_.281993.E2.80.932000.29|C200]] (W202)\n\nUnlike the 102, 103, and early 104 series engines, the engine did not use [[mechanical fuel injection]] but the [[Siemens]] PEC/PMS (Pressure Engine Control) management system, which integrates fuel and spark management.\n\nIt is a speed-density type of system, as mixture formation is dependent on RPM, TPS angle, and manifold pressure (MAP).\n\nInjectors work in pairs (idle, part load), or altogether (full-load).\n\nIt uses 2 ignition coils and no ignition distributor. Cylinders are fired in pairs (dual fire) - 1 and 4 together, and 2 and 3 together. The crankshaft position sensor is sensing the movement of two radially opposed position plates on the flywheel, one of which is magnetized, and the other is not. Thus, the engine management has precise information which group of cylinders to fire, and which group of injectors to spray.\n\n== M111.942 ==\nSimilar to the M111.940 engine, used in the following years. It produces {{convert|100|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} of power and {{convert|190|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nApplications:\n* 1995-2000 [[Mercedes-Benz W210|E200]] (W210)\n* 1993-2000 [[Mercedes-Benz_C-Class#W202_.281993.E2.80.932000.29|C200]] (W202)\n\nThis motor never had PMS. Early models -95 to -97 has a HFM-motronic, hot-film type air/fuel metering device,  and -97 to -2002 with [[Motronic#2.1|ME2.1 motronic]]. The later system also has a magnet on the intake camshaft, and gives signal to ECU, to assist the motor in producing more torque at low revs. The early motor didn't have any camshaft position sensor, so wiring was much different.\n\nThe only problem experienced with this M111 excellent reliability motor is the originally installed [[Victor Reinz]] headgasket, which eventually tore apart by age, and made the top loose coolant on the side. Other than that, only some year models, had bad insulation on the engine wiring, that needed all the wiring to be replaced.\n\n== M111.943 ==\nIt produces {{convert|141|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|270|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n\n* 1996-2000 [[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class (R170)|SLK200 Kompressor (R170)]]\n\n== M111.944 ==\nThe '''M111.944''' is a {{convert|1998|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} 16-valve engine utilizing a [[supercharger]] similar to the 2.3L M111.973 engine. It produces {{convert|141|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} of power and {{convert|270|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. This engine was built especially for SLK 170 and CLK 208 exported to Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal and Greece for tax reasons. The 'executive cars' tax limit was based in engine's capacity bigger than 2000&nbsp;cc, so Mercedes in order to hit these markets made a mixture of the M111.940 with the supercharger of M111.973 for high performance at low engine capacity.\n\nApplications:\n* 1997-2001\n\n== M111.946 ==\nIt produces {{convert|100|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|190|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n* 1996-2000 [[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class (R170)|SLK200 (R170)]]\n[[File:M111 1998cc 1996 r170 europe thumb.jpg|M111.946 engine from 1996 SLK200 R170 1998cc]]\n\n== M111.947 ==\nIt produces {{convert|137|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|270|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n* 1997-2002 [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W210)|E200 Kompressor (W210)]]\n\n== M111.951 ==\nEVO engine (M 111 E 20 EVO).

It has a variant called the '''M111.921''' which has a MAF (Mass Air Flow)-sensor instead of MAP-sensor on the first one, and using [[Engine control unit|ECU]] instead of PMS. \n\nApplications:\n* 1996-2000 [[Mercedes-Benz_C-Class#W202_.281993.E2.80.932000.29|C180]] (W202)\n\n== M111.940 ==\nThe '''M111.940''' is a {{convert|1998|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} 16-valve engine with bore and stroke of {{convert|89.9x78.7|mm|2|abbr=on}} and compression ratio of 9.6:1.

Cylinders are fired in pairs (dual fire) - 1 and 4 together, and 2 and 3 together. The crankshaft position sensor is sensing the movement of two radially opposed position plates on the flywheel, one of which is magnetized, and the other is not. Thus, the engine management has precise information which group of cylinders to fire, and which group of injectors to spray.\n\n== M111.942 ==\nSimilar to the M111.940 engine, used in the following years. It produces {{convert|100|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} of power and {{convert|190|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nApplications:\n* 1995-2000 [[Mercedes-Benz W210|E200]] (W210)\n* 1993-2000 [[Mercedes-Benz_C-Class#W202_.281993.E2.80.932000.29|C200]] (W202)\n\nThis motor never had PMS. Early models -95 to -97 has a HFM-motronic, hot-film type air/fuel metering device,  and -97 to -2002 with [[Motronic#2.1|ME2.1 motronic]]. The later system also has a magnet on the intake camshaft, and gives signal to ECU, to assist the motor in producing more torque at low revs. The early motor didn't have any camshaft position sensor, so wiring was much different.\n\nThe only problem experienced with this M111 excellent reliability motor is the originally installed [[Victor Reinz]] headgasket, which eventually tore apart by age, and made the top loose coolant on the side. Other than that, only some year models, had bad insulation on the engine wiring, that needed all the wiring to be replaced.\n\n== M111.943 ==\nIt produces {{convert|141|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|270|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n\n* 1996-2000 [[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class (R170)|SLK200 Kompressor (R170)]]\n\n== M111.944 ==\nThe '''M111.944''' is a {{convert|1998|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} 16-valve engine utilizing a [[supercharger]] similar to the 2.3L M111.973 engine. It produces {{convert|141|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} of power and {{convert|270|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. This engine was built especially for SLK 170 and CLK 208 exported to Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal and Greece for tax reasons. The 'executive cars' tax limit was based in engine's capacity bigger than 2000&nbsp;cc, so Mercedes in order to hit these markets made a mixture of the M111.940 with the supercharger of M111.973 for high performance at low engine capacity.\n\nApplications:\n* 1997-2001\n\n== M111.946 ==\nIt produces {{convert|100|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|190|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n* 1996-2000 [[Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class (R170)|SLK200 (R170)]]\n[[File:M111 1998cc 1996 r170 europe thumb.jpg|M111.946 engine from 1996 SLK200 R170 1998cc]]\n\n== M111.947 ==\nIt produces {{convert|137|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|270|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nApplications:\n* 1997-2002 [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W210)|E200Kompressor (W210)]]\n\n== M111.951 ==\nEVO engine (M 111 E 20 EVO).

This interaction has caused star formation to increase tenfold compared to \"normal\" galaxies.\n\nM82 has undergone at least one tidal encounter with M81 resulting in a large amount of gas being funneled into the galaxy's core over the last 200 Myr.<ref name=\"Barkeretal2008\" /> The most recent such encounter is thought to have happened around 2\u20135{{e|8}} years ago and resulted in a concentrated starburst together with a corresponding marked peak in the cluster age distribution.<ref name=\"Barkeretal2008\" /> This starburst ran for up to ~50 Myr at a rate of ~10 ''M''<sub>\u2299</sub> per year.<ref name=\"Barkeretal2008\" /> Two subsequent starbursts followed, the last (~4\u20136 Myr ago) of which may have formed the core clusters, both super star clusters (SSCs) and their lighter counterparts.<ref name=\"Barkeretal2008\" />\n\nStars in M82's disk seem to have been formed in a burst 500 million years ago, leaving its disk littered with hundreds of clusters with properties similar to globular clusters (but younger), and stopped 100 million years ago with no star formation taking place in this galaxy outside the central starburst and, at low levels since 1 billion\nyears ago, on its [[galactic halo|halo]]. A suggestion to explain those features is that M82 was previously a [[low surface brightness galaxy]] where star formation was triggered due to interactions with its giant neighbor.<ref name=\"Divakaraetal2009\">\n{{cite journal\n | author=Divakara Mayya, Y. | author2=Carrasco, Luis\n | date=2009\n | title=M82 as a Galaxy: Morphology and Stellar Content of the Disk and Halo\n | journal=Revista Mexicana de Astronom\u00eda y Astrof\u00edsica, Serie de Conferencias\n | volume= 37\n | pages= 44\u201355\n | bibcode=2009arXiv0906.0757D\n |arxiv = 0906.0757 }}</ref>\n\nIgnoring any difference in their respective distances from the Earth, the centers of M81 and M82 are visually separated by about 130,000 light-years.<ref>Declination separation of 36&prime;.87 and Right Ascension separation of 9&prime;.5 gives via [[Pythagorean theorem]] a visual separation of 38&prime;.07; Average distance of 11.65 Mly \u00d7 sin(38&prime;.07) = 130,000 ly visual separation.</ref> The actual separation is {{val|300|+300|-200|u=kly}}.<ref>Separation = sqrt(D<sub>M81</sub><sup>2</sup> + D<sub>M82</sub><sup>2</sup> \u2013 2 D<sub>M81</sub> D<sub>M82</sub> Cos(38&prime;.07)) assuming the error direction is about the same for both objects.</ref><ref name=\"Karachentsevetal2006\">\n{{cite journal\n | author=Karachentsev, I.

The ship in 2013 chartered to an Italian company and did the [[Livorno]]\u2013[[Olbia]] route but it was unsuccessful during a mechanical damage. The ship after the charting entered again in [[Piraeus]]\u2013[[Heraklion]] route but again chartered to a Russian company. The went in [[Novorossysk]] but never entered in service and returned in [[Piraeus]]. The ship lai-up many times and eventually on Summer of 2016 [[Blue Star Ferries]] charterd it for [[Piraeus]]\u2013[[Dodecanesse]] route for Summer only. Eventually in 2017 ''Kriti I'' again chartered from [[Grandi Navi Veloci]]. In [[Italy]] the ship did the [[Civitavechia]]\u2013[[Termini Imerese]] route with ''[[Spledid]]''. The ship was chartered for three years and on December 2019 ''Kriti I'' arrived in [[Piraeus]] and has been laid-up since then in [[Perama]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commonscatinline}}\n\n{{authoritycontrol}}\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, addeduncategorisedtag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_I"}

It was released on 15 September 2003 on his ISO Records label, in conjunction with [[Columbia Records]]. Co-produced by Bowie and longtime collaborator [[Tony Visconti]], it was recorded between January and May 2003 at Bowie's home studio and Looking Glass Studios in New York City and [[Mike Garson]]'s home studio in California. A [[Rock music|rock]] album, it was written mostly after production on Bowie's previous album ''[[Heathen (David Bowie album)|Heathen]]'' wrapped up. It contains covers of [[the Modern Lovers]]' \"[[Pablo Picasso (song)|Pablo Picasso]]\" and [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[Try Some, Buy Some]]\". He supported the album with the [[A Reality Tour]] throughout 2003 and 2004, his final concert tour. It was his last album of original material for ten years, until the release of ''[[The Next Day]]'' in 2013.\n\n==Recording and production==\nBowie started writing the songs for ''Reality'' as the production for his previous album ''[[Heathen (David Bowie album)|Heathen]]'' was wrapping up. Some songs he wrote quickly: \"[[Fall Dog Bombs the Moon]]\" was written in 30 minutes. Other songs, such as \"[[Bring Me the Disco King]]\", was a song Bowie had tried his hand at as early as the 1970s and had tried again with 1993's ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]''<ref>{{cite journal |author=David Wild |title=Bowie's Wedding Album |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=21 January 1993 |page=14}}</ref> as well as ''[[Earthling (album)|Earthling]]'' in 1997.<ref name=\"A2A\">{{cite book | title=Ashes to Ashes The Songs of David Bowie 1976\u20132016 | first=Chris | last=O'Leary | publisher=[[Repeater Books]]  | year=2019 | ISBN=9781912248308}}</ref><ref name=SOS03>{{cite web|first=Richard |last=Buskin |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/reality.htm |title=David Bowie & Tony Visconti Recording ''Reality'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606111145/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/reality.htm |archivedate=6 June 2015 |website=[[Sound on Sound]] |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref> The album was recorded and produced in [[New York City]]'s Looking Glass Studios and co-produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]]. Bowie wrote four or five tracks at his home studio before coming to Looking Glass. Bowie and Visconti took those tracks and worked those into about 7 songs, before adding overdubs like rhythm guitars and keyboards. According to Visconti, they took care during this part of the process to record things properly, saying \"we'd hardly redo anything. I always record things carefully in the first place, because I know we're not going to redo them, and so a lot of the demo parts ended up on the final version.\"<ref name=\"SOS03\" /> They then took \"a short break\" during which time Bowie wrote a few more songs, and then they started the overdub process over again with that new material.<ref name=\"SOS03\" /> \n\nConsisting mostly of original compositions, the album also includes two songs written by others, [[the Modern Lovers]]' \"[[Pablo Picasso (song)|Pablo Picasso]]\" and [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[Try Some, Buy Some]]\". These two tracks were originally slated for Bowie's never-recorded ''[[Pin Ups]] 2'' album from the early 1970s. Bowie had originally intended to record it for a planned follow-up to ''[[Pin Ups (album)|Pin Ups]]'', his 1973 collection of cover versions.<ref name=SOS03 /> Talking to ''Rolling Stone'' shortly before the release of ''Reality'', he said of his recording: \"We were pretty true to the original arrangement, but the overall atmosphere is somewhat different. It's a dense piece.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=David |last=Peisner |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bowie-back-with-reality-20030715 |title=Bowie Back With 'Reality': September set features Modern Lovers, Ronnie Spector covers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414010458/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bowie-back-with-reality-20030715 |archivedate=14 April 2018 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nBowie and Visconti produced both the stereo and 5.1 mix in the studio as the album was recorded. Of the 5.1 mix, Visconti said \"My approach to 5.1 is to be involved, to have instruments wrapped around you rather than in front of you. Rather than putting you in the audience seat I actually put you in the band, and so that's what I did with ''Reality''. Also, I put a slap-back on the vocal in the rear speakers to again create space.\"<ref name=\"SOS03\" />\n\nBowie usually recorded his vocals for songs in just one or two takes. Visconti remarked that Bowie had recently quit smoking, and as a result \"he's recaptured some of his high range. He'd lost at least five semitones, and he's now gained most of them back. I mean, in the old days he used to sing '[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]' in the key of C. Now he has to sing it in the key of G.\"<ref name=\"SOS03\" />\n\n==Album title==\nBowie chose 'Reality' as the album title because, \"I feel that reality has become an abstract for so many people over the last 20 years. Things that they regarded as truths seem to have just melted away, and it's almost as if we're thinking post-philosophically now. There's nothing to rely on any more. No knowledge, only interpretation of those facts that we seem to be inundated with on a daily basis. Knowledge seems to have been left behind and there's a sense that we are adrift at sea. There's nothing more to hold on to, and of course political circumstances just push that boat further out.<ref name=SOS03 />\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 74/100<ref name=MetaCritic>{{citation |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/reality/david-bowie |title=Reality (Review) |accessdate=16 January 2013 |publisher=metacritic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322011203/http://www.metacritic.com/music/reality/david-bowie |archive-date=22 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[AllMusic]]''\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/reality-mw0000449983 |title=Reality \u2013 David Bowie |author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |work=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=31 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617134812/http://www.allmusic.com/album/reality-mw0000449983 |archive-date=17 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev2score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th |year=2011 |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) }}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev3score = C+ <ref>{{cite journal |title=Reality |date=19 September 2003 |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |page=85}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite news |author=Caroline Sullivan |date=12 September 2003 |title=David Bowie, Reality |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/12/popandrock.shopping8 |accessdate=31 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002150252/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/12/popandrock.shopping8 |archive-date=2 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] Oct 2003, p.104</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev6Score = 7.3/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/880-reality/ |title=David Bowie: Reality |author=Eric Carr |date=16 September 2003 |work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=31 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201134258/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/880-reality/ |archive-date=1 December 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev7Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/reality-20030910 |title=David Bowie: Reality |date=10 September 2003 |accessdate=12 September 2017 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=DeCurtis |first=Anthony |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912192217/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/reality-20030910 |archive-date=12 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]] |year=2004 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|pages=97\u201398}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''\n| rev9score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] Oct 2003, p.112</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[USA Today]]''\n| rev10score = {{Rating|3|4}}<ref>{{cite news |author=Edna Gundersen |date=15 September 2003 |title=Listen Up (David Bowie: ''Reality'') |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2003-09-15-listenup_x.htm |accessdate=31 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025053055/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2003-09-15-listenup_x.htm |archive-date=25 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| noprose   = yes\n}}\nA contemporary review of the album by the [[BBC]] called the album \"a proper album, with a beginning, a middle and an end.

It was released on 15 September 2003 on his ISO Records label, in conjunction with [[Columbia Records]]. Co-produced by Bowie and longtime collaborator [[Tony Visconti]], it was recorded between January and May 2003 at Bowie's home studio and Looking Glass Studios in New York City and [[Mike Garson]]'s home studio in California. A [[Rock music|rock]] album, it was written mostly after production on Bowie's previous album ''[[Heathen (David Bowie album)|Heathen]]'' wrapped up. It contains covers of [[the Modern Lovers]]' \"[[Pablo Picasso (song)|Pablo Picasso]]\" and [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[Try Some, Buy Some]]\". He supported the album with the [[A Reality Tour]] throughout 2003 and 2004, his final concert tour. It was his last album of original material for ten years, until the release of ''[[The Next Day]]'' in 2013.\n\n==Recording and production==\nBowie started writing the songs for ''Reality'' as the production for his previous album ''[[Heathen (David Bowie album)|Heathen]]'' was wrapping up. Some songs he wrote quickly: \"[[Fall Dog Bombs the Moon]]\" was written in 30 minutes. Other songs, such as \"[[Bring Me the Disco King]]\", was a song Bowie had tried his hand at as early as the 1970s and had tried again with 1993's ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]''<ref>{{cite journal |author=David Wild |title=Bowie's Wedding Album |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=21 January 1993 |page=14}}</ref> as well as ''[[Earthling (album)|Earthling]]'' in 1997.<ref name=\"A2A\">{{cite book | title=Ashes to Ashes The Songs of David Bowie 1976-2016 | first=Chris | last=O'Leary | publisher=[[Repeater Books]]  | year=2019 | ISBN=9781912248308}}</ref><ref name=SOS03>{{cite web|first=Richard |last=Buskin |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/reality.htm |title=David Bowie & Tony Visconti Recording ''Reality'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606111145/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/reality.htm |archivedate=6 June 2015 |website=[[Sound on Sound]] |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref> The album was recorded and produced in [[New York City]]'s Looking Glass Studios and co-produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]]. Bowie wrote four or five tracks at his home studio before coming to Looking Glass. Bowie and Visconti took those tracks and worked those into about 7 songs, before adding overdubs like rhythm guitars and keyboards. According to Visconti, they took care during this part of the process to record things properly, saying \"we'd hardly redo anything. I always record things carefully in the first place, because I know we're not going to redo them, and so a lot of the demo parts ended up on the final version.\"<ref name=\"SOS03\" /> They then took \"a short break\" during which time Bowie wrote a few more songs, and then they started the overdub process over again with that new material.<ref name=\"SOS03\" /> \n\nConsisting mostly of original compositions, the album also includes two songs written by others, [[the Modern Lovers]]' \"[[Pablo Picasso (song)|Pablo Picasso]]\" and [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[Try Some, Buy Some]]\". These two tracks were originally slated for Bowie's never-recorded ''[[Pin Ups]] 2'' album from the early 1970s. Bowie had originally intended to record it for a planned follow-up to ''[[Pin Ups (album)|Pin Ups]]'', his 1973 collection of cover versions.<ref name=SOS03 /> Talking to ''Rolling Stone'' shortly before the release of ''Reality'', he said of his recording: \"We were pretty true to the original arrangement, but the overall atmosphere is somewhat different. It's a dense piece.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=David |last=Peisner |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bowie-back-with-reality-20030715 |title=Bowie Back With 'Reality': September set features Modern Lovers, Ronnie Spector covers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414010458/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bowie-back-with-reality-20030715 |archivedate=14 April 2018 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nBowie and Visconti produced both the stereo and 5.1 mix in the studio as the album was recorded. Of the 5.1 mix, Visconti said \"My approach to 5.1 is to be involved, to have instruments wrapped around you rather than in front of you. Rather than putting you in the audience seat I actually put you in the band, and so that's what I did with ''Reality''. Also, I put a slap-back on the vocal in the rear speakers to again create space.\"<ref name=\"SOS03\" />\n\nBowie usually recorded his vocals for songs in just one or two takes. Visconti remarked that Bowie had recently quit smoking, and as a result \"he's recaptured some of his high range. He'd lost at least five semitones, and he's now gained most of them back. I mean, in the old days he used to sing '[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]' in the key of C. Now he has to sing it in the key of G.\"<ref name=\"SOS03\" />\n\n==Album title==\nBowie chose 'Reality' as the album title because, \"I feel that reality has become an abstract for so many people over the last 20 years. Things that they regarded as truths seem to have just melted away, and it's almost as if we're thinking post-philosophically now. There's nothing to rely on any more. No knowledge, only interpretation of those facts that we seem to be inundated with on a daily basis. Knowledge seems to have been left behind and there's a sense that we are adrift at sea. There's nothing more to hold on to, and of course political circumstances just push that boat further out.<ref name=SOS03 />\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 74/100<ref name=MetaCritic>{{citation |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/reality/david-bowie |title=Reality (Review) |accessdate=16 January 2013 |publisher=metacritic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322011203/http://www.metacritic.com/music/reality/david-bowie |archive-date=22 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[AllMusic]]''\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/reality-mw0000449983 |title=Reality \u2013 David Bowie |author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |work=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=31 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617134812/http://www.allmusic.com/album/reality-mw0000449983 |archive-date=17 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev2score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th |year=2011 |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) }}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev3score = C+ <ref>{{cite journal |title=Reality |date=19 September 2003 |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |page=85}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite news |author=Caroline Sullivan |date=12 September 2003 |title=David Bowie, Reality |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/12/popandrock.shopping8 |accessdate=31 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002150252/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/12/popandrock.shopping8 |archive-date=2 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] Oct 2003, p.104</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev6Score = 7.3/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/880-reality/ |title=David Bowie: Reality |author=Eric Carr |date=16 September 2003 |work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=31 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201134258/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/880-reality/ |archive-date=1 December 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev7Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/reality-20030910 |title=David Bowie: Reality |date=10 September 2003 |accessdate=12 September 2017 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=DeCurtis |first=Anthony |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912192217/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/reality-20030910 |archive-date=12 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]] |year=2004 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|pages=97\u201398}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''\n| rev9score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] Oct 2003, p.112</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[USA Today]]''\n| rev10score = {{Rating|3|4}}<ref>{{cite news |author=Edna Gundersen |date=15 September 2003 |title=Listen Up (David Bowie: ''Reality'') |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2003-09-15-listenup_x.htm |accessdate=31 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025053055/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2003-09-15-listenup_x.htm |archive-date=25 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| noprose   = yes\n}}\nA contemporary review of the album by the [[BBC]] called the album \"a proper album, with a beginning, a middle and an end.
