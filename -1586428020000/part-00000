This was replaced in 1999 by simply: 'Sainsbury's'. The flagship supermarket in [[Greenwich]], South London, first trialled the new look, leading to the term 'Greenwich Blue', which was used to describe the signature colour of new identity. After its success most supermarkets were refurbished with dark blue walls, bright orange wall panels and grey shelving, as well as new checkouts. Individual counters also had different, brightly coloured panels behind them. Gradually the format was rolled out across the entire Sainsbury's estate. The 'Greenwich Blue' look has been phased out and new supermarkets now have a fresher look.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/sainsburys-tesco-asda-logos-certain-12779611 |title=Why Sainsbury's, Tesco and Asda logos are certain colours|newspaper=Coventry Telegraph|accessdate=12 April 2017}}</ref> Old external signage bearing the 'J Sainsbury' name was still to be found in use as recently as summer 2011 in Swindon, Ashbourne in Derbyshire and Blackheath, West Midlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/alexmartin81/5998423061/|title=Timewarp Wiltshire|work=Flickr|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Nectar loyalty card ===\n{{main|Nectar loyalty card}}\nSainsbury's was a founding member of the UK's largest retail loyalty scheme called 'Nectar' in 2002.

The meetings can include communication from Head Office, the chance to organise charity or local events and the opportunity for employee's to discuss issues and feedback or question the attending Store Manager. The group controls a budget for donating to local charities and a budget for investing in employee facilities. The group was previously known as the 'Colleague Council', a separate version for young employees was called 'Youth Forum' and another separate group called 'SSA Council' existed to organise events in shops. A change in 2014 combined all three into 'Great Place To Work Groups'. The shop groups are part of a national structure, meeting monthly at shops and depots, then monthly at a regional level and then finally at a national meeting less frequently. The shop level is chaired by Store Managers, regional level by a Store Manager and Regional Operations Manager and nationally by the Groups HR Director.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/our-values/a-great-place-to-work|title=Our colleagues|website=www.about.sainsburys.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tomorrowscompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Employee_voice_IPA_TC_case_study_Sainsburys_50c20c9770c64.pdf|title=Sainbury's case study|publisher=Tomorrow's Company|accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"j-sainsbury.co.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/media/latest-stories/2012/20120312-youth-can-sainsburys-launches-campaign-to-boost-retail-careers-for-young-people/ |title='Youth Can': Sainsbury's launches campaign to boost retail careers for young people |publisher=J-sainsbury.co.uk |access-date=14 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022163334/http://j-sainsbury.co.uk/media/latest-stories/2012/20120312-youth-can-sainsburys-launches-campaign-to-boost-retail-careers-for-young-people/ |archive-date=22 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks |first=Beth |url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/companies/supermarkets/sainsburys/sainsburys-tells-youth-they-can/227138.article |title=Sainsbury's tells youth they can |publisher=Thegrocer.co.uk |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n;Sainsbury's Staff Association\nSainsbury's Staff Association was founded in 1947.

Individual counters also had different, brightly coloured panels behind them. Gradually the format was rolled out across the entire Sainsbury's estate.

The meetings can include communication from Head Office, the chance to organise charity or local events and the opportunity for employee's to discuss issues and feedback or question the attending Store Manager. The group controls a budget for donating to local charities and a budget for investing in employee facilities. The group was previously known as the 'Colleague Council', a separate version for young employees was called 'Youth Forum' and another separate group called 'SSA Council' existed to organise events in shops. A change in 2014 combined all three into 'Great Place To Work Groups'. The shop groups are part of a national structure, meeting monthly at shops and depots, then monthly at a regional level and then finally at a national meeting less frequently. The shop level is chaired by Store Managers, regional level by a Store Manager and Regional Operations Manager and nationally by the Groups HR Director.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/our-values/a-great-place-to-work|title=Our colleagues|website=www.about.sainsburys.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tomorrowscompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Employee_voice_IPA_TC_case_study_Sainsburys_50c20c9770c64.pdf|title=Sainbury's case study|publisher=Tomorrow's Company|accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"j-sainsbury.co.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/media/latest-stories/2012/20120312-youth-can-sainsburys-launches-campaign-to-boost-retail-careers-for-young-people/ |title='Youth Can': Sainsbury's launches campaign to boost retail careers for young people |publisher=J-sainsbury.co.uk |access-date=14 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022163334/http://j-sainsbury.co.uk/media/latest-stories/2012/20120312-youth-can-sainsburys-launches-campaign-to-boost-retail-careers-for-young-people/ |archive-date=22 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks |first=Beth |url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/companies/supermarkets/sainsburys/sainsburys-tells-youth-they-can/227138.article |title=Sainsbury's tells youth they can |publisher=Thegrocer.co.uk |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n;Sainsbury's Staff Association\nSainsbury's Staff Association was founded in 1947.
