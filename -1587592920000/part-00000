All times are Eastern and Pacific, with certain exceptions, such as ''Monday Night Football''.\n\nNew fall series are highlighted in '''bold'''.\n\nNOTE: The [[September 11 attacks]] hindered the ability to start airing shows in a timely manner. Although many series began their seasons in September and October as regularly scheduled, the television season officially did not begin until the month of November. From February 8 to 24, 2002, all of NBC's primetime programming was preempted in favor of coverage of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]].\n\nEach of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by [[Nielsen Media Research]].<ref name=\"BM2\">Highest-rated series is based on the annual top-rated programs list compiled by [[Nielsen Media Research]] and reported in: Brooks, Tim & Marsh, Earle (2007).

When ABC announced their 2001 Fall Schedule, originally the plan was for [[The Job (2001 TV series)|The Job]] to air after [[The Drew Carey Show]] starting in mid-September and [[NYPD Blue]] would air in the 10pm ET timeslot after [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20 Downtown]] returned to Friday nights in late December.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/16/arts/tv-notes-20-20-bouncing-and-vanishing.html</ref> However, after the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001, ABC decided to not air [[The Job (2001 TV series)|The Job]] until mid-season because the show was set in New York City. In October, when the sitcom [[Bob Patterson (TV series)|Bob Patterson]] was not doing well in the ratings on Tuesday nights, they moved the show to the Wednesday 9:30pm ET timeslot and put [[NYPD Blue]] in the Tuesday 9pm ET timeslot.\n\n2.

When ABC announced their 2001 Fall Schedule, originally the plan was for [[The Job (2001 TV series)|The Job]] to air after [[The Drew Carey Show]] starting in mid-September and [[NYPD Blue]] would air in the 10pm ET timeslot after [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20 Downtown]] returned to Friday nights in late December.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/16/arts/tv-notes-20-20-bouncing-and-vanishing.html</ref> However, after the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001, ABC decided to not air [[The Job (2001 TV series)|The Job]] until mid-season because the show was set in New York City. In October, when the sitcom [[Bob Patterson (TV series)|Bob Patterson]] was not doing well in the ratings on Tuesday nights, they moved the show to the Wednesday 9:30pm ET timeslot and put [[NYPD Blue]] in the Tuesday 9pm ET timeslot.\n\n2.

He obtained his [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] National License in 1980, then won six races to claim the SCCA's Northeast Division Formula Ford championship in 1981. He also drove in a number of [[Formula Vee]] races in regional SCCA events. In 1982, he won six of the 11 races on his way to winning the [[Super Vee|Robert Bosch US Formula Super Vee Championship]]. He also won the opening race of the 1983 Super Vee season before he moved up to drive in [[Formula Atlantic]], and won his second title by winning the [[Formula Mondial|FIA Formula Mondial North American Cup]] the following season.

The father and son partnership returned to the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] the following year, and were joined by [[Philippe Alliot]] in the [[Kremer Racing|Porsche Kremer Racing]]'s [[Porsche 956]], taking third place. Michael also raced alongside his father in the Riverside 6 Hours where they were joined by [[A. J. Foyt]] and [[Preston Henn]], but the [[Porsche 935]] failed to finish.

Andretti re-signed for Kraco to undertake the 1984 season, where he managed five third-place finishes and ended his rookie season in seventh overall. In the [[1984 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]], he finished fifth and shared the [[List of Indianapolis 500 Rookies of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award with [[Roberto Guerrero]].

The season became a two-man battle for the championship title, between Michael and [[Bobby Rahal]]. Andretti would take the points lead with his victory on the [[Milwaukee Mile]]. A week later, on [[Father's Day (United States)|Father's Day]], Michael was leading on the final lap at [[Portland International Raceway|Portland]], when his [[March Engineering|March-Cosworth 86C]] ran out of fuel, allowing his father, Mario, to beat him by just 0.07 seconds. It was one of the most shocking finishes in the history of IndyCar, and the closest finish (until 1997). With Rahal continuing to win races, Andretti's consistent finishing only allowed Rahal a nine-point lead in the standing with two races remaining.

He shared Rookie of the Year honours with Guerrero in 1984, when he finished fifth. However, in [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991]], he led with 12 laps remaining, but finished second to [[Rick Mears]] after battling the multiple Indy 500 winner. The pair of them traded memorable late-lap outside passes for the lead in Turn One. The next year, [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992]], he dominated the race, leading four-fifths of the laps, but, with 11 laps remaining after holding a two-lap lead, his fuel pump failed, and his car coasted to a stop. He was classified in 13th place. He also dropped out while leading the Indy 500 in [[1989 Indianapolis 500|1989]], [[1995 Indianapolis 500|1995]] and [[2003 Indianapolis 500|2003]]. Andretti holds the record for [[List of Indianapolis 500 lap leaders|most laps led]] in the Indy 500 without having achieved a victory.<ref name=\"mshf.com\"/>\n\n===Formula One===\nFor the 1993 season, Michael signed for [[McLaren|Marlboro McLaren]], to partner the triple World Drivers' Champion [[Ayrton Senna]] in their [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] HBD [[V8]] powered [[McLaren MP4/8|MP4/8]]. He signed during the summer of 1992 and the deal was announced at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] over the weekend of the [[1992 Italian Grand Prix]].\n\n\"I think he can win Grands Prix and become the World Champion,\" said [[Ron Dennis]], McLaren's team principal. \"It's not a question of which country you come from. It's how you demonstrate your desire to win.\" There were practical factors that mitigated against Andretti being able to show competitive form in his debut season in F1. The rule changes introduced that season destroyed his hopes of unrestricted laps in free practice during which he could learn the tracks, as most were unfamiliar to him. From the start of 1993, just 23 laps were allowed in the morning's untimed session and only twelve in the qualifying session.<ref name=\"mclaren.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mclaren.com/formula1/heritage/driver/michael-andretti/|title=McLaren Formula 1 - Heritage - Michael Andretti|publisher=McLaren|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Andretti 1993 European GP.jpg|thumb|left|Andretti driving for [[McLaren]] at the [[1993 European Grand Prix]]]]\nWith the pressure intensifying, Michael began the year with crashes in the [[Kyalami]] and at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace|Interlagos]]. In the latter of these two, he had a massive collision at the start with Gerhard Berger in a Ferrari. He then qualified sixth for the [[1993 European Grand Prix|Sega European Grand Prix]] at [[Donington Park]], but he collided with [[Karl Wendlinger]]'s [[Sauber]] on the opening lap.

He never fully got to grips with the McLaren MP4/8. Highly technical aspects which he was not used to in the [[American Championship Car Racing#Comparison with Formula One|technologically simpler IndyCars]] such as [[active suspension]] and [[traction control system|traction control]] hampered Andretti's chances as did the standing starts used in F1. Some in the industry also felt that since he commuted to races and test sessions from the United States, rather than relocating full-time to Europe was also a contributing factor to his lack of success in Formula One. At the time, McLaren's Special Projects Manager, long-time Andretti family friend Tyler Alexander, who had been involved in F1 since the mid-1960s, had urged Michael to relocate to England as he knew times had changed from when Mario had raced to the 1978 World Championship. True enough, he finished third at Monza (which would prove to be his last Formula One race), but with three races remaining, he left the team and the championship by mutual agreement after the race.<ref name=\"mclaren.com\"/><ref name=\"atlasf1.autosport.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/08/sports/sports-people-auto-racing-andretti-switches-to-mclaren-team.html|title=Andretti Switches to McLaren Team|date=September 8, 1992|work=AP|via=The New York Times|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Michael's son [[Marco Andretti|Marco]], the McLaren team \"sabotaged\" his father's chances at being competitive in order to replace him with the team's test driver [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]], who would require a smaller salary. \"The reality of it was, they had Mika H\u00e4kkinen ready to come in for a lot less than what my dad was getting paid, and that's all it was. Right then and there, they had to make him look [bad],\" claimed Marco in 2008. \"They would make the car do weird things in the corner electronically, stuff out of his control.\" However, Andretti still had problems in practice for the [[1993 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]], and both he and Senna spun off with brake balance problems early in the race. Andretti was able to continue and fought back up to third, holding off Wendlinger. Throughout the season, Senna experienced similar reliability problems to Andretti, mainly electronic gremlins, particularly in [[1993 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]], [[1993 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], [[1993 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]] and [[1993 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]], although H\u00e4kkinen equalled Andretti's third place Monza finish in [[1993 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], while Senna won both the Japanese Grand Prix and the season ending [[1993 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]], his final race for McLaren.<ref name=\"mclaren.com\"/><ref name=\"atlasf1.autosport.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwherald.com/articles/2008/05/22/sports/other_sports/doc4835195490406345041530.txt|title=Local News and Video for McHenry County, Illinois|work=Northwest Herald}}{{cbignore}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr546.html|title=Portuguese GP, 1993 Race Report - GP Encyclopedia - F1 History on Grandprix.com|publisher=Grandprix.com|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr548.html|title=Australian GP, 1993 Race Report - GP Encyclopedia - F1 History on Grandprix.com|publisher=Grandprix.com|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref> And according to H\u00e4kkinen in a much later interview, Andretti was commuting to Europe from the United States, and was not in Europe enough when testing needed to be done, allowing H\u00e4kkinen to consistently show his speed and build a relationship with the team.

He went on to win in his very first race back in the series at the [[1994 Australian FAI Indycar Grand Prix]], around the [[Surfers Paradise Street Circuit]] in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], having led every lap along the way. That win also got [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]]'s first win in CART in their debut. Although the season may not have gone the way Michael would have liked, he did win again in the [[Honda Indy Toronto|Molson Indy Toronto]], taking a record fourth win. By the time he retired, Michael would have won seven times around the [[Exhibition Place]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/raceyear/1994/R|title=CART Results for 1994|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1995 PPG Indy Car World|1995]], he returned to [[Newman/Haas Racing]]. He had a consistent season, scoring points in every round, but taking just the one win, in Toronto, enable Andretti to claim fourth overall in the points standing. The following season, he would finish as runner-up to [[Jimmy Vasser]], in a season marred by the death of [[Jeff Krosnoff]] and split with [[IndyCar|Indy Racing League]], visiting victory lane on five occasions. Newman/Haas began a new relationship with [[Swift Engineering|Swift]] which did not prove to be very successful in 1997-1999. In 2000 the team used [[Lola Cars|Lola]] chassis and Michael won the [[Indy Japan 300|Firestone Firehawk 300]] held at [[Twin Ring Motegi]] in Japan, and again in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/raceyear/1995/R|title=CART Results for 1995|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/raceyear/1996/R|title=CART Results for 1996|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"grandprix.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-andmic.html|title=Michael Andretti Profile - Drivers - GP Encyclopedia - F1 History on Grandprix.com|publisher=Grandprix.com|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMichael tried again to win Le Mans in 1997, again alongside Mario, but joined on this occasion by [[Olivier Grouillard]].

Andretti ran in a third Team Green car with Motorola sponsorship and ran at Indianapolis. He led 16 laps, and was leading the race during a rain delay just beyond the halfway point. Had the race been halted due to the rain, he could have been declared the winner. The red flag, however, did not come out at the time and the race resumed. A punctured tyre, and a minor collision in the pits with eventual winner [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]], driving for car owner [[Roger Penske]], slowed him down, and at the end of the day, Andretti settled for 3rd place.

He then announced that this would be his last Indy 500 as a driver. Andretti leaves driving competition at Indy with a frustrating distinction - the driver who's led the most laps (431) without winning the race.

Statistically one of the most successful drivers in the history of [[American open-wheel car racing]], Andretti won the [[1991 CART PPG Indy Car World Series]] and amassed 42 race victories, the most in the CART era and fourth-most all time.<ref name=\"CCSATR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.champcarstats.com/records/records-career.htm|title=All-Time Records - Career|work=champcarstats.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>  Since his retirement from active racing, Andretti has owned [[Andretti Autosport]], which has won four IndyCar Series championships and five [[Indianapolis 500]] races.\n\nHe is the son of [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One World Champion]] and Indianapolis 500 winner [[Mario Andretti]], and the father of current IndyCar Series driver [[Marco Andretti]].\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===Early career===\n\nMichael Andretti was born to Dee Ann and racing legend [[Mario Andretti]], a race car driver who became a four-time IndyCar champion and the 1978 Formula One World Champion.\n\nFollowing a successful career racing karts, winning 50 of his 75 races over eight years, Michael moved into racing cars. He obtained his [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] National License in 1980, then won six races to claim the SCCA's Northeast Division Formula Ford championship in 1981. He also drove in a number of [[Formula Vee]] races in regional SCCA events. In 1982, he won six of the 11 races on his way to winning the [[Super Vee|Robert Bosch US Formula Super Vee Championship]]. He also won the opening race of the 1983 Super Vee season before he moved up to drive in [[Formula Atlantic]], and won his second title by winning the [[Formula Mondial|FIA Formula Mondial North American Cup]] the following season. Although he made his international sports car debut at the [[1982 24 Hours of Le Mans]], he was denied the opportunity to race, as the Mirage M12 he had chosen to race with his father was disqualified 80 minutes before the race was due to start. The father and son partnership returned to the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] the following year, and were joined by [[Philippe Alliot]] in the [[Kremer Racing|Porsche Kremer Racing]]'s [[Porsche 956]], taking third place. Michael also raced alongside his father in the Riverside 6 Hours where they were joined by [[A. J. Foyt]] and [[Preston Henn]], but the [[Porsche 935]] failed to finish. The father and son duo paired up again the [[1984 24 Hours of Daytona|1984 Daytona 24 Hours]], this time in a full-works [[Porsche 962]], which made its race debut. They took pole position, but during the race, the engine broke.<ref name=\"teamdan.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teamdan.com/archive/www2/superv/82svrob.html|title=1982 Robert Bosch US Formula Super Vee Championship|work=teamdan.com|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"champcarstats.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.champcarstats.com/atlantic/year/1983.htm|title=1983 FIA Formula Mondial North American Cup|work=champcarstats.com|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texacohavoline42.com/media/history/cart/michael_andretti.asp |accessdate=December 20, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231010720/http://www.texacohavoline42.com/media/history/cart/michael_andretti.asp |archivedate=December 31, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/driver/results/Michael-Andretti-USA.html|title=Michael Andretti (USA) - All Results|publisher=Racing Sports Cars|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Le_Mans-1982-06-20.html|title=Le Mans 24 Hours|publisher=Racing Sports Cars|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Le_Mans-1983-06-19-photo.html|title=Le Mans 24 Hours|publisher=Racing Sports Cars|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Cotton\">Martin Cotton, \"Directory of World Sportscars GROUP C and IMSA Cars from 1982\" (Aston Publications, {{ISBN|0-946627-38-X}}, 1988)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Riverside-1983-04-24.html|title=Riverside 6 Hours|publisher=Racing Sports Cars|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===CART===\n[[File:1986 March 86C Indy Car.JPG|right|thumb|Andretti's first race winning Indy Car, now at [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]], England.]]\nHe made his [[Champ Car|CART]] debut in [[1983 CART PPG Indy Car World Series|1983]], racing for the [[Kraco Enterprises]] team. Andretti re-signed for Kraco to undertake the 1984 season, where he managed five third-place finishes and ended his rookie season in seventh overall. In the [[1984 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]], he finished fifth and shared the [[List of Indianapolis 500 Rookies of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award with [[Roberto Guerrero]]. He went on to win his first [[American Championship Car Racing|IndyCar]] race in [[1986 IndyCar season|1986]] in the [[Grand Prix of Long Beach|Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach]]. The season became a two-man battle for the championship title, between Michael and [[Bobby Rahal]]. Andretti would take the points lead with his victory on the [[Milwaukee Mile]]. A week later, on [[Father's Day (United States)|Father's Day]], Michael was leading on the final lap at [[Portland International Raceway|Portland]], when his [[March Engineering|March-Cosworth 86C]] ran out of fuel, allowing his father, Mario, to beat him by just 0.07 seconds. It was one of the most shocking finishes in the history of IndyCar, and the closest finish (until 1997). With Rahal continuing to win races, Andretti's consistent finishing only allowed Rahal a nine-point lead in the standing with two races remaining. Andretti won a key victory in at [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]]. Going into the season finale at [[Tamiami Park]], Andretti was just three points behind Rahal, but neither driver were a factor in the race, with Andretti retiring with a broken halfshaft.<ref name=\"niashf.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.niashf.org/inductees/michael-andretti/|title=Michael Andretti|work=National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame|accessdate=January 26, 2016|date=2012-11-07}}</ref><ref name=\"racing-reference.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Michael_Andretti|title=Michael Andretti Career Statistics|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.champcarstats.com/drivers/AndrettiMichael.htm|title=Michael Andretti|work=champcarstats.com|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn a one-off race with [[Alfa Corse]], he took part in the inaugural World Touring Car race, [[1987 Monza 500|500 km di Monza]]. Paired with [[Alessandro Nannini]], they finished 16th overall, second in class. Back in CART, he continued with Kraco in 1987, and like 1986, the championship was between Andretti and Rahal. Michael would win the [[Firestone Indy 400|Michigan 500]], drawing within nine points of Rahal.  With him winning in dominating fashion at [[Nazareth Speedway]], his championship hopes remained alive, although Rahal clinched the championship at the next race. Andretti would also win the season finale, [[Tamiami Park]]. He would finish runner-up for the second season in a row. Back in June 1987, Michael joined Hendrick Motorsport to race a [[Chevrolet Corvette GTP]] in the Mid-Ohio 500&nbsp;km, this time joined by his cousin, [[John Andretti]], where they finished 11th.<ref name=\"niashf.org\"/><ref name=\"racing-reference.info\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touringcarracing.net/Races/1987%20Monza.html|title=1987 WTC - round 1|work=touringcarracing.net|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Mid-Ohio-1987-06-07.html|title=Mid-Ohio 500 Kilometres|publisher=Racing Sports Cars|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:962 Andrettis.jpg|right|thumb|Andretti's family 962C, Le Mans 1988]]\n[[File:1989Porsche962MarioAndrettiMichaelAndrettiMillerHighLife.jpg|thumb|right|Michael and Mario's 1989 [[Porsche 962]] driven in the [[24 Hours of Daytona]].]]\n\nFollowing Porsche's defeat in the [[1988 24 Hours of Daytona|1988 Daytona 24 Hours]], Porsche entered a [[Porsche 962|962C]] at [[1988 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] for Mario, Michael and John. They were tremendously competitive in the first half of the race, until the Andretti family's car needed minor repairs before lapsing on to five cylinders, finishing sixth overall.

He remained with Kraco, scoring a just one race win, in the non-champion [[Marlboro Challenge]].\n\n1989 saw a change of teams, which Michael switching to [[Newman/Haas Racing]], to partner, a certain Mario Andretti. Winning two races during the season, [[Honda Indy Toronto|Molson Indy Toronto]] and [[Firestone Indy 400|Marlboro 500]] at the [[Michigan International Speedway]], on his way to third in the standing. For 1990, [[Al Unser, Jr.]] would become champion, Andretti was his nearest competitor, winning five races and four poles. In the second-to-last race of the season at Nazareth, Unser crashed out, giving Andretti a huge opportunity to close the gap. Andretti managed only a sixth-place finish, and could not capitalize on Unser's misfortune. Unser left Nazareth with a 27-point lead, enough to clinch the championship. Andretti would finish runner-up once again.<ref name=\"racing-reference.info\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFor the 1991 Daytona 24, Mario was joined by both his sons this time, with Michael being joined by [[Jeff Andretti]]. Piloting a [[Dauer Sportwagen|Jochen Dauer Racing]] entered Porsche 962, they were classified fifth overall, despite not finishing the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Daytona-1991-02-03.html|title=Daytona 24 Hours|publisher=Racing Sports Cars|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MichaelAndretti.jpg|right|thumb|Andretti racing at [[Monterey, California]], October 1991]]\nAndretti achieved major title success by winning the [[1991 CART PPG Indy Car World Series]] for Newman/Haas Racing. He won a total eight of 17 races, eight poles and led more than half of the laps during the season, but Rahal still took the championship battle down to the final race of the season. Andretti's season started slowly, recording [[Did Not Finish|DNFs]] in the opening two events, then the heartbreaking second place at the Indy 500. He recovered from this, winning four of the last five races of the season and with Rahal retiring during the title decider at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]], he cruised to the title. The day before, he won the non-championship, [[Marlboro Challenge]] for a second time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/raceyear/1991/R|title=CART Results for 1991 |publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRemaining with Newman/Haas for 1992, Michael's season started slowly, but then wins three races out of four mid-season. Despite taking two more wins later in the year, including the season finale at Laguna Seca, Rahal beat him again to the title by just four points. He would leave for F1 at the end of the year, with his seat going to the reigning Formula One World Champion, [[Nigel Mansell]], who would win the 1993 CART title in his rookie season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/raceyear/1992/R|title=CART Results for 1992|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor four seasons between 1989 and 1992, Michael enjoyed the unique experience, privilege and honour of having his father as his teammate at Newman/Haas. Together, they established a number of first, including the first father-son front row, for the 1986 Dana 200 for Special Olympics at [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]], and the first of 15 father-son podiums in the 1984 Cribari Wines 300K at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]], with the last coming nearly a decade later in the [[1992 Daikyo IndyCar Grand Prix]], around the street of [[Surfers Paradise Street Circuit|Surfers Paradise]].<ref name=\"mshf.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/michael-andretti.html|title=Andretti, Michael - Open Wheel - 2008|publisher=Motorsports Hall of Fame of America|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"islandconnections.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.islandconnections.com/edit/andretti.htm|title=Michael Andretti - Racing's Top Driver & Successful Entrepreneur|publisher=Island Connections|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Futility at Indianapolis===\n\nThe Andretti family's bad luck at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] is known as the [[Andretti Curse]]. He shared Rookie of the Year honours with Guerrero in 1984, when he finished fifth. However, in [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991]], he led with 12 laps remaining, but finished second to [[Rick Mears]] after battling the multiple Indy 500 winner. The pair of them traded memorable late-lap outside passes for the lead in Turn One. The next year, [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992]], he dominated the race, leading four-fifths of the laps, but, with 11 laps remaining after holding a two-lap lead, his fuel pump failed, and his car coasted to a stop. He was classified in 13th place. He also dropped out while leading the Indy 500 in [[1989 Indianapolis 500|1989]], [[1995 Indianapolis 500|1995]] and [[2003 Indianapolis 500|2003]]. Andretti holds the record for [[List of Indianapolis 500 lap leaders|most laps led]] in the Indy 500 without having achieved a victory.<ref name=\"mshf.com\"/>\n\n===Formula One===\nFor the 1993 season, Michael signed for [[McLaren|Marlboro McLaren]], to partner the triple World Drivers' Champion [[Ayrton Senna]] in their [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] HBD [[V8]] powered [[McLaren MP4/8|MP4/8]]. He signed during the summer of 1992 and the deal was announced at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] over the weekend of the [[1992 Italian Grand Prix]].\n\n\"I think he can win Grands Prix and become the World Champion,\" said [[Ron Dennis]], McLaren's team principal. \"It's not a question of which country you come from. It's how you demonstrate your desire to win.\" There were practical factors that mitigated against Andretti being able to show competitive form in his debut season in F1. The rule changes introduced that season destroyed his hopes of unrestricted laps in free practice during which he could learn the tracks, as most were unfamiliar to him. From the start of 1993, just 23 laps were allowed in the morning's untimed session and only twelve in the qualifying session.<ref name=\"mclaren.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mclaren.com/formula1/heritage/driver/michael-andretti/|title=McLaren Formula 1 - Heritage - Michael Andretti|publisher=McLaren|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Andretti 1993 European GP.jpg|thumb|left|Andretti driving for [[McLaren]] at the [[1993 European Grand Prix]]]]\nWith the pressure intensifying, Michael began the year with crashes in the [[Kyalami]] and at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace|Interlagos]]. In the latter of these two, he had a massive collision at the start with Gerhard Berger in a Ferrari. He then qualified sixth for the [[1993 European Grand Prix|Sega European Grand Prix]] at [[Donington Park]], but he collided with [[Karl Wendlinger]]'s [[Sauber]] on the opening lap. Next time out at [[1993 San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]], he again fell foul of Wendlinger after a drive that might have ended with a visit to the podium, and many critics cited this as the key turning point for the American.<ref name=\"mclaren.com\"/><ref name=\"atlasf1.autosport.com\">{{cite web|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2000/ita/okeefe.html|title=Man for One Season|publisher=Atlas F1|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1993 Spanish Grand Prix|Gran Premio de Espa\u00f1a]], Andretti finally completed a race, finishing fifth amongst the established front runners.<ref name=\"atlasf1.autosport.com\"/> However, his showing was criticized by former McLaren World Champion [[James Hunt]] because Andretti was lapped by his teammate Senna.\n  \nHe would finish in the points on three occasions, but he could never quite string things together consistently. He never fully got to grips with the McLaren MP4/8. Highly technical aspects which he was not used to in the [[American Championship Car Racing#Comparison with Formula One|technologically simpler IndyCars]] such as [[active suspension]] and [[traction control system|traction control]] hampered Andretti's chances as did the standing starts used in F1. Some in the industry also felt that since he commuted to races and test sessions from the United States, rather than relocating full-time to Europe was also a contributing factor to his lack of success in Formula One. At the time, McLaren's Special Projects Manager, long-time Andretti family friend Tyler Alexander, who had been involved in F1 since the mid-1960s, had urged Michael to relocate to England as he knew times had changed from when Mario had raced to the 1978 World Championship. True enough, he finished third at Monza (which would prove to be his last Formula One race), but with three races remaining, he left the team and the championship by mutual agreement after the race.<ref name=\"mclaren.com\"/><ref name=\"atlasf1.autosport.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/08/sports/sports-people-auto-racing-andretti-switches-to-mclaren-team.html|title=Andretti Switches to McLaren Team|date=September 8, 1992|work=AP|via=The New York Times|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Michael's son [[Marco Andretti|Marco]], the McLaren team \"sabotaged\" his father's chances at being competitive in order to replace him with the team's test driver [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]], who would require a smaller salary. \"The reality of it was, they had Mika H\u00e4kkinen ready to come in for a lot less than what my dad was getting paid, and that's all it was. Right then and there, they had to make him look [bad],\" claimed Marco in 2008. \"They would make the car do weird things in the corner electronically, stuff out of his control.\" However, Andretti still had problems in practice for the [[1993 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]], and both he and Senna spun off with brake balance problems early in the race. Andretti was able to continue and fought back up to third, holding off Wendlinger. Throughout the season, Senna experienced similar reliability problems to Andretti, mainly electronic gremlins, particularly in [[1993 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]], [[1993 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], [[1993 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]] and [[1993 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]], although H\u00e4kkinen equalled Andretti's third place Monza finish in [[1993 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], while Senna won both the Japanese Grand Prix and the season ending [[1993 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]], his final race for McLaren.<ref name=\"mclaren.com\"/><ref name=\"atlasf1.autosport.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwherald.com/articles/2008/05/22/sports/other_sports/doc4835195490406345041530.txt|title=Local News and Video for McHenry County, Illinois|work=Northwest Herald}}{{cbignore}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr546.html|title=Portuguese GP, 1993 Race Report - GP Encyclopedia - F1 History on Grandprix.com|publisher=Grandprix.com|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr548.html|title=Australian GP, 1993 Race Report - GP Encyclopedia - F1 History on Grandprix.com|publisher=Grandprix.com|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref> And according to H\u00e4kkinen in a much later interview, Andretti was commuting to Europe from the United States, and was not in Europe enough when testing needed to be done, allowing H\u00e4kkinen to consistently show his speed and build a relationship with the team.

He went on to win in his very first race back in the series at the [[1994 Australian FAI Indycar Grand Prix]], around the [[Surfers Paradise Street Circuit]] in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], having led every lap along the way. That win also got [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]]'s first win in CART in their debut. Although the season may not have gone the way Michael would have liked, he did win again in the [[Honda Indy Toronto|Molson Indy Toronto]], taking a record fourth win. By the time he retired, Michael would have won seven times around the [[Exhibition Place]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/raceyear/1994/R|title=CART Results for 1994|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1995 PPG Indy Car World|1995]], he returned to [[Newman/Haas Racing]].

The following season, he would finish as runner-up to [[Jimmy Vasser]], in a season marred by the death of [[Jeff Krosnoff]] and split with [[IndyCar|Indy Racing League]], visiting victory lane on five occasions. Newman/Haas began a new relationship with [[Swift Engineering|Swift]] which did not prove to be very successful in 1997-1999. In 2000 the team used [[Lola Cars|Lola]] chassis and Michael won the [[Indy Japan 300|Firestone Firehawk 300]] held at [[Twin Ring Motegi]] in Japan, and again in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/raceyear/1995/R|title=CART Results for 1995|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/raceyear/1996/R|title=CART Results for 1996|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"grandprix.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-andmic.html|title=Michael Andretti Profile - Drivers - GP Encyclopedia - F1 History on Grandprix.com|publisher=Grandprix.com|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMichael tried again to win Le Mans in 1997, again alongside Mario, but joined on this occasion by [[Olivier Grouillard]].

Andretti ran in a third Team Green car with Motorola sponsorship and ran at Indianapolis. He led 16 laps, and was leading the race during a rain delay just beyond the halfway point. Had the race been halted due to the rain, he could have been declared the winner. The red flag, however, did not come out at the time and the race resumed. A punctured tyre, and a minor collision in the pits with eventual winner [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]], driving for car owner [[Roger Penske]], slowed him down, and at the end of the day, Andretti settled for 3rd place.

That year he bought into the \"Team Green\" squad run by brothers Kim and Barry Green in [[Champ Car|CART]].

Chrome wheels known as Gumby's are present on the targa top and convertible while the Z06 is fitted with chrome Spyder wheels. A body-colored spoiler shared with the ZR1 joins a \"carbon pattern\" engine cover, while a leather-wrapped ebony interior contains \"GT1\" embroidered on the head rests of the seats, the instrument panel and a center console armrest. Non-Z06 models also include a Z51 Performance Package and NPP Performance exhaust.\n\nOriginal production numbers were slated to be 100 units of each model in each color (600 total), each carrying a premium over the standard models. But actual numbers amounted to 125 units in various numbers for each color code. This was due to the government take over of General Motors.\n\n===Z06 Carbon Limited Edition (2011)===\nIn March 2010, Chevrolet announced that 500 units of the Z06 Carbon Limited Edition will be made available as a 2011 model beginning in Summer of 2010.

It came in second and third in its class, just behind the new [[Aston Martin DBR9]] race car. It was put on display a week later at the [[New York International Auto Show]] next to the Z06.\n\nIn 2006, the Corvette C6.R won both American Le Mans GT1 Championships: Teams and Manufacturers. On March 17, 2007 it won the GT1 class in the [[2007 12 Hours of Sebring|12 Hours of Sebring]].\n\nFor Le Mans 2007, four C6.R's were on the entry list, the two Corvette Racing entries joined by single entries from the Luc Alphand Aventures and PSI-Motorsport teams.\n\nThe heart of the C6.R, its LS7.R motor, was crowned as Global Motorsport Engine of the Year by a jury of 50 race engine engineers on the Professional Motorsport World Expo 2006 in Cologne, Germany.\n\nAs the GT1 class dwindled, Corvette Racing switched to the GT2 class during the 2009 ALMS season.\n\nFor 2011, the aerodynamics of the ALMS cars were modified to be similar to the [[Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1|ZR1]]. This car has since won the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in the GTE-Pro and GTE-Am classes. In 2012, the Corvette C6.R won again in the GTE-Am category.\n\nIn addition to the [[American Le Mans Series]], Corvette C6.Rs also race in the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]]. The GT1 cars are given more power and have less aerodynamics restrictions than the Le Mans cars, which follow GT2 regulations.\n\n===Riley GT===\n\n[[Riley Technologies]] built a GT2-class Chevrolet Corvette for the [[2008 American Le Mans Series]].

Changes were necessary to make the car endurance race ready. These include a stripped interior, full rollcage for safety, [[Centerlock wheel|center-locking wheels]], carbon fiber doors, rear deck spoiler and front splitter. The LS7 and LS3-engine and drivetrain are built by APP Racing Engines from the Netherlands. The car is not road legal.\n\nEight Z06-R were constructed by Callaway Competition GmbH<ref>[[Callaway Cars#C15 .28FIA Corvette GT3.29]]</ref> in [[Leingarten]], Germany, for the 2006 season.

It is the place from where the [[Franciscan]] movement started.\n\nThe name Portiuncola (meaning \u201csmall portion of land\u201d) was first mentioned in a document from 1045, now in the archives of the [[Assisi Cathedral]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to a legend, whose existence can be traced back with certainty only to 1645, the little chapel of Porziuncola was erected under [[Pope Liberius]] (352-366) by hermits from the [[Valley of Josaphat]], who had brought relics from the grave of the Blessed Virgin. The same legend relates that the chapel passed into the possession of [[Benedict of Nursia]] in 516. It was known as Our Lady of the Valley of Josaphat or of the Angels \u2013 the latter title referring, according to some, to the [[assumption of Mary]] accompanied by angels; a better-founded opinion attributes the name to a legend attesting to the singing of angels which had been frequently heard there.<ref name=bihl>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12286a.htm Bihl, Michael. \"Portiuncula.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 28 Apr. 2014]</ref>\n\nThe chapel was located on a small portion of land (\"Portiuncula\") belonging to the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] of [[Monte Subasio]]. Later, the name of the land passed to the little church itself.<ref name=\"Indulgence\"/> It was in bad condition, lying abandoned in a wood of oak trees. \n\nAfter a pilgrimage to Rome, where he begged at the church doors for the poor, [[Francis of Assisi|Francis]] said he had had a mystical vision of Jesus Christ in the wayside chapel of San Damiano, about two miles outside of Assisi, in which the Icon of Christ Crucified came alive and said to him three times, \"Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you can see, is falling into ruins\". Francis took this literally to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so sold his horse and some cloth from his father's store, to assist the priest there for this purpose. His father Pietro, highly indignant, sought restitution. After a final interview in the presence of the bishop, Francis renounced his father and his patrimony, laying aside even the garments he had received from him. For the next couple of months he lived as a beggar in the region of Assisi. Returning to the town for two years this time, he restored several ruined churches, among them the Porziuncola, little chapel of St Mary of the Angels, just outside the town.<ref name=robinson>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06221a.htm Robinson, Paschal. \"St. Francis of Assisi.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 29 Apr. 2014]</ref>\n\n[[File:Evora66.jpg|thumb|left|The miracle of the Porziuncola; painting by Antonio de Oliveira Bernardes (1698); [[Cathedral of \u00c9vora]], Portugal.]]\nFrancis built himself a small hut near the Chapel of Our Lady of the Angels and was soon joined by others. Here he founded the [[Franciscan]]s. Around 1211 the small chapel was given to Francis by the [[abbot]] of Saint Benedict of Monte Subasio on condition of making it the mother house of his religious family. On Palm Sunday 1211 St Francis received in this church [[Clare of Assisi]] and founded the Second Order of the Poor Ladies [[Poor Clares]]. Adjoining this humble sanctuary, already dear to Francis, the first Franciscan convent was formed by the erection of a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge.<ref name=robinson/>\n\nThe General Chapters, the annual meetings of the friars, were held in this church usually during [[Pentecost]] (months of May \u2013 June).\n\nFeeling his end approaching, St Francis asked to be brought back to the Portiuncola in September 1226. On his death-bed St Francis recommended the chapel to the faithful protection and care of his brethren. He died, in his cell, not fifteen yards from the church, at sunset on Saturday, 3 October 1226. \n\nHowever this may be, here or in this neighbourhood was the cradle of the Franciscan Order. After the death of Francis, the spiritual value and the charisma of the Porziuncola became even greater. St Francis himself pointed out the Portiuncola as a primary source of inspiration and a model for all his followers.\n\n==Later developments==\nConcerning the form and plan of the first monastery built near the chapel we have no information, nor is the exact form of the loggia or platforms built round the chapel itself, or of the choir for the brothers built behind it, known. Shortly after 1290, the chapel, which measured only about 5.5 by 3.2&nbsp;m, became entirely inadequate to accommodate the throngs of pilgrims. The altar piece, an ''Annunciation'', was painted by the priest Hilarius of Viterbo in 1393. The monastery was at most the residence, only for a short time, of the ministers-general of the order after St Francis. In 1415 it first became associated with the Regular Observance, in the care of which it remains to the present day. \n[[Image:S.Maria.degli.Angeli17.jpg|thumb|230px|Side view of the Portiuncola.]]\n\n==Decorations of the Porziuncola==\nThis tiny church is exquisitely decorated by artists from different periods. On the fa\u00e7ade, above the entrance outside, is a fresco by [[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]] (1829), depicting St Francis receiving from the Christ and the Virgin the indulgence, known as the \u201cPardon of Assisi\u201d. The German painter Overbeck was a member of the [[Nazarene movement]], a group of painters who aimed to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art. At the base of this fresco is a small rectangular fresco beneath which are the Latin words ''Haec est porta vitae aeternae'' (\"This is the gate to eternal life\")\n[[Image:S.M.degli.Angeli024.jpg|thumb|right|''St Francis receiving the Pardon of Assisi'' by F. Overbeck.]]\nThe outside wall to the right of the entrance shows fragments of two frescoes by unknown Umbrian artists. In the 19th century a door was opened in the same wall, to control the flow of pilgrims. The left outside wall includes the tombstone of [[Pietro Cattani]], who died on 10 March 1221. (St Francis was still alive at the time of his death). At the back, above the entrance, is the fresco ''Crucifixion'' by [[Pietro Vannucci|Perugino]], painted around 1485. It was badly damaged during the construction of the basilica. The 15th century door is decorated with floral motifs. On top of the Porziuncola stands a small Gothic belfry.\n\nThe interior is austere and simple. Some of the rough, squared stones, taken from Mount Subasio, were put in place by the saint himself while repairing this little church. It is decorated in a simple Gothic style with frescoes from the 14th and the 15th century. But the masterpiece is the six-part fresco in the apse of this little church, painted by the priest Ilario da Viterbo (1393): \n*''The Annunciation'' (middle)\n*''St Francis Throws Himself into the Thorny Brambles'' (right)\n*''St Francis Accompanied by Two Angels'' (right)\n*''Apparition of Christ and the Virgin, Accompanied by 60 Angels, with St Francis Offering Roses'' (top)\n*''St Francis imploring pope Honorius III the Confirmation of the Indulgence'' (left)\n*''St Francis Promulgates the Indulgence, Accompanied by the Bishops of Umbria'' (left)\n\nThe pavement on the floor is now restored to its original appearance by the restorations following the earthquake of 1997.\n\n==Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli==\n{{Main|Papal Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels in Assisi}}\nThe buildings which had been gradually added to the shrine were taken down by order of [[Pope Pius V]] (1566\u20131572), except the cell in which St Francis had died, and were replaced by a large basilica in contemporary style. The new edifice was erected over the cell just mentioned and over the Portiuncula chapel, which is situated immediately under the cupola. The [[basilica]], which has three naves and a circle of chapels extending along the entire length of the aisles, was completed (1569\u201378) according to the plans of [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]], assisted by [[Galeazzo Alessi]]. \n\nIn the night of 15 March 1832, the arch of the three naves and of the choir fell in, in consequence of an earthquake, the cupola sporting a big crack. Gregory XVI had all restored in 1836-1840), and on 8 September 1840, the basilica was reconsecrated by Cardinal Lambruschini. By Brief of 11 April 1909, [[Pope Pius X]] raised it to a \"[[Major basilica|patriarchal basilica]] and papal chapel\". The high altar was therefore immediately rebuilt at the expense of the Franciscan province of the Holy Cross (also known as the Saxon province), and a papal throne added. Under the bay of the choir, resting against the columns of the cupola, is still preserved the cell in which St Francis died, while, a little behind the sacristy, is the spot where the saint, during a temptation, is said to have rolled in a briar-bush, which was then changed into thornless roses. During this same night the saint received the Porziuncola Indulgence.\n\n==Feast Day and Portiuncola Indulgence==\nFranciscans continue to celebrate the feast of Our Lady of the Angels of the Porzioncula on August 2,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calledbymary.org/franciscan-feast-days.html|title=Franciscan Feast Days|website=The Franciscans of Mary the Theotokos|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> which marks the dedication of the church.<ref>[https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/friar-lauds-indulgence-as-a-way-to-connect-with-st-francis Bunderson, Carl. \"On Aug. 2, you can get this St. Francis-themed indulgence\", Catholic News agency, August 2, 2013]</ref>\n\nThe '''Porziuncola [[Indulgence]]''' could at first be gained only in the Porziuncola chapel between the afternoon of 1 August and sunset on 2 August.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wshYVi3KM4C&pg=RA1-PA246-IA1&lpg=RA1-PA246-IA1&dq=Albert+of+Pisa&source=bl&ots=mxGwNqGdbm&sig=ACfU3U00LUW1A4CWfBTnQgmJk8hAOnEnVw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjRoPb64uvmAhUOrVkKHcFbDxI4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=Albert%20of%20Pisa&f=false Arnald of Sarrant. \"The Generalate of Brother Albert of Pisa\", ''Chronicle of the Twenty-Four Generals of the Order of Friars Minor'', (Noel Muscat ofm, trans.) Ordo Fratrum Minorum. Malta, 2010]</ref> On 5 August 1480 (or 1481), [[Pope Sixtus IV]] extended it to all churches of the first and second orders of St Francis for Franciscans. On 4 July 1622, [[Gregory XV]] extended the privilege to all the faithful, who, after confession and the reception of Holy Communion, visited such churches on the appointed day. On 12 October 1622, Gregory XV granted the same privilege to all the churches of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]]. [[Pope Urban VIII]] granted it for all churches of the regular [[Third Order]] on 13 January 1643, and [[Clement X]] for all churches of the [[Conventuals]] on 3 October 1670.\n\nWhile papal declarations made the Porziuncola Indulgence indisputable from the juridico-canonistic standpoint, its historical authenticity (i.e. origin from St Francis) remains in question. None of the old legends of St Francis mentions the Indulgence, nor does any contemporary document mention it. The oldest document mentioning the Indulgence is a notary's deed of 31 October 1277, in which Blessed [[Benedict of Arezzo]] (whom St Francis himself received into the order) testifies that he had been informed by Brother Masseo (a companion of St Francis) that [[Pope Honorius III]] granted the indulgence at Perugia. Later testimonies include those of [[Jacob Cappoli]] concerning [[Brother Leo]], of [[Oddo of Acquasparta]], [[Peter Zalfani]], [[Peter John Olivi]] (who wrote a scholastic tract defending this indulgence about 1279), [[John of Laverna]], [[Ubertino da Casale]], and [[Francis of Fabriano]] (whose testimony goes back to the year 1268). \n\nLater popes extended the privilege to all churches pertaining in any way to the Franciscan Order, even to churches in which the Third Order held its meetings (even parish churches, etc.), provided that there was no Franciscan church in the district, and that such a church was distant over an Italian mile (1000 paces). Even districts and countries could receive special privileges. \n\n[[Pope Paul VI]] completely reformed the grants of indulgences, after the [[Second Vatican Council]]. His Apostolic Constitution \"Indulgentiarum Doctrina\" (1967), yet again confirmed the Portiuncula Indulgence. According to the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, Catholic faithful may gain a plenary indulgence on 2 August (the Portiuncula) or on such other day as designated by the local ordinary for the advantage of the faithful, under the usual conditions (sacramental Confession, Holy Communion, and prayer for the intentions of the Supreme Pontiff), by devoutly visiting the parish church, and there reciting at least the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. The Indulgence applies to the cathedral church of the diocese, and to the co-cathedral church (if there is one), even if they are not parochial, and also to quasi-parochial churches. To gain this, as any plenary indulgence, the faithful must be free from any attachment to sin, even venial sin.

It is the place from where the [[Franciscan]] movement started.\n\nThe name Portiuncola (meaning \u201csmall portion of land\u201d) was first mentioned in a document from 1045, now in the archives of the [[Assisi Cathedral]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to a legend, whose existence can be traced back with certainty only to 1645, the little chapel of Porziuncola was erected under [[Pope Liberius]] (352-366) by hermits from the [[Valley of Josaphat]], who had brought relics from the grave of the Blessed Virgin. The same legend relates that the chapel passed into the possession of [[Benedict of Nursia]] in 516. It was known as Our Lady of the Valley of Josaphat or of the Angels - the latter title referring, according to some, to the [[assumption of Mary]] accompanied by angels; a better-founded opinion attributes the name to a legend attesting to the singing of angels which had been frequently heard there.<ref name=bihl>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12286a.htm Bihl, Michael. \"Portiuncula.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 28 Apr. 2014]</ref>\n\nThe chapel was located on a small portion of land (\"Portiuncula\") belonging to the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] of [[Monte Subasio]]. Later, the name of the land passed to the little church itself.<ref name=\"Indulgence\"/> It was in bad condition, lying abandoned in a wood of oak trees. \n\nAfter a pilgrimage to Rome, where he begged at the church doors for the poor, [[Francis of Assisi|Francis]] said he had had a mystical vision of Jesus Christ in the wayside chapel of San Damiano, about two miles outside of Assisi, in which the Icon of Christ Crucified came alive and said to him three times, \"Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you can see, is falling into ruins\". Francis took this literally to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so sold his horse and some cloth from his father's store, to assist the priest there for this purpose.  His father Pietro, highly indignant, sought restitution. After a final interview in the presence of the bishop, Francis renounced his father and his patrimony, laying aside even the garments he had received from him. For the next couple of months he lived as a beggar in the region of Assisi. Returning to the town for two years this time, he restored several ruined churches, among them the Porziuncola, little chapel of St Mary of the Angels, just outside the town.<ref name=robinson>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06221a.htm Robinson, Paschal. \"St. Francis of Assisi.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 29 Apr. 2014]</ref>\n\n[[File:Evora66.jpg|thumb|left|The miracle of the Porziuncola; painting by Antonio de Oliveira Bernardes (1698); [[Cathedral of \u00c9vora]], Portugal.]]\nFrancis built himself a small hut near the Chapel of Our Lady of the Angels and was soon joined by others. Here he founded the [[Franciscan]]s. Around 1211 the small chapel was given to Francis by the [[abbot]] of Saint Benedict of Monte Subasio on condition of making it the mother house of his religious family. On Palm Sunday 1211 St. Francis received in this church [[Clare of Assisi]] and founded the Second Order of the Poor Ladies [[Poor Clares]]. Adjoining this humble sanctuary, already dear to Francis, the first Franciscan convent was formed by the erection of a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge.<ref name=robinson/>\n\nThe General Chapters, the annual meetings of the friars, were held in this church usually during [[Pentecost]] (months of May - June).\n\nFeeling his end approaching, St. Francis asked to be brought back to the Portiuncola in September 1226. On his death-bed St. Francis recommended the chapel to the faithful protection and care of his brethren. He died, in his cell, not fifteen yards from the church, at sunset on Saturday, 3 October 1226. \n\nHowever this may be, here or in this neighbourhood was the cradle of the Franciscan Order. After the death of Francis, the spiritual value and the charisma of the Porziuncola became even greater. St. Francis himself pointed out the Portiuncola as a primary source of inspiration and a model for all his followers.\n\n==Later developments==\nConcerning the form and plan of the first monastery built near the chapel we have no information, nor is the exact form of the loggia or platforms built round the chapel itself, or of the choir for the brothers built behind it, known. Shortly after 1290, the chapel, which measured only about 5.5 by 3.2&nbsp;m, became entirely inadequate to accommodate the throngs of pilgrims. The altar piece, an ''Annunciation'', was painted by the priest Hilarius of Viterbo in 1393. The monastery was at most the residence, only for a short time, of the ministers-general of the order after St. Francis. In 1415 it first became associated with the Regular Observance, in the care of which it remains to the present day. \n[[Image:S.Maria.degli.Angeli17.jpg|thumb|230px|Side view of the Portiuncola.]]\n\n==Decorations of the Porziuncola==\nThis tiny church is exquisitely decorated by artists from different periods. On the fa\u00e7ade, above the entrance outside, is a fresco by [[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]] (1829), depicting St Francis receiving from the Christ and the Virgin the indulgence, known as the \u201cPardon of Assisi\u201d. The German painter Overbeck was a member of the [[Nazarene movement]], a group of painters who aimed to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art. At the base of this fresco is a small rectangular fresco beneath which are the Latin words ''Haec est porta vitae aeternae'' (\"This is the gate to eternal life\")\n[[Image:S.M.degli.Angeli024.jpg|thumb|right|''St. Francis receiving the Pardon of Assisi'' by F. Overbeck.]]\nThe outside wall to the right of the entrance shows fragments of two frescoes by unknown Umbrian artists. In the 19th century a door was opened in the same wall, to control the flow of pilgrims. The left outside wall includes the tombstone of [[Pietro Cattani]], who died on 10 March 1221. (St. Francis was still alive at the time of his death).  At the back, above the entrance, is the fresco ''Crucifixion'' by [[Pietro Vannucci|Perugino]], painted around 1485. It was badly damaged during the construction of the basilica. The 15th century door is decorated with floral motifs. On top of the Porziuncola stands a small Gothic belfry.\n\nThe interior is austere and simple. Some of the rough, squared stones, taken from Mount Subasio, were put in place by the saint himself while repairing this little church. It is decorated in a simple Gothic style with frescoes from the 14th and the 15th century. But the masterpiece is the six-part fresco in the apse of this little church, painted by the priest Ilario da Viterbo (1393): \n*''The Annunciation'' (middle)\n*''St Francis Throws Himself into the Thorny Brambles'' (right)\n*''St Francis Accompanied by Two Angels'' (right)\n*''Apparition of Christ and the Virgin, Accompanied by 60 Angels, with St. Francis Offering Roses'' (top)\n*''St. Francis imploring pope Honorius III the Confirmation of the Indulgence'' (left)\n*''St. Francis Promulgates the Indulgence, Accompanied by the Bishops of Umbria'' (left)\n\nThe pavement on the floor is now restored to its original appearance by the restorations following the earthquake of 1997.\n\n==Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli==\n{{Main|Papal Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels in Assisi}}\nThe buildings which had been gradually added to the shrine were taken down by order of [[Pope Pius V]] (1566\u20131572), except the cell in which St. Francis had died, and were replaced by a large basilica in contemporary style. The new edifice was erected over the cell just mentioned and over the Portiuncula chapel, which is situated immediately under the cupola. The [[basilica]], which has three naves and a circle of chapels extending along the entire length of the aisles, was completed (1569\u201378) according to the plans of [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]], assisted by [[Galeazzo Alessi]]. \n\nIn the night of 15 March 1832, the arch of the three naves and of the choir fell in, in consequence of an earthquake, the cupola sporting a big crack. Gregory XVI had all restored in 1836-1840), and on 8 September 1840, the basilica was reconsecrated by Cardinal Lambruschini. By Brief of 11 April 1909, [[Pope Pius X]] raised it to a \"[[Major basilica|patriarchal basilica]] and papal chapel\". The high altar was therefore immediately rebuilt at the expense of the Franciscan province of the Holy Cross (also known as the Saxon province), and a papal throne added. Under the bay of the choir, resting against the columns of the cupola, is still preserved the cell in which St. Francis died, while, a little behind the sacristy, is the spot where the saint, during a temptation, is said to have rolled in a briar-bush, which was then changed into thornless roses. During this same night the saint received the Porziuncola Indulgence.\n\n==Feast Day and Portiuncola Indulgence==\nFranciscans continue to celebrate the feast of Our Lady of the Angels of the Porzioncula on August 2,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calledbymary.org/franciscan-feast-days.html|title=Franciscan Feast Days|website=The Franciscans of Mary the Theotokos|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> which marks the dedication of the church.<ref>[https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/friar-lauds-indulgence-as-a-way-to-connect-with-st-francis Bunderson, Carl. \"On Aug. 2, you can get this St. Francis-themed indulgence\", Catholic News agency, August 2, 2013]</ref>\n\nThe '''Porziuncola [[Indulgence]]''' could at first be gained only in the Porziuncola chapel between the afternoon of 1 August and sunset on 2 August.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wshYVi3KM4C&pg=RA1-PA246-IA1&lpg=RA1-PA246-IA1&dq=Albert+of+Pisa&source=bl&ots=mxGwNqGdbm&sig=ACfU3U00LUW1A4CWfBTnQgmJk8hAOnEnVw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjRoPb64uvmAhUOrVkKHcFbDxI4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=Albert%20of%20Pisa&f=false Arnald of Sarrant. \"The Generalate of Brother Albert of Pisa\", ''Chronicle of the Twenty-Four Generals of the Order of Friars Minor'', (Noel Muscat ofm, trans.) Ordo Fratrum Minorum. Malta, 2010]</ref> On 5 August 1480 (or 1481), [[Pope Sixtus IV]] extended it to all churches of the first and second orders of St. Francis for Franciscans. On 4 July 1622, [[Gregory XV]] extended the privilege to all the faithful, who, after confession and the reception of Holy Communion, visited such churches on the appointed day. On 12 October 1622, Gregory XV granted the same privilege to all the churches of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]]. [[Pope Urban VIII]] granted it for all churches of the regular [[Third Order]] on 13 January 1643, and [[Clement X]] for all churches of the [[Conventuals]] on 3 October 1670.\n\nWhile papal declarations made the Porziuncola Indulgence indisputable from the juridico-canonistic standpoint, its historical authenticity (i.e. origin from St. Francis) remains in question. None of the old legends of St. Francis mentions the Indulgence, nor does any contemporary document mention it. The oldest document mentioning the Indulgence is a notary's deed of 31 October 1277, in which Blessed [[Benedict of Arezzo]] (whom St. Francis himself received into the order) testifies that he had been informed by Brother Masseo (a companion of St. Francis) that [[Pope Honorius III]] granted the indulgence at Perugia. Later testimonies include those of [[Jacob Cappoli]] concerning [[Brother Leo]], of [[Oddo of Acquasparta]], [[Peter Zalfani]], [[Peter John Olivi]] (who wrote a scholastic tract defending this indulgence about 1279), [[John of Laverna]], [[Ubertino da Casale]], and [[Francis of Fabriano]] (whose testimony goes back to the year 1268). \n\nLater popes extended the privilege to all churches pertaining in any way to the Franciscan Order, even to churches in which the Third Order held its meetings (even parish churches, etc.), provided that there was no Franciscan church in the district, and that such a church was distant over an Italian mile (1000 paces). Even districts and countries could receive special privileges. \n\n[[Pope Paul VI]] completely reformed the grants of indulgences, after the [[Second Vatican Council]]. His Apostolic Constitution \"Indulgentiarum Doctrina\" (1967), yet again confirmed the Portiuncula Indulgence. According to the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, Catholic faithful may gain a plenary indulgence on 2 August (the Portiuncula) or on such other day as designated by the local ordinary for the advantage of the faithful, under the usual conditions (sacramental Confession, Holy Communion, and prayer for the intentions of the Supreme Pontiff), by devoutly visiting the parish church, and there reciting at least the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. The Indulgence applies to the cathedral church of the diocese, and to the co-cathedral church (if there is one), even if they are not parochial, and also to quasi-parochial churches. To gain this, as any plenary indulgence, the faithful must be free from any attachment to sin, even venial sin. Where this entire detachment is wanting, the indulgence is partial.<ref name=\"Indulgence\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/archive/stfrancis/stf_portuncula_indulgence.htm|title=The Portiuncula Indulgence|accessdate=2010-10-06|publisher=Franciscan Friars, TOR}}</ref>\n\n==Porziuncola in America==\nIn San Francisco, California, there is a replica of the Porziuncola Chapel.

It spanned three issues each of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #225-227, ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #24-26, and ''[[New Mutants]]''  #59-61; unlike most crossovers however, the various titles' storylines did not intertwine, but were instead linked thematically as each team underwent major ordeals and drastic changes in their status quo.\n\nThe 1990 computer game ''[[X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants]]'' was based on this storyline.\n\n==Promotion==\n[[Image:Mutant Reg Ad.JPG|250px|left|thumb|The faux-advertisement for the Mutant Registration Act. The \"mutie\" is [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]. Art by [[Jon Bogdanove]].]] Marvel Comics used a novel approach in advertising the crossover event. A major element within the stories at the time was the public's growing concern over the \"[[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] menace\" and [[Senator Robert Kelly]]'s proposed [[Mutant Registration Act]], which foreshadowed the dystopian future shown in \"[[Days of Future Past]]\". Marvel distributed postcard-size mock advertisements supporting the act in comic book stores as well as their various titles [[cover date]]d \"November 1987\". Asking \"Do You Know What Your Children Are?\", the card further suggested that anyone who knew themselves to be a mutant should fill out the form on the back and mail it in to register themselves with the government.\n\n==Plot summary==\n''The Fall of the Mutants'' consists of three separate non-intersecting storylines: one involving the X-Men, one involving X-Factor, and the other concerning the New Mutants.\n\n===Uncanny X-Men===\nThe [[X-Men]] head to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in search of their missing and de-powered leader [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], herself seeking the mutant inventor [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] to restore her powers. Upon arrival, they encounter [[Freedom Force (comics)#Mystique's Freedom Force|Freedom Force]], a government-sanctioned strike team of reformed villains led by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who are under orders to arrest the X-Men for refusing to comply with the Mutant Registration Act, and a fight ensues. Freedom Force's mutant [[precognition|precognitive]] [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] then has a vision: everyone inside a particular Dallas skyscraper at dawn will be dead. Once it begins snowing \u2014 in Texas, in the middle of summer \u2014 and as [[caveman|cavemen]], dinosaurs, and other strange peoples and creatures begin appearing, the two teams realize that something of immense significance is occurring. Calling a temporary truce, they turn to restore order to the chaos engulfing the city.  Many of the events are broadcast on television by a reporter [[Neal Conan]] and cameraman [[Manoli Wetherell]], who accompany the X-Men and Freedom Force.\n\nStorm and Forge meanwhile find themselves in a pristine, natural world all to themselves. In this new Earth, time proceeds at an accelerated rate, and while only a few moments pass in the main reality, a year does for them. Storm, still hating the man she once loved (as Forge invented the Neutralizer gun that removed her mutant powers),<ref>'' The Uncanny X-Men'' #185\u2013186</ref> spends most of the year in solitude until she is finally ready to make her peace with him. Forge meanwhile had been developing technology from the ground up, eventually creating the tools \u2014 and with circuitry sourced from dismantling his bionic arm and leg \u2014 enabling him to build a device that restores Storm's weather manipulation powers. Storm, after months of being grounded, takes to the skies again with joy. Forge uses his shamanic magic in conjunction with her lightning bolts to open a portal back to Dallas.\n\nTime and space meanwhile run amok in the city, as the X-Men and Freedom Force find themselves amidst a scene from the [[Vietnam War]]. It is revealed that during his tour of duty, Forge had used his shamanic powers to summon a demon to avenge his fallen comrades. However, in his naivet\u00e9, he did not realize that the spell required the souls of his nine comrades and unleashed a horde of demons he had no way to control, including the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], the creature responsible for the chaos they now found themselves in.\n\nAs Storm and Forge join the battle, it quickly becomes apparent that the Adversary cannot be defeated, and the only way to be rid of him is for Forge to cast the same spell and seal him away forever. Millions watch the television broadcast (including a horrified [[Kitty Pryde]]) as Forge casts the spell, using the souls of the nine X-Men (Storm, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[Psylocke]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]' estranged wife [[Madelyne Pryor]]) to fuel it. As foreseen by Destiny, the X-Men die. However, the goddess [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], who had also become embroiled in the day's events, takes pity on the X-Men for their noble sacrifice and returns them all to life, additionally commenting to them that as foul and evil as the Adversary is, he should not and cannot be locked away forever, since from the chaos he creates positive change and growth occurs. However, he was bound for an age, which Roma decreed was sufficient punishment for his crime. She additionally made the X-Men invisible to all forms of surveillance save plain sight, thus allowing them to continue with their operations while the world assumes they are dead. Believing that if the world thinks the X-Men are dead they will have the freedom to fight their enemies without the people they cared for being hurt as collateral damage. Before they head to Australia to establish a new base, she gives them the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], telling them they could use it to 'reset' time should they be discovered.\n\n===X-Factor===\nX-Factor ([[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]]) is transported to the [[Ship (comics)|Ship]] of the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Offered a place by his side in his evolutionary war against humans, they refuse, and a battle ensues between X-Factor and his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]]. The horseman Death then reveals himself to be their former teammate [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], thought dead and now remade in Apocalypse's image with deadly, razor-sharp wings. He quickly defeats the team and they are restrained save for Caliban, who surrenders himself to Apocalypse in return for powers like Death. Apocalypse then unleashes his Horsemen on New York City and tries to force the heroes to watch. They are able to break free of their restraints, and attempt to stop the Horseman. In the process, they accidentally cause Apocalypse's airship to lose control, damaging several skyscrapers as it loses altitude. The preteen superhero team [[Power Pack]] helps limit the damage, destroying part of the airship's engine cowling just before the cowling would have impacted the [[Statue of Liberty]]. As the team battles the Horsemen, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] comes up with an idea to stop Death, and creates a statue of himself out of ice. Death attacks and breaks the statue and, thinking it is actually Iceman, is overcome with guilt and switches sides. Apocalypse easily repels his attacks, but decides to make a tactical withdrawal anyway. After he leaves, the team attempts to regain control of Apocalypse's airship, eventually bringing it to land on top of their headquarters, crushing it.\n\n===The New Mutants===\nThe New Mutants ([[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], [[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]], [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]])  head off to visit their friend [[Bird-Brain (Marvel Comics)|Bird-Brain]] on his remote island. There, they quickly discover that Bird-Brain's creator, the Ani-Mator, is creating more semi-sentient creatures (the Ani-Mates), which he mistreats and experiments on. As the team attempts to free them, the anti-mutant organization known as [[The Right (comics)|The Right]] tracks them down and attacks. During the three-pronged battle, Cypher is shot and killed, taking a bullet meant for Wolfsbane. Eventually, Bird-Brain defeats the Ani-Mator and becomes king of the Ani-Mates, and Magik teleports the Right's soldiers, along with the Ani-Mator himself, to [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. They then return home, where [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] (headmaster of the Xavier School in [[Professor X]]'s absence) blames humanity for Cypher's death.

It spanned three issues each of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #225-227, ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #24-26, and ''[[New Mutants]]''  #59-61; unlike most crossovers however, the various titles' storylines did not intertwine, but were instead linked thematically as each team underwent major ordeals and drastic changes in their status quo.\n\nThe 1990 computer game ''[[X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants]]'' was based on this storyline.\n\n==Promotion==\n[[Image:Mutant Reg Ad.JPG|250px|left|thumb|The faux-advertisement for the Mutant Registration Act. The \"mutie\" is [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]. Art by [[Jon Bogdanove]].]] Marvel Comics used a novel approach in advertising the crossover event. A major element within the stories at the time was the public's growing concern over the \"[[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] menace\" and [[Senator Robert Kelly]]'s proposed [[Mutant Registration Act]], which foreshadowed the dystopian future shown in \"[[Days of Future Past]]\". Marvel distributed postcard-size mock advertisements supporting the act in comic book stores as well as their various titles [[cover date]]d \"November 1987\". Asking \"Do You Know What Your Children Are?\", the card further suggested that anyone who knew themselves to be a mutant should fill out the form on the back and mail it in to register themselves with the government.\n\n==Plot summary==\n''The Fall of the Mutants'' consists of three separate non-intersecting storylines: one involving the X-Men, one involving X-Factor, and the other concerning the New Mutants.\n\n===Uncanny X-Men===\nThe [[X-Men]] head to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in search of their missing and de-powered leader [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], herself seeking the mutant inventor [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] to restore her powers. Upon arrival, they encounter [[Freedom Force (comics)#Mystique's Freedom Force|Freedom Force]], a government-sanctioned strike team of reformed villains led by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who are under orders to arrest the X-Men for refusing to comply with the Mutant Registration Act, and a fight ensues. Freedom Force's mutant [[precognition|precognitive]] [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] then has a vision: everyone inside a particular Dallas skyscraper at dawn will be dead. Once it begins snowing \u2014 in Texas, in the middle of summer \u2014 and as [[caveman|cavemen]], dinosaurs, and other strange peoples and creatures begin appearing, the two teams realize that something of immense significance is occurring. Calling a temporary truce, they turn to restore order to the chaos engulfing the city.  Many of the events are broadcast on television by a reporter [[Neal Conan]] and cameraman [[Manoli Wetherell]], who accompany the X-Men and Freedom Force.\n\nStorm and Forge meanwhile find themselves in a pristine, natural world all to themselves. In this new Earth, time proceeds at an accelerated rate, and while only a few moments pass in the main reality, a year does for them. Storm, still hating the man she once loved (as Forge invented the Neutralizer gun that removed her mutant powers),<ref>'' The Uncanny X-Men'' #185\u2013186</ref> spends most of the year in solitude until she is finally ready to make her peace with him. Forge meanwhile had been developing technology from the ground up, eventually creating the tools \u2014 and with circuitry sourced from dismantling his bionic arm and leg \u2014 enabling him to build a device that restores Storm's weather manipulation powers. Storm, after months of being grounded, takes to the skies again with joy. Forge uses his shamanic magic in conjunction with her lightning bolts to open a portal back to Dallas.\n\nTime and space meanwhile run amok in the city, as the X-Men and Freedom Force find themselves amidst a scene from the [[Vietnam War]]. It is revealed that during his tour of duty, Forge had used his shamanic powers to summon a demon to avenge his fallen comrades. However, in his naivet\u00e9, he did not realize that the spell required the souls of his nine comrades and unleashed a horde of demons he had no way to control, including the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], the creature responsible for the chaos they now found themselves in.\n\nAs Storm and Forge join the battle, it quickly becomes apparent that the Adversary cannot be defeated, and the only way to be rid of him is for Forge to cast the same spell and seal him away forever. Millions watch the television broadcast (including a horrified [[Kitty Pryde]]) as Forge casts the spell, using the souls of the nine X-Men (Storm, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[Psylocke]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]' estranged wife [[Madelyne Pryor]]) to fuel it. As foreseen by Destiny, the X-Men die. However, the goddess [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], who had also become embroiled in the day's events, takes pity on the X-Men for their noble sacrifice and returns them all to life, additionally commenting to them that as foul and evil as the Adversary is, he should not and cannot be locked away forever, since from the chaos he creates positive change and growth occurs. However, he was bound for an age, which Roma decreed was sufficient punishment for his crime. She additionally made the X-Men invisible to all forms of surveillance save plain sight, thus allowing them to continue with their operations while the world assumes they are dead. Believing that if the world thinks the X-Men are dead they will have the freedom to fight their enemies without the people they cared for being hurt as collateral damage. Before they head to Australia to establish a new base, she gives them the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], telling them they could use it to 'reset' time should they be discovered.\n\n===X-Factor===\nX-Factor ([[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]]) is transported to the [[Ship (comics)|Ship]] of the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Offered a place by his side in his evolutionary war against humans, they refuse, and a battle ensues between X-Factor and his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]]. The horseman Death then reveals himself to be their former teammate [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], thought dead and now remade in Apocalypse's image with deadly, razor-sharp wings. He quickly defeats the team and they are restrained save for Caliban, who surrenders himself to Apocalypse in return for powers like Death. Apocalypse then unleashes his Horsemen on New York City and tries to force the heroes to watch. They are able to break free of their restraints, and attempt to stop the Horseman. In the process, they accidentally cause Apocalypse's airship to lose control, damaging several skyscrapers as it loses altitude. The preteen superhero team [[Power Pack]] helps limit the damage, destroying part of the airship's engine cowling just before the cowling would have impacted the [[Statue of Liberty]]. As the team battles the Horsemen, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] comes up with an idea to stop Death, and creates a statue of himself out of ice. Death attacks and breaks the statue and, thinking it is actually Iceman, is overcome with guilt and switches sides. Apocalypse easily repels his attacks, but decides to make a tactical withdrawal anyway. After he leaves, the team attempts to regain control of Apocalypse's airship, eventually bringing it to land on top of their headquarters, crushing it.\n\n===The New Mutants===\nThe New Mutants ([[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], [[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]], [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]])  head off to visit their friend [[Bird-Brain (Marvel Comics)|Bird-Brain]] on his remote island. There, they quickly discover that Bird-Brain's creator, the Ani-Mator, is creating more semi-sentient creatures (the Ani-Mates), which he mistreats and experiments on. As the team attempts to free them, the anti-mutant organization known as [[The Right (comics)|The Right]] tracks them down and attacks. During the three-pronged battle, Cypher is shot and killed, taking a bullet meant for Wolfsbane. Eventually, Bird-Brain defeats the Ani-Mator and becomes king of the Ani-Mates, and Magik teleports the Right's soldiers, along with the Ani-Mator himself, to [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. They then return home, where [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] (headmaster of the Xavier School in [[Professor X]]'s absence) blames humanity for Cypher's death. Disgusted, the team quits Magneto's tutelage, while deciding to stay dedicated to Professor X's dream of peace.\n\n==Tie-Ins==\nWhile not officially part of the crossover, a number of other Marvel comic books were billed as \"Fall of the Mutants\" Tie-Ins:\n*'''Captain America''' #339\n:As a reward for defeating Marvel Girl, Apocalypse teleports his Horseman [[Famine (comics)|Famine]] to the American midwest to destroy its crops and cattle with her life-draining powers.

{"title_page": "Real time (media)", "text_new": "{{short description|Theatrical genre}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{example farm|date=October 2016}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2019}}\n}}\n'''Real time''' within the media is a method where events are portrayed at the same rate at which the characters experience them. For example, if a movie told in real time is two hours long, then the plot of that movie covers two hours of fictional time. If a daily real time comic strip runs for six years, then the characters will be six years older at the end of the strip than they were at the beginning. This technique can be enforced with varying levels of precision. In some stories, every minute of [[screen time]] is a minute of fictional time. In other stories, such as the daily comic strip ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', each day's strip does not necessarily correspond to a new day of fictional time, but each year of the strip does correspond to one year of fictional time.\n\nReal time fiction dates back to the climactic structure of classical [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://department.monm.edu/cata/rankin/classes/cata171/lectures/chapter15.htm|title=Dramatic Structure: Climactic, Episodic, and other Forms|website=[[Monmouth College]]|access-date=2019-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813211353/https://department.monm.edu/cata/rankin/classes/cata171/lectures/chapter15.htm|archive-date=2019-08-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Film, television and radio ==\nOften, use of [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screens]] or [[picture-in-picture]]s are used to show events occurring at the same time, or the context in which various [[subplot]]s are affecting each other.

For example, if a movie told in real time is two hours long, then the plot of that movie covers two hours of fictional time. If a daily real time comic strip runs for six years, then the characters will be six years older at the end of the strip than they were at the beginning. This technique can be enforced with varying levels of precision. In some stories, every minute of [[screen time]] is a minute of fictional time. In other stories, such as the daily comic strip ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', each day's strip does not necessarily correspond to a new day of fictional time, but each year of the strip does correspond to one year of fictional time.\n\nReal time fiction dates back to the climactic structure of classical [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://department.monm.edu/cata/rankin/classes/cata171/lectures/chapter15.htm|title=Dramatic Structure: Climactic, Episodic, and other Forms|website=[[Monmouth College]]|access-date=2019-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813211353/https://department.monm.edu/cata/rankin/classes/cata171/lectures/chapter15.htm|archive-date=2019-08-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Film, television and radio ==\nOften, use of [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screens]] or [[picture-in-picture]]s are used to show events occurring at the same time, or the context in which various [[subplot]]s are affecting each other.

At The Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted, a school for the [[supernatural]], student Landon Kirby is revealed to be a Phoenix. Supernatural abilities include being able to return to life in a blaze of fire and ashes several minutes after death. Also, during heightened emotional states, the ability to fly with protruding angelic wings made out of fire itself. Only weaknesses seam to be being shot by the mythical \"Golden Arrow\".\n\n== In literature ==\n* Classical references to the phoenix include the Greek historian [[Herodotus]],<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html][[Herodotus]]<span>, </span>''Histories''<span>, volume 2</span></ref> the Latin poet [[Ovid]].,<ref>[http://www.themediadrome.com/content/articles/words_articles/poems_phoenix.htm The Mediadrome - Poems of the Week: The Phoenix]</ref> the Latin historian [[Tacitus]],<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/annals.html][[Tacitus]]<span>, </span>''Annals'',</ref> and the early Christian [[Apostolic Father]] [[1 Clement]].\n* [[William Shakespeare]] frequently mentions the bird in his plays. He also wrote the poem ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]]''.\n* In certain works of [[Renaissance]] literature, the phoenix is said to have been eaten as the rarest of dishes \u2013 for only one was alive at any one time. [[Jonson]], in Volpone (1605), III, vii. 204-5 writes: 'could we get the ph\u0153nix, though nature lost her kind, shee were our dish.' Another mention of the phoenix as a culinary delicacy occurs in [[John Webster]]'s ''[[The White Devil]]'' (1612).\n* [[Edith Nesbit]]'s famous children's novel, ''[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]'' is based on this legendary creature and its friendship with a family of children.\n* In the [[Vermilion Bird]], a mystical Phoenix symbol represents of [[Four Symbols (China)|Four Symbols]] of the [[Chinese constellations]].\n* [[D. H. Lawrence]] frequently used the phoenix as a symbol for rebirth in life. ''[[The Cambridge Edition of the Letters and Works of D. H. Lawrence]]'' carries the motif on its covers.\n* In [[Robert E. Howard]]'s tale of [[King Conan]] of [[Aquilonia (Conan)|Aquilonia]], \"[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]\", the supernatural scribe Epimetreus inscribes a mystical Phoenix symbol on the blade of Conan's broadsword, to aid against a supernatural enemy.\n* [[Edward Ormondroyd]]'s [[Children's literature|children's novel]] (1957) ''[[David and the Phoenix]]'' features the phoenix as a main character.\n* In [[C. S. Lewis]]' book ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', a marvellous bird guards an [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]-like garden. It appears later, and is identified as a phoenix, in ''[[The Last Battle]]''.\n* The phoenix was also famed for being a symbol of the rise and fall of [[society]], Montag and Faber in [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]''. The pattern of a complacent and abusive society's destruction yielding a fresh new start was compared to the Phoenix's [[mythological]] pattern of resurrection.\n* [[Sylvia Plath]] also alludes to the phoenix in the end of her famous poem \"Lady Lazarus\".\n* [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels feature a phoenix named [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Fawkes|Fawkes]].<ref name=Fawkes>{{cite web |url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/bestiary/fawkes.html |title=Phoenixes - Fawkes |publisher=Harry Potter Lexicon |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> In Harry Potter's world, phoenixes can carry enormous weights, and their song is said to strike fear into the hearts of the impure and courage into those who are pure of heart. The tears of the phoenix can heal severe poisoning, and other illnesses and injuries. In addition, the wands of both Harry and Voldemort contain feathers from Fawkes.\n* In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s short story \"Sunbird\", a party of Epicureans finally answer the question of what happens when a Phoenix is roasted and eaten; you burst into flames, and 'the years burn off you'. This can kill those who are inexperienced, but those who have swallowed fire and practised with glow-worms can achieve eternal youth.\n* In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s novel ''[[Carpe Jugulum]]'', the search for the phoenix forms an important side plot.\n* In ''[[Phoenix Rising (novel)|Phoenix Rising]]'' by [[Karen Hesse]], Trent mentions the Phoenix several times while he is lying in bed, and the main character questions Trent multiple times about the Phoenix and its background.\n* In [[Steven Brust]]'s books set in the world of [[Dragaera]], the [[Phoenix (novel)#The House of the Phoenix|House of the Phoenix]] is linked biologically to the phoenix and metaphorically to the theme of rebirth.
