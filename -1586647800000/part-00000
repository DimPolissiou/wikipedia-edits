{"title_page": "List of languages by first written accounts", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{pp|small=yes}}\n{{sprotected2}}\nThis is a list of [[language]]s arranged by the approximate dates of the oldest existing [[writing|texts]] recording a complete sentence in the language.  It does not include [[undeciphered scripts]], though there are various claims without wide acceptance, which, if substantiated, would push backward the first attestation of certain languages.  It also does not include inscriptions consisting of isolated words or names from a language.\nIn most cases, some form of the language had already been spoken (and even written) considerably earlier than the dates of the earliest extant samples provided here.\n\nA written record may encode a stage of a language corresponding to an earlier time, either as a result of [[oral tradition]], or because the earliest source is a copy of an older manuscript that was lost. An oral tradition of [[epic poetry]] may typically bridge a few centuries, and in rare cases, over a millennium. An extreme case is the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] of the ''[[Rigveda]]'': the earliest parts of this text may date to {{circa|lk=no}} 1500 BC,<ref>{{cite book\n| chapter = Sanskrit | first = Stephanie W. | last = Jamison | pages = 6\u201332\n| title = The Ancient Languages of Asia and the Americas\n| editor-first = Roger D. | editor-last = Woodward\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-521-68494-1\n}} pp. 6\u20137.</ref> while the oldest known manuscripts date to {{circa|lk=no}} 1040 AD.<ref>{{cite book\n| chapter = The Development of the Vedic Canon and its Schools : The Social and Political Milieu\n| first = Michael | last = Witzel\n| pages = 257\u2013348\n| chapter-url = http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/canon.pdf\n| title = Inside the Texts, Beyond the Texts\n| editor-first = Michael | editor-last = Witzel\n| publisher = Harvard University Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies\n| location = Cambridge, MA | year = 1997\n| isbn = 978-1-888789-03-4\n}} p. 259.</ref>\nSimilarly the oldest [[Avestan language|Avestan]] texts, the ''[[Gathas]]'', are believed to have been composed before 1000 BC, but the oldest Avestan manuscripts date from the 13th century AD.<ref>{{cite book\n| chapter = Avestan | first = Mark | last = Hale | pages = 101\u2013122\n| title = The Ancient Languages of Asia and the Americas\n| editor-first = Roger D. | editor-last = Woodward\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-521-68494-1\n}}</ref>\n\nFor languages that have developed out of a known predecessor, dates provided here follow conventional terminology. For example, [[Old French]] developed gradually out of [[Vulgar Latin]], and the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] (842) listed are the earliest text that is classified as \"Old French\".\n\n==Before 1000 BC==\n{{Further|Bronze Age writing}}\nWriting first appeared in the [[Near East]] at the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC.  A very limited number of languages are attested in the area from before the [[Bronze Age collapse]] and the rise of [[alphabetic writing]]:\n* the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], [[Hattic language|Hattic]] and [[Elamite language]] isolates,\n* [[Afro-Asiatic]] in the form of the [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Semitic languages]] and\n* [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ([[Anatolian languages]] and [[Mycenaean Greek]]).\nIn [[East Asia]] towards the end of the second millennium BC, the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] family was represented by [[Old Chinese]].\n\nThere are also a number of [[undeciphered writing systems|undeciphered]] Bronze Age records:\n* [[Proto-Elamite script]] and [[Linear Elamite]]\n* the [[Indus script]] (claimed to record a \"[[Harappan language]]\")\n* [[Cretan hieroglyphs]] and [[Linear A]] (encoding a possible \"[[Minoan language]]\"){{sfnp|Woodard|2008|p=2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/lterms/qt/linear_a.htm |title=Linear A \u2013 Undeciphered Writing System of the Minoans |publisher=Archaeology.about.com |date=2013-07-13 |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref>\n* the [[Cypro-Minoan syllabary]]{{sfnp|Woodard|2008|p=3}}\nEarlier symbols, such as the [[Jiahu symbols]], [[Vin\u010da symbols]] and the marks on the [[Dispilio tablet]], are believed to be [[proto-writing]], rather than representations of language.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the summer of 2003, when he was 26 years old, Markingson was living in Los Angeles, where he hoped to become a screenwriter. During a visit to Los Angeles, Weiss became alarmed at changes in her son's behavior that suggested he was seriously mentally ill. She persuaded him to return to St. Paul.  On November 12, 2003, Markingson spoke about an apocalyptic \u201cstorm\u201d in which he would be required to murder people, including his mother. As a result, he was admitted to a locked psychiatric unit at [[Fairview University Medical Center]].  His treating physician was Dr. Stephen Olson, an associate professor in the University of Minnesota's Department of Psychiatry.<ref>Office of the Legislative Auditor, State of Minnesota, [http://www.auditor.leg.state.mn.us/sreview/markingson.pdf A Clinical Drug Study at the University of Minnesota Department of Psychiatry: The Dan Markingson Case], March 19, 2015, p. 5.</ref>\n\nAfter starting Markingson on [[risperidone]] (Risperdal), an antipsychotic drug, Olson wrote in support of a petition for an involuntary commitment order that would send Markingson to Anoka Metropolitan Regional Treatment Center, a long-term state psychiatric hospital.<ref>Office of the Legislative Auditor, State of Minnesota, [http://www.auditor.leg.state.mn.us/sreview/markingson.pdf A Clinical Drug Study at the University of Minnesota Department of Psychiatry: The Dan Markingson Case], March 19, 2015, p. 5.</ref>  A judge granted the commitment order on November 17, 2003.<ref>[http://www.auditor.leg.state.mn.us/sreview/markingson.pdf In the Matter of the Civil Commitment of Daniel Markingson, State of Minnesota, County of Dakota], Court File PX-03-10465, November 17, 2003.</ref> Two other clinicians examined Markingson as part of the commitment process and both noted Markingson's extremely disordered thinking.<ref>K.

Transmission was entirely oral. Salic Law therefore reflects ancient usages and practices.<ref>{{harvnb|Drew|1991|p=20}}.</ref> In order to govern more effectively, it was desirable for monarchs and their administrations to have a written code. The name of the code comes from the circumstance that Clovis was a [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] king ruling only the [[Salian Franks]] before his unification of [[Francia]]. The law must have applied to the [[Ripuarian Franks]] as well; however, containing only 65 titles, it may not have included any special Ripuarian laws.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nFor the next 300 years the code was copied by hand, and was amended as required to add newly enacted laws, revise laws that had been amended, and delete laws that had been repealed. In contrast with printing, hand copying is an individual act by an individual copyist with ideas and a style of his own. Each of the several dozen surviving manuscripts features a unique set of errors, corrections, content and organization. The laws are called \"titles\" as each one has its own name, generally preceded by ''de'', \"of\", \"concerning\". Different sections of titles acquired individual names which revealed something about their provenances. Some of these dozens of names have been adopted for specific reference, often given the same designation as the overall work, ''lex''.\n\n===Merovingian phase===\nThe [[recension]] of [[Johan Hendrik Caspar Kern|Hendrik Kern]] organizes all of the manuscripts into five families according to similarity and relative chronological sequence, judged by content and dateable material in the text.<ref>{{harvnb|Kern|1880|loc=Prologue}}.</ref> Family I is the oldest, containing four manuscripts dated to the 8th and 9th centuries but containing 65 titles believed to be copies of originals published in the 6th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Kern|1880|p=xiv}}.</ref> In addition they feature the ''Malbergse Glossen'', \"[[Malberg Glosses]]\", marginal [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] stating the native court word for some Latin words.

The first, comprising three manuscripts, dated to the 8th\u20139th centuries, presents an expanded text of 99 or 100 titles. The Malberg Glosses are retained. The second division, with four manuscripts, not only drops the glosses, but \"bears traces of attempts to make the language more concise\".<ref name=Kernxvii>{{harvnb|Kern|1880|p=xvii}}.</ref> A statement gives the provenance: \"in the 13th year of the reign of our most glorious king of the Franks, Pipin\".<ref name=Kernxvii/> Some of the internal documents were composed after the reign of [[Pepin the Short]], but it is considered to be an emendation initiated by Pepin, and is therefore termed the ''Pipina Recensio''.\n\nFamily IV also has two divisions: the first comprised 33 manuscripts; the second, one manuscript. They are characterized by the internal assignment of Latin names to various sections of different provenance. Two of the sections are dated to 768 and 778, but the emendation is believed to be dated to 798, late in the reign of [[Charlemagne]]. This edition calls itself{{clarify|date=May 2017}} the ''Lex Salica Emendata'', or the ''Lex Reformata'', or the ''Lex Emendata'', and is clearly the result of a law code reform by Charlemagne.<ref name=\"Kernxvii\"/>\n\nBy that time his [[Holy Roman Empire]] comprised most of Western Europe. He adds laws of choice (free will) taken from the earlier law codes of Germanic peoples not originally part of Francia. These are numbered into the laws that were there, but they have their own, quasi-sectional, title. All the Franks of Francia were subject to the same law code, which retained the overall title of ''Lex Salica''. These integrated sections borrowed from other Germanic codes are the ''[[Lex Ripuaria|Lex Ribuariorum]]'', later ''Lex Ribuaria'', laws adopted from the [[Ripuarian Franks]], who, before Clovis, had been independent. The ''[[Lex Alamannorum]]'' took laws from the [[Alamanni]], then subject to the Franks. Under the Franks, they were governed by Frankish law, not their own. The inclusion of some of their law as part of the Salic Law must have served as a palliative.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Charlemagne goes back even earlier to the ''Lex Suauorum'', the ancient code of the [[Suebi]] preceding the Alemanni.\n\n==Old Dutch glosses==\n{{see also|Old Dutch}}\n\nGlosses to the Salic law code (the ''Malbergse glossen'') contain several Old Dutch words and what is likely the earliest full sentence in the language:<ref>{{cite book | title = Dutch: Biography of a Language | first = Roland | last = Willemyns | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-19-932366-1 | page = 41 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Old Dutch'''  || maltho || thi || afrio || lito\n|-\n| (Modern) '''Dutch'''  || ik meld, || jou<nowiki>*</nowiki> || bevrijd ik, || laat**\n|-\n| '''English'''  || I declare,  || thee (you<nowiki>*</nowiki>) || I free || villein**\n|-\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Old Dutch and Early Modern and earlier versions of English used the second-person singular pronoun, like ''thou'' and ''thee''.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> A ''lito'' was a form of [[serfdom|serf]] in the [[feudal system]], a half-free farmer, connected to the lord's land but not owned by that lord. In contrast, a slave was fully owned by the lord.\n\n==Some tenets of the law==\nThese laws and their interpretations give an insight into Frankish society. The criminal laws established damages to be paid and fines levied in recompense for injuries to persons and damage to goods (e.g. [[slave]]s), [[theft]], and unprovoked insults. One-third of the fine paid court costs. Judicial interpretation was by a [[jury of peers]].\n\nThe civil law establishes that an individual person is legally unprotected if he or she does not belong to a [[family]]. The rights of family members were defined: for example, the equal division of land among all living male heirs, in contrast to [[primogeniture]].\n\n===Agnatic succession===\nOne tenet of the civil law is [[Patrilineality#Agnatic succession|agnatic succession]], explicitly excluding females from the inheritance of a throne or [[fief]]. Indeed, \"Salic law\" has often been used simply as a [[synonym]] for agnatic succession. But the importance of Salic law extends beyond the rules of inheritance, as it is a direct ancestor of the systems of law in use in many parts of continental Europe today.\n\nSalic law regulates succession according to sex. ''Agnatic succession'' means succession to the throne or fief going to an agnate of the predecessor: for example, a brother, a son, or nearest male relative through the male line, including collateral agnate branches, for example very distant cousins. Chief forms are ''[[agnatic seniority]]'' and ''[[agnatic primogeniture]]''. The latter, which has been the most usual, means succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.\n\n===Female inheritance===\n{{See also|Terra salica}}\nConcerning the inheritance of land, Salic Law said:\n\n{{quote|But of Salic land no portion of the inheritance shall come to a woman: but the whole inheritance of the land shall come to the male sex.<ref>Cave, Roy and Coulson, Herbert. ''A Source Book for Medieval Economic History'', Biblo and Tannen, New York (1965) p.&nbsp;336</ref>}}\n\nor, another transcript:\n\n{{quote|concerning terra Salica no portion or inheritance is for a woman but all the land belongs to members of the male sex who are brothers.}}\n\nAs interpreted by the Salian Franks, the law merely prohibited women from inheriting ancestral \"Salic land\"; this prohibition did not apply to other property (such as [[personal property]]); and under [[Chilperic I]] sometime around the year 570, the law was actually amended to permit inheritance of land by a daughter if a man had no surviving sons. (This amendment, depending on how it is applied and interpreted, offers the basis for either Semi-Salic succession or male-preferred [[primogeniture]], or both.)\n\nThe wording of the law, as well as common usage in those days and centuries afterwards, seems to support an interpretation that inheritance is divided between brothers. And, if it is intended to govern succession, it can be interpreted to mandate [[agnatic seniority]], not direct primogeniture.\n\nIn its use by Continental hereditary monarchies since the 15th century, aiming at agnatic succession, the Salic law is regarded as excluding all females from the succession as well as prohibiting the transfer of succession rights through any woman. At least two systems of hereditary succession are direct and full applications of the Salic Law: [[agnatic seniority]] and [[agnatic primogeniture]].\n\nThe so-called ''Semi-Salic'' version of succession order stipulates that firstly all-male descendance is applied, including all collateral male lines; but if all such lines are extinct, then the closest female agnate (such as a daughter) of the last male holder of the property inherits, and after her, her own male heirs according to the Salic order. In other words, the female closest to the last incumbent is \"regarded as a male\" for the purposes of inheritance and succession. This has the effect of following the closest extant blood line (at least in the first instance) and not involving any more distant relatives (see, for example: [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] in Austria). The closest female relative might be a child of a relatively junior{{clarify|date=May 2017}} branch of the whole dynasty, but still inherits due to her position in the male line, thanks to the longevity of her own branch{{clarify|date=May 2017}}; any existing senior{{clarify|date=May 2017}} female lines come behind that of the closest female.\n\nFrom the Middle Ages, there was{{clarify|date=May 2017}}{{Fix|text=where/when was this system used?}} another system of succession, known as cognatic male primogeniture, which actually fulfills apparent stipulations{{clarify|date=May 2017}} of the original Salic law: succession is allowed also through female lines, but excludes the females themselves in favour of their sons. For example, a grandfather, without sons, is succeeded by a son of his daughter, when the daughter in question is still alive. Or an uncle, with no children of his own, is succeeded by a son of his sister, when the sister in question is still alive.\n\nStrictly seen{{clarify|date=June 2017}}, this fulfils the Salic condition of \"no land comes to a woman, but the land comes to the male sex\". This can be called a ''Quasi-Salic'' system of succession and it should be classified as primogenitural, cognatic, and male.\n\n==Applications of the succession and inheritance laws==\n\n===In France===\nThe Merovingian kings divided their realm equally among all living sons, leading to much conflict and fratricide among the rival heirs. The Carolingians did likewise, but they also possessed the imperial dignity, which was indivisible and passed to only one person at a time. Primogeniture, or the preference for the eldest line in the transmission of inheritance, eventually emerged in France, under the Capetian kings. The early Capetians had only one heir, the eldest son, whom they [[Coronation of the French monarch#Coronation of the heir|crowned during their lifetime]]. Instead of an equal portion of the inheritance, the younger sons of the Capetian kings received an [[appanage]], which is a feudal territory under the suzerainty of the king. Feudal law allowed the transmission of fiefs to daughters in default of sons, which was also the case for the early appanages. Whether feudal law also applied to the French throne no one knew, until 1316.\n\n====The succession in 1316====\nFor a remarkably long period, from the inception of the Capetian dynasty in 987 until the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316, the eldest living son of the King of France succeeded to the throne upon his demise. There was no prior occasion to demonstrate whether or not females were excluded from the succession to the crown. Louis X died without a son, but left his wife pregnant. The king's brother, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]], became regent. Philip prepared for the contingencies with [[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy]], maternal uncle of Louis X's daughter and prospective heiress, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]]. If the unborn child was male, he would succeed to the French throne as king; if female, Philip would maintain the regency until the daughters of Louis X reach their majority. There was opportunity for either daughter to succeed to the French throne.\n\nThe unborn child proved to be male, [[John I of France|John I]], to the relief of the kingdom. But the infant lived for only a few days. Philip saw his chance and broke the agreement with the Duke of Burgundy by having himself anointed at Reims in January 1317 as [[Philip V of France]]. [[Agnes of France, Duchess of Burgundy|Agnes of France]], daughter of Saint Louis, mother of the Duke of Burgundy, and maternal grandmother of the Princess Joan, considered it an usurpation and demanded an assembly of the peers, which Philip V accepted.\n\nAn assembly of prelates, lords, the bourgeois of Paris and doctors of the University, known as the Estates-General of 1317, gathered in February. Philip V asked them to write an argument justifying his right to the throne of France. These \"general statements\" agreed in declaring that \"Women do not succeed the kingdom of France\", formalizing Philip's usurpation and the impossibility for a woman to ascend the throne of France, a principle in force until the end of the monarchy. The Salic law, at the time, was not yet invoked: the arguments put forward in favor of Philip V relied only on the degree of proximity of Philip V with St. Louis. Philip had the support of the nobility and had the resources for his ambitions.\n\nPhilip won over the Duke of Burgundy by giving him his daughter, also named [[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan]], in marriage, with the counties of Artois and Burgundy as her eventual inheritance. On March 27, 1317, a treaty was signed at Laon between the Duke of Burgundy and Philip V, wherein Joan renounced her right to the throne of France.\n\n====The succession in 1328====\nPhilip, too, died without a son, and his brother Charles succeeded him as [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] unopposed. Charles, too, died without a son, but also left his wife pregnant. It was another succession crisis, the same as that in 1316: it was necessary both to prepare for a possible regency (and choose a regent) and prepare for a possible succession to the throne. At this point, it had been accepted that women could not claim the crown of France (without any written rule stipulating it yet).\n\nUnder the application of the agnatic principle, the following were excluded:\n*the daughters of Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV, including the possible unborn daughter of the pregnant Queen [[Jeanne d'\u00c9vreux]];\n*[[Isabella of France]], sister of Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV, wife of King [[Edward II of England]].\n\nThe widow of Charles IV gave birth to a daughter. [[Isabella of France]], sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, [[Edward III of England]]. The French rejected the claim, noting that \"Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess\", a corollary to the succession principle in 1316. The regent, Philip of Valois, became [[Philip VI of France]] in 1328. Philip became king without serious opposition, until his attempt to confiscate [[Gascony]] in 1337 made Edward III press his claim to the French throne.\n\n====Emergence of the Salic law====\nAs far as can be ascertained, ''Salic law'' was not explicitly mentioned either in 1316 or 1328. It had been forgotten in the feudal era, and the assertion that the French crown can only be transmitted to and through males made it unique and exalted in the eyes of the French. Jurists later resurrected the long-defunct Salic law and reinterpreted it to justify the line of succession arrived at in the cases of 1316 and 1328 by forbidding not only inheritance by a woman but also inheritance through a female line (''In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant'').\n\nIn its origin, therefore, the agnatic principle was limited to the succession to the crown of France. Prior to the Valois succession, Capetian kings granted appanages to their younger sons and brothers, which could pass to male and female heirs. But the appanages given to the Valois princes, in imitation of the succession law of the monarchy that gave them, limited their transmission to males. Another Capetian lineage, the [[Montfort of Brittany]], claimed male succession in the Duchy of Brittany. In this they were supported by the King of England, while their rivals who claimed the traditional female succession in Brittany were supported by the King of France. The Montforts eventually won the duchy by warfare, but had to recognize the suzerainty of the King of France.\n\nThis law was by no means intended to cover all matters of inheritance\u2014for example, not the inheritance of movables\u2014only those lands considered \"Salic\"\u2014and there is still debate as to the legal definition of this word, although it is generally accepted to refer to lands in the royal [[fisc]].  Only several hundred years later, under the [[House of Capet|Direct Capetian]] kings of [[France]] and their English contemporaries who held lands in France, did Salic law become a rationale for enforcing or debating succession.  By then it was somewhat anachronistic\u2014there were no Salic lands, since the Salian monarchy and its lands had originally emerged in what is now the [[Netherlands]].\n\nShakespeare claims that [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] rejected [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s claim to the French throne on the basis of Salic law's inheritance rules, leading to the [[Battle of Agincourt]].  In fact, the conflict between Salic law and English law was a justification for [[English claims to the French throne|many overlapping claims]] between the French and English monarchs over the French throne.\n\nMore than a century later, [[Philip II of Spain]] attempted to claim the French crown for his daughter [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]], born of his Valois queen. Philip's agents were instructed to \"insinuate cleverly\" that the Salic law was a \"pure invention\". But even if the \"Salic law\" did not really apply to the throne of France, the very principle of agnatic succession had become a cornerstone of the French royal succession; they had upheld it in the Hundred Years' War with the English, and it had produced their kings for more than two centuries. The eventual recognition of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], the first of the Bourbons kings, further solidified the agnatic principle in France.\n\n===Other European applications===\nA number of military conflicts in European history have stemmed from the application of, or disregard for, Salic law. The [[Carlist Wars]] occurred in [[Spain]] over the question of whether the heir to the throne should be a female or a male relative. The [[War of the Austrian Succession]] was triggered by the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] in which [[Charles VI of Austria]], who himself had inherited the Austrian patrimony over his nieces as a result of Salic law, attempted to ensure the inheritance directly to his own daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], that being an example of an operation of the ''Semi-Salic law''.\n\nIn the modern [[Kingdom of Italy]], under the [[House of Savoy]], succession to the throne was regulated by Salic law.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and the [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanoverian]] thrones separated after the death of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom]] and of Hanover, in 1837. Hanover practised Semi-Salic law, but not Britain. King William's niece, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]], ascended to the throne of Great Britain and Ireland, but the throne of Hanover went to William's brother [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest, Duke of Cumberland]].\n\nSalic law was also an important issue in the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] and played a weary prosaic day-to-day role in the inheritance and marriage decisions of common princedoms of the [[List of historic states of Germany|German states]], such as [[Saxe-Weimar]], to cite a representative example. It is not much of an overstatement to say that European nobility confronted Salic issues at every turn and nuance of diplomacy, and certainly, especially when negotiating marriages, for the entire male line had to be extinguished for a land title to pass (by marriage) ''to a female's husband''\u2014women rulers were anathema in the German states well into the modern era.\n\nIn a similar way, the thrones of  the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] were separated in 1890, with the succession of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Princess Wilhelmina]] as the first [[Queen regnant]] of the Netherlands. As a remnant of Salic law, the office of the reigning [[monarch]] of the [[Netherlands]] is always formally known as \"King\" even though her title may be \"Queen\". Luxembourg passed to the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]'s distantly-related agnates, the [[House of Nassau-Weilburg]]. However, that house, too, faced extinction in the male line less than two decades later.  With no other male-line agnates in the remaining branches of the House of Nassau, [[William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke William IV]] adopted a semi-Salic law of succession so that he could be succeeded by his daughters.\n\n==Literary references==\n*[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] uses the Salic Law as a plot device in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', saying it was upheld by the French to bar Henry V\u2019s claiming the French throne. The play ''Henry V'' begins with the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] being asked if the claim might be upheld despite the Salic Law. The Archbishop replies, \"That the '''''land Salique''''' is in Germany, between the floods of [[Saale|Sala]] and of [[Elbe]]\", implying that the law is German, not French. The Archbishop's justification for Henry's claim, which Shakespeare intentionally renders obtuse and verbose (for comedic as well as politically expedient reasons) is also erroneous, as the [[Salian Franks]] settled along the lower [[Rhine]] and [[Scheldt]], which today is for the most part in the [[Flemish Region]].\n*In the novel ''[[Royal Flash]]'', by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], the hero, [[Harry Flashman]], on his marriage, is presented with the Royal Consort's portion of the Crown Jewels, and \"The Duchess did rather better\"; the character, feeling hard done-by, thinks, \"It struck me then, and it strikes me now, that the Salic Law was a damned sound idea\".<ref>G.

Dozens of manuscripts dating from the sixth to eighth centuries and three emendations as late as the ninth century have survived.<ref>{{harvnb|Drew|1991|page=53}}.</ref>\n\nSalic law provided written codification of both civil law, such as the statutes governing [[inheritance]], and [[criminal law]], such as the punishment for [[murder]].

Its use of [[agnatic succession]] governed the succession of kings in kingdoms such as [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].\n\n==History of the law==\n[[File:Salic Law.png|thumb|[[Clovis I|King Clovis]] dictates the ''Salic Law'' surrounded by his military chiefs.]]\n[[File:Frankish_Foederatus.png|thumb|Salian settlement in [[Toxandria]], where they had recently settled or been settled in 358, when [[Julian the Apostate]] made them ''[[dediticii]]''.]]\nThe original edition of the code was commissioned by the first king of all the Franks, [[Clovis I]] (c. 466\u2013511), and published sometime between 507 and 511.<ref>{{harvnb|Hinckeldey|Fosberry|1993|p=7}}.</ref> He appointed four commissioners<ref>{{cite book | title=History of languages: an introduction | first=Tore | last=Janson | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2011 | series=Oxford textbooks in linguistics | page=141}}</ref> to research uses{{clarify|date=May 2017}} of laws that, until the publication of the Salic Law, had been recorded only in the minds of designated elders, who would meet in council when their knowledge was required. Transmission was entirely oral. Salic Law therefore reflects ancient usages and practices.<ref>{{harvnb|Drew|1991|p=20}}.</ref> In order to govern more effectively, it was desirable for monarchs and their administrations to have a written code. The name of the code comes from the circumstance that Clovis was a [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] king ruling only the [[Salian Franks]] before his unification of [[Francia]]. The law must have applied to the [[Ripuarian Franks]] as well; however, containing only 65 titles, it may not have included any special Ripuarian laws.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nFor the next 300 years the code was copied by hand, and was amended as required to add newly enacted laws, revise laws that had been amended, and delete laws that had been repealed. In contrast with printing, hand copying is an individual act by an individual copyist with ideas and a style of his own. Each of the several dozen surviving manuscripts features a unique set of errors, corrections, content and organization. The laws are called \"titles\" as each one has its own name, generally preceded by ''de'', \"of\", \"concerning\". Different sections of titles acquired individual names which revealed something about their provenances. Some of these dozens of names have been adopted for specific reference, often given the same designation as the overall work, ''lex''.\n\n===Merovingian phase===\nThe [[recension]] of [[Johan Hendrik Caspar Kern|Hendrik Kern]] organizes all of the manuscripts into five families according to similarity and relative chronological sequence, judged by content and dateable material in the text.<ref>{{harvnb|Kern|1880|loc=Prologue}}.</ref> Family I is the oldest, containing four manuscripts dated to the 8th and 9th centuries but containing 65 titles believed to be copies of originals published in the 6th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Kern|1880|p=xiv}}.</ref> In addition they feature the ''Malbergse Glossen'', \"Malberg Glosses\", marginal [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] stating the native court word for some Latin words.

The first, comprising three manuscripts, dated to the 8th\u20139th centuries, presents an expanded text of 99 or 100 titles. The Malberg Glosses are retained. The second division, with four manuscripts, not only drops the glosses, but \"bears traces of attempts to make the language more concise\".<ref name=Kernxvii>{{harvnb|Kern|1880|p=xvii}}.</ref> A statement gives the provenance: \"in the 13th year of the reign of our most glorious king of the Franks, Pipin\".<ref name=Kernxvii/> Some of the internal documents were composed after the reign of [[Pepin the Short]], but it is considered to be an emendation initiated by Pepin, and is therefore termed the ''Pipina Recensio''.\n\nFamily IV also has two divisions: the first comprised 33 manuscripts; the second, one manuscript. They are characterized by the internal assignment of Latin names to various sections of different provenance. Two of the sections are dated to 768 and 778, but the emendation is believed to be dated to 798, late in the reign of [[Charlemagne]]. This edition calls itself{{clarify|date=May 2017}} the ''Lex Salica Emendata'', or the ''Lex Reformata'', or the ''Lex Emendata'', and is clearly the result of a law code reform by Charlemagne.<ref name=\"Kernxvii\"/>\n\nBy that time his [[Holy Roman Empire]] comprised most of Western Europe. He adds laws of choice (free will) taken from the earlier law codes of Germanic peoples not originally part of Francia. These are numbered into the laws that were there, but they have their own, quasi-sectional, title. All the Franks of Francia were subject to the same law code, which retained the overall title of ''Lex Salica''. These integrated sections borrowed from other Germanic codes are the ''[[Lex Ripuaria|Lex Ribuariorum]]'', later ''Lex Ribuaria'', laws adopted from the [[Ripuarian Franks]], who, before Clovis, had been independent. The ''[[Lex Alamannorum]]'' took laws from the [[Alamanni]], then subject to the Franks. Under the Franks, they were governed by Frankish law, not their own. The inclusion of some of their law as part of the Salic Law must have served as a palliative.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Charlemagne goes back even earlier to the ''Lex Suauorum'', the ancient code of the [[Suebi]] preceding the Alemanni.\n\n==Old Dutch glosses==\n{{see also|Old Dutch}}\n\nGlosses to the Salic law code (the ''Malbergse glossen'') contain several Old Dutch words and what is likely the earliest full sentence in the language:<ref>{{cite book | title = Dutch: Biography of a Language | first = Roland | last = Willemyns | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-19-932366-1 | page = 41 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Old Dutch'''  || maltho || thi || afrio || lito\n|-\n| (Modern) '''Dutch'''  || ik meld, || jou<nowiki>*</nowiki> || bevrijd ik, || laat**\n|-\n| '''English'''  || I declare,  || thee (you<nowiki>*</nowiki>) || I free || villein**\n|-\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Old Dutch and Early Modern and earlier versions of English used the second-person singular pronoun, like ''thou'' and ''thee''.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> A ''lito'' was a form of [[serfdom|serf]] in the [[feudal system]], a half-free farmer, connected to the lord's land but not owned by that lord. In contrast, a slave was fully owned by the lord.\n\n==Some tenets of the law==\nThese laws and their interpretations give an insight into Frankish society. The criminal laws established damages to be paid and fines levied in recompense for injuries to persons and damage to goods (e.g. [[slave]]s), [[theft]], and unprovoked insults. One-third of the fine paid court costs. Judicial interpretation was by a [[jury of peers]].\n\nThe civil law establishes that an individual person is legally unprotected if he or she does not belong to a [[family]]. The rights of family members were defined: for example, the equal division of land among all living male heirs, in contrast to [[primogeniture]].\n\n===Agnatic succession===\nOne tenet of the civil law is [[Patrilineality#Agnatic succession|agnatic succession]], explicitly excluding females from the inheritance of a throne or [[fief]]. Indeed, \"Salic law\" has often been used simply as a [[synonym]] for agnatic succession. But the importance of Salic law extends beyond the rules of inheritance, as it is a direct ancestor of the systems of law in use in many parts of continental Europe today.\n\nSalic law regulates succession according to sex. ''Agnatic succession'' means succession to the throne or fief going to an agnate of the predecessor: for example, a brother, a son, or nearest male relative through the male line, including collateral agnate branches, for example very distant cousins. Chief forms are ''[[agnatic seniority]]'' and ''[[agnatic primogeniture]]''. The latter, which has been the most usual, means succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.\n\n===Female inheritance===\n{{See also|Terra salica}}\nConcerning the inheritance of land, Salic Law said:\n\n{{quote|But of Salic land no portion of the inheritance shall come to a woman: but the whole inheritance of the land shall come to the male sex.<ref>Cave, Roy and Coulson, Herbert. ''A Source Book for Medieval Economic History'', Biblo and Tannen, New York (1965) p.&nbsp;336</ref>}}\n\nor, another transcript:\n\n{{quote|concerning terra Salica no portion or inheritance is for a woman but all the land belongs to members of the male sex who are brothers.}}\n\nAs interpreted by the Salian Franks, the law merely prohibited women from inheriting ancestral \"Salic land\"; this prohibition did not apply to other property (such as [[personal property]]); and under [[Chilperic I]] sometime around the year 570, the law was actually amended to permit inheritance of land by a daughter if a man had no surviving sons. (This amendment, depending on how it is applied and interpreted, offers the basis for either Semi-Salic succession or male-preferred [[primogeniture]], or both.)\n\nThe wording of the law, as well as common usage in those days and centuries afterwards, seems to support an interpretation that inheritance is divided between brothers. And, if it is intended to govern succession, it can be interpreted to mandate [[agnatic seniority]], not direct primogeniture.\n\nIn its use by Continental hereditary monarchies since the 15th century, aiming at agnatic succession, the Salic law is regarded as excluding all females from the succession as well as prohibiting the transfer of succession rights through any woman. At least two systems of hereditary succession are direct and full applications of the Salic Law: [[agnatic seniority]] and [[agnatic primogeniture]].\n\nThe so-called ''Semi-Salic'' version of succession order stipulates that firstly all-male descendance is applied, including all collateral male lines; but if all such lines are extinct, then the closest female agnate (such as a daughter) of the last male holder of the property inherits, and after her, her own male heirs according to the Salic order. In other words, the female closest to the last incumbent is \"regarded as a male\" for the purposes of inheritance and succession. This has the effect of following the closest extant blood line (at least in the first instance) and not involving any more distant relatives (see, for example: [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] in Austria). The closest female relative might be a child of a relatively junior{{clarify|date=May 2017}} branch of the whole dynasty, but still inherits due to her position in the male line, thanks to the longevity of her own branch{{clarify|date=May 2017}}; any existing senior{{clarify|date=May 2017}} female lines come behind that of the closest female.\n\nFrom the Middle Ages, there was{{clarify|date=May 2017}}{{Fix|text=where/when was this system used?}} another system of succession, known as cognatic male primogeniture, which actually fulfills apparent stipulations{{clarify|date=May 2017}} of the original Salic law: succession is allowed also through female lines, but excludes the females themselves in favour of their sons. For example, a grandfather, without sons, is succeeded by a son of his daughter, when the daughter in question is still alive. Or an uncle, with no children of his own, is succeeded by a son of his sister, when the sister in question is still alive.\n\nStrictly seen{{clarify|date=June 2017}}, this fulfils the Salic condition of \"no land comes to a woman, but the land comes to the male sex\". This can be called a ''Quasi-Salic'' system of succession and it should be classified as primogenitural, cognatic, and male.\n\n==Applications of the succession and inheritance laws==\n\n===In France===\nThe Merovingian kings divided their realm equally among all living sons, leading to much conflict and fratricide among the rival heirs. The Carolingians did likewise, but they also possessed the imperial dignity, which was indivisible and passed to only one person at a time. Primogeniture, or the preference for the eldest line in the transmission of inheritance, eventually emerged in France, under the Capetian kings. The early Capetians had only one heir, the eldest son, whom they [[Coronation of the French monarch#Coronation of the heir|crowned during their lifetime]]. Instead of an equal portion of the inheritance, the younger sons of the Capetian kings received an [[appanage]], which is a feudal territory under the suzerainty of the king. Feudal law allowed the transmission of fiefs to daughters in default of sons, which was also the case for the early appanages. Whether feudal law also applied to the French throne no one knew, until 1316.\n\n====The succession in 1316====\nFor a remarkably long period, from the inception of the Capetian dynasty in 987 until the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316, the eldest living son of the King of France succeeded to the throne upon his demise. There was no prior occasion to demonstrate whether or not females were excluded from the succession to the crown. Louis X died without a son, but left his wife pregnant. The king's brother, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]], became regent. Philip prepared for the contingencies with [[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy]], maternal uncle of Louis X's daughter and prospective heiress, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]]. If the unborn child was male, he would succeed to the French throne as king; if female, Philip would maintain the regency until the daughters of Louis X reach their majority. There was opportunity for either daughter to succeed to the French throne.\n\nThe unborn child proved to be male, [[John I of France|John I]], to the relief of the kingdom. But the infant lived for only a few days. Philip saw his chance and broke the agreement with the Duke of Burgundy by having himself anointed at Reims in January 1317 as [[Philip V of France]]. [[Agnes of France, Duchess of Burgundy|Agnes of France]], daughter of Saint Louis, mother of the Duke of Burgundy, and maternal grandmother of the Princess Joan, considered it an usurpation and demanded an assembly of the peers, which Philip V accepted.\n\nAn assembly of prelates, lords, the bourgeois of Paris and doctors of the University, known as the Estates-General of 1317, gathered in February. Philip V asked them to write an argument justifying his right to the throne of France. These \"general statements\" agreed in declaring that \"Women do not succeed the kingdom of France\", formalizing Philip's usurpation and the impossibility for a woman to ascend the throne of France, a principle in force until the end of the monarchy. The Salic law, at the time, was not yet invoked: the arguments put forward in favor of Philip V relied only on the degree of proximity of Philip V with St. Louis. Philip had the support of the nobility and had the resources for his ambitions.\n\nPhilip won over the Duke of Burgundy by giving him his daughter, also named [[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan]], in marriage, with the counties of Artois and Burgundy as her eventual inheritance. On March 27, 1317, a treaty was signed at Laon between the Duke of Burgundy and Philip V, wherein Joan renounced her right to the throne of France.\n\n====The succession in 1328====\nPhilip, too, died without a son, and his brother Charles succeeded him as [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] unopposed. Charles, too, died without a son, but also left his wife pregnant. It was another succession crisis, the same as that in 1316: it was necessary both to prepare for a possible regency (and choose a regent) and prepare for a possible succession to the throne. At this point, it had been accepted that women could not claim the crown of France (without any written rule stipulating it yet).\n\nUnder the application of the agnatic principle, the following were excluded:\n*the daughters of Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV, including the possible unborn daughter of the pregnant Queen [[Jeanne d'\u00c9vreux]];\n*[[Isabella of France]], sister of Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV, wife of King [[Edward II of England]].\n\nThe widow of Charles IV gave birth to a daughter. [[Isabella of France]], sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, [[Edward III of England]]. The French rejected the claim, noting that \"Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess\", a corollary to the succession principle in 1316. The regent, Philip of Valois, became [[Philip VI of France]] in 1328. Philip became king without serious opposition, until his attempt to confiscate [[Gascony]] in 1337 made Edward III press his claim to the French throne.\n\n====Emergence of the Salic law====\nAs far as can be ascertained, ''Salic law'' was not explicitly mentioned either in 1316 or 1328. It had been forgotten in the feudal era, and the assertion that the French crown can only be transmitted to and through males made it unique and exalted in the eyes of the French. Jurists later resurrected the long-defunct Salic law and reinterpreted it to justify the line of succession arrived at in the cases of 1316 and 1328 by forbidding not only inheritance by a woman but also inheritance through a female line (''In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant'').\n\nIn its origin, therefore, the agnatic principle was limited to the succession to the crown of France. Prior to the Valois succession, Capetian kings granted appanages to their younger sons and brothers, which could pass to male and female heirs. But the appanages given to the Valois princes, in imitation of the succession law of the monarchy that gave them, limited their transmission to males. Another Capetian lineage, the [[Montfort of Brittany]], claimed male succession in the Duchy of Brittany. In this they were supported by the King of England, while their rivals who claimed the traditional female succession in Brittany were supported by the King of France. The Montforts eventually won the duchy by warfare, but had to recognize the suzerainty of the King of France.\n\nThis law was by no means intended to cover all matters of inheritance\u2014for example, not the inheritance of movables\u2014only those lands considered \"Salic\"\u2014and there is still debate as to the legal definition of this word, although it is generally accepted to refer to lands in the royal [[fisc]].  Only several hundred years later, under the [[House of Capet|Direct Capetian]] kings of [[France]] and their English contemporaries who held lands in France, did Salic law become a rationale for enforcing or debating succession.  By then it was somewhat anachronistic\u2014there were no Salic lands, since the Salian monarchy and its lands had originally emerged in what is now the [[Netherlands]].\n\nShakespeare claims that [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] rejected [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s claim to the French throne on the basis of Salic law's inheritance rules, leading to the [[Battle of Agincourt]].  In fact, the conflict between Salic law and English law was a justification for [[English claims to the French throne|many overlapping claims]] between the French and English monarchs over the French throne.\n\nMore than a century later, [[Philip II of Spain]] attempted to claim the French crown for his daughter [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]], born of his Valois queen. Philip's agents were instructed to \"insinuate cleverly\" that the Salic law was a \"pure invention\". But even if the \"Salic law\" did not really apply to the throne of France, the very principle of agnatic succession had become a cornerstone of the French royal succession; they had upheld it in the Hundred Years' War with the English, and it had produced their kings for more than two centuries. The eventual recognition of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], the first of the Bourbons kings, further solidified the agnatic principle in France.\n\n===Other European applications===\nA number of military conflicts in European history have stemmed from the application of, or disregard for, Salic law. The [[Carlist Wars]] occurred in [[Spain]] over the question of whether the heir to the throne should be a female or a male relative. The [[War of the Austrian Succession]] was triggered by the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] in which [[Charles VI of Austria]], who himself had inherited the Austrian patrimony over his nieces as a result of Salic law, attempted to ensure the inheritance directly to his own daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], that being an example of an operation of the ''Semi-Salic law''.\n\nIn the modern [[Kingdom of Italy]], under the [[House of Savoy]], succession to the throne was regulated by Salic law.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and the [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanoverian]] thrones separated after the death of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom]] and of Hanover, in 1837. Hanover practised Semi-Salic law, but not Britain. King William's niece, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]], ascended to the throne of Great Britain and Ireland, but the throne of Hanover went to William's brother [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest, Duke of Cumberland]].\n\nSalic law was also an important issue in the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] and played a weary prosaic day-to-day role in the inheritance and marriage decisions of common princedoms of the [[List of historic states of Germany|German states]], such as [[Saxe-Weimar]], to cite a representative example. It is not much of an overstatement to say that European nobility confronted Salic issues at every turn and nuance of diplomacy, and certainly, especially when negotiating marriages, for the entire male line had to be extinguished for a land title to pass (by marriage) ''to a female's husband''\u2014women rulers were anathema in the German states well into the modern era.\n\nIn a similar way, the thrones of  the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] were separated in 1890, with the succession of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Princess Wilhelmina]] as the first [[Queen regnant]] of the Netherlands. As a remnant of Salic law, the office of the reigning [[monarch]] of the [[Netherlands]] is always formally known as \"King\" even though her title may be \"Queen\". Luxembourg passed to the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]'s distantly-related agnates, the [[House of Nassau-Weilburg]]. However, that house, too, faced extinction in the male line less than two decades later.  With no other male-line agnates in the remaining branches of the House of Nassau, [[William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke William IV]] adopted a semi-Salic law of succession so that he could be succeeded by his daughters.\n\n==Literary references==\n*[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] uses the Salic Law as a plot device in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', saying it was upheld by the French to bar Henry V\u2019s claiming the French throne. The play ''Henry V'' begins with the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] being asked if the claim might be upheld despite the Salic Law. The Archbishop replies, \"That the '''''land Salique''''' is in Germany, between the floods of [[Saale|Sala]] and of [[Elbe]]\", implying that the law is German, not French. The Archbishop's justification for Henry's claim, which Shakespeare intentionally renders obtuse and verbose (for comedic as well as politically expedient reasons) is also erroneous, as the [[Salian Franks]] settled along the lower [[Rhine]] and [[Scheldt]], which today is for the most part in the [[Flemish Region]].\n*In the novel ''[[Royal Flash]]'', by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], the hero, [[Harry Flashman]], on his marriage, is presented with the Royal Consort's portion of the Crown Jewels, and \"The Duchess did rather better\"; the character, feeling hard done-by, thinks, \"It struck me then, and it strikes me now, that the Salic Law was a damned sound idea\".<ref>G.

{"title_page": "Shower speaker", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|{{more citations needed|date=November 2019}}{{original research|date=November 2019}}}}\n\nA '''shower speaker''' is a [[Wireless speaker|Bluetooth speaker]] designed for use in humid environments such as [[shower]]s or more generally in the [[bathroom]]. There are also shower speakers using [[Wi-Fi]], although this is more rare.\n\n== Principle of operation ==\nThe speaker must first be paired with a [[Bluetooth]] device. In general, it is a smartphone or tablet. It is this device that will serve as the source for the music that will be played through the speaker.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n== Features and characteristics ==\n\n=== Water resistance ===\nA shower speaker must first of all be able to withstand water splashes. This resistance is expressed by an IP ([[IP Code|Ingress Protection]]) index that must be mentioned on the product. The most frequent indexes encountered are the IPX4 index, which indicates that the device is protected against splashes. Other models offer superior protection, such as IPX7. In this case, the enclosure is completely submersible in [[water]] to a depth of 1 meter for half an hour.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} It is then considered [[Waterproofing|waterproof]]. Some models, rarer those, extend their protection up to index 8.\n\n=== Sound quality ===\nThe most basic models only offer an output power of 3W, which does not allow for an optimal sound quality. Mid-range models go up to 5W and [[high-end]] models can go up to 10W and beyond.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:Shower speaker.jpg|alt=a shower speaker attached to the wall of a shower with a suction cup|thumb|a shower speaker attached to the wall of a shower with a suction cup]]\nThe number of speakers can also vary: while entry-level models are limited to a single speaker, more elaborate models can offer two, and thus have stereo sound reproduction. Some shower speakers add a [[Passive radiator (speaker)|passive radiator]] to improve [[low frequency]] reproduction and achieve deeper [[sound]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-what-are-advantages-passive-radiator-design|title=Q.

Under the guise of this concept, Bobgoblin wore (and still wear) conforming jumpsuits that were the issued attire for the LFSMF.\n\nFor their first shows in 1993, Hop's brother, credited as Hech Mahech, joined the band on bass, and guitarist Lech Vogner, another University of North Texas graduate, to round out the band.

In 1994, Bobgoblin independently released the full-length album \"Jet,\" which helped increase the band's audience and made a name for themselves in the region while laying a foundation for their '70s and '80s punk, glam, and new wave-influenced sound.

Ahlby Galutin, an award-winning record producer most famous for his work with the Bee Gees and one of the creators of the Enhanced CD technology, worked at MCA at the time and pegged Bobgoblin as guinea pigs to experiment with the new technology in a CD release because of the band's conceptual bent and computer savvy members.\n\nIn 1999, after delivering the rough drafts for a second record to MCA, the band left the label to try to build a new life under a different name.\n\n==The Adventures of Jet (2000-2004)==\nBased on Bobgoblin's first release, \"Jet,\" the band renamed itself ''The Adventures of Jet'' (simply known as AOJ).

The record, thematically centered on the band's experiences in the\ncorporate music world and with corporate conventions in general, accentuates more of Litzwire's keyboard counter-melodies and brought the band's '80s new-wave influences more to the fore. The record attracted a limited but international and avid following, almost completely separate from the audience built under Bobgoblin.\n\nThe band parted ways with Jason Weisenberg, and after some dormancy enlisted long-time friend Zach Blair (Rise Against, Hagfish) on guitar.

In  major cities, street hawkers and roadside stalls sell dozens of dishes of mohinga to the locals and passers-by. Usually eaten for [[breakfast]], today the dish is being consumed more and more throughout the day.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History and origins==\nThe origins of mohinga are difficult to pinpoint in the absence of extant records. Food processing tools dating to the [[Pyu city-states]] used to ferment [[rice]] have been discovered, leading to the conclusion that the tradition of making rice vermicelli, the key starch used in mohinga, has a long history. The earliest reference to mohinga dates to the [[Konbaung dynasty]], in the poet [[U Ponnya]]'s ''alinga'' verse poem. Burmese history researcher Khin Maung Nyunt has concluded that during pre-colonial times, mohinga was likely a commoner's dish, as a recipe for \"mohinga\" has not been found in palatial records and cookbooks. During the latter half of [[Bagyidaw]]'s reign, a poet by the name of U Min emerged and referenced \"mohinga\" as \"[[mont di]]\" (\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u1010\u102e) in a poetry competition. While mont ti largely refers to another set of dishes in modern-day Myanmar, a small minority continues uses \"mont ti\" in reference to mohinga. Various regions in the country also call mohinga simply \"mont\" (\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a) or \"mont hin\" (\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u101f\u1004\u103a\u1038).\n\n== Preparation ==\nThere are different varieties of mohinga in various regions of Myanmar. [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] mohinga has more [[ngapi|fish paste]] and less soup. Its ingredients depend on their availability.

In  major cities, street hawkers and roadside stalls sell dozens of dishes of mohinga to the locals and passers-by. Usually eaten for [[breakfast]], today the dish is being consumed more and more throughout the day.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History and origins==\nThe origins of mohinga are difficult to pinpoint in the absence of extant records. Food processing tools dating to the [[Pyu city-states]] used to ferment [[rice]] have been discovered, leading to the conclusion that the tradition of making rice vermicelli, the key starch used in mohinga, has a long history. The earliest reference to mohinga dates to the [[Konbaung dynasty]], in the poet [[U Ponnya]]'s ''alinga'' verse poem. Burmese history researcher Khin Maung Nyunt has concluded that during pre-colonial times, mohinga was likely a commoner's dish, as a recipe for \"mohinga\" has not been found in palatial records and cookbooks. During the latter half of [[Bagyidaw]]'s reign, a poet by the name of U Min emerged and referenced \"mohinga\" as \"[[mont ti]]\" (\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u1010\u102e) in a poetry competition. While mont ti largely refers to another set of dishes in modern-day Myanmar, a small minority continues uses \"mont ti\" in reference to mohinga. Various regions in the country also call mohinga simply \"mont\" (\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a) or \"mont hin\" (\u1019\u102f\u1014\u1037\u103a\u101f\u1004\u103a\u1038). \n\n== Preparation ==\nThere are different varieties of mohinga in various regions of Myanmar. [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] mohinga has more [[ngapi|fish paste]] and less soup. Its ingredients depend on their availability. However, the standard dish comes from southern Myanmar, where fresh fish is more readily available. The main ingredients of mohinga are [[chickpea flour]] and/or crushed toasted rice, [[garlic]], [[onions]], [[lemongrass]],  [[Musa (genus)|banana tree stem]]s, [[ginger]], fish paste, [[fish sauce]], and [[catfish]] or other types of fishes, like [[Mrigal carp]] in a rich broth cooked and kept on the boil in a [[cauldron]].

The heralds are appointed by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Sovereign]] and are delegated authority to act on behalf of the Crown in all matters of [[heraldry]], the granting of new [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], [[Genealogy|genealogical research]] and the recording of [[pedigree chart|pedigrees]]. The College is also the official body responsible for matters relating to the flying of flags on land, and it maintains the official registers of flags and other national symbols. Though a part of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household of the United Kingdom]] the College is self-financed, unsupported by any public funds.\n\nFounded by [[royal charter]] in 1484 by King [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the College is one of the few remaining official [[heraldic authority|heraldic authorities]] in Europe. Within the United Kingdom, there are two such authorities, the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] in Scotland and the College for [[Countries of the United Kingdom|the rest of the United Kingdom]]. The College has had its home in the [[City of London]] since its foundation, and has been at its present location, on [[Queen Victoria Street, London|Queen Victoria Street]], since 1555.<ref>The College originally occupied a property between St Paul's and Thames St known as Derby Place, which burned in the Great Fire.  The replacement building, known simply as the College of Arms or Herald's College, was built on the same property.  When Queen Victoria St was built it crossed the south end of the College's property; the building was then remodeled to front onto the new street.</ref>  The College of Arms also undertakes and consults on the planning of many [[Ceremony|ceremonial occasion]]s such as [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]]s, [[State funerals in the United Kingdom|state funerals]], the annual [[Garter Service]] and the [[State Opening of Parliament]]. Heralds of the College accompany the sovereign on many of these occasions.\n\nThe College comprises thirteen officers or heralds: three [[Kings of Arms]], six [[Herald|Heralds of Arms]] and four [[Pursuivant|Pursuivants of Arms]]. There are also seven officers extraordinary, who take part in ceremonial occasions but are not part of the College. The entire corporation is overseen by the [[Earl Marshal]], a hereditary office held by the [[Duke of Norfolk]], currently [[Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Rous Roll - Richard and family.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Depiction of King Richard III the College of Arms' founder, his wife Queen Anne Neville and their son Prince Edward, Prince of Wales with their heraldic crests and badges from the Rous Roll.

From then on, all genealogical records and the duty of recording them was subsumed by the College.

In 1776 some stylistic changes were made to the exterior of the building and some details, such as [[pediment]]s and [[cornice]]s were removed, transforming the building to the then popular but austere [[Neo-Classical style]].<ref name=\"CoA architecture\"/>\n\nThe magnificent coronation of [[James II of England|James II]] in 1685 saw the College revived as an institution of state and the monarchy.<ref name=\"Noble 295\">{{harvnb|Noble|1805|p=295}}</ref> However, the abrupt end of his reign saw all but one of the heralds taking the side of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]].<ref name=\"Noble 301\">{{harvnb|Noble|1805|p=301}}</ref> The period from 1704 to 1706 saw not a single grant of arms being made by the College; this nadir was attributed to the changes in attitude of the times.<ref name=\"Wagner 318\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=318}}</ref> The [[Acts of Union 1707]] between England and Scotland, in the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] did not affect the jurisdiction or the rights of the College.

This structure was a fire risk and the cause of great anxiety among the heralds. In 1775 the College Surveyor drew attention to this problem, but to no avail. In February 1800, the College was asked by a Select Committee of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to report to them the state of public records; again the heralds drew attention to the proximity of the Sugar House. Members of the committee inspected the College premises and reported to the House that the College must either be moved to a new building or secured against the risk of fire. Again nothing was done; in 1812 water seeped through the walls of the College damaging records. The Surveyor traced the leak back to a shed recently erected by Mr. Alderman Smith, owner of the Sugar House, who declared his readiness to do everything he could, but who actually did very little to rectify the situation.<ref name=\"Wagner 472\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=472}}</ref> After years of negotiation the College, in 1820, bought the Sugar House from Smith for the sum of \u00a31,500.<ref name=\"Wagner 474\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=474}}</ref> \n[[File:Herald's College April 17, 1830.jpg|thumb|left|Herald's College, Bennet's Hill.

A petition from the College was given to the Lords of the Treasury setting out the herald's reason for the move: \"that the local situation of the College is so widely detached from the proper scene of the official duties and occupations of Your Memorialists and from the residences of that class of persons by whom the records in their charge are chiefly and most frequently consulted.\"<ref name=\"Wagner 477\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=477}}</ref>\n\nNash himself was asked by the College to design a new building near fashionable [[Trafalgar Square]] but Nash's elaborate plan proved too costly and ambitious for the College.<ref name=\"Wagner 478\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=478}}</ref> At the same time the College also asked [[Robert Abraham (architect)|Robert Abraham]] to submit to them a second plan for the building.

However they were constantly beset by conflicts between the different officers over the amount needed to build a new building.

However, protests from the heralds resulted in only parts of the south east and south west wings being sliced off, requiring extensive remodelling.

However unlike the Lyon Court, which was a [[court of law]] and part of the [[Courts of Scotland|Scottish Judiciary]], the College of Arms has always been an independent corporate body overseen by the Earl Marshal.

Meanwhile, on 10 and 11 May 1941 the College building was almost consumed by fire, which had already levelled all the buildings to the east of the College on Queen Victoria Street. The building was given up for lost, when a change in the wind saved it.

Eventually with the help of the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] and a public subscription, the building was repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place.<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=528}}</ref> The present gates to the building were added in 1956, and came originally from [[Goodrich Court]] in Herefordshire.

However, the monarch has delegated this power to two authorities; the Lord Lyon, with jurisdiction over Scotland and the College of Arms over England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Under the latter's jurisdiction, the right to arms is acquired exclusively either by proving descent in an unbroken male-line from someone registered as so entitled or by a new grant from the King of Arms.<ref name=\"Grant Arms\">{{cite web | url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/granting-arms | title=Granting of Arms | publisher=College of Arms | accessdate=14 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613152725/http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/granting-arms | archive-date=13 June 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> These are the most common way of gaining this right, however technically arms can also be gained: by a grant from the Crown, by prescription (meaning in use since [[time immemorial]]), by succeeding to an office or by marriage. The descent of arms follow strongly the [[Law of heraldic arms]], which is a branch of English law, interpreted by civil lawyers in the Court of Chivalry. Sir Edward Coke in his ''Commentary upon Littleton'' (1628) wrote that \"gentry and armes is the nature of [[gavelkind]]e, for they descend to all the sonnes.\" Arms in England, therefore descend to all of the male lines, and not just the most senior alone (unlike in Scotland).<ref name=\"Brooke-Little 265\">{{harvnb|Brooke-Little|1978|p=265}}</ref><ref name=\"Woodcock 33\">{{harvnb|Woodcock|Robinson|1988|p=33}}</ref>\n\nWhen a new grant of arms is to be made, it is granted through a [[Letters Patent]]. The Crown delegates all of this authority to the King of Arms, however before any letters can be issued they must have a warrant from the Earl Marshal agreeing to the granting of arms. This has been the case since 1673, when the authority of the Earl Marshal, which the heralds had challenged, was established by a royal declaration stating, among other things, that no patents of arms should be granted without his consent. This established the present system whereby royal authority to approve candidates for grants of arms is exercised by the Earl Marshal, and royal authority to grant the arms themselves is exercised by the Kings of Arms. Firstly a petition is submitted, called a memorial, to the Earl Marshal. This memorial will be drawn up for the petitioner by an officer of arms, if it is felt that such a petition would be accepted.<ref name=\"Grant Arms\"/><ref name=\"Brooke-Little 267\">{{harvnb|Brooke-Little|1978|p=267}}</ref> Currently there are no set criteria for eligibility for a grant of arms, the College recommends that \"awards or honours from the Crown, civil or military commissions, university degrees, professional qualifications, public and charitable services, and eminence or good standing in national or local life\" will be taken into account.<ref name=\"Woodcock 142\"/><ref name=\"Grant Arms\"/><ref name=\"Woodcock 143\"/>\n\n[[File:To all and Singular, Grant of Arms.gif|thumb|right|A section of a modern grant of arms for the Rt.

Suitability rested on the phrase \"eminent men\", originally the test applied was one of wealth or social status, as any man entitled to bear a coat of arms was expected to be a [[gentleman]].<ref name=\"Woodcock 142\"/> By 1530, the heralds applied a property qualification, requiring successful candidates for a grant of arms to have an income from land of \u00a310 per annum, or movable wealth of \u00a3300. However this was not always the case, in 1616 Ralph Brooke, York Herald, tricked Garter King of Arms, [[William Segar]], into granting a coat of arms to [[Gregory Brandon]], a common hangman, for a fee of 22 shillings.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pegge |first=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel Pegge |title=Curialia Miscellanea; Or, Anecdotes of Old Times: Regal, Noble, Gentilitial, and Miscellaneous: Including Authentic Anecdotes of the Royal Household, and the Manners and Customs of the Court, at an Early Period of the English History\n |url=https://archive.org/details/curialiamiscella00pegg |quote=Curialia miscellanea; or, Anecdotes of old times. |year=1818 |publisher=J.

As of 1 January 2016 the fees for a personal grant of arms, including a [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] is \u00a35,875, a grant to a non-profit body is \u00a312,375 and to a commercial company is \u00a318,350. This grant however does not include a grant of a [[Heraldic badge|badge]], [[supporter]]s or a [[Heraldic flag|standard]], their inclusion into the grant requires extra fees.<ref name=\"Grant Arms\"/> The fees mainly go towards commissioning the artwork and calligraphy on the [[vellum]] [[Letters Patent]], which must be done by hand and in a sense a work of art in itself, plus other administrative costs borne by the heralds and for the upkeep of the College.\n\nOnce the Earl Marshal has approved the petition he will issue his Warrant to the King of Arms, this will allow them to proceed with the granting of the arms. It is during this stage that the designing and formation of the arms begin. Although the King of Arms has full discretion over the composition of the arms, he will take into full account the wishes of the applicant. These will include allusions and references to the applicant's life and achievements. The design of any new coat of arms must abide by all the rules of heraldry as well as being entirely original and distinct from all previous arms recorded at the College's archives. A preliminary sketch will then be approved and sent to the petitioner for approval.<ref name=\"Grant Arms\"/><ref name=\"Brooke-Little 267\"/>\n\n[[File:City of Bridgetown, Barbados Armorial bearing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The coat of arms of city of [[Bridgetown]] in the capital and largest city of [[Barbados]].

This takes the form of a handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in [[vellum]] by a College artist and [[scrivener]]. The grant is then signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is always made for the College's own register.<ref name=\"Grant Arms\"/><ref name=\"Brooke-Little 267\"/>\n\nOnce granted, a coat of arms becomes the hereditary and inheritable property of the owner and his descendants. However, this can only be so if the inheritor is a legitimate male-line descendant of the person originally granted with the arms. To establish the right to arms by descent, one must be able to prove that an ancestor had his arms recorded in the registers of the College. If there is a possibility of such an inheritance, one must first make contact with an officer-in-waiting at the College, who could then advise on the course of action and the cost of such a search. The research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry, which will involve the examination of genealogical records. The first step involve a search of the family name in the College's archives, as coats of arms and family name has no connection, the officer could prove, through this method, that there is in fact no descent. However, if a connection is found a genealogical research outside of the College's archives would then be undertaken to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual.<ref name=\"Woodcock 143\"/><ref name=\"Descent Arms\">{{cite web | url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/proving-a-right-to-arms | title=Proving a right to arms | publisher=College of Arms | accessdate=14 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531131511/http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/proving-a-right-to-arms | archive-date=31 May 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Change of names===\nThe College of Arms is also an authorised location for enrolling a [[Name change|change of name]].

On being enrolled the deed is customarily 'gazetted', that is published in the ''[[London Gazette]]''. The deed poll is not entered on the registers, but is still published, if the name change only affects one's [[given name]].<ref name=\"Change name\">{{cite web | url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/name-change | title=Changes of Name | publisher=College of Arms | accessdate=14 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621113834/http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/name-change | archive-date=21 June 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Change of name and arms===\nIt is also possible to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, that is to say a licence in the form of a warrant from [[the Crown]] directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are [[gazetted]] and make a [[deed poll]] unnecessary.<ref name=\"Change name\"/>\n\n===Genealogical records===\n[[File:Robert Glover Pedigree de Euro.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an Elizabethan pedigree of the de Euro family of [[Northumberland]], barons of Warkworth and Clavering.

The officer would ensure that the pedigree was in the correct format and also advise the client on the documentary evidences necessary to supports such a draft. After this is done, the officer would submit the pedigree to a chapter of two other officers, who would then examine the pedigree for any mistakes or in some cases demand more research.

Many of the holders of the office have been related to each other; however, it was not until 1672 that the office became fully hereditary. In that year [[Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk|Henry Howard]] was appointed to the position by King Charles II. In 1677 he also succeeded to the [[Duke of Norfolk|Dukedom of Norfolk]] as the 6th Duke, thus combining the two titles for his successors.<ref name=\"Earl Marshal\"/><ref name=\"Boutell (1863) 109\"/>\n\nThe office originates from that of [[Marshal]], one of the English monarch's chief military officers. As such he became responsible for all matters concerning war and together with the [[Lord High Constable of England|Lord High Constable]] held the joint post as judges of the Court of Chivalry. After the decline of medieval [[chivalry]], the role of Earl Marshal came to concern all matters of state and royal ceremonies.

This thirteen can be divided hierarchically into three distinctive ranks: three [[Kings of Arms]], six [[Herald|Heralds of Arms]] and four [[Pursuivant|Pursuivants of Arms]]. There are also presently seven Officers Extraordinary, who take part in ceremonial occasions but are not part of the College. As members of the Royal Household, the heralds are appointed at the pleasure of the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Earl Marshal.<ref name=\"CoA current officers\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Bedingfeld|Gwynn-Jones|1993|p=24}}</ref> The Officers in Ordinary are appointed by Letters Patent under the [[Great Seal of the Realm]], and the Officers Extraordinary by [[Royal Sign Manual]]; all appointments are announced in the ''[[London Gazette]]''.<ref name=\"Woodcock 139\">{{harvnb|Woodcock|Robinson|1988|p=139}}</ref>\n\nAll of the officers in Ordinary of the College were first instituted at different dates (some even before the incorporation of the College), some originating as private servants of noblemen, some being Royal from the start. They take their names and badges from the titles and [[Royal Badges of England|royal badges]] of the monarchs of England.<ref name=\"Woodcock 139\"/> The officers Extraordinary, however take their names from the titles and estates of the Earl Marshal, they were also created at different dates for ceremonial purposes.<ref name=\"Woodcock 140\">{{harvnb|Woodcock|Robinson|1988|p=140}}</ref>\n\n===Wages===\nThe College is almost entirely self-financed, and is not a recipient of any regular public funding.<ref name=\"CoA work\"/> Its officers do have official salaries, which are paid for by the Crown.

Since the 13th century, records of this distinctive garment were apparent. At first it is likely that the herald wore his master's cast-off coat, but even from the beginning that would have had special significance, signifying that he was in effect his master's representative. Especially when his master was a sovereign prince, the wearing of his coat would haven given the herald a natural diplomatic status.<ref name=\"Wagner 79\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=79}}</ref> [[John Anstis]] wrote that: \"The Wearing the outward Robes of the Prince, hath been esteemed by the Consent of Nations, to be an extraordinary Instance of Favour and Honour, as in the Precedent of ''[[Mordecai]]'', under a king of Persia.\"<ref name=\"Wagner 79\"/> The last King of England to have worn a tabard with his arms was probably King Henry VII. Today the herald's tabard is a survivor of history, much like the [[Court dress#Judges|judges' wigs]] and (until the last century) the bishop's [[gaiter]]s.<ref name=\"Wagner 79\"/>\n\n[[File:W H Weldon Norroy.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[William Weldon (officer of arms)|Sir William Henry Weldon]], the Norroy King of Arms from 1894 until 1911, wearing the tabard and donning the crown of the King of Arms at the 1902 coronation of [[King Edward VII]]]]\nThe tabards of the different officers can be distinguished by the type of fabric used to make them. A tabard of a King of Arms is made of velvet and cloth of gold, the tabard of a Herald of satin and that of a Pursuivant of damask silk. The tabards of all heralds (Ordinary and Extraordinary) are inscribed with the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Sovereign's royal arms]], richly embroidered. It was once the custom for pursuivants to wear their tabards with the sleeves at the front and back, in fact in 1576 a pursuivant was fined for presuming to wear his tabard like a herald<ref name=\"Boutell (1863) 109\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 80\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=80}}</ref> but this practice was ended during the reign of James II. Until 1888 all tabards was provided to the heralds by the Crown, however in that year a parsimonious Treasury refused to ask [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for funds for the purpose. Ever since then heralds either paid for their own tabards or bought the one used by their predecessors. The newest tabard was made in 1963 for the Welsh Herald Extraordinary. A stock of them is now held by the [[Lord Chamberlain]], from which a loan \"during tenure of office\" is made upon each appointment.<ref name=\"Wagner 83\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=83}}</ref> They are often sent to [[Ede & Ravenscroft]] for repair or replacement. In addition, heralds and pursuivants wear black velvet caps with a badge embroidered.\n\nApart from the tabards, the heralds also wear scarlet [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|court uniforms]] with gold embroidery during formal events; with white breeches and stockings for coronations and black for all other times together with black patent court shoes with gold buckles (the Scottish heralds wear black wool serge military style trousers with wide gold oak leaf lace on the side seams and black patent ankle boots; or for women, a long black skirt). The heralds are also entitled to distinctive [[sceptre]]s, which have been a symbol of their office since the Tudor period.<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=91}}</ref> In 1906 new sceptres were made, most likely the initiative of [[Alfred Scott-Gatty|Sir Alfred Scott-Gatty]]. These take the form of short black [[Baton (symbol)|baton]]s with gilded ends, each with a representation of the badges of the different offices of the heralds. In 1953 these were replaced by white staves, with gilded metal handles and at its head a blue dove in a golden coronet or a \"martinet\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=93}}</ref> These blue martinets are derived from the arms of the College.<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=92}}</ref> Another of the heralds' insignia of office is the [[Livery collar|Collar of SS]], which they wear over their uniforms.<ref name=\"Robson 35\"/> During inclement weather, a large black cape is worn. At state funerals, they would wear a wide sash of black silk sarsenet over their tabards (in ancient times, they would have worn long black hooded cloaks under their tabards).\n\nThe three Kings of Arms have also been entitled to wear a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] since the 13th century. However, it was not until much later that the specific design of the crown was regulated. The silver-gilt crown is composed of sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height, inscribed with a line from [[Psalm 51]] in Latin: ''Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam'' (translated: Have mercy on me O God according to Thy great mercy).<ref name=\"Boutell (1863) 109\">{{harvnb|Boutell|1863|p=109}}</ref><ref name=\"Wagner 90\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=90}}</ref> Within the crown is a cap of crimson velvet, lined with [[ermine]], having at the top a large tuft of tassels, wrought in gold. In medieval times the king of arms were required to wear their crowns and attend to the Sovereign on four high feasts of the year: Christmas, Easter, [[Whitsuntide]] and [[All Saint's Day]]. Today, the crown is reserved for the most solemn of occasions. The last time these crowns were worn was at the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953.<ref name=\"Robson 35\"/> At other times, kings of arms wear a black [[bicorne]] trimmed with white ostrich feathers when performing duties outdoors, or a black velvet cap, depending on circumstances of occasion.\n\nThe New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary is a special case when it comes to uniform. Although they do wear the tabard, they only do so when in the UK performing duties. When in New Zealand, they simply wear [[morning dress]] as official uniform, together with their chains and baton.\n\n===Qualifications===\n[[File:Crown of a British King of Arms.svg|thumb|right|upright|Heraldic representation of a King of Arms's crown]]\nThere are no formal qualifications for a herald, but certain specialist knowledge and discipline are required. Most of the current officers are trained lawyers and historians. Noted heraldist and writer [[John Ferne|Sir John Ferne]] wrote in ''The Glory of Generositie'' in 1586 that a herald \"ought to be a Gentlemen and an Old man not admitting into that sacred office everie glasier, painter & tricker, or a meere blazonner of Armes: for to the office of a herald is requisite the skill of many faculties and professions of literature, and likewise the knowledge of warres.\"<ref name=\"Woodcock 143\">{{harvnb|Woodcock|Robinson|1988|p=143}}</ref> Some of the greatest scholars and eminent antiquarians of their age were members of the College, such as [[Robert Glover (officer of arms)|Robert Glover]], [[William Camden]], [[William Dugdale|Sir William Dugdale]], [[Elias Ashmole]], [[John Anstis]], [[Anthony Wagner|Sir Anthony Wagner]] and [[John Brooke-Little]].<ref name=\"CoA past heralds\"/>\n\nEven with these examples, many controversial appointments were made throughout the College's history. For example, in 1704 the architect and dramatist [[John Vanbrugh|Sir John Vanbrugh]] was appointed Clarenceux King of Arms, although he knew little of heraldry and genealogy and was known to have ridiculed both.<ref name=\"Bedingfeld 37\"/><ref name=\"CoA past heralds\"/> Nevertheless, he was also described as \"possibly the most distinguished man who has ever worn a herald's tabard.\"<ref name=\"Wagner 326\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=326}}</ref> Noted antiquarian [[William Oldys]], appointed Norroy King of Arms in 1756, was described as being \"rarely sober in the afternoon, never after supper\", and \"much addicted to low company\".<ref name=\"CoA past heralds\">{{cite web | url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us/some-past-heralds | title=Some past heralds | publisher=College of Arms | accessdate=14 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818133533/http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us/some-past-heralds | archive-date=18 August 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===List of heralds===\n\n====Officers in Ordinary====\n{| border=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:100%; margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"|'''Kings of Arms'''<ref name=\"CoA current officers\"/>\n|-\n!style=\"width: 90px;\"|Arms\n!style=\"width: 25%;\"|Office\n!style=\"width: 25%;\"|Name<br>(Date of appointment)\n!Notes\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Coat of Arms of the Garter King of Arms.svg|80px]]||<center>[[Garter Principal King of Arms]]</center>||<center>[[Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|Thomas Woodcock, CVO, BA (Durham), LLB (Cambridge), DL, FSA]]<br>(1 April 2010)<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59385 |page=6033 |date=8 April 2010 |nolink=yes}}</ref></center>||The senior King of Arms (his title is a reference to the Order of the Garter).

with jurisdiction over England, [[Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]] and some [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth realms]]. The heralds are appointed by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Sovereign]] and are delegated authority to act on behalf of the Crown in all matters of [[heraldry]], the granting of new [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], [[Genealogy|genealogical research]] and the recording of [[pedigree chart|pedigrees]]. The College is also the official body responsible for matters relating to the flying of flags on land, and it maintains the official registers of flags and other national symbols. Though a part of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household of the United Kingdom]] the College is self-financed, unsupported by any public funds.\n\nFounded by [[royal charter]] in 1484 by King [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the College is one of the few remaining official [[heraldic authority|heraldic authorities]] in Europe. Within the United Kingdom, there are two such authorities, the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] in Scotland and the College for [[Countries of the United Kingdom|the rest of the United Kingdom]]. The College has had its home in the [[City of London]] since its foundation, and has been at its present location, on [[Queen Victoria Street, London|Queen Victoria Street]], since 1555.<ref>The College originally occupied a property between St Paul's and Thames St known as Derby Place, which burned in the Great Fire.  The replacement building, known simply as the College of Arms or Herald's College, was built on the same property.  When Queen Victoria St was built it crossed the south end of the College's property; the building was then remodeled to front onto the new street.</ref>  The College of Arms also undertakes and consults on the planning of many [[Ceremony|ceremonial occasion]]s such as [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]]s, [[State funerals in the United Kingdom|state funerals]], the annual [[Garter Service]] and the [[State Opening of Parliament]]. Heralds of the College accompany the sovereign on many of these occasions.\n\nThe College comprises thirteen officers or heralds: three [[Kings of Arms]], six [[Herald|Heralds of Arms]] and four [[Pursuivant|Pursuivants of Arms]]. There are also seven officers extraordinary, who take part in ceremonial occasions but are not part of the College. The entire corporation is overseen by the [[Earl Marshal]], a hereditary office held by the [[Duke of Norfolk]], currently [[Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Rous Roll - Richard and family.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Depiction of King Richard III the College of Arms' founder, his wife Queen Anne Neville and their son Prince Edward, Prince of Wales with their heraldic crests and badges from the Rous Roll.

As a result, the heralds were left destitute and many of their books and records were lost.<ref name=\"CoA history\"/><ref name=\"Robson 36\"/><ref name=\"Woodcock 140\"/> Despite this ill treatment from the King, the heralds' position at the [[royal court]] remained, and they were compelled by the King to attend him at all times (albeit in rotation).<ref name=\"Wagner 136\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=136}}</ref>\n\nOf the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], it has been said that: \"at no time since its establishment, was [the college] in higher estimation, nor in fuller employment, than in this reign.\"<ref name=\"the Noble 101\">{{harvnb|Noble|1805|p=101}}</ref> Henry VIII was fond of pomp and magnificence, and thus gave the heralds plenty of opportunity to exercise their roles in his court. In addition, the members of the College were also expected to be regularly despatched to foreign courts on missions, whether to declare war, accompany armies, summon garrisons or deliver messages to foreign potentates and generals.<ref name=\"the Noble 101\" /> During his magnificent meeting with [[Francis I of France]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] in 1520, Henry VIII brought with him eighteen officers of arms, probably all he had, to regulate the many tournaments and ceremonies held there.<ref name=\"Noble 107\">{{harvnb|Noble|1805|p=107}}</ref>\n\n[[File:English Officers of Arms 1511.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Officers of the College of Arms riding in procession to the [[Tournament (medieval)|Westminster Tournament]], from a tourney roll, made during the reign of King Henry VIII in 1511.

They even resorted to meeting at each other's houses, at various guildhalls and even a hospital.<ref name=\"Wagner 181\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=181}}</ref> Furthermore, Henry VIII's habit of raising ladies in the situation of subjects to queens, and then awarding them many [[Augmentation of honour|heraldic augmentations]], which also extended to their respective families, was considered harmful to the science of heraldry.<ref name=\"Noble 107\"/> The noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] commented in 1863, that the: \"Arms of Queen [[Anne Boleyn]] are the first which exemplify the usage, introduced by Henry VIII, of granting to his Consorts 'Augmentations' to their paternal arms. It is a striking illustration of the degenerate condition of Heraldry under the second Tudor Sovereign.\"<ref name=\"Boutell (1863) 242\">{{harvnb|Boutell|1863|p=242}}</ref>\n\nIt was also in this reign in 1530, that Henry VIII conferred on the College one of its most important duties for almost a century, the [[heraldic visitation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Boutell|1863|p=125}}</ref> The provincial Kings of Arms were commissioned under a royal warrant to enter all houses and churches and given authority to deface and destroy all arms unlawfully used by any knight, esquire, or gentleman. Around the time of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] this duty became even more necessary as the monasteries were previously repositories of local genealogical records. From then on, all genealogical records and the duty of recording them was subsumed by the College. These visitations were serious affairs, and many individuals were charged and heavily fined for breaking the [[law of arms]]. Hundreds of these visitations were carried out well into the 17th century; the last was in 1686.<ref name=\"Woodcock 140\"/><ref name=\"Noble 105\">{{harvnb|Noble|1805|p=105}}</ref>\n\n===Reincorporation===\n[[File:Tudor Roll of arms, Sir Thomas Wriothesley.png|thumb|right|upright|Roll of grants of arms during the [[Tudor period]] by Sir Thomas Wriothesley, c&nbsp;1528]]\nThe College found a patroness in [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], although it must have been embarrassing for both sides, after the heralds initially proclaimed the right of her rival [[Lady Jane Grey]] to the throne. When King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] died on 6 July 1553, Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed queen four days later, first in [[Cheapside]] then in [[Fleet Street]] by two heralds, trumpets blowing before them. However, when popular support swung to Mary's side, the Lord Mayor of London and his councils accompanied by the Garter King of Arms, two other heralds, and four trumpeters returned to Cheapside to proclaim Mary's ascension as rightful queen instead.<ref name=\"Noble 149\">{{harvnb|Noble|1805|p=149}}</ref> The College's excuse was that they were compelled in their earlier act by the [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]] (Lady Jane's father-in-law, who was later executed), an excuse that Mary accepted.<ref name=\"Noble 150\">{{harvnb|Noble|1805|p=150}}</ref>\n\nThe queen and her husband (and co-sovereign) [[Philip II of Spain]] then set about granting the College a new house called Derby Place or Derby House, under a new charter, dated 18 July 1555 at [[Hampton Court Palace]].<ref name=\"Woodcock 140\"/><ref name=\"Noble 150\"/> The house was built by [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]], who married Lady Margaret Beaufort in 1482 and was created the 1st [[Earl of Derby]] in 1485.<ref name=\"Wagner 182\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=182}}</ref> The house was built in 1503 and was given to the Crown by the [[Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby|3rd Earl]] in 1552/3 in exchange for some land.<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=183}}</ref> The charter stated that the house would: \"enable them [the College] to assemble together, and consult, and agree amongst themselves, for the good of their faculty, and that the records and rolls might be more safely and conveniently deposited.\"<ref name=\"Noble 150\"/> The charter also reincorporated the three kings of arms, six heralds and all other heralds and pursuivants, and their successors, into a corporation with perpetual succession. A new seal of authority, with the College's full coat of arms was also engraved. On 16 May 1565, the name \"the House of the Office of Arms\" was used, thereafter in May 1566 \"our Colledge of Armes\", and in January 1567 \"our House of the College of the office of arms\".<ref name=\"Wagner 182\"/>\n\nDerby Place was situated in the parish of St Benedict and St Peter, south of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]], more or less on the College's present location.<ref name=\"CoA history\"/><ref name=\"Robson 36\"/> There are records of the heralds carrying out modifications to the structure of Derby Place over many years. However, little record of its appearance has survived, except the description that the buildings formed three sides of a quadrangle, entered through a gate with a portcullis on the west side.

In February 1800, the College was asked by a Select Committee of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to report to them the state of public records; again the heralds drew attention to the proximity of the Sugar House. Members of the committee inspected the College premises and reported to the House that the College must either be moved to a new building or secured against the risk of fire. Again nothing was done; in 1812 water seeped through the walls of the College damaging records. The Surveyor traced the leak back to a shed recently erected by Mr. Alderman Smith, owner of the Sugar House, who declared his readiness to do everything he could, but who actually did very little to rectify the situation.<ref name=\"Wagner 472\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=472}}</ref> After years of negotiation the College, in 1820, bought the Sugar House from Smith for the sum of \u00a31,500.<ref name=\"Wagner 474\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=474}}</ref> \n[[File:Herald's College April 17, 1830.jpg|thumb|left|Herald's College, Bennet's Hill.

This generous endowment from the crown, the first since 1555, was applied towards the reparation and support of the College.<ref name=\"Wagner 475\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=475}}</ref><ref name=\"Woodcock 141\"/> Despite the successes of the purchase of the Sugar House and the royal endowment, the College still looked upon the possibility of moving its location to a more suitable and fashionable place.<ref name=\"Wagner 475\"/> [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] was at the same time laying out his plans for a new London, and, in 1822, the College, through the Deputy Earl Marshal, asked the government for a portion of land in the new districts on which to build a house to keep their records. A petition from the College was given to the Lords of the Treasury setting out the herald's reason for the move: \"that the local situation of the College is so widely detached from the proper scene of the official duties and occupations of Your Memorialists and from the residences of that class of persons by whom the records in their charge are chiefly and most frequently consulted.\"<ref name=\"Wagner 477\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=477}}</ref>\n\nNash himself was asked by the College to design a new building near fashionable [[Trafalgar Square]] but Nash's elaborate plan proved too costly and ambitious for the College.<ref name=\"Wagner 478\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=478}}</ref> At the same time the College also asked [[Robert Abraham (architect)|Robert Abraham]] to submit to them a second plan for the building.

However they were constantly beset by conflicts between the different officers over the amount needed to build a new building. By 1827 the college still had no coherent plan; the [[Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] ordered the College to drop the matter altogether.<ref name=\"Wagner 486\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=486}}</ref> By 1842 the heralds were reconciled with their location and once again commissioned Abraham to build a new octagonal-shaped Record Room on the site of the old Sugar House.<ref name=\"CoA architecture\"/>\n\nIn 1861 a proposal was made to construct a road from [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] to the [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]]; this would have resulted in the complete demolition of the College. However, protests from the heralds resulted in only parts of the south east and south west wings being sliced off, requiring extensive remodelling. The College was now a three-sided building with an open courtyard facing the New Queen Victoria Street laid out in 1866.

The warrant issued on the behalf of the [[Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], stated: \"that it is desirable that the College of Arms should be visited, and an inquiry instituted with the view of ascertaining whether the Rules and Orders for the good government of the said College&nbsp;... are duly obeyed and fulfilled&nbsp;... and whether by change of circumstances or any other cause, any new Laws, Ordinances or Regulations are necessary to be made&nbsp;... for the said College.\"<ref name=\"Wagner 518\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=518}}</ref> The commission had three members: [[Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Glossop|Lord Edward Fitzalan-Howard]] (the Deputy Earl Marshal), [[Sir William Alexander, 3rd Baronet|Sir William Alexander]] (Queen's Counsel) and [[Edward Bellasis (lawyer)|Edward Bellasis]] (a Sergeant at Law).<ref name=\"Wagner 507\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=507}}</ref> [[Bernard Burke|Sir Bernard Burke]] (of the famous [[Burke's Peerage]]), at the time Ulster King of Arms, gave the commission the advice that the College should: \"be made a Government Department, let its Officers receive fixed salaries from Government, and let all its fees be paid into the public exchequer.

However unlike the Lyon Court, which was a [[court of law]] and part of the [[Courts of Scotland|Scottish Judiciary]], the College of Arms has always been an independent corporate body overseen by the Earl Marshal.

At the beginning of the 20th century these issues were once again brought to the forefront. In 1903 an inquiry was set up at the instructions of [[Arthur Balfour]], soon to be [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. The committee of inquiry was to consist of eight members, [[Algernon West|Sir Algernon West]] was made chairman. They were tasked to investigate \"the constitution, duties and administration of the Heralds' College\".

Firstly they concluded that the fees systems were adequate and no change was necessary in that regard. They justified this by stating that \"placing all or even a few of the Officers on a fixed salary outweigh any advantages which might be expected to result from the change.\"<ref name=\"1928 inquiry\"/> Secondly they concluded that from now on the College was to be entirely subordinated to the Home Office, and that a standing inter-departmental committee be established to settle any future conflicts.<ref name=\"1928 inquiry\"/>\n\n===Present===\n[[File:London College of Arms 2011 05.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Main entrance to the College of Arms, 2011]]\nIn 1934, on the 450th anniversary of the incorporation of the College of Arms, an exhibition was held at the College of the herald's principal treasures and other associated interests. The exhibition was opened by the [[Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk|Earl Marshal]] and ran from 28 June to 26 July, during which time it received more than 10,000&nbsp;visitors, including the Duke ([[George VI]]) and Duchess of York ([[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=547}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939 at the beginning of the Second World War the College's records were moved to [[Thornbury Castle]] in Gloucestershire, the home of Major [[Algar Howard]] (the Norroy King of Arms). Meanwhile, on 10 and 11 May 1941 the College building was almost consumed by fire, which had already levelled all the buildings to the east of the College on Queen Victoria Street. The building was given up for lost, when a change in the wind saved it. At the end of the war, all of the records were returned safely to the College.<ref name=\"Wagner 548\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=548}}</ref>\n\nIn 1943 the College was given new responsibilities when the office of Ulster King of Arms was annexed and combined with those of the Norroy King of Arms, creating a new office called Norroy and Ulster King of Arms; Sir Algar Howard thus became the first to hold this office.<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=551}}</ref>  \n\nAlthough the College building was saved from the war, its walls and roof were left in a perilous state. In 1954 a decision was forced upon heralds, whether to abandon the old building (which would have been profitable financially) or repair it on a scale far beyond the College's resources. Eventually with the help of the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] and a public subscription, the building was repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place.<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=528}}</ref> The present gates to the building were added in 1956, and came originally from [[Goodrich Court]] in Herefordshire.

However, the monarch has delegated this power to two authorities; the Lord Lyon, with jurisdiction over Scotland and the College of Arms over England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Under the latter's jurisdiction, the right to arms is acquired exclusively either by proving descent in an unbroken male-line from someone registered as so entitled or by a new grant from the King of Arms.<ref name=\"Grant Arms\">{{cite web | url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/granting-arms | title=Granting of Arms | publisher=College of Arms | accessdate=14 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613152725/http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/granting-arms | archive-date=13 June 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> These are the most common way of gaining this right, however technically arms can also be gained: by a grant from the Crown, by prescription (meaning in use since [[time immemorial]]), by succeeding to an office or by marriage. The descent of arms follow strongly the [[Law of heraldic arms]], which is a branch of English law, interpreted by civil lawyers in the Court of Chivalry. Sir Edward Coke in his ''Commentary upon Littleton'' (1628) wrote that \"gentry and armes is the nature of [[gavelkind]]e, for they descend to all the sonnes.\" Arms in England, therefore descend to all of the male lines, and not just the most senior alone (unlike in Scotland).<ref name=\"Brooke-Little 265\">{{harvnb|Brooke-Little|1978|p=265}}</ref><ref name=\"Woodcock 33\">{{harvnb|Woodcock|Robinson|1988|p=33}}</ref>\n\nWhen a new grant of arms is to be made, it is granted through a [[Letters Patent]]. The Crown delegates all of this authority to the King of Arms, however before any letters can be issued they must have a warrant from the Earl Marshal agreeing to the granting of arms. This has been the case since 1673, when the authority of the Earl Marshal, which the heralds had challenged, was established by a royal declaration stating, among other things, that no patents of arms should be granted without his consent. This established the present system whereby royal authority to approve candidates for grants of arms is exercised by the Earl Marshal, and royal authority to grant the arms themselves is exercised by the Kings of Arms. Firstly a petition is submitted, called a memorial, to the Earl Marshal. This memorial will be drawn up for the petitioner by an officer of arms, if it is felt that such a petition would be accepted.<ref name=\"Grant Arms\"/><ref name=\"Brooke-Little 267\">{{harvnb|Brooke-Little|1978|p=267}}</ref> Currently there are no set criteria for eligibility for a grant of arms, the College recommends that \"awards or honours from the Crown, civil or military commissions, university degrees, professional qualifications, public and charitable services, and eminence or good standing in national or local life\" will be taken into account.<ref name=\"Woodcock 142\"/><ref name=\"Grant Arms\"/><ref name=\"Woodcock 143\"/>\n\n[[File:To all and Singular, Grant of Arms.gif|thumb|right|A section of a modern grant of arms for the Rt.

Suitability rested on the phrase \"eminent men\", originally the test applied was one of wealth or social status, as any man entitled to bear a coat of arms was expected to be a [[gentleman]].<ref name=\"Woodcock 142\"/> By 1530, the heralds applied a property qualification, requiring successful candidates for a grant of arms to have an income from land of \u00a310 per annum, or movable wealth of \u00a3300. However this was not always the case, in 1616 Ralph Brooke, York Herald, tricked Garter King of Arms, [[William Segar]], into granting a coat of arms to [[Gregory Brandon]], a common hangman, for a fee of 22 shillings.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pegge |first=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel Pegge |title=Curialia Miscellanea; Or, Anecdotes of Old Times: Regal, Noble, Gentilitial, and Miscellaneous: Including Authentic Anecdotes of the Royal Household, and the Manners and Customs of the Court, at an Early Period of the English History\n |url=https://archive.org/details/curialiamiscella00pegg |quote=Curialia miscellanea; or, Anecdotes of old times. |year=1818 |publisher=J.

As of 1 January 2016 the fees for a personal grant of arms, including a [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] is \u00a35,875, a grant to a non-profit body is \u00a312,375 and to a commercial company is \u00a318,350. This grant however does not include a grant of a [[Heraldic badge|badge]], [[supporter]]s or a [[Heraldic flag|standard]], their inclusion into the grant requires extra fees.<ref name=\"Grant Arms\"/> The fees mainly go towards commissioning the artwork and calligraphy on the [[vellum]] [[Letters Patent]], which must be done by hand and in a sense a work of art in itself, plus other administrative costs borne by the heralds and for the upkeep of the College.\n\nOnce the Earl Marshal has approved the petition he will issue his Warrant to the King of Arms, this will allow them to proceed with the granting of the arms. It is during this stage that the designing and formation of the arms begin. Although the King of Arms has full discretion over the composition of the arms, he will take into full account the wishes of the applicant. These will include allusions and references to the applicant's life and achievements. The design of any new coat of arms must abide by all the rules of heraldry as well as being entirely original and distinct from all previous arms recorded at the College's archives. A preliminary sketch will then be approved and sent to the petitioner for approval.<ref name=\"Grant Arms\"/><ref name=\"Brooke-Little 267\"/>\n\n[[File:City of Bridgetown, Barbados Armorial bearing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The coat of arms of city of [[Bridgetown]] in the capital and largest city of [[Barbados]]. The arms were granted to the city on 20 September 1960 by the College of Arms.]]\nAs soon as the composition of the [[blazon]] is agreed to by both parties a final grant could then be created. This takes the form of a handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in [[vellum]] by a College artist and [[scrivener]]. The grant is then signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is always made for the College's own register.<ref name=\"Grant Arms\"/><ref name=\"Brooke-Little 267\"/>\n\nOnce granted, a coat of arms becomes the hereditary and inheritable property of the owner and his descendants. However, this can only be so if the inheritor is a legitimate male-line descendant of the person originally granted with the arms. To establish the right to arms by descent, one must be able to prove that an ancestor had his arms recorded in the registers of the College. If there is a possibility of such an inheritance, one must first make contact with an officer-in-waiting at the College, who could then advise on the course of action and the cost of such a search. The research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry, which will involve the examination of genealogical records. The first step involve a search of the family name in the College's archives, as coats of arms and family name has no connection, the officer could prove, through this method, that there is in fact no descent. However, if a connection is found a genealogical research outside of the College's archives would then be undertaken to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual.<ref name=\"Woodcock 143\"/><ref name=\"Descent Arms\">{{cite web | url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/proving-a-right-to-arms | title=Proving a right to arms | publisher=College of Arms | accessdate=14 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531131511/http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/proving-a-right-to-arms | archive-date=31 May 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Change of names===\nThe College of Arms is also an authorised location for enrolling a [[Name change|change of name]]. In common law there is no obligation to undergo any particular formality to change one's name. However, it is possible to execute a [[deed poll]], more specifically a [[deed of change of name]], as a demonstration of intention to adopt and henceforth use a new name, and deeds poll may be enrolled either in the [[High Court]] or in the College. On being enrolled the deed is customarily 'gazetted', that is published in the ''[[London Gazette]]''. The deed poll is not entered on the registers, but is still published, if the name change only affects one's [[given name]].<ref name=\"Change name\">{{cite web | url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/name-change | title=Changes of Name | publisher=College of Arms | accessdate=14 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621113834/http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/name-change | archive-date=21 June 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Change of name and arms===\nIt is also possible to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, that is to say a licence in the form of a warrant from [[the Crown]] directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are [[gazetted]] and make a [[deed poll]] unnecessary.<ref name=\"Change name\"/>\n\n===Genealogical records===\n[[File:Robert Glover Pedigree de Euro.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an Elizabethan pedigree of the de Euro family of [[Northumberland]], barons of Warkworth and Clavering.

This would require the services of an officer of the College who would then draft a pedigree. The officer would ensure that the pedigree was in the correct format and also advise the client on the documentary evidences necessary to supports such a draft. After this is done, the officer would submit the pedigree to a chapter of two other officers, who would then examine the pedigree for any mistakes or in some cases demand more research.

Many of the holders of the office have been related to each other; however, it was not until 1672 that the office became fully hereditary. In that year [[Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk|Henry Howard]] was appointed to the position by King Charles II.

Since the 13th century, records of this distinctive garment were apparent. At first it is likely that the herald wore his master's cast-off coat, but even from the beginning that would have had special significance, signifying that he was in effect his master's representative. Especially when his master was a sovereign prince, the wearing of his coat would haven given the herald a natural diplomatic status.<ref name=\"Wagner 79\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=79}}</ref> [[John Anstis]] wrote that: \"The Wearing the outward Robes of the Prince, hath been esteemed by the Consent of Nations, to be an extraordinary Instance of Favour and Honour, as in the Precedent of ''[[Mordecai]]'', under a king of Persia.\"<ref name=\"Wagner 79\"/> The last King of England to have worn a tabard with his arms was probably King Henry VII. Today the herald's tabard is a survivor of history, much like the [[Court dress#Judges|judges' wigs]] and (until the last century) the bishop's [[gaiter]]s.<ref name=\"Wagner 79\"/>\n\n[[File:W H Weldon Norroy.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[William Weldon (officer of arms)|Sir William Henry Weldon]], the Norroy King of Arms from 1894 until 1911, wearing the tabard and donning the crown of the King of Arms at the 1902 coronation of [[King Edward VII]]]]\nThe tabards of the different officers can be distinguished by the type of fabric used to make them. A tabard of a King of Arms is made of velvet and cloth of gold, the tabard of a Herald of satin and that of a Pursuivant of damask silk. The tabards of all heralds (Ordinary and Extraordinary) are inscribed with the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Sovereign's royal arms]], richly embroidered. It was once the custom for pursuivants to wear their tabards with the sleeves at the front and back, in fact in 1576 a pursuivant was fined for presuming to wear his tabard like a herald<ref name=\"Boutell (1863) 109\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 80\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=80}}</ref> but this practice was ended during the reign of James II. Until 1888 all tabards was provided to the heralds by the Crown, however in that year a parsimonious Treasury refused to ask [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for funds for the purpose. Ever since then heralds either paid for their own tabards or bought the one used by their predecessors. The newest tabard was made in 1963 for the Welsh Herald Extraordinary. A stock of them is now held by the [[Lord Chamberlain]], from which a loan \"during tenure of office\" is made upon each appointment.<ref name=\"Wagner 83\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=83}}</ref> They are often sent to [[Ede & Ravenscroft]] for repair or replacement. In addition, heralds and pursuivants wear black velvet caps with a badge embroidered.\n\nApart from the tabards, the heralds also wear scarlet [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|court uniforms]] with gold embroidery during formal events; with white breeches and stockings for coronations and black for all other times together with black patent court shoes with gold buckles (the Scottish heralds wear black wool serge military style trousers with wide gold oak leaf lace on the side seams and black patent ankle boots; or for women, a long black skirt). The heralds are also entitled to distinctive [[sceptre]]s, which have been a symbol of their office since the Tudor period.<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=91}}</ref> In 1906 new sceptres were made, most likely the initiative of [[Alfred Scott-Gatty|Sir Alfred Scott-Gatty]]. These take the form of short black [[Baton (symbol)|baton]]s with gilded ends, each with a representation of the badges of the different offices of the heralds. In 1953 these were replaced by white staves, with gilded metal handles and at its head a blue dove in a golden coronet or a \"martinet\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=93}}</ref> These blue martinets are derived from the arms of the College.<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=92}}</ref> Another of the heralds' insignia of office is the [[Livery collar|Collar of SS]], which they wear over their uniforms.<ref name=\"Robson 35\"/> During inclement weather, a large black cape is worn. At state funerals, they would wear a wide sash of black silk sarsenet over their tabards (in ancient times, they would have worn long black hooded cloaks under their tabards).\n\nThe three Kings of Arms have also been entitled to wear a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] since the 13th century. However, it was not until much later that the specific design of the crown was regulated. The silver-gilt crown is composed of sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height, inscribed with a line from [[Psalm 51]] in Latin: ''Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam'' (translated: Have mercy on me O God according to Thy great mercy).<ref name=\"Boutell (1863) 109\">{{harvnb|Boutell|1863|p=109}}</ref><ref name=\"Wagner 90\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=90}}</ref> Within the crown is a cap of crimson velvet, lined with [[ermine]], having at the top a large tuft of tassels, wrought in gold. In medieval times the king of arms were required to wear their crowns and attend to the Sovereign on four high feasts of the year: Christmas, Easter, [[Whitsuntide]] and [[All Saint's Day]]. Today, the crown is reserved for the most solemn of occasions. The last time these crowns were worn was at the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953.<ref name=\"Robson 35\"/> At other times, kings of arms wear a black [[bicorne]] trimmed with white ostrich feathers when performing duties outdoors, or a black velvet cap, depending on circumstances of occasion.\n\nThe New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary is a special case when it comes to uniform. Although they do wear the tabard, they only do so when in the UK performing duties. When in New Zealand, they simply wear [[morning dress]] as official uniform, together with their chains and baton.\n\n===Qualifications===\n[[File:Crown of a British King of Arms.svg|thumb|right|upright|Heraldic representation of a King of Arms's crown]]\nThere are no formal qualifications for a herald, but certain specialist knowledge and discipline are required. Most of the current officers are trained lawyers and historians. Noted heraldist and writer [[John Ferne|Sir John Ferne]] wrote in ''The Glory of Generositie'' in 1586 that a herald \"ought to be a Gentlemen and an Old man not admitting into that sacred office everie glasier, painter & tricker, or a meere blazonner of Armes: for to the office of a herald is requisite the skill of many faculties and professions of literature, and likewise the knowledge of warres.\"<ref name=\"Woodcock 143\">{{harvnb|Woodcock|Robinson|1988|p=143}}</ref> Some of the greatest scholars and eminent antiquarians of their age were members of the College, such as [[Robert Glover (officer of arms)|Robert Glover]], [[William Camden]], [[William Dugdale|Sir William Dugdale]], [[Elias Ashmole]], [[John Anstis]], [[Anthony Wagner|Sir Anthony Wagner]] and [[John Brooke-Little]].<ref name=\"CoA past heralds\"/>\n\nEven with these examples, many controversial appointments were made throughout the College's history. For example, in 1704 the architect and dramatist [[John Vanbrugh|Sir John Vanbrugh]] was appointed Clarenceux King of Arms, although he knew little of heraldry and genealogy and was known to have ridiculed both.<ref name=\"Bedingfeld 37\"/><ref name=\"CoA past heralds\"/> Nevertheless, he was also described as \"possibly the most distinguished man who has ever worn a herald's tabard.\"<ref name=\"Wagner 326\">{{harvnb|Wagner|1967|p=326}}</ref> Noted antiquarian [[William Oldys]], appointed Norroy King of Arms in 1756, was described as being \"rarely sober in the afternoon, never after supper\", and \"much addicted to low company\".<ref name=\"CoA past heralds\">{{cite web | url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us/some-past-heralds | title=Some past heralds | publisher=College of Arms | accessdate=14 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818133533/http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us/some-past-heralds | archive-date=18 August 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===List of heralds===\n\n====Officers in Ordinary====\n{| border=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:100%; margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"|'''Kings of Arms'''<ref name=\"CoA current officers\"/>\n|-\n!style=\"width: 90px;\"|Arms\n!style=\"width: 25%;\"|Office\n!style=\"width: 25%;\"|Name<br>(Date of appointment)\n!Notes\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Coat of Arms of the Garter King of Arms.svg|80px]]||<center>[[Garter Principal King of Arms]]</center>||<center>[[Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|Thomas Woodcock, CVO, BA (Durham), LLB (Cambridge), DL, FSA]]<br>(1 April 2010)<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59385 |page=6033 |date=8 April 2010 |nolink=yes}}</ref></center>||The senior King of Arms (his title is a reference to the Order of the Garter).

The competitions were basic in structure, and were associated with the anti-colonial movement. The [[Somali Youth League]] (SYL), the nation's first political party, had put together a team of local youth to play against the Italian expatriate teams. The soccer team the FYL had assembled, which would later change its name to Bondhere, won the first several competitions. In 1951, the [[Somali Football Federation]] (SFF) was founded. The first Somali commissioner for sport was later established in 1958.\n\nAlthough the Somali national football team took part in preliminary matches, it has never qualified for the final stages of a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. For many years after the outbreak of the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] in the early 1990s, FIFA-sanctioned games could not be played within the country. Qualifying matches for the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] and the World Cup were instead contested away from home. However, following the pacification of the capital [[Mogadishu]] in 2011, the SFF began preparations for the first major sporting event to be held in years at the [[Mogadishu Stadium]], in December 2012.\n\nPrior to 2019, the Somali FA decided they would admit to all their young and upcoming youth talents and put out local trials to fortify both Olympic and national football teams.\n\nIn addition, many from the Somali diaspora in the past have produced quality football players such as Islam Feiruz and Mukhtar Ali.\n\nOn 5 September 2019, Somalia won their first qualifying match since 1984 (against [[Kenya national football team|Kenya]] - AFCON Qualifying) and their first ever FIFA World Cup qualifying match, beating [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] by 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49621822|title=World Cup qualifying: Somalia national team's history-making driving instructor|website=BBC News|date=8 September

([[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]; 12 November 1963)\n}}\nThe '''Somalia national footballers team''' ({{lang-so|Xeegada Qaranka Soomaaliya}}), nicknamed the ''Ocean Stars'', represents [[Somalia]] in international [[association football|football]] and is controlled by the [[Somali Football Federation]] (SFF), a member of the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF).\n\n==History==\nThe first Somali football teams were established in the 1940s. The competitions were basic in structure, and were associated with the anti-colonial movement. The [[Somali Youth League]] (SYL), the nation's first political party, had put together a team of local youth to play against the Italian expatriate teams. The soccer team the FYL had assembled, which would later change its name to Bondhere, won the first several competitions. In 1951, the [[Somali Football Federation]] (SFF) was founded. The first Somali commissioner for sport was later established in 1958.\n\nAlthough the Somali national football team took part in preliminary matches, it has never qualified for the final stages of a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. For many years after the outbreak of the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] in the early 1990s, FIFA-sanctioned games could not be played within the country. Qualifying matches for the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] and the World Cup were instead contested away from home. However, following the pacification of the capital [[Mogadishu]] in 2011, the SFF began preparations for the first major sporting event to be held in years at the [[Mogadishu Stadium]], in December 2012.\n\nPrior to 2019, the Somali FA decided they would admit to all their young and upcoming youth talents and put out local trials to fortify both Olympic and national football teams.\n\nIn addition, many from the Somali diaspora in the past have produced quality football players such as Islam Feiruz and Mukhtar Ali.\n\nOn 5 September 2019, Somalia won their first qualifying match since 1984 (against [[Kenya national football team|Kenya]] - AFCON Qualifying) and their first ever FIFA World Cup qualifying match, beating [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] by 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49621822|title=World Cup qualifying: Somalia national team's history-making driving instructor|website=BBC News|date=8 September

Forecasters first identified the threat on October&nbsp;16 as a large upper-level [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] was expected to combine with an unstable atmosphere across Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas particularly. On the evening of October&nbsp;20, discrete [[supercell]] thunderstorms developed across the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]], contributing to several tornadoes. One of those tornadoes caused EF3 damage in the Dallas suburbs, becoming the costliest tornado event in Texas history, at $1.55&nbsp;billion. A later [[squall line]] contributed to additional tornadoes and a widespread swath of damaging winds as the system tracked eastward.\n\n==Meteorological synopsis==\nThe first signs of organized severe weather across the [[South Central United States]] came on October&nbsp;16, when the [[Storm Prediction Center]] (SPC) first delineated a risk area across portions of northern Texas, eastern Oklahoma, and adjacent portions of Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Elizabeth Leitman|title=Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook Issued on Oct 16, 2019|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/archive/2019/day4-8_20191016.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 16, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> In their day&nbsp;3 outlook on October&nbsp;18, the organization introduced a broad Marginal risk for much of the same areas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brynn Kerr|title=Oct 18, 2019 0730 UTC Day 3 Severe Thunderstorm Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day3otlk_20191018_0730.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 18, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> A small Slight risk was added across northeastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, and western Arkansas on October&nbsp;19,<ref>{{cite web|author=Brynn Kerr|title=Oct 19, 2019 0600 UTC Day 2 Convective Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day2otlk_20191019_0600.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 19, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> but as confidence in a higher-end event increased, these same areas were raised to an Enhanced risk.<ref name=\"d1\">{{cite web|author=Roger Edwards|author2=Andy Dean|title=Oct 20, 2019 1300 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day1otlk_20191020_1300.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> In advance of the outbreak, the SPC monitored several weather features of interest. In the upper levels of the atmosphere, an upper-level [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] was expected to amplify as it progressed eastward into the U.S. Plains, providing increasing wind shear throughout the region. Simultaneously, a [[low-pressure area]] and associated [[cold front]] were anticipated to shift eastward across an unstable environment, leading to the formation of severe thunderstorms. Forecasters noted that while the overall environment supported the potential for significant ([[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF2+]]) tornadoes, questions about whether storms would be supercellular or instead evolve into a [[quasi-linear convective system]] prevented the addition a significant risk area.<ref name=\"d1\" /> By the late afternoon hours of October&nbsp;20, thunderstorms began to develop across eastern Oklahoma within a rapidly-moistening environment.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Mosier|author2=Jeremy Grams|title=Mesoscale Discussion 2089|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/2019/md2089.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> At 7:58&nbsp;p.m. CDT, the first [[tornado watch]] was issued across the [[Ark-La-Tex]] region;<ref>{{cite web|title=Tornado Watch 676|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2019/ww0676.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> several more watches were introduced over subsequent hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=SPC Severe Weather Event Review for Sunday October 20 2019|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/archive/event.php?date=20191020|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> A pair of long-tracked supercells developed across [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] and [[Johnson County, Texas|Johnson]] counties, intersecting a very unstable regime and producing significant tornadoes as a result.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Mosier|title=Mesoscale Discussion 2090|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/2019/md2090.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> A squall line formed along the cold front farther west, producing a wide swath of damaging winds and additional tornadoes as it tracked across the South-Central United States.<ref name=\"dallas\">{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Fort Worth, Texas|title=Texas Event Report: EF3 Tornado|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=856409|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2019|accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SPC Storm Reports for 10/20/19|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/191020_rpts.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Confirmed tornadoes==\n{{Tornado Chart\n|Total = 36\n|FU = 0\n|F0 = 13\n|F1 = 20\n|F2 = 2\n|F3 = 1\n|F4 = 0\n|F5 = 0\n|Enhanced=yes\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ Confirmed tornadoes during the tornado outbreak of October 20\u201322, 2019{{efn|All dates are based on the local [[time zone]] where the tornado touched down; however, all times are in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] for consistency.|group=note|name=Date/Time}}\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:3%; text-align:center;\"|[[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF#]]\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:7%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Location\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|County / Parish\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:5%; text-align:center;\"|State\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Start Coord.\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"7%\" align=\"center\"|Date\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Time ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Path length\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Max width\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:48%; text-align:center;\"|Summary\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:3%; text-align:center;\"|Refs\n|-\n|bgcolor={{storm colour|storm}} | EF0\n|SW of [[Beckville, Texas|Beckville]]\n|[[Panola County, Texas|Panola]]\n|[[Texas|TX]]\n|{{Coord|32.1470|-94.5443|name=Beckville (Oct. 20, EF0)}}\n|{{Sort|001|October&nbsp;20}}\n|00:36\u201300:38\n|{{convert|0.8|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|{{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|Several trees were snapped or uprooted.

The tornado moved east-northeast across [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] and collapsed the exterior walls of a strip mall and retail buildings of varying sizes, suggesting it had intensified to EF2 strength by that point. Along Walnut Hill Lane, a multi-story apartment complex and a small professional building saw their roofs ripped off; the apartment complex sustained severe damage to its exterior walls as well. The tornado progressed into a less-populated area from Marsh Lane to U.S. Highway 75, though it still damaged hardwood trees with the consistency of an EF1. Beyond that point, it entered a residential area and caused EF1 to EF2 damage to numerous homes. The worst impacted structures suffered either partial or total roof loss, accompanied by only slight exterior wall damage. However, along Northhaven Road, one single-family home in particular saw its roof entirely removed and multiple exterior walls collapsed. Given the degree of damage, damage surveyors assigned low-end EF3 damage to that home, the only EF3 damage point assigned along the path of the tornado. The tornado moved into southern [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], where several businesses, including a car dealership, a Home Depot, and office low-rise buildings, suffered EF2 damage. It crossed the [[Texas Instruments]] campus, now on a northeast course, causing mainly EF1 damage. At an apartment complex near Walnut Street and Greenville Avenue, dozens of units had sections of roof missing. The nearby Cutters Point apartment complex was also affected, with significant roof loss consistent with EF2 damage. A low-rise office building saw numerous windows blown out. Homes north of [[Richland College]] likewise suffered EF2 damage before the tornado began to weaken. Widespread tree and roof damage consistent with an EF1 tornado was observed across the Richland Park, Lakes of Buckingham, Richland Meadows, and College Park subdivisions. The tornado curved sharply north around that time, continuing into the Huffhines Park area. It decreased in width and finally dissipated while crossing Jupiter Road. In total, the tornado was on the ground for {{convert|15.76|mi|km|abbr=on}}, reached a maximum width of {{convert|1300|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and remained on the ground for 32&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit|url=https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, the tornado caused about $1.55&nbsp;billion in damage, the costliest tornado event in Texas history.<ref name=\"dallas\" />\n\nAround 8:00 a.m. the next morning, approximately 242,000 people were without power.

A later [[squall line]] contributed to additional tornadoes and a widespread swath of damaging winds as the system tracked eastward.\n\n==Meteorological synopsis==\nThe first signs of organized severe weather across the [[South Central United States]] came on October&nbsp;16, when the [[Storm Prediction Center]] (SPC) first delineated a risk area across portions of northern Texas, eastern Oklahoma, and adjacent portions of Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Elizabeth Leitman|title=Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook Issued on Oct 16, 2019|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/archive/2019/day4-8_20191016.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 16, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> In their day&nbsp;3 outlook on October&nbsp;18, the organization introduced a broad Marginal risk for much of the same areas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brynn Kerr|title=Oct 18, 2019 0730 UTC Day 3 Severe Thunderstorm Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day3otlk_20191018_0730.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 18, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> A small Slight risk was added across northeastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, and western Arkansas on October&nbsp;19,<ref>{{cite web|author=Brynn Kerr|title=Oct 19, 2019 0600 UTC Day 2 Convective Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day2otlk_20191019_0600.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 19, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> but as confidence in a higher-end event increased, these same areas were raised to an Enhanced risk.<ref name=\"d1\">{{cite web|author=Roger Edwards|author2=Andy Dean|title=Oct 20, 2019 1300 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day1otlk_20191020_1300.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> In advance of the outbreak, the SPC monitored several weather features of interest. In the upper levels of the atmosphere, an upper-level [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] was expected to amplify as it progressed eastward into the U.S. Plains, providing increasing wind shear throughout the region. Simultaneously, a [[low-pressure area]] and associated [[cold front]] were anticipated to shift eastward across an unstable environment, leading to the formation of severe thunderstorms. Forecasters noted that while the overall environment supported the potential for significant ([[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF2+]]) tornadoes, questions about whether storms would be supercellular or instead evolve into a [[quasi-linear convective system]] prevented the addition a significant risk area.<ref name=\"d1\" /> By the late afternoon hours of October&nbsp;20, thunderstorms began to develop across eastern Oklahoma within a rapidly-moistening environment.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Mosier|author2=Jeremy Grams|title=Mesoscale Discussion 2089|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/2019/md2089.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> At 7:58&nbsp;p.m. CDT, the first [[tornado watch]] was issued across the [[Ark-La-Tex]] region;<ref>{{cite web|title=Tornado Watch 676|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2019/ww0676.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> several more watches were introduced over subsequent hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=SPC Severe Weather Event Review for Sunday October 20 2019|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/archive/event.php?date=20191020|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> A pair of long-tracked supercells developed across [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] and [[Johnson County, Texas|Johnson]] counties, intersecting a very unstable regime and producing significant tornadoes as a result.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Mosier|title=Mesoscale Discussion 2090|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/2019/md2090.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> A squall line formed along the cold front farther west, producing a wide swath of damaging winds and additional tornadoes as it tracked across the South-Central United States.<ref name=\"dallas\">{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Fort Worth, Texas|title=Texas Event Report: EF3 Tornado|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=856409|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2019|accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SPC Storm Reports for 10/20/19|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/191020_rpts.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Confirmed tornadoes==\n{{Tornado Chart\n|Total = 36\n|FU = 0\n|F0 = 13\n|F1 = 20\n|F2 = 2\n|F3 = 1\n|F4 = 0\n|F5 = 0\n|Enhanced=yes\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ Confirmed tornadoes during the tornado outbreak of October 20\u201322, 2019{{efn|All dates are based on the local [[time zone]] where the tornado touched down; however, all times are in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] for consistency.|group=note|name=Date/Time}}\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:3%; text-align:center;\"|[[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF#]]\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:7%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Location\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|County / Parish\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:5%; text-align:center;\"|State\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Start Coord.\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"7%\" align=\"center\"|Date\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Time ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Path length\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Max width\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:48%; text-align:center;\"|Summary\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:3%; text-align:center;\"|Refs\n|-\n|bgcolor={{storm colour|storm}} | EF0\n|SW of [[Beckville, Texas|Beckville]]\n|[[Panola County, Texas|Panola]]\n|[[Texas|TX]]\n|{{Coord|32.1470|-94.5443|name=Beckville (Oct. 20, EF0)}}\n|{{Sort|001|October&nbsp;20}}\n|00:36\u201300:38\n|{{convert|0.8|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|{{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|Several trees were snapped or uprooted.

The tornado moved east-northeast across [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] and collapsed the exterior walls of a strip mall and retail buildings of varying sizes, suggesting it had intensified to EF2 strength by that point. Along Walnut Hill Lane, a multi-story apartment complex and a small professional building saw their roofs ripped off; the apartment complex sustained severe damage to its exterior walls as well. The tornado progressed into a less-populated area from Marsh Lane to U.S. Highway 75, though it still damaged hardwood trees with the consistency of an EF1. Beyond that point, it entered a residential area and caused EF1 to EF2 damage to numerous homes. The worst impacted structures suffered either partial or total roof loss, accompanied by only slight exterior wall damage. However, along Northhaven Road, one single-family home in particular saw its roof entirely removed and multiple exterior walls collapsed. Given the degree of damage, damage surveyors assigned low-end EF3 damage to that home, the only EF3 damage point assigned along the path of the tornado. The tornado moved into southern [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], where several businesses, including a car dealership, a Home Depot, and office low-rise buildings, suffered EF2 damage. It crossed the [[Texas Instruments]] campus, now on a northeast course, causing mainly EF1 damage. At an apartment complex near Walnut Street and Greenville Avenue, dozens of units had sections of roof missing. The nearby Cutters Point apartment complex was also affected, with significant roof loss consistent with EF2 damage. A low-rise office building saw numerous windows blown out. Homes north of [[Richland College]] likewise suffered EF2 damage before the tornado began to weaken. Widespread tree and roof damage consistent with an EF1 tornado was observed across the Richland Park, Lakes of Buckingham, Richland Meadows, and College Park subdivisions. The tornado curved sharply north around that time, continuign into the Huffhines Park area. It decreased in width and finally dissipated while crossing Jupiter Road. In total, the tornado was on the ground for {{convert|15.76|mi|km|abbr=on}}, reached a maximum width of {{convert|1300|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and remained on the ground for 32&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit|url=https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, the tornado caused about $1.55&nbsp;billion in damage, the costliest tornado event in Texas history.<ref name=\"dallas\" />\n\nAround 8:00 a.m. the next morning, approximately 242,000 people were without power.

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}\n\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.  This is a unique Chinese system that ensures the joint leadership of the Communist Party and the state over the armed forces.<ref name=Xingzu/>\n\n{{See also|List of wars involving the People's Republic of China}}\n\n==State leaders==\n{{see also|Paramount leader|List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Political position ranking of PRC|Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Generations of Chinese leadership}}\n\n===Politburo Standing Committee===\n{{CPC Politburo Standing Committee}}\n\n===Full Politburo members===\n{{CPC Politburo}}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in the People's Republic of China}}\nNo substantial legal political opposition groups exist, and the country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called \"democratic parties\", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}{{More citations needed section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\n{{See also|Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|Regional ethnic autonomy system of China}}\n\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. \n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]].<ref>Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], further specified under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]</ref> By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

In 1971, the PRC replaced the [[Republic of China]], commonly known as \"Taiwan\" since the 1970s, as the sole representative of China in the [[United Nations]] and as one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>Eddy Chang (Aug 22, 2004).

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

China is also a founder and member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), alongside [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia]]n republics.\n\nMuch of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of \"[[China's peaceful development]]\". Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved,{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979.

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}\n\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}{{More citations needed section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\n{{See also|Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|Regional ethnic autonomy system of China}}\n\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. \n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]].<ref>Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], further specified under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]</ref> By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

In 1971, the PRC replaced the [[Republic of China]], commonly known as \"Taiwan\" since the 1970s, as the sole representative of China in the [[United Nations]] and as one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>Eddy Chang (Aug 22, 2004).

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

China is also a founder and member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), alongside [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia]]n republics.\n\nMuch of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of [[China's peaceful development]]. Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved,{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, China and Russia signed the [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]],<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826175727/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm |date=26 August 2006 }} (March 21, 2006).

Genevieve County''' (French: Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve), is a [[County (United States)|county]] located in the eastern portion of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Missouri]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 18,145.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/29/29186.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}</ref> The largest city and [[county seat]] is [[Ste.

Genevieve]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The county was officially organized on October 1, 1812, and is named after the Spanish district once located in the region, after Saint [[Genevieve]], patroness of [[Paris, France]].  It includes the earliest settlement west of the [[Mississippi River]] outside [[New Spain]], part of the French colonial mid-Mississippi valley villages. It is one of the last places where the [[Paw Paw French]] is still spoken.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSte. Genevieve County is located on the west bank of the [[Mississippi River]] approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} south of [[St. Louis]]. Ste. Genevieve is the principal town and the county seat of Ste. Genevieve County with a population of around 5,000 people. Ste. Genevieve was the first permanent civilized settlement in Missouri. The actual date of establishment is, like many other dates, connected to genealogy. There is a conflict of opinion as to the exact year depending on the preferred source. The year 1735, according to [[Goodspeed Publishing|Goodspeed]]'s ''History of Southeast Missouri'', and most of the descendants of the early settlers, is the most generally accepted date. Dr. Carl J. Ekberg, in his book, ''Colonial Ste. Genevieve'', is of the opinion that the date of the establishment of Ste. Genevieve is closer to 1750, based on interpretations of early letters, maps, and Catholic Church documents. Regardless of which date one wishes to believe, Ste. Genevieve is about 250 years old.\n\nThe village of Ste. Genevieve was originally included in the Illinois Country. This was generally accepted to be all the land claimed by the French from the mouth of the [[Ohio River]], north to the [[Great Lakes]], and including the valleys of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivers. The seat of government was established in New Orleans, and what is now Missouri became part of Upper Louisiana Territory. The early French explorers and settlers were known to have been in the Ste. Genevieve area in the very early 18th century.\n \n[[Salt]] was a very important commodity then in the preservation of foods and curing of animal hides, and the early French settlers were quick to exploit the salt springs on Saline Creek just below Ste. Genevieve. Mineral explorations lead [[Philip Fran\u00e7ois Renault|Renault]] and [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac|La Motte]] to the area, and some of the very [[Mine La Motte, Missouri|earliest lead mines]] were named for La Motte in nearby [[Madison County, Missouri|Madison County]].\n\nProbably the biggest factor in the establishment of Ste. Genevieve was agriculture. Across the Mississippi River in [[Fort de Chartres]] and [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], there was a growing need for agricultural land for the colonists. Across the Mississippi from [[Fort Kaskaskia]] was a large fertile section of river bottom, called the \"[[Le Grand Champ Bottom|Grand Champ]]\" or Big Field. The \"Old Town\" of Ste. Genevieve was originally located here. It was approximately three miles south of the present site of Ste. Genevieve. The village of Ste. Genevieve was originally an offshoot of the older French communities on the east bank of the Mississippi River\u2014[[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]], Kaskaskia, village of Chartres, [[Prairie du Rocher, Illinois|Prairie du Rocher]], and [[St. Philippe, Illinois|St. Philippe]]. The rich agricultural lands of the river bottoms were main attractions that lured most all of the early French pioneers to Ste. Genevieve. All the civil and legal business of Ste. Genevieve was transacted at Kaskaskia until about 1766 when the first commandant, Philippe de Rocheblave, was installed at Ste. Genevieve.\n\nThe present site of the town of Ste. Genevieve was moved to its present higher location, from the river bottoms after the devastating floods of 1785. According to a sworn statement by one Julien Labriere, in October 1825, \"there were about fifty or sixty cabins in the old village. The old village was overflowed so as to be on the tops of houses. The water in many places was twelve or fifteen feet deep.\" Although the Mississippi River was a natural barrier, travel back and forth was frequent and common. The first commercial ferry at Ste. Genevieve was established about 1800.\nWhen Missouri was first being settled, the [[Osage Nation|Osage]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were the only tribe between the [[Osage River]] and the Mississippi. They were of the same stock as the [[Sioux]] and were hostile to the whites. Around 1787, the Spanish government, who had acquired the territory from France in 1762, brought in a band of [[Shawnee]] and [[Lenape|Delaware]] Native Americans, who had been friendly to the French, to help protect the settlers from the Osage. After the French had established and settled Ste. Genevieve, the first American settlers started showing up in about 1788, and trickled upriver from [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri|Cape Girardeau]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]]. Starting about 1794, Americans began migrating into the Ste. Genevieve District from [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Tennessee]]. Starting around 1840, German Catholics began settling around [[New Offenburg, Missouri|New Offenburg]] and [[Zell, Missouri|Zell]], and shortly after German Lutherans began spreading into Ste. Genevieve from [[Perry County, Missouri|Perry County]].\n\nIn 1800, France reacquired Louisiana from Spain, and in 1803, [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte I]] sold it to the United States as the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. U.S. officials took over in 1804 and Ste. Genevieve County was formed in 1812 as an original county, from the old Ste. Genevieve District. It is bordered on the east by the Mississippi River, on the north by [[Jefferson County, Missouri|Jefferson County]], on the west by [[St. Francois County, Missouri|St. Francois County]], and on the south by Perry County.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|507|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|499|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|7.6|sqmi}} (1.5%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_29.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=November 20, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021170230/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_29.txt|archive-date=October 21, 2013|df=}}</ref> The county's northeastern border with [[Illinois]] is formed by the [[Mississippi River]].\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Jefferson County, Missouri|Jefferson County]] (northwest)\n*[[Monroe County, Illinois]] (northeast)\n*[[Randolph County, Illinois]] (east)\n*[[Perry County, Missouri|Perry County]] (southeast)\n*[[St. Francois County, Missouri|St. Francois County]] (southwest)\n\n===Major highways===\n*[[Image:I-55 (MO).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 55 (Missouri)|Interstate 55]]\n*[[Image:US 61.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 61 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 61]]\n*[[Image:MO-32.svg|20px]] [[Missouri Route 32|Route 32]]\n\n===National protected area===\n*[[Mark Twain National Forest]] (part)\n\n===Valleys===\n{{div col begin|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Bidwell Hollow]]\n*[[Corn Hollow]]\n*[[Henry Hollow]]\n*[[Lick Hollow]]\n*[[Morrison Hollow]]\n*[[Snell Hollow]]\n*[[Staples Hollow]]\n*[[Wolf Hollow]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 4962\n|1830= 2186\n|1840= 3148\n|1850= 5313\n|1860= 8029\n|1870= 8384\n|1880= 10390\n|1890= 9883\n|1900= 10359\n|1910= 10607\n|1920= 9809\n|1930= 10097\n|1940= 10905\n|1950= 11237\n|1960= 12116\n|1970= 12867\n|1980= 15180\n|1990= 16037\n|2000= 17842\n|2010= 18145\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=17888\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=November 13, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/mo190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Genevieve used to be one of the most reliably Democratic strongholds in presidential elections. [[George W. Bush]] lost Ste. Genevieve County both times in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]; in 2004, it was one of only four counties (the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[St. Louis]], [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] and [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]) that voted for [[John Kerry]]. Unlike other rural counties throughout Missouri, Ste. Genevieve County was one of only nine counties in Missouri that favored [[Barack Obama]] over [[John McCain]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]. The Democratic dominant streak in Ste. Genevieve County, however, was broken in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] when [[Mitt Romney]] carried it by three points over [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. This was the first time that a Republican presidential nominee had won Ste. Genevieve County since [[Ronald Reagan]] carried the county in his landslide reelection bid in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]]. In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Republican [[Donald Trump]], who received much more working class support than a typical Republican which could be seen across many working class and [[Rural America|rural]] counties all across the country just like Ste. Genevieve county received 64% in the county, the most of any Presidential candidate since [[Lyndon Johnson]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] and the most of any Republican candidate ever.\n\nLike most rural counties throughout Missouri, voters in Ste. Genevieve County generally adhere to socially and culturally [[Conservatism|conservative]] principles but are more moderate or [[Populism|populist]] on economic issues, typical of the [[Dixiecrat]] philosophy. In 2004, Missourians voted on [[Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2 (2004)|a constitutional amendment to define marriage as the union between a man and a woman]]\u2014it overwhelmingly passed Ste. Genevieve County with 75.25 percent of the vote. The initiative passed the state with 71 percent of support from voters as Missouri became the first state to ban [[same-sex marriage]]. In 2006, Missourians voted on [[Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2 (2006)|a constitutional amendment to fund and legalize embryonic stem cell research in the state]]\u2014it failed in Ste. Genevieve County with 56.22 percent voting against the measure. The initiative narrowly passed the state with 51 percent of support from voters as Missouri became one of the first states in the nation to approve [[Embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem cell research]]. Despite Ste. Genevieve County\u2019s longstanding tradition of supporting socially conservative platforms, voters in the county have a penchant for advancing [[Populism|populist]] causes like increasing the [[minimum wage]]. In 2006, Missourians voted on a proposition (Proposition B) to increase the minimum wage in the state to $6.50 an hour\u2014it passed Ste. Genevieve County with 79.26 percent of the vote. The proposition strongly passed every single county in Missouri with 78.99 percent voting in favor as the minimum wage was increased to $6.50 an hour in the state. During the same election, voters in five other states also strongly approved increases in the minimum wage.\n\n===Missouri presidential preference primary (2008)===\n{{Missouri Republican primary, 2008\n| name            =Ste.

Genevieve County''' (French: Ste-Genevi\u00e8ve), is a [[County (United States)|county]] located in the eastern portion of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Missouri]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 18,145.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/29/29186.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}</ref> The largest city and [[county seat]] is [[Ste.

Genevieve]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The county was officially organized on October 1, 1812, and is named after the Spanish district once located in the region, after Saint [[Genevieve]], patroness of [[Paris, France]].  It includes the earliest settlement west of the [[Mississippi River]] outside [[New Spain]], part of the French colonial mid-Mississippi valley villages. It is one of the last places where the [[Paw Paw French]] is still spoken.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nSte. Genevieve County is located on the west bank of the [[Mississippi River]] approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} south of [[St. Louis]]. Ste. Genevieve is the principal town and the county seat of Ste. Genevieve County with a population of around 5,000 people. Ste. Genevieve was the first permanent civilized settlement in Missouri. The actual date of establishment is, like many other dates, connected to genealogy. There is a conflict of opinion as to the exact year depending on the preferred source. The year 1735, according to [[Goodspeed Publishing|Goodspeed]]'s ''History of Southeast Missouri'', and most of the descendants of the early settlers, is the most generally accepted date. Dr. Carl J. Ekberg, in his book, ''Colonial Ste. Genevieve'', is of the opinion that the date of the establishment of Ste. Genevieve is closer to 1750, based on interpretations of early letters, maps, and Catholic Church documents. Regardless of which date one wishes to believe, Ste. Genevieve is about 250 years old.\n\nThe village of Ste. Genevieve was originally included in the Illinois Country. This was generally accepted to be all the land claimed by the French from the mouth of the [[Ohio River]], north to the [[Great Lakes]], and including the valleys of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivers. The seat of government was established in New Orleans, and what is now Missouri became part of Upper Louisiana Territory. The early French explorers and settlers were known to have been in the Ste. Genevieve area in the very early 18th century.\n \n[[Salt]] was a very important commodity then in the preservation of foods and curing of animal hides, and the early French settlers were quick to exploit the salt springs on Saline Creek just below Ste. Genevieve. Mineral explorations lead [[Philip Fran\u00e7ois Renault|Renault]] and [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac|La Motte]] to the area, and some of the very [[Mine La Motte, Missouri|earliest lead mines]] were named for La Motte in nearby [[Madison County, Missouri|Madison County]].\n\nProbably the biggest factor in the establishment of Ste. Genevieve was agriculture. Across the Mississippi River in [[Fort de Chartres]] and [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], there was a growing need for agricultural land for the colonists. Across the Mississippi from [[Fort Kaskaskia]] was a large fertile section of river bottom, called the \"[[Le Grand Champ Bottom|Grand Champ]]\" or Big Field. The \"Old Town\" of Ste. Genevieve was originally located here. It was approximately three miles south of the present site of Ste. Genevieve. The village of Ste. Genevieve was originally an offshoot of the older French communities on the east bank of the Mississippi River\u2014[[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]], Kaskaskia, village of Chartres, [[Prairie du Rocher, Illinois|Prairie du Rocher]], and [[St. Philippe, Illinois|St. Philippe]]. The rich agricultural lands of the river bottoms were main attractions that lured most all of the early French pioneers to Ste. Genevieve. All the civil and legal business of Ste. Genevieve was transacted at Kaskaskia until about 1766 when the first commandant, Philippe de Rocheblave, was installed at Ste. Genevieve.\n\nThe present site of the town of Ste. Genevieve was moved to its present higher location, from the river bottoms after the devastating floods of 1785. According to a sworn statement by one Julien Labriere, in October 1825, \"there were about fifty or sixty cabins in the old village. The old village was overflowed so as to be on the tops of houses. The water in many places was twelve or fifteen feet deep.\" Although the Mississippi River was a natural barrier, travel back and forth was frequent and common. The first commercial ferry at Ste. Genevieve was established about 1800.\nWhen Missouri was first being settled, the [[Osage Nation|Osage]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were the only tribe between the [[Osage River]] and the Mississippi. They were of the same stock as the [[Sioux]] and were hostile to the whites. Around 1787, the Spanish government, who had acquired the territory from France in 1762, brought in a band of [[Shawnee]] and [[Lenape|Delaware]] Native Americans, who had been friendly to the French, to help protect the settlers from the Osage. After the French had established and settled Ste. Genevieve, the first American settlers started showing up in about 1788, and trickled upriver from [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri|Cape Girardeau]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]]. Starting about 1794, Americans began migrating into the Ste. Genevieve District from [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Tennessee]]. Starting around 1840, German Catholics began settling around [[New Offenburg, Missouri|New Offenburg]] and [[Zell, Missouri|Zell]], and shortly after German Lutherans began spreading into Ste.

Genevieve used to be one of the most reliably Democratic strongholds in presidential elections. [[George W. Bush]] lost Ste. Genevieve County both times in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]; in 2004, it was one of only four counties (the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[St. Louis]], [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] and [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]) that voted for [[John Kerry]]. Unlike other rural counties throughout Missouri, Ste. Genevieve County was one of only nine counties in Missouri that favored [[Barack Obama]] over [[John McCain]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]. The Democratic dominant streak in Ste. Genevieve County, however, was broken in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] when [[Mitt Romney]] carried it by three points over [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. This was the first time that a Republican presidential nominee had won Ste. Genevieve County since [[Ronald Reagan]] carried the county in his landslide reelection bid in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]]. In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Republican [[Donald Trump]], who received much more working class support than a typical Republican which could be seen across many working class and [[Rural America|rural]] counties all across the country just like Ste. Genevieve county received 64% in the county, the most of any Presidential candidate since [[Lyndon Johnson]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] and the most of any Republican candidate ever.\n\nLike most rural counties throughout Missouri, voters in Ste. Genevieve County generally adhere to socially and culturally [[Conservatism|conservative]] principles but are more moderate or [[Populism|populist]] on economic issues, typical of the [[Dixiecrat]] philosophy. In 2004, Missourians voted on [[Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2 (2004)|a constitutional amendment to define marriage as the union between a man and a woman]]\u2014it overwhelmingly passed Ste. Genevieve County with 75.25 percent of the vote. The initiative passed the state with 71 percent of support from voters as Missouri became the first state to ban [[same-sex marriage]]. In 2006, Missourians voted on [[Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2 (2006)|a constitutional amendment to fund and legalize embryonic stem cell research in the state]]\u2014it failed in Ste. Genevieve County with 56.22 percent voting against the measure. The initiative narrowly passed the state with 51 percent of support from voters as Missouri became one of the first states in the nation to approve [[Embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem cell research]]. Despite Ste. Genevieve County\u2019s longstanding tradition of supporting socially conservative platforms, voters in the county have a penchant for advancing [[Populism|populist]] causes like increasing the [[minimum wage]]. In 2006, Missourians voted on a proposition (Proposition B) to increase the minimum wage in the state to $6.50 an hour\u2014it passed Ste. Genevieve County with 79.26 percent of the vote. The proposition strongly passed every single county in Missouri with 78.99 percent voting in favor as the minimum wage was increased to $6.50 an hour in the state. During the same election, voters in five other states also strongly approved increases in the minimum wage.\n\n===Missouri presidential preference primary (2008)===\n{{Missouri Republican primary, 2008\n| name            =Ste.
