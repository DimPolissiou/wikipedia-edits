It was long believed that their origins lay in Gascony.\n\nIn 905 [[Sancho I of Pamplona|Sancho Garc\u00e9s]], a younger son of the dynasty founder, used foreign assistance to displace the \u00cd\u00f1iguez ruler [[Fort\u00fan Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona|Fort\u00fan Garc\u00e9s]] and consolidate the monarchy in his dynasty's hands. He would be viewed as founder of the dynasty, with several [[Al-Andalus|Iberian Muslim]] sources calling the family the ''Banu Sanjo'' ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0646\u0648&nbsp;\u0634\u0627\u0646\u062c\u0647}} - the descendants of Sancho) for several subsequent generations, while a 12th-century Tunisian chronicler of Al-Andalus, [[Ibn al-Kardab\u016bs]], would referred to [[Sancho III of Pamplona]] as ''ibn Abarca'' ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0646&nbsp;\u0623\u0628\u0631\u0643}} - son or descendant of ''Abarca''), referencing a nickname originally borne by Sancho I in the naming of this ''Banu Abarca'' dynasty.<ref name=\"Ca\u00f1ada Juste\" />  In addition to repulsing several attacks from the [[Emir of C\u00f3rdoba]], Sancho I crushed the neighboring [[Banu Qasi]] and thus expanded Pamplona to the upper [[Ebro River]] valley, as well as incorporating the previously-autonomous [[County of Aragon]] into the realm.\n\nFollowing the death of Sancho in 925, his brother [[Jimeno Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona|Jimeno Garc\u00e9s]] maintained a position of strength, intervening in the politics of neighboring Christian and Muslim states. His death left the crown to his nephew, Sancho's son [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez I of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez I]], who was still a child.  Originally ruling under the tutelage of his mother, the \u00cd\u00f1iguez descendant Toda Aznar who established a web of political and marital alliances among the Iberian Christian states, he invited the intervention of his cousin [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] of C\u00f3rdoba to achieve emancipation from his mother.  There followed three generations of defeat and subjugation by the Caliphate. He did create for his younger son a short-lived sub-kingdom centered at Viguera, which lasted for several decades until it was reabsorbed into the Pamplona kingdom.\n\nThe kingdom of Pamplona only reemerged from the Cordoban shadow during the reign of [[Sancho the Great]], who ruled from 1000 to 1035 in Pamplona, but also ruled [[Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[ounty of Ribagorza|Ribagorza]] and eventually [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] (but not [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]]) by right or conquest. He received the homage of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and possibly of the [[Duke of Gascony]]. After his coronation in Le\u00f3n, he even took up the [[Imperator totius Hispaniae|imperial title over all Spain]]. His vast domains were divided amongst his sons at his death, giving rise to three independent medieval kingdoms each ruled by a Jim\u00e9nez monarch.\n\nThe Kingdom of Navarre, passing to the eldest son [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III of Navarre|Garc\u00eda]], was unable to maintain its hegemony, leading to the full independence of Aragon under his illegitimate brother [[Ramiro I of Aragon|Ramiro I]], who had previously taken over the territories of murdered brother [[Gonzalo of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza]]. Younger sibling [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand I]], then [[Count of Castile]], killed [[Battle of Tamar\u00f3n|in battle]] his nominal overlord the [[Bermudo III|King of Le\u00f3n and Galicia]] in 1037 and thereby inheriting them and bringing them fully into the orbit of his ruling clan. He then defeated Garc\u00eda, achieving a sort of hegemony over his brothers, but again divided his realm among his sons. One of these, [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]], not only succeeded to the reunited realm of his father, but also conquered Toledo, reclaimed the imperial title and even pretended to rule over both Christian and Moslem Spain.\n\nThe Navarre branch of the dynasty went into eclipse when in 1076 [[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho IV]] was assassinated by his siblings, and his cousins Alfonso VI of Castile and [[Sancho Ram\u00edrez]] of Aragon converged and divided the kingdom, with the Aragon ruler gaining the Navarre crown, while ceding western lands to Castile.\n\nThe holdings of the family were briefly reunited when [[Alfonso the Battler]] of Navarre and Aragon married Alfonso VI's daughter [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca, Queen of Castile and Le\u00f3n]], and claimed the imperial title. However, the marriage failed and the kingdoms of Castile and Le\u00f3n passed out of the dynasty, to Urraca's son by a prior marriage. The [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and that of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] likewise went their separate ways following Alfonso's death, the former passing to his brother, the latter to a descendant of its original ruling family, with each eventually passing to other dynasties through heiresses: [[Petronilla of Aragon]], who married the ruler of Barcelona and thus united those two realms into the [[Crown of Aragon]]; and [[Blanca of Navarre (daughter of Sancho VI)|Blanca]], sister of [[Sancho VII of Navarre]], whose 1234 death brought Jim\u00e9nez rule to an end.\n\nThe [[Borgias]] of Italy in the 15th century would present a pedigree that traced their ancestry to [[Pedro de Atar\u00e9s]], lord of [[Borja, Zaragoza]], who had been a competitor for the thrones of Navarre and Aragon following the death of Alfonso the Battler. Pedro was a scion of this family, being grandson of [[Sancho Ram\u00edrez, Count of Ribagorza]], illegitimate brother of king Sancho Ram\u00edrez of Aragon. Such a descent would thus have made the Borgias male-line descendants of the Jim\u00e9nez dynasty. However, the descent was a fabrication.\n\n== Rulers ==\n{{see also|Kings of Navarre family tree|l1=Navarre rulers family tree}}\nEmperors in '''bold'''.

It was long believed that their origins lay in Gascony.\n\nIn 905 [[Sancho I of Pamplona|Sancho Garc\u00e9s]], a younger son of the dynasty founder, used foreign assistance to displace the \u00cd\u00f1iguez ruler [[Fort\u00fan Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona|Fort\u00fan Garc\u00e9s]] and consolidate the monarchy in his dynasty's hands. He would be viewed as founder of the dynasty, with several [[Al-Andalus|Iberian Muslim]] sources calling the family the ''Banu Sanjo'' ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0646\u0648&nbsp;\u0634\u0627\u0646\u062c\u0647}} - the descendants of Sancho) for several subsequent generations, while a 12th-century Tunisian chronicler of Al-Andalus, [[Ibn al-Kardab\u016bs]], would referred to [[Sancho III of Pamplona]] as ''ibn Abarca'' ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0646&nbsp;\u0623\u0628\u0631\u0643}} - son or descendant of ''Abarca''), referencing a nickname originally borne by Sancho I in the naming of this ''Banu Abarca'' dynasty.<ref name=\"Ca\u00f1ada Juste\" />  In addition to repulsing several attacks from the [[Emir of C\u00f3rdoba]], Sancho I crushed the neighboring [[Banu Qasi]] and thus expanded Pamplona to the upper [[Ebro River]] valley, as well as incorporating the previously-autonomous [[County of Aragon]] into the realm.\n\nFollowing the death of Sancho in 925, his brother [[Jimeno Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona|Jimeno Garc\u00e9s]] maintained a position of strength, intervening in the politics of neighboring Christian and Muslim states. His death left the crown to his nephew, Sancho's son [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez I of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez I]], who was still a child.  Originally ruling under the tutelage of his mother, the \u00cd\u00f1iguez descendant Toda Aznar who established a web of political and marital alliances among the Iberian Christian states, he invited the intervention of his cousin [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] of C\u00f3rdoba to achieve emancipation from his mother.  There followed three generations of defeat and subjugation by the Caliphate. He did create for his younger son a short-lived sub-kingdom centered at Viguera, which lasted for several decades until it was reabsorbed into the Pamplona kingdom.\n\nThe kingdom of Pamplona only reemerged from the Cordoban shadow during the reign of [[Sancho the Great]], who ruled from 1000 to 1035 in Pamplona, but also ruled [[Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[ounty of Ribagorza|Ribagorza]] and eventually [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] (but not [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]]) by right or conquest. He received the homage of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and possibly of the [[Duke of Gascony]]. After his coronation in Le\u00f3n, he even took up the [[Imperator totius Hispaniae|imperial title over all Spain]]. His vast domains were divided amongst his sons at his death, giving rise to three independent medieval kingdoms each ruled by a Jim\u00e9nez monarch.\n\nThe Kingdom of Navarre, passing to the eldest son [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III of Navarre|Garc\u00eda]], was unable to maintain its hegemony, leading to the full independence of Aragon under his illegitimate brother [[Ramiro I of Aragon|Ramiro I]], who had previously taken over the territories of murdered brother [[Gonzalo of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza]]. Younger sibling [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand I]], then [[Count of Castile]], killed [[Battle of Tamar\u00f3n|in battle]] his nominal overlord the [[Bermudo III|King of Le\u00f3n and Galicia]] in 1037 and thereby inheriting them and bringing them fully into the orbit of his ruling clan. He then defeated Garc\u00eda, achieving a sort of hegemony over his brothers, but again divided his realm among his sons. One of these, [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]], not only succeeded to the reunited realm of his father, but also conquered Toledo, reclaimed the imperial title and even pretended to rule over both Christian and Moslem Spain.\n\nThe Navarre branch of the dynasty went into eclipse when in 1076 [[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho IV]] was assassinated by his siblings, and his cousins Alfonso VI of Castile and [[Sancho Ram\u00edrez]] of Aragon converged and divided the kingdom, with the Aragon ruler gaining the Navarre crown, while ceding western lands to Castile.\n\nThe holdings of the family were briefly reunited when [[Alfonso the Battler]] of Navarre and Aragon married Alfonso VI's daughter [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca, Queen of Castile and Le\u00f3n]], and claimed the imperial title. However, the marriage failed and the kingdoms of Castile and Le\u00f3n passed out of the dynasty, to Urraca's son by a prior marriage. The [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and that of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] likewise went their separate ways following Alfonso's death, the former passing to his brother, the latter to a descendant of its original ruling family, with each eventually passing to other dynasties through heiresses: [[Petronilla of Aragon]], who married the ruler of Barcelona and thus united those two realms into the [[Crown of Aragon]]; and [[Blanca of Navarre (daughter of Sancho VI)|Blanca]], sister of [[Sancho VII of Navarre]], whose 1234 death brought Jim\u00e9nez rule to an end.\n\nThe [[Borgias]] of Italy in the 15th century would present a pedigree that traced their ancestry to [[Pedro de Atar\u00e9s]], lord of [[Borja, Zaragoza]], who had been a competitor for the thrones of Navarre and Aragon following the death of Alfonso the Battler. Pedro was a scion of this family, being grandson of [[Sancho Ram\u00edrez, Count of Ribagorza]], illegitimate brother of king Sancho Ram\u00edrez of Aragon. Such a descent would thus have made the Borgias male-line descendants of the Jim\u00e9nez dynasty. However, the descent was a fabrication.\n\n== Rulers ==\n{{see also|Kings of Navarre family tree|l1=Navarre rulers family tree}}\nEmperors in '''bold'''.

Herbert identifies the four [[Siouan languages|Siouan]]-speaking communities as the Saraw, [[Pedee people|Pee Dee]], Scavano, and Wacoma. Modern-day Lumbees claim connection to those settlements, but none of the four tribes is located within the boundaries of present-day Robeson County.\n\nWhen this area was first surveyed by the English in the 1750s, they reported that \"No Indians\" lived in Bladen County, which then included parts of present-day Robeson County. Colonial Welsh timber survey parties of the same areas also reported, \"No Hostile Indians, in fact No Indians to be found at all.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The adjacent [[Anson County, North Carolina|Anson County]] was identified as \"a frontier to the Indians.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}<!-- Anson County article says nothing about territory going to Robeson County. -->\n\nIn 1754, colonial authorities organized the territory: everything north of the Lumber River was made part of Bladen County, and everything south of the Lumber River was made part of Anson County. Anson County's border stretched west to known Cherokee territory. Historical records are unclear as to which parts of Anson County were occupied by Indians in the early colonial period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nA 1772 proclamation by the [[governor of North Carolina]], [[Arthur Dobbs]], derived from a report by his agent, Colonel Rutherford, head of a Bladen County militia, listed the names of inhabitants who took part in a \"Mob Railously Assembled together,\" apparently defying the efforts of colonial officials to collect taxes. The proclamation declared the \"Above list of Rogus [sic] is all living upon the Kings Land without title.\" A later colonial military survey described \"50 families a mixt crew, a lawless People possess the Lands without Patent or paying quit Rents.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Colonial Records: North Carolina 1890''; 768 and ''North Carolina 1887''; 161, respectively</ref> The surnames of some of the families are the same as modern-day Lumbees, but each family must be traced separately to identify individual ancestors, particularly since extensive intermarriage took place. The families were classified then as \"[[mulatto]]s,\" a term that then had several different meanings. Today, it is most commonly used to describe [[mixed-race]] persons of African-European ancestry. However, at the time, the term was also used across the South to describe any non-white individual. They included full-blooded Native Americans not living within a confined reservation and mixed-race persons of Native American-European ancestry.\n\nFollowing the [[Reconstruction Era]], white-dominated legislatures in the South imposed legal racial segregation. They required all non-white people or people of color to attend black schools in which most students were [[Freedman#United States|freedmen]]'s children. In 1885, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state representative Hamilton McMillan supported an effort to gain separate schools for the Indian children in the state since they and their ancestors had always been free and refused to send their children to black schools. In making his case, McMillan wrote that Lumbee ancestor James Lowrie had received sizable land grants early in the century and, by 1738, possessed combined estates of more than 2,000 acres (810&nbsp;ha). [[Adolph Dial]] and [[David Eliades]] claimed that another Lumbee ancestor, John Brooks, held the title to over 1,000 acres (400&nbsp;ha) in 1735 and that Robert Lowrie gained possession of almost 700 acres (280&nbsp;ha).<ref>Dial and Eliades, pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nHowever, a state [[archivist]] noted in the late 20th century that no land grants were issued during these years in North Carolina. The first documented land grants made to individuals claimed to be Lumbee ancestors did not take place until the 1750s, more than a decade later.<ref>Hoffman</ref> None of the various petitions for federal recognition by the Lumbee people has relied on the McMillan, Dial, or Eliades claims.<ref>Thomas</ref>\n\nLand patents and deeds filed with the colonial administrations of Virginia, North Carolina, and [[South Carolina]] during that period show that individuals who claimed to be Lumbee ancestors migrated from southern parts of Virginia and northern parts of North Carolina. In the first federal census of 1790, the ancestors of the Lumbee were enumerated as [[free people of color|Free Persons of Color]], another term used for a wide variety of non-White people including, non-reservation American Indians, mixed race of American Indian/European, and mixed race African/European. In 1800 and 1810, the families were classified as \"all other free persons\" in the census (after \"white\" and \"black\").{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nLand records show that in the second half of the 18th century, persons since identified as ancestral Lumbees began to take titles to land near Drowning Creek (Lumber River) and prominent swamps such as Ashpole, Long, and Back. According to James Campisi, the [[anthropologist]] hired by the Lumbee tribe to support their petition for federal recognition, the area \"is located in the heart of the so-called old field of the [[Cheraw]] documented in land records between 1737 and 1739.\"<ref>Campisi, Dr. Jack.

October 3, 1771</ref> That mention, along with no evidence that a new settlement was established or the old settlement was abandoned, is not sufficient to confirm that the settlement on Drowning Creek in 1754 was a Cheraw settlement.\n\n===American Revolution and federal era===\nPension records for veterans of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in Robeson County listed men with surnames later associated with Lumbee families, such as Samuel Bell, Jacob Locklear, John Brooks, Berry Hunt, Thomas Jacobs, Thomas Cummings, and Michael Revels. In 1790, other men with surnames since associated with Lumbee-identified descendants, such as Barnes, Braveboy (or Brayboy), Bullard, Chavers (Chavis), Cumbo, Hammonds, Lowrie (Lowry/Lowery), Oxendine, Strickland, and Wilkins, were listed as inhabitants of the Fayetteville District; they were all \"Free Persons of Color\" in the first federal census.<ref name=\"U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1790\">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1790</ref>\n\n===Antebellum===\nFollowing the [[Nat Turner]] Slave Rebellion of 1831, the state legislature passed amendments to its original 1776 constitution, abolishing [[suffrage]] for free people of color. This was one of a series of laws passed by North Carolina whites from 1826 to the 1850s which the historian [[John Hope Franklin]] characterized as the \"Free Negro Code,\" creating restrictions on that class. Free people of color were stripped of various political and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] which they had enjoyed for almost two generations. They could no longer vote or serve on juries, bear arms without a license from the state, or serve in the state militia.<ref name=\"Heinegg\">[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], 1995-2005, accessed 9 Mar 2008</ref> As these were obligations traditionally associated with citizenship, they were made second-class citizens.\n\nIn 1853, the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of the state's restrictions to prevent free people of color from bearing arms without a license. Noel Locklear, identified as a free man of color in ''State v. Locklear'', was convicted for the illegal possession of firearms.<ref name=\"dial eliades 45\">Dial and Eliades, p.45</ref><ref>Evans, p.108</ref><ref>Hauptman, p. 77.</ref> In 1857, William Chavers from Robeson County was arrested and charged as a free person of color for carrying a shotgun without a license. Chavers, like Locklear, was convicted. Chavers promptly appealed, arguing that the law restricted only \"free Negroes,\" not \"persons of color from Indian blood.\" The appeals court reversed the lower court, finding that \"free persons of color may be, then, for all we can see, persons colored by Indian blood\".<ref>''State v. Chavers,'' 50 N.C. (5 Jones) 11 (1857).</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nA [[yellow fever]] epidemic in 1862\u20131863 killed many [[Slavery|slaves]] working on the construction of [[Fort Fisher]] near [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], then considered to be the \"[[Gibraltar]] of the South\". As the state's slave owners resisted sending more slaves to Fort Fisher, the Confederate Home Guard intensified efforts to conscript able-bodied free persons of color as laborers. There does not appear to be documentation of conscription among the free people of color in Robeson County.<ref name=\"evans 3-18\">Evans, pp. 3\u201318.</ref><ref>Dial and Eliades, pp. 46\u201347.</ref><ref>Hauptman, pp. 78\u201380.</ref>\n\nSome Lumbee ancestors are believed to have been forced to aid the Confederacy as laborers. Others are documented as drawing Confederate pensions for their service. The community says that many men tried to avoid such forced labor by hiding in the swamps. During that period, some men from Robeson County operated as [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] for the [[Union Army]], sabotaging the efforts of the Confederacy and robbing local whites.\n\n===Lowrie War===\n{{Main|Lowry War}}\nEarly in the Civil War, North Carolina turned to forced labor to construct her defenses. Several Lowrie cousins had been conscripted as laborers to help build [[Fort Fisher]], near Wilmington. [[Henry Berry Lowrie]] and several of his relatives took to the swamps where Indians resorted to \"lying out\" to avoid being rounded up by the Home Guard and forced to work as impressed laborers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe Lowrie gang, as it became known, resorted to crime and conducting personal feuds, committing robberies and murders against white Robeson County residents and skirmishing with the Confederate Home Guard. They grew bolder as the war turned against the Confederates. In December 1864, the Lowrie gang killed James P. Barnes after he had drafted workers, including the Lowries, for work on local defenses. Barnes had earlier accused Henry's father, Allen Lowrie, of stealing hogs. Next, the gang killed James Brantley Harris, a Confederate conscription officer who had killed a Lowrie relative.<ref name=Hauptman>{{cite book|last1=Hauptman|first1=Laurence|title=Between Two Fires: American Indians in the Civil War|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=81}}</ref>\n\nThe Confederates struck back, searching Allen Lowrie's home in March 1865, where they found forbidden firearms. The Home Guard convened a summary court, convicted Allen Lowrie and his son William of illegally possessing firearms as men of color, and executed them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAfter the Civil War, the Lowrie gang continued their insurgency, committing robberies and murders. The authorities' raids and attempts to capture gang members became known as the [[Lowry War]]. The gang consisted of Henry Lowrie, his brothers Stephen and Thomas, cousins Calvin and Henderson Oxendine, two of Lowrie's brothers-in-law, two escaped slaves who had joined the Lowries, a white man of unknown identity who was likely a Confederate deserter, and two other men of unknown relation and identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lumbee.org/hbl.html |title=Henry Berry Lowrie |publisher=Lumbee Regional Development Association |date= |accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"ncmuseumofhistory.org\">{{cite web|last=Currie |first=Jefferson |url=http://ncmuseumofhistory.org/workshops/indian/lowry.htm |title=Henry Berry Lowry Lives Forever |publisher=North Carolina Museum of History |access-date=October 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929192631/http://ncmuseumofhistory.org/workshops/indian/lowry.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn December 7, 1865, Henry Lowrie married Rhoda Strong. Arrested at his wedding, Lowrie escaped from jail by filing his way through the jail's bars.<ref name=\"ncmuseumofhistory.org\"/>\n\nLowrie's gang continued its activities into the Reconstruction Era. Republican [[Governor of North Carolina|governor]] [[William Woods Holden]] declared Lowrie and his men outlaws in 1869, and offered a $12,000 reward for their capture: dead or alive. Lowrie responded with more revenge killings. Eluding capture, the Lowrie gang persisted after Reconstruction ended and conservative white Democrats gained control of North Carolina government, imposing [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and [[white supremacy]].\n\nThe Lowrie gang gained the sympathy of local Indian families and even some poor whites, who refused to cooperate with efforts to stop them. Records of the pursuit of the Lowrie gang provide the first documentation of the local people's claims on mixed Indian ancestry. These early accounts refer to the Lowries and the other local Indian families as being mixed [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]]/white. More than 150 years before, a large number of the Tuscarora people, who spoke an Iroquoian language, migrated north to New York to join their Iroquois cousins. The Tuscarora tribe in New York considers the migration complete by the year 1722; all the Tuscarora who remained in North Carolina are not considered under the same council fire, or tribal fraction. The large migration of Tuscarora people was a result of their defeat by the Carolina colonists and their Indian allies in the [[Tuscarora War]].\n\nIn February 1872, shortly after a raid in which he robbed the local sheriff's safe of more than $28,000, Henry Berry Lowrie disappeared. It is claimed he accidentally shot himself while cleaning his double-barrel shotgun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/LUMBEE/2007-11/1194648046 |title=LUMBEE-L Archives: Henry Berry Lowry and the Physician who pronounced him dead |publisher=RootsWeb |date=November 9, 2007 |access-date=October 28, 2011}}</ref> As with many folk heroes, the death of Lowrie was disputed. He was reportedly seen at a funeral several years later.<ref name=\"ncmuseumofhistory.org\" /> Without his leadership, all but two members of the Lowrie gang were subsequently hunted down, and either captured or killed.\n\n===State recognition as Indians===\nDuring Reconstruction, the legislature established public education for the first time, providing for white and black schools. All children of color were assigned to black schools, which were dominated by the children of freedmen (freed slaves). The Indian people of Robeson County had always been free and did not socially associate or interact with Blacks. They refused to send their children to school with the free Blacks and demanded for separate Indian schools. In the 1880s, as the Democratic Party was struggling against the biracial Populist movement which combined the strength of poor whites (Populist and Democrats) and blacks (mostly Republicans), [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state representative Hamilton MacMillan proposed to have the state recognize these Indian people of Robeson County as the \"Croatan Indians\" and to create a separate system of Croatan Indian schools. By the end of the 19th century, the \"Indians of Robeson County\" (as they then identified) established schools in eleven of their principal settlements.<ref>Ross, pp.115-116; 124-125.</ref>\n\n===An Indian school system===\nIn 1887, the Indians of Robeson County petitioned the state legislature to establish a [[normal school]] to train Indian teachers for the county's Indian schools. With state permission, they raised the requisite funds, along with some state assistance, which proved inadequate. Several tribal leaders donated money and privately held land for schools. Robeson County's Indian Normal School eventually developed as Pembroke State University and subsequently as the [[University of North Carolina at Pembroke]].<ref>Ross, pp. 115-116; 124-125</ref>\n\nIn 1899, North Carolina Congressional representatives introduced the first bill in Congress to appropriate federal funds to educate the Indian children of Robeson County. They introduced another bill a decade later,<ref>H.R.19036, 61st Congress, 2nd Session</ref> and yet another in 1911.<ref>S.3258, 62nd Congress, 1st Session</ref> The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, T.&nbsp;J. Morgan, responded to Congress and the Croatan Indians, writing that, \"so long as the immediate wards of the Government [Indians on reservations] are so insufficiently provided for, I do not see how I can consistently render any assistance to the Croatans or any other civilized tribes.\" [sic, civilized tribes were defined in contrast to Indians on reservations, who were wards of the government.]<ref>Dial and Eliades, 93</ref> Those Indians in the Southeast and elsewhere who were not on reservations, such as those in Robeson County, were considered to be United States citizens and thus the responsibility of state governments. The federal government funded Indian education only for Indians on reservations.\n\nBy the first decade of the 20th century, a North Carolina Representative introduced a federal bill to establish \"a normal school for the Indians of Robeson County, North Carolina,\" to be paid for by the federal government. Charles F. Pierce, U.S. Supervisor of Indian Schools in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], opposed the legislation since, \"[a]t the present time it is the avowed policy of the government to require states having an Indian population to assume the burden and responsibility for their education, so far as is possible.\"<ref>Jefferson, NC: McFarland (1994), pages 179-186</ref>\n\n===Ku Klux Klan conflict===\n{{Main|Battle of Hayes Pond}}\nDuring the 1950s, the Croatan Indians (as they were then called) made nationwide news when they came into conflict with the [[Ku Klux Klan|Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]], a white supremacist organization headed by Klan [[Grand Wizard|Grand Dragon]] [[James W. \"Catfish\" Cole]]. Cole began a campaign of harassment against the Lumbee, claiming they were \"[[mongrel]]s and [[half-breed]]s\" whose \"race mixing\" threatened to upset the established order of the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] South.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} After giving a series of speeches denouncing the \"loose morals\" of Lumbee women, Cole burned a cross in the front yard of a Lumbee woman in [[St. Pauls, North Carolina]], as a \"warning\" against \"race mixing\".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Emboldened, Cole called for a Klan rally on January 18, 1958, near the town of [[Maxton, North Carolina|Maxton]]. The Lumbee, led by recent veterans of the Second World War, decided to disrupt the rally.\n\nThe \"[[Battle of Hayes Pond]]\", also known as \"the Klan Rout\", made national news.<ref name=\"Life\"/> Cole had predicted more than 5,000 Klansmen would show up for the rally, but fewer than 100 and possibly as few as three dozen attended. Approximately 500 Lumbee, armed with guns and sticks, gathered in a nearby swamp, and when they realized they possessed an overwhelming numerical advantage, attacked the Klansmen. The Lumbee encircled the Klansmen, opening fire and wounding four Klansmen in the first volley, none seriously. The remaining Klansmen panicked and fled. Cole was found in the swamps, arrested and tried for inciting a riot. The Lumbee celebrated the victory by burning Klan regalia and dancing around the open flames.<ref name=\"Life\">\"Bad Medicine for the Klan\", ''Life'' magazine, 1958</ref>\n\nThe Battle of Hayes Pond, which marked the end of Klan activity in Robeson County, is celebrated as a Lumbee holiday.\n\n===Early efforts to gain federal recognition===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nThe people achieved state recognition as \"Croatan Indians\" in the 1880s. In 1911, at the request of the tribe, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation changing their name to \"Indians of Robeson County.\" In 1913, over the objections of the existing federally recognized [[Cherokee Nation]] tribes in Oklahoma, the North Carolina legislators, based on a petition lobbied for and created by the Croatans, added \"Cherokee\" to the name of the Robeson County tribe. The tribe petitioned for federal recognition as \"Cherokee\" Indians, but it was denied. From 1913 to 1932, North Carolina legislators introduced bills in Congress as petitioned for by the Croatan faction to change the name of the people to Cherokee and gain federal recognition, but did not succeed.\n\nIn the early 20th century, North Carolina requested federal assistance to collect information related to the status of Indians in the state. The Southeast tribes had been subject to [[Indian removal]] in the 1830s, and were assigned to reservations in Oklahoma. Those Indians remaining in the state were considered state and federal citizens; there were no Indian reservations in the state. The legislature was chiefly reviewing issues related to the state's treatment of the Cherokee descendants who lived in the state.\n\nIn 1915, the report of Special Indian Agent O.M. McPherson of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, was sent to the North Carolina legislature. He primarily reported on the Cherokee in the state. He noted that the Indians of Robeson County had developed an extensive system of schools and a political organization. He thought that, as state-recognized Indians, they were eligible to attend federal Indian schools. But, as they were highly assimilated, spoke English, and already worked in the common state culture, he doubted that the federal Indian schools could meet their needs. Congress did not provide any additional funding to support education for Indians in North Carolina.<ref>McPherson</ref>\n\nIn 1924, the Cherokee Indians of North Carolina petitioned for federal recognition as \"Siouan Indians\"; their request was rejected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Congressional committees continued to refuse to have the federal government assume educational responsibility for the Indians of Robeson County, as they were state citizens and part of that jurisdiction's responsibility.\n\n===Federally commissioned reports===\nIn the 20th century, numerous federally commissioned studies related to the Lumbee were conducted by [[anthropology|anthropologists]], [[ethnology|ethnologists]], and historians. They reflect changing concepts of what constituted Indian identity.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} In 1912, legislation was introduced to the US Senate to establish a school for the Indians of Robeson County. When the bill was sent to committee, it requested information from the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. The Indian Office sent Charles F. Pierce, the Supervisor of Indian Schools, to Robeson County to conduct a study of the tribe. Pierce reported that the state and county were providing funds to educate the 1,976 school-age Indian children. He also stated in his report that \"one would readily class a large majority [of the Lumbee] as being at least three-fourths Indian.<ref name= Tamura>{{cite book| title= The History of Discrimination in U.S. Education: Marginality, Agency, and Power| editor-first= E. |editor-last= Tamura| edition= Illustrated| publisher= Springer| year= 2008| isbn= 9780230611030}}</ref>\n\nOn April 28, 1914, the Senate called for an investigation into the status and conditions of the Indians of Robeson and adjoining counties. The Indian Office sent Special Indian Agent O.M. McPherson to the county to obtain information regarding the educational system of the tribe. In his report, submitted to the Senate on January 4, 1915, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>While these Indians are essentially an agricultural people, I believe them to be as capable of learning the mechanical trades as the average white youth. The foregoing facts suggest the character of the educational institution that should be established for them, in case Congress sees fit to make the necessary appropriation, namely the establishment of an agricultural and mechanical school, in which domestic science shall also be taught.<ref name= \"history--culture\">{{cite web| url= http://www.lumbeetribe.com/history--culture | website= LumbeeTribe.com| title= History & Culture: Recognition| publisher= Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina| access-date= October 21, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[John R. Swanton]], a noted anthropologist-historian, reported on possible origins of the Indians of Robeson County in his work on Southeast Indians. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The evidence available thus seems to indicate that the Indians of Robeson County who have been called Croatan and Cherokee are descended mainly from certain Siouan tribes of which the most prominent were the Cheraw and Keyauwee, but they probably included as well remnants of the Eno, and Shakori, and very likely some of the coastal groups such as the Waccamaw and Cape Fears. It is not improbable that a few families or small groups of Algonquian or Iroquoian may have cast their lot with this body of people, but contributions from such sources are relatively insignificant. Although there is some reason to think that the Keyauwee tribe actually contributed more blood to the Robeson County Indians than any other, the name is not widely known, whereas that of the Cheraw has been familiar to historians, geographers and ethnologists in one form or another since the time of De Soto and has a firm position in the cartography of the region. The Cheraws, too, seem to have taken a leading part in opposing the colonists during and immediately after the Yamasee uprising. Therefore, if the name of any tribe is to be used in connection with this body of six or eight thousand people, that of the Cheraw would, in my opinion, be most appropriate.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1935, Indian Agent Fred Baker was sent to Robeson County in response to a proposed resettlement project for the Cherokee Indians of Robeson County. At the time, the people were attempting to organize as a tribe under the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, which largely applied to Indians on reservations to encourage their self-government.\n\nBaker reported:\n\n<blockquote>I find that the sense of racial solidarity is growing stronger and that the members of this tribe are cooperating more and more with each other with the object in view of promoting the mutual benefit of all the members. It is clear to my mind that sooner of later government action will have to be taken in the name of justice and humanity to aid them.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}</blockquote>\n\nD'Arcy McNickle, from the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]],<ref name= Hearing>{{cite web| title= Senate Hearing 109-610: Lumbee Recognition Act, S. 660| url= https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109shrg28696/html/CHRG-109shrg28696.htm| website= GPO.gov| publisher= Committee on Indian Affairs, United States Senate | date= July 12, 2006| place= Washington, D.C.| access-date= October 21, 2016}}</ref> came to Robeson County in 1936 to collect affidavits and other data from people registering as Indian under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. McNickle stated, \"there are reasons for believing that until comparatively recently some remnant of language still persisted among these people.\"<ref name= Hearing/>\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] ethnologists Dr. William Sturtevant and Dr. Samuel Stanley described the Lumbee as \"larger than any other Indian group in the United States except the Navajo\", and estimated their population as 31,380 Lumbee (from North and South Carolina) in 1960.<ref name= \"history--culture\" />\n\n===Indian New Deal===\nThe federal [[Indian Reorganization Act]] in 1934 was chiefly directed at Native American tribes on reservations. It encouraged them to re-establish self-government, which had been diminished since the founding of reservations and the supervision by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\nAt this time, the Indians of Robeson County renewed their petition for federal recognition as a tribe. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) sent [[John R. Swanton]], an anthropologist from the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], and the Indian Agent Fred Baker to evaluate the claim of the Indians of Robeson County to historical continuity as an identified Indian community. In 1934, the future Lumbee revived their claim to Cherokee identity, joining the National Congress of American Indians under the name, \"Cherokee Indians of Robeson County.\"\n\nSwanton speculated that the group were more likely descended in part from Cheraw and other eastern Siouan tribes, as these were the predominant Native American peoples historically in that area. The Indians of Robeson County split in terms of how they identified as Native Americans: one group supported the Cheraw theory of ancestry. The other faction believed they were descended from the Cherokee, although the tribe had historically occupied territory in the mountains and western part of the state rather than the area of Robeson County. North Carolina's politicians abandoned support for the federal recognition effort until the tribal factions agreed on their identity.\n\nIn 1952, under the leadership of D.F. Lowrie, the tribe voted to adopt the name \"Lumbee.\" The North Carolina legislature recognized the name change in 1953. The tribe petitioned again for federal recognition.\n\n===Lumbee Act===\nThe Lumbee Act, also known as H.R. 4656 ({{USStatute|84|570|70|254}}), passed by Congress in late May 1956 as a concession to political lobbying and signed by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], designated the Lumbee as an Indian people. It withheld full recognition as a \"Tribe\", as had been agreed to by the Lumbee leaders. The Lumbee Act designated the Indians of Robeson, [[Hoke County, North Carolina|Hoke]], [[Scotland County, North Carolina|Scotland]], and [[Cumberland County, North Carolina|Cumberland]] counties as the \"Lumbee Indians of North Carolina.\"\n\nIt provided further, \"as requested by the Lumbee HR 4656 stipulated that '[n]othing in this Act shall make such Indians eligible for any services performed by the United States for Indians because of their status as Indians.'\" It also forbids a Government relationship with the Lumbee and forbids them from applying through the BARS, the BIA administrative process to gain recognition. This restriction as to eligibility for services was a condition which tribal representatives agreed to at the time in order to achieve status as a recognized tribe and have the Lumbee name recognized. The Lumbee had essentially assimilated into early colonial life prior to the formation of the United States. They lived as individuals, as did any other colonial and U.S. citizens. Lumbee spokesmen repeatedly testified at these hearings that they were not seeking federal financial benefits; they said they only wanted a name designation as Lumbee people.\n\n===Petitioning for full federal recognition===\nIn 1987, the Lumbee petitioned the [[United States Department of the Interior]] for full federal recognition. This is a prerequisite to receive the financial benefits accorded federally recognized Native American tribes. The latter have generally been those tribes who had signed treaties with the federal government and had reservations established, and a history of a tribal relationship with the federal government.<ref>The petition's authors were [[Julian Pierce]], Cynthia Hunt-Locklear, Wes White, Jack Campisi and [[Arlinda Locklear]].</ref> The petition was denied because of the Lumbee Act.\n\nThe Lumbee resumed [[lobbying]] Congress, testifying in 1988, 1989, 1991 and 1993 in efforts to gain full federal recognition by congressional action.<ref name= draft>[http://www.indian.senate.gov/public/_files/Hicks071206.pdf DRAFT<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> All of these attempts failed in the face of opposition by the Department of Interior, the recognized [[Cherokee]] tribes (including North Carolina's [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]]), some of the North Carolina Congressional delegation, and some representatives from other states with federally recognized tribes.

The Lumbee abandoned the Lost Colony theory of origins in 1911, dropping \"Croatan\" from their tribal name, calling themselves the \"Indians of Robeson County.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Cherokee descent===\nThe proto Lumbee first began identifying as Cherokee Indians in 1915, when they changed their name to the \"Cherokee Indians of Robeson County.\" Four years earlier, they had changed their name from the \"Croatan Indians\" to the generic \"Indians of Robeson County.\" But the Cherokee occupied much further to the west and in the mountains during the colonial era.\n\nIn his unpublished 1934 master's thesis, graduate student Clifton Oxendine theorized that the Lumbee descended from [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Cherokee]]. Citing \"oral traditions,\" Oxendine suggested that the Lumbee were the descendants of Cherokee warriors who fought with the British under Colonel [[John Barnwell (colonist)|John Barnwell]] of South Carolina in the Tuscarora campaign of 1711\u20131713. He said the Cherokee settled in the swamps of Robeson County when the campaign ended, along with some Tuscarora captives.<ref>Oxendine, p. 4</ref>\n\nThe Oxendine theory of Cherokee origin has been uniformly rejected by mainstream scholars. First, no Cherokee warriors are listed in the record of Barnwell's company.<ref>Rights, pp. 54-55</ref> Second, the Lumbee do not speak Cherokee or any other Indian language. Third, Oxendine's claims of oral traditions are completely unsubstantiated; no such oral traditions survive or are documented by any other scholar.\n\nThe Lumbee have abandoned this theory in their documentation supporting their effort to obtain federal tribal recognition. The federally recognized [[Cherokee Nation]] categorically rejects any connection to the Lumbee, dismissing the Oxendine claims as \"absurd\" and disputing even that the Lumbee qualify as Native American.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Cheraw descent===\nShortly after abandoning the Croatan label and changing their name to the generic \"Indians of Robeson County\", the proto Lumbee seized on the speculations of Indian agent McPherson that they may be related to the defunct [[Cheraw]], a band of Siouan-speaking Indians that had been reduced by war and disease to 50 or 60 individuals by 1768.\n\nThe 1915 ''McPherson Report'' said in reference to the Cheraw (quoting the ''Handbook of American Indians'', 1906):\n\n<blockquote>Their numbers in 1715, according to Rivers, was 510, but this estimate probably included the Keyauwee. Being still subject to attack by the [[Iroquois]], they finally\u2014between 1726 and 1739\u2014became incorporated with the [[Catawba people|Catawba]]&nbsp;... They are mentioned as with the Catawba but speaking their own distinct dialect as late as 1743 (Adair). The last notice of them in 1768, when their remnant, reduced by war and disease to 50 or 60, were still living with the Catawba.<ref>''Handbook of American Indians'' (1906)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Catawba people|Catawba]] are a federally recognized tribe. The McPherson Report does not explain how or when the remaining four or five dozen Cheraw identified in 1768 separated from the Catawba and became the ancestors of the Lumbee.\n\n===Siouan descent===\nAfter repeated rejections under the Croatan, Cherokee and Cheraw labels, the proto Lumbee petitioned the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1924 for recognition as \"Siouan\" Indians. This petition was rejected largely on the grounds that Siouan was a language, not a tribe. Moreover, there was no record of the Lumbee or their ancestors having ever spoken the Siouan or any other Indian language.\n\n===Keyauwee descent===\nIn 1933, John Swanton wrote that the Siouan-speaking Keyauwee and Cheraw of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Carolina Piedmont]] were the most likely Indian ancestors of the people known from 1885 to 1912 as Croatan Indians and later as the Indians of Robeson County.<ref name=chavis>Chavis, Dean.

In the 21st century, these tribes are extinct as groups, except for a small band of Waccamaw that live on Lake Waccamaw and have been recognized by the state.<ref name=chavis/>\n\nSwanton traced the migration of Southeast tribes.<ref name=\"Rights, p. 59\">Rights, p. 59</ref> In addition to the Keyauwee, Cheraw, Bear River, Waccamaw, and Woccon already mentioned, he noted that the [[Eno people|Eno]] and [[Waxhaw people|Waxhaw]] migrated from [[Piedmont, South Carolina]] northeast to the north-central part of North Carolina, then back south again to a point on the [[Pee Dee River]] just south of the border of the two Carolinas.\n\nAccording to Blu, by the 1770s remnant Indians, from the once distinct tribal communities of the Cheraw, Keyauwee, Hatteras, Waxhaw, Sugaree, Eno, and Shakori, gathered along the Lumbee River, near the border that now divides North and South Carolina.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Some of these Indians moved further southward to join with the few surviving Catawba, but the majority settled near the pines, web of wetlands, and river that bear the name of the Lumbee. Over time in a process of [[ethnogenesis]], they identified as a common people.<ref>Blu 1980:36</ref>\n\n== Settlements ==\nThe Lumbee are heavily concentrated in [[Robeson County, North Carolina|Robeson County]] on the southern border of the state. Over the years, the Lumbee have migrated to other areas primarily for employment. Sizeable Lumbee settlements are in [[Cumberland County, North Carolina|Cumberland]], [[Sampson County, North Carolina|Sampson]], [[Hoke County, North Carolina|Hoke]], [[Scotland County, North Carolina|Scotland]], and [[Columbus County, North Carolina|Columbus]] counties; in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Detroit]], [[History of the Native Americans in Baltimore|Baltimore]], and [[Claxton, Georgia]] (settled from 1865 to the 1920s to work [[turpentine]] and cotton).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n==Culture and traditions==\n===Lumbee Homecoming===\nLumbee Homecoming is a celebration held annually in [[Pembroke, NC]] since 1968.

Communities are basically self-governing. One form of self-governance in the early 20th century was exhibited by a fraternal organization known as the Red Men's Lodge. By 1914, lodges existed in Prospect, Magnolia, Pembroke, Saddletree, Oxendine, and Union Chapel. Lodge members maintained social order, carried out ceremonies, marched in parades, and conducted funerals. The 1987 Lumbee Petition states that, \"[w]ith so many prominent leaders it is easy to understand how the lodges could maintain order and, at the same time, protect the tribal members from organized violence from whites in the area\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lumbeetribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=132&Itemid=97 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615063856/http://www.lumbeetribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=132&Itemid=97 |archivedate=2013-06-15 }}, Lumbee Tribe website</ref>\n\n===Lumbee patchwork===\nLumbee patchwork is a traditional Lumbee craft. Drawing on the abundant flora around them, they worked the Long Leaf Pine cone into a design for their blankets, rugs, and clothing. Patchwork can be seen at the UNCP [[University of North Carolina at Pembroke|Native American Resource Center]], powwows, cultural events, quilting bees, and culture classes around Robeson County. In 1993, the Lumbee patchwork dress was recreated for Miss Lumbee Natascha Wagoner, who was chosen as the 8th [[Miss Indian America|Miss Indian USA]]. The dress, designed by Hayes Alan Locklear and sewn by Kat Littleturtle, set a standard for the Lumbee women and became a cultural symbol.\n\n===Religion===\nToday the Lumbee primarily practice Christianity, and attending church is an important social activity. Churches have Sunday schools, youth organizations, senior citizens' programs, Bible study programs, and choir practices. Gospel songs are popular. Ministers are highly respected. When a sizeable number of Lumbee people move to a city, they tend to settle in a particular section or neighborhood and establish a church.

The Lumbee Tribe is the largest state tribe in North Carolina, the largest state tribe east of the [[Mississippi River]], and the ninth largest non-federally recognized tribe in the United States. The Lumbee take their name from the Lumber River which winds its way through Robeson County. Pembroke, North Carolina, is the economic, cultural and political center of the tribe. The Lumbee Tribe was recognized as a Native American tribe by the [[United States Congress]] in 1956, under conditions that it agreed to at the time, which did not allow them to have benefits available to other federally recognized tribes.<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/184/text]</ref> According to the [[2000 United States Census]] report, 89% of the population of the town of [[Pembroke, North Carolina]], identify as Lumbee; 40% of Robeson County's population identify as Lumbee.\n\nThe Lumbee are one of eight state-recognized Native American tribes in North Carolina;<ref>[http://statelibrary.ncdcr.gov/colls/themes/november.html \"Native American Heritage.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515012444/http://statelibrary.ncdcr.gov/colls/themes/november.html |date=2012-05-15 }} ''State Library of North Carolina.'' Retrieved 8 Nov 2009.</ref> they have been recognized by the state since 1885. They participate at the state level in many ways, including in the North Carolina Commission of Indian Affairs. They also participate in such national organizations as the [[National Congress of American Indians]] and the [[National Indian Education Association]].\n\n==History==\n===Early historical references===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2019}}\nThe earliest European document referring to Indian communities in the area of the [[Lumber River]] is a map prepared in 1725 by John Herbert, the English commissioner of Indian trade for the Wineau Factory on the [[Black River (North Carolina)|Black River]]. Herbert identifies the four [[Siouan languages|Siouan]]-speaking communities as the Saraw, [[Pedee people|Pee Dee]], Scavano, and Wacoma. Modern-day Lumbees claim connection to those settlements, but none of the four tribes is located within the boundaries of present-day Robeson County.\n\nWhen this area was first surveyed by the English in the 1750s, they reported that \"No Indians\" lived in Bladen County, which then included parts of present-day Robeson County. Colonial Welsh timber survey parties of the same areas also reported, \"No Hostile Indians, in fact No Indians to be found at all.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The adjacent [[Anson County, North Carolina|Anson County]] was identified as \"a frontier to the Indians.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}<!-- Anson County article says nothing about territory going to Robeson County. -->\n\nIn 1754, colonial authorities organized the territory: everything north of the Lumber River was made part of Bladen County, and everything south of the Lumber River was made part of Anson County. Anson County's border stretched west to known Cherokee territory. Historical records are unclear as to which parts of Anson County were occupied by Indians in the early colonial period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nA 1772 proclamation by the [[governor of North Carolina]], [[Arthur Dobbs]], derived from a report by his agent, Colonel Rutherford, head of a Bladen County militia, listed the names of inhabitants who took part in a \"Mob Railously Assembled together,\" apparently defying the efforts of colonial officials to collect taxes. The proclamation declared the \"Above list of Rogus [sic] is all living upon the Kings Land without title.\" A later colonial military survey described \"50 families a mixt crew, a lawless People possess the Lands without Patent or paying quit Rents.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Colonial Records: North Carolina 1890''; 768 and ''North Carolina 1887''; 161, respectively</ref> The surnames of some of the families are the same as modern-day Lumbees, but each family must be traced separately to identify individual ancestors, particularly since extensive intermarriage took place. The families were classified then as \"[[mulatto]]s,\" a term that then had several different meanings. Today, it is most commonly used to describe [[mixed-race]] persons of African-European ancestry. However, at the time, the term was also used across the South to describe any non-white individual. They included full-blooded Native Americans not living within a confined reservation and mixed-race persons of Native American-European ancestry.\n\nFollowing the [[Reconstruction Era]], white-dominated legislatures in the South imposed legal racial segregation. They required all non-white people or people of color to attend black schools in which most students were [[Freedman#United States|freedmen]]'s children. In 1885, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state representative Hamilton McMillan supported an effort to gain separate schools for the Indian children in the state since they and their ancestors had always been free and refused to send their children to black schools. In making his case, McMillan wrote that Lumbee ancestor James Lowrie had received sizable land grants early in the century and, by 1738, possessed combined estates of more than 2,000 acres (810&nbsp;ha). [[Adolph Dial]] and [[David Eliades]] claimed that another Lumbee ancestor, John Brooks, held the title to over 1,000 acres (400&nbsp;ha) in 1735 and that Robert Lowrie gained possession of almost 700 acres (280&nbsp;ha).<ref>Dial and Eliades, pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nHowever, a state [[archivist]] noted in the late 20th century that no land grants were issued during these years in North Carolina. The first documented land grants made to individuals claimed to be Lumbee ancestors did not take place until the 1750s, more than a decade later.<ref>Hoffman</ref> None of the various petitions for federal recognition by the Lumbee people has relied on the McMillan, Dial, or Eliades claims.<ref>Thomas</ref>\n\nLand patents and deeds filed with the colonial administrations of Virginia, North Carolina, and [[South Carolina]] during that period show that individuals who claimed to be Lumbee ancestors migrated from southern parts of Virginia and northern parts of North Carolina. In the first federal census of 1790, the ancestors of the Lumbee were enumerated as [[free people of color|Free Persons of Color]], another term used for a wide variety of non-White people including, non-reservation American Indians, mixed race of American Indian/European, and mixed race African/European. In 1800 and 1810, the families were classified as \"all other free persons\" in the census (after \"white\" and \"black\").{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nLand records show that in the second half of the 18th century, persons since identified as ancestral Lumbees began to take titles to land near Drowning Creek (Lumber River) and prominent swamps such as Ashpole, Long, and Back. According to James Campisi, the [[anthropologist]] hired by the Lumbee tribe to support their petition for federal recognition, the area \"is located in the heart of the so-called old field of the [[Cheraw]] documented in land records between 1737 and 1739.\"<ref>Campisi, Dr. Jack.

October 3, 1771</ref> That mention, along with no evidence that a new settlement was established or the old settlement was abandoned, is not sufficient to confirm that the settlement on Drowning Creek in 1754 was a Cheraw settlement.\n\n===American Revolution and federal era===\nPension records for veterans of the [[American Revolutionary War]] in Robeson County listed men with surnames later associated with Lumbee families, such as Samuel Bell, Jacob Locklear, John Brooks, Berry Hunt, Thomas Jacobs, Thomas Cummings, and Michael Revels. In 1790, other men with surnames since associated with Lumbee-identified descendants, such as Barnes, Braveboy (or Brayboy), Bullard, Chavers (Chavis), Cumbo, Hammonds, Lowrie (Lowry/Lowery), Oxendine, Strickland, and Wilkins, were listed as inhabitants of the Fayetteville District; they were all \"Free Persons of Color\" in the first federal census.<ref name=\"U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1790\">U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1790</ref>\n\n===Antebellum===\nFollowing the [[Nat Turner]] Slave Rebellion of 1831, the state legislature passed amendments to its original 1776 constitution, abolishing [[suffrage]] for free people of color. This was one of a series of laws passed by North Carolina whites from 1826 to the 1850s which the historian [[John Hope Franklin]] characterized as the \"Free Negro Code,\" creating restrictions on that class. Free people of color were stripped of various political and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] which they had enjoyed for almost two generations. They could no longer vote or serve on juries, bear arms without a license from the state, or serve in the state militia.<ref name=\"Heinegg\">[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], 1995-2005, accessed 9 Mar 2008</ref> As these were obligations traditionally associated with citizenship, they were made second-class citizens.\n\nIn 1853, the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of the state's restrictions to prevent free people of color from bearing arms without a license. Noel Locklear, identified as a free man of color in ''State v. Locklear'', was convicted for the illegal possession of firearms.<ref name=\"dial eliades 45\">Dial and Eliades, p.45</ref><ref>Evans, p.108</ref><ref>Hauptman, p. 77.</ref> In 1857, William Chavers from Robeson County was arrested and charged as a free person of color for carrying a shotgun without a license. Chavers, like Locklear, was convicted. Chavers promptly appealed, arguing that the law restricted only \"free Negroes,\" not \"persons of color from Indian blood.\" The appeals court reversed the lower court, finding that \"free persons of color may be, then, for all we can see, persons colored by Indian blood\".<ref>''State v. Chavers,'' 50 N.C. (5 Jones) 11 (1857).</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nA [[yellow fever]] epidemic in 1862\u20131863 killed many [[Slavery|slaves]] working on the construction of [[Fort Fisher]] near [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], then considered to be the \"[[Gibraltar]] of the South\". As the state's slave owners resisted sending more slaves to Fort Fisher, the Confederate Home Guard intensified efforts to conscript able-bodied free persons of color as laborers. There does not appear to be documentation of conscription among the free people of color in Robeson County.<ref name=\"evans 3-18\">Evans, pp. 3\u201318.</ref><ref>Dial and Eliades, pp. 46\u201347.</ref><ref>Hauptman, pp. 78\u201380.</ref>\n\nSome Lumbee ancestors are believed to have been forced to aid the Confederacy as laborers. Others are documented as drawing Confederate pensions for their service. The community says that many men tried to avoid such forced labor by hiding in the swamps. During that period, some men from Robeson County operated as [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] for the [[Union Army]], sabotaging the efforts of the Confederacy and robbing local whites.\n\n===Lowrie War===\n{{Main|Lowry War}}\nEarly in the Civil War, North Carolina turned to forced labor to construct her defenses. Several Lowrie cousins had been conscripted as laborers to help build [[Fort Fisher]], near Wilmington. [[Henry Berry Lowrie]] and several of his relatives took to the swamps where Indians resorted to \"lying out\" to avoid being rounded up by the Home Guard and forced to work as impressed laborers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe Lowrie gang, as it became known, resorted to crime and conducting personal feuds, committing robberies and murders against white Robeson County residents and skirmishing with the Confederate Home Guard. They grew bolder as the war turned against the Confederates. In December 1864, the Lowrie gang killed James P. Barnes after he had drafted workers, including the Lowries, for work on local defenses. Barnes had earlier accused Henry's father, Allen Lowrie, of stealing hogs. Next, the gang killed James Brantley Harris, a Confederate conscription officer who had killed a Lowrie relative.<ref name=Hauptman>{{cite book|last1=Hauptman|first1=Laurence|title=Between Two Fires: American Indians in the Civil War|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=81}}</ref>\n\nThe Confederates struck back, searching Allen Lowrie's home in March 1865, where they found forbidden firearms. The Home Guard convened a summary court, convicted Allen Lowrie and his son William of illegally possessing firearms as men of color, and executed them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAfter the Civil War, the Lowrie gang continued their insurgency, committing robberies and murders. The authorities' raids and attempts to capture gang members became known as the [[Lowry War]]. The gang consisted of Henry Lowrie, his brothers Stephen and Thomas, cousins Calvin and Henderson Oxendine, two of Lowrie's brothers-in-law, two escaped slaves who had joined the Lowries, a white man of unknown identity who was likely a Confederate deserter, and two other men of unknown relation and identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lumbee.org/hbl.html |title=Henry Berry Lowrie |publisher=Lumbee Regional Development Association |date= |accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"ncmuseumofhistory.org\">{{cite web|last=Currie |first=Jefferson |url=http://ncmuseumofhistory.org/workshops/indian/lowry.htm |title=Henry Berry Lowry Lives Forever |publisher=North Carolina Museum of History |access-date=October 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929192631/http://ncmuseumofhistory.org/workshops/indian/lowry.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn December 7, 1865, Henry Lowrie married Rhoda Strong. Arrested at his wedding, Lowrie escaped from jail by filing his way through the jail's bars.<ref name=\"ncmuseumofhistory.org\"/>\n\nLowrie's gang continued its activities into the Reconstruction Era. Republican [[Governor of North Carolina|governor]] [[William Woods Holden]] declared Lowrie and his men outlaws in 1869, and offered a $12,000 reward for their capture: dead or alive. Lowrie responded with more revenge killings. Eluding capture, the Lowrie gang persisted after Reconstruction ended and conservative white Democrats gained control of North Carolina government, imposing [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and [[white supremacy]].\n\nThe Lowrie gang gained the sympathy of local Indian families and even some poor whites, who refused to cooperate with efforts to stop them. Records of the pursuit of the Lowrie gang provide the first documentation of the local people's claims on mixed Indian ancestry. These early accounts refer to the Lowries and the other local Indian families as being mixed [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]]/white. More than 150 years before, a large number of the Tuscarora people, who spoke an Iroquoian language, migrated north to New York to join their Iroquois cousins. The Tuscarora tribe in New York considers the migration complete by the year 1722; all the Tuscarora who remained in North Carolina are not considered under the same council fire, or tribal fraction. The large migration of Tuscarora people was a result of their defeat by the Carolina colonists and their Indian allies in the [[Tuscarora War]].\n\nIn February 1872, shortly after a raid in which he robbed the local sheriff's safe of more than $28,000, Henry Berry Lowrie disappeared. It is claimed he accidentally shot himself while cleaning his double-barrel shotgun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/LUMBEE/2007-11/1194648046 |title=LUMBEE-L Archives: Henry Berry Lowry and the Physician who pronounced him dead |publisher=RootsWeb |date=November 9, 2007 |access-date=October 28, 2011}}</ref> As with many folk heroes, the death of Lowrie was disputed. He was reportedly seen at a funeral several years later.<ref name=\"ncmuseumofhistory.org\" /> Without his leadership, all but two members of the Lowrie gang were subsequently hunted down, and either captured or killed.\n\n===State recognition as Indians===\nDuring Reconstruction, the legislature established public education for the first time, providing for white and black schools. All children of color were assigned to black schools, which were dominated by the children of freedmen (freed slaves). The Indian people of Robeson County had always been free and did not socially associate or interact with Blacks. They refused to send their children to school with the free Blacks and demanded for separate Indian schools. In the 1880s, as the Democratic Party was struggling against the biracial Populist movement which combined the strength of poor whites (Populist and Democrats) and blacks (mostly Republicans), [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state representative Hamilton MacMillan proposed to have the state recognize these Indian people of Robeson County as the \"Croatan Indians\" and to create a separate system of Croatan Indian schools. By the end of the 19th century, the \"Indians of Robeson County\" (as they then identified) established schools in eleven of their principal settlements.<ref>Ross, pp.115-116; 124-125.</ref>\n\n===An Indian school system===\nIn 1887, the Indians of Robeson County petitioned the state legislature to establish a [[normal school]] to train Indian teachers for the county's Indian schools. With state permission, they raised the requisite funds, along with some state assistance, which proved inadequate. Several tribal leaders donated money and privately held land for schools. Robeson County's Indian Normal School eventually developed as Pembroke State University and subsequently as the [[University of North Carolina at Pembroke]].<ref>Ross, pp. 115-116; 124-125</ref>\n\nIn 1899, North Carolina Congressional representatives introduced the first bill in Congress to appropriate federal funds to educate the Indian children of Robeson County. They introduced another bill a decade later,<ref>H.R.19036, 61st Congress, 2nd Session</ref> and yet another in 1911.<ref>S.3258, 62nd Congress, 1st Session</ref> The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, T.&nbsp;J. Morgan, responded to Congress and the Croatan Indians, writing that, \"so long as the immediate wards of the Government [Indians on reservations] are so insufficiently provided for, I do not see how I can consistently render any assistance to the Croatans or any other civilized tribes.\" [sic, civilized tribes were defined in contrast to Indians on reservations, who were wards of the government.]<ref>Dial and Eliades, 93</ref> Those Indians in the Southeast and elsewhere who were not on reservations, such as those in Robeson County, were considered to be United States citizens and thus the responsibility of state governments. The federal government funded Indian education only for Indians on reservations.\n\nBy the first decade of the 20th century, a North Carolina Representative introduced a federal bill to establish \"a normal school for the Indians of Robeson County, North Carolina,\" to be paid for by the federal government. Charles F. Pierce, U.S. Supervisor of Indian Schools in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], opposed the legislation since, \"[a]t the present time it is the avowed policy of the government to require states having an Indian population to assume the burden and responsibility for their education, so far as is possible.\"<ref>Jefferson, NC: McFarland (1994), pages 179-186</ref>\n\n===Ku Klux Klan conflict===\n{{Main|Battle of Hayes Pond}}\nDuring the 1950s, the Croatan Indians (as they were then called) made nationwide news when they came into conflict with the [[Ku Klux Klan|Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]], a white supremacist organization headed by Klan [[Grand Wizard|Grand Dragon]] [[James W. \"Catfish\" Cole]]. Cole began a campaign of harassment against the Lumbee, claiming they were \"[[mongrel]]s and [[half-breed]]s\" whose \"race mixing\" threatened to upset the established order of the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] South.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} After giving a series of speeches denouncing the \"loose morals\" of Lumbee women, Cole burned a cross in the front yard of a Lumbee woman in [[St. Pauls, North Carolina]], as a \"warning\" against \"race mixing\".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Emboldened, Cole called for a Klan rally on January 18, 1958, near the town of [[Maxton, North Carolina|Maxton]]. The Lumbee, led by recent veterans of the Second World War, decided to disrupt the rally.\n\nThe \"[[Battle of Hayes Pond]]\", also known as \"the Klan Rout\", made national news.<ref name=\"Life\"/> Cole had predicted more than 5,000 Klansmen would show up for the rally, but fewer than 100 and possibly as few as three dozen attended. Approximately 500 Lumbee, armed with guns and sticks, gathered in a nearby swamp, and when they realized they possessed an overwhelming numerical advantage, attacked the Klansmen. The Lumbee encircled the Klansmen, opening fire and wounding four Klansmen in the first volley, none seriously. The remaining Klansmen panicked and fled. Cole was found in the swamps, arrested and tried for inciting a riot. The Lumbee celebrated the victory by burning Klan regalia and dancing around the open flames.<ref name=\"Life\">\"Bad Medicine for the Klan\", ''Life'' magazine, 1958</ref>\n\nThe Battle of Hayes Pond, which marked the end of Klan activity in Robeson County, is celebrated as a Lumbee holiday.\n\n===Early efforts to gain federal recognition===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nThe people achieved state recognition as \"Croatan Indians\" in the 1880s. In 1911, at the request of the tribe, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation changing their name to \"Indians of Robeson County.\" In 1913, over the objections of the existing federally recognized [[Cherokee Nation]] tribes in Oklahoma, the North Carolina legislators, based on a petition lobbied for and created by the Croatans, added \"Cherokee\" to the name of the Robeson County tribe. The tribe petitioned for federal recognition as \"Cherokee\" Indians, but it was denied. From 1913 to 1932, North Carolina legislators introduced bills in Congress as petitioned for by the Croatan faction to change the name of the people to Cherokee and gain federal recognition, but did not succeed.\n\nIn the early 20th century, North Carolina requested federal assistance to collect information related to the status of Indians in the state. The Southeast tribes had been subject to [[Indian removal]] in the 1830s, and were assigned to reservations in Oklahoma. Those Indians remaining in the state were considered state and federal citizens; there were no Indian reservations in the state. The legislature was chiefly reviewing issues related to the state's treatment of the Cherokee descendants who lived in the state.\n\nIn 1915, the report of Special Indian Agent O.M. McPherson of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, was sent to the North Carolina legislature. He primarily reported on the Cherokee in the state. He noted that the Indians of Robeson County had developed an extensive system of schools and a political organization. He thought that, as state-recognized Indians, they were eligible to attend federal Indian schools. But, as they were highly assimilated, spoke English, and already worked in the common state culture, he doubted that the federal Indian schools could meet their needs. Congress did not provide any additional funding to support education for Indians in North Carolina.<ref>McPherson</ref>\n\nIn 1924, the Cherokee Indians of North Carolina petitioned for federal recognition as \"Siouan Indians\"; their request was rejected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Congressional committees continued to refuse to have the federal government assume educational responsibility for the Indians of Robeson County, as they were state citizens and part of that jurisdiction's responsibility.\n\n===Federally commissioned reports===\nIn the 20th century, numerous federally commissioned studies related to the Lumbee were conducted by [[anthropology|anthropologists]], [[ethnology|ethnologists]], and historians. They reflect changing concepts of what constituted Indian identity.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} In 1912, legislation was introduced to the US Senate to establish a school for the Indians of Robeson County. When the bill was sent to committee, it requested information from the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. The Indian Office sent Charles F. Pierce, the Supervisor of Indian Schools, to Robeson County to conduct a study of the tribe. Pierce reported that the state and county were providing funds to educate the 1,976 school-age Indian children. He also stated in his report that \"one would readily class a large majority [of the Lumbee] as being at least three-fourths Indian.<ref name= Tamura>{{cite book| title= The History of Discrimination in U.S. Education: Marginality, Agency, and Power| editor-first= E. |editor-last= Tamura| edition= Illustrated| publisher= Springer| year= 2008| isbn= 9780230611030}}</ref>\n\nOn April 28, 1914, the Senate called for an investigation into the status and conditions of the Indians of Robeson and adjoining counties. The Indian Office sent Special Indian Agent O.M. McPherson to the county to obtain information regarding the educational system of the tribe. In his report, submitted to the Senate on January 4, 1915, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>While these Indians are essentially an agricultural people, I believe them to be as capable of learning the mechanical trades as the average white youth. The foregoing facts suggest the character of the educational institution that should be established for them, in case Congress sees fit to make the necessary appropriation, namely the establishment of an agricultural and mechanical school, in which domestic science shall also be taught.<ref name= \"history--culture\">{{cite web| url= http://www.lumbeetribe.com/history--culture | website= LumbeeTribe.com| title= History & Culture: Recognition| publisher= Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina| access-date= October 21, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[John R. Swanton]], a noted anthropologist-historian, reported on possible origins of the Indians of Robeson County in his work on Southeast Indians. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The evidence available thus seems to indicate that the Indians of Robeson County who have been called Croatan and Cherokee are descended mainly from certain Siouan tribes of which the most prominent were the Cheraw and Keyauwee, but they probably included as well remnants of the Eno, and Shakori, and very likely some of the coastal groups such as the Waccamaw and Cape Fears. It is not improbable that a few families or small groups of Algonquian or Iroquoian may have cast their lot with this body of people, but contributions from such sources are relatively insignificant. Although there is some reason to think that the Keyauwee tribe actually contributed more blood to the Robeson County Indians than any other, the name is not widely known, whereas that of the Cheraw has been familiar to historians, geographers and ethnologists in one form or another since the time of De Soto and has a firm position in the cartography of the region. The Cheraws, too, seem to have taken a leading part in opposing the colonists during and immediately after the Yamasee uprising. Therefore, if the name of any tribe is to be used in connection with this body of six or eight thousand people, that of the Cheraw would, in my opinion, be most appropriate.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1935, Indian Agent Fred Baker was sent to Robeson County in response to a proposed resettlement project for the Cherokee Indians of Robeson County. At the time, the people were attempting to organize as a tribe under the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, which largely applied to Indians on reservations to encourage their self-government.\n\nBaker reported:\n\n<blockquote>I find that the sense of racial solidarity is growing stronger and that the members of this tribe are cooperating more and more with each other with the object in view of promoting the mutual benefit of all the members.

McNickle stated, \"there are reasons for believing that until comparatively recently some remnant of language still persisted among these people.\"<ref name= Hearing/>\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] ethnologists Dr. William Sturtevant and Dr. Samuel Stanley described the Lumbee as \"larger than any other Indian group in the United States except the Navajo\", and estimated their population as 31,380 Lumbee (from North and South Carolina) in 1960.<ref name= \"history--culture\" />\n\n===Indian New Deal===\nThe federal [[Indian Reorganization Act]] in 1934 was chiefly directed at Native American tribes on reservations. It encouraged them to re-establish self-government, which had been diminished since the founding of reservations and the supervision by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\nAt this time, the Indians of Robeson County renewed their petition for federal recognition as a tribe. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) sent [[John R. Swanton]], an anthropologist from the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], and the Indian Agent Fred Baker to evaluate the claim of the Indians of Robeson County to historical continuity as an identified Indian community. In 1934, the future Lumbee revived their claim to Cherokee identity, joining the National Congress of American Indians under the name, \"Cherokee Indians of Robeson County.\"\n\nSwanton speculated that the group were more likely descended in part from Cheraw and other eastern Siouan tribes, as these were the predominant Native American peoples historically in that area. The Indians of Robeson County split in terms of how they identified as Native Americans: one group supported the Cheraw theory of ancestry. The other faction believed they were descended from the Cherokee, although the tribe had historically occupied territory in the mountains and western part of the state rather than the area of Robeson County. North Carolina's politicians abandoned support for the federal recognition effort until the tribal factions agreed on their identity.\n\nIn 1952, under the leadership of D.F. Lowrie, the tribe voted to adopt the name \"Lumbee.\" The North Carolina legislature recognized the name change in 1953. The tribe petitioned again for federal recognition.\n\n===Lumbee Act===\nThe Lumbee Act, also known as H.R. 4656 ({{USStatute|84|570|70|254}}), passed by Congress in late May 1956 as a concession to political lobbying and signed by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], designated the Lumbee as an Indian people. It withheld full recognition as a \"Tribe\", as had been agreed to by the Lumbee leaders. The Lumbee Act designated the Indians of Robeson, [[Hoke County, North Carolina|Hoke]], [[Scotland County, North Carolina|Scotland]], and [[Cumberland County, North Carolina|Cumberland]] counties as the \"Lumbee Indians of North Carolina.\"\n\nIt provided further, \"as requested by the Lumbee HR 4656 stipulated that '[n]othing in this Act shall make such Indians eligible for any services performed by the United States for Indians because of their status as Indians.'\" It also forbids a Government relationship with the Lumbee and forbids them from applying through the BARS, the BIA administrative process to gain recognition. This restriction as to eligibility for services was a condition which tribal representatives agreed to at the time in order to achieve status as a recognized tribe and have the Lumbee name recognized. The Lumbee had essentially assimilated into early colonial life prior to the formation of the United States. They lived as individuals, as did any other colonial and U.S. citizens. Lumbee spokesmen repeatedly testified at these hearings that they were not seeking federal financial benefits; they said they only wanted a name designation as Lumbee people.\n\n===Petitioning for full federal recognition===\nIn 1987, the Lumbee petitioned the [[United States Department of the Interior]] for full federal recognition. This is a prerequisite to receive the financial benefits accorded federally recognized Native American tribes. The latter have generally been those tribes who had signed treaties with the federal government and had reservations established, and a history of a tribal relationship with the federal government.<ref>The petition's authors were [[Julian Pierce]], Cynthia Hunt-Locklear, Wes White, Jack Campisi and [[Arlinda Locklear]].</ref> The petition was denied because of the Lumbee Act.\n\nThe Lumbee resumed [[lobbying]] Congress, testifying in 1988, 1989, 1991 and 1993 in efforts to gain full federal recognition by congressional action.<ref name= draft>[http://www.indian.senate.gov/public/_files/Hicks071206.pdf DRAFT<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> All of these attempts failed in the face of opposition by the Department of Interior, the recognized [[Cherokee]] tribes (including North Carolina's [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]]), some of the North Carolina Congressional delegation, and some representatives from other states with federally recognized tribes.

The Lumbee abandoned the Lost Colony theory of origins in 1911, dropping \"Croatan\" from their tribal name, calling themselves the \"Indians of Robeson County.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Cherokee descent===\nThe proto Lumbee first began identifying as Cherokee Indians in 1915, when they changed their name to the \"Cherokee Indians of Robeson County.\" Four years earlier, they had changed their name from the \"Croatan Indians\" to the generic \"Indians of Robeson County.\" But the Cherokee occupied much further to the west and in the mountains during the colonial era.\n\nIn his unpublished 1934 master's thesis, graduate student Clifton Oxendine theorized that the Lumbee descended from [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Cherokee]]. Citing \"oral traditions,\" Oxendine suggested that the Lumbee were the descendants of Cherokee warriors who fought with the British under Colonel [[John Barnwell (colonist)|John Barnwell]] of South Carolina in the Tuscarora campaign of 1711\u20131713. He said the Cherokee settled in the swamps of Robeson County when the campaign ended, along with some Tuscarora captives.<ref>Oxendine, p. 4</ref>\n\nThe Oxendine theory of Cherokee origin has been uniformly rejected by mainstream scholars. First, no Cherokee warriors are listed in the record of Barnwell's company.<ref>Rights, pp. 54-55</ref> Second, the Lumbee do not speak Cherokee or any other Indian language. Third, Oxendine's claims of oral traditions are completely unsubstantiated; no such oral traditions survive or are documented by any other scholar.\n\nThe Lumbee have abandoned this theory in their documentation supporting their effort to obtain federal tribal recognition. The federally recognized [[Cherokee Nation]] categorically rejects any connection to the Lumbee, dismissing the Oxendine claims as \"absurd\" and disputing even that the Lumbee qualify as Native American.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Cheraw descent===\nShortly after abandoning the Croatan label and changing their name to the generic \"Indians of Robeson County\", the proto Lumbee seized on the speculations of Indian agent McPherson that they may be related to the defunct [[Cheraw]], a band of Siouan-speaking Indians that had been reduced by war and disease to 50 or 60 individuals by 1768.\n\nThe 1915 ''McPherson Report'' said in reference to the Cheraw (quoting the ''Handbook of American Indians'', 1906):\n\n<blockquote>Their numbers in 1715, according to Rivers, was 510, but this estimate probably included the Keyauwee. Being still subject to attack by the [[Iroquois]], they finally\u2014between 1726 and 1739\u2014became incorporated with the [[Catawba people|Catawba]]&nbsp;... They are mentioned as with the Catawba but speaking their own distinct dialect as late as 1743 (Adair). The last notice of them in 1768, when their remnant, reduced by war and disease to 50 or 60, were still living with the Catawba.<ref>''Handbook of American Indians'' (1906)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Catawba people|Catawba]] are a federally recognized tribe. The McPherson Report does not explain how or when the remaining four or five dozen Cheraw identified in 1768 separated from the Catawba and became the ancestors of the Lumbee.\n\n===Siouan descent===\nAfter repeated rejections under the Croatan, Cherokee and Cheraw labels, the proto Lumbee petitioned the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1924 for recognition as \"Siouan\" Indians. This petition was rejected largely on the grounds that Siouan was a language, not a tribe. Moreover, there was no record of the Lumbee or their ancestors having ever spoken the Siouan or any other Indian language.\n\n===Keyauwee descent===\nIn 1933, John Swanton wrote that the Siouan-speaking Keyauwee and Cheraw of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Carolina Piedmont]] were the most likely Indian ancestors of the people known from 1885 to 1912 as Croatan Indians and later as the Indians of Robeson County.<ref name=chavis>Chavis, Dean.

Communities are basically self-governing. One form of self-governance in the early 20th century was exhibited by a fraternal organization known as the Red Men's Lodge. By 1914, lodges existed in Prospect, Magnolia, Pembroke, Saddletree, Oxendine, and Union Chapel. Lodge members maintained social order, carried out ceremonies, marched in parades, and conducted funerals. The 1987 Lumbee Petition states that, \"[w]ith so many prominent leaders it is easy to understand how the lodges could maintain order and, at the same time, protect the tribal members from organized violence from whites in the area\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lumbeetribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=132&Itemid=97 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615063856/http://www.lumbeetribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=132&Itemid=97 |archivedate=2013-06-15 }}, Lumbee Tribe website</ref>\n\n===Lumbee patchwork===\nLumbee patchwork is a traditional Lumbee craft.

In 1993, the Lumbee patchwork dress was recreated for Miss Lumbee Natascha Wagoner, who was chosen as the 8th [[Miss Indian America|Miss Indian USA]]. The dress, designed by Hayes Alan Locklear and sewn by Kat Littleturtle, set a standard for the Lumbee women and became a cultural symbol.\n\n===Religion===\nToday the Lumbee primarily practice Christianity, and attending church is an important social activity. Churches have Sunday schools, youth organizations, senior citizens' programs, Bible study programs, and choir practices. Gospel songs are popular. Ministers are highly respected.

But we do not know anything else as regards the Kapila with whom the said branch was associated. Further in the ''khilas'' of the Rgveda, one Kapila is mentioned along with some other sages.

Though the S\u0101\u1e43khya vehemently criticises the Vedic sacrifices, but thereby it does not totally set aside the validity of the Vedas.

But we do not know anything else as regards the Kapila with whom the said branch was associated. Further in the ''khilas'' of the Rgveda, one Kapila is mentioned along with some other sages.

Though the S\u0101\u1e43khya vehemently criticises the Vedic sacrifices, but thereby it does not totally set aside the validity of the Vedas.

It has been said that Buddha and Kapila were both atheists, and that Buddha borrowed his atheism from Kapila. But atheism is an indefinite term, and may mean very different things. In one sense, every Indian philosopher was an atheist, for they all perceived that the gods of the populace could not claim the attributes that belong to a Supreme Being (Absolute, the source of all that exists or seems to exist, [[Brahman]]). (...) Kapila, when accused of atheism, is not accused of denying the existence of an Absolute Being. He is accused of denying the existence of an [[Ishvara]].\n|Max Muller et al.|Studies in Buddhism<ref name=maxmuller9>Max Muller et al.

Knowledge, however, is the highest end (for which one strives). When all faults of the heart are cured (by acts), and when the felicity of Brahma becomes established in knowledge, benevolence, forgiveness, tranquillity, compassion, truthfulness, and candour, abstention from injury, absence of pride, modesty, renunciation, and abstention from work are attained. These constitute the path that lead to Brahman. By those one attains to what is the Highest.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n* \"Bhishma said (to [[Yudhishthira]]), 'Listen, O slayer of foes! The Sankhyas or followers of Kapila, who are conversant with all paths and endued with wisdom, say that there are five faults, O puissant one, in the human body. They are Desire and Wrath and Fear and Sleep and Breath. These faults are seen in the bodies of all embodied creatures. Those that are endued with wisdom cut the root of wrath with the aid of Forgiveness. Desire is cut off by casting off all purposes. By cultivation of the quality of Goodness (Sattwa) sleep is conquered, and Fear is conquered by cultivating Heedfulness. Breath is conquered by abstemiousness of diet.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Recognition==\nKapila, the founder of Samkhya, has been a highly revered sage in various schools of Hindu philosophy.
