{"title_page": "Anatomical terms of muscle", "text_new": "{{Anatomical terminology series}}\n'''[[Muscle]]s''' are described using unique [[anatomical terminology]] according to their actions and structure.\n\n==Types==\n\nThere are three types of muscle tissue in the human body: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac.\n\n===Skeletal muscle===\n[[Skeletal striated muscle]], or \"voluntary muscle\", primarily joins to bone with [[tendon]]s. Skeletal muscle enables movement of the bones of the [[human skeleton]] and maintains posture.<ref>[http://global.britannica.com/science/skeletal-muscle/ Skeletal Muscle]</ref>\n\n===Smooth muscle===\n[[Smooth muscle tissue]] is found in parts of the body where it conveys action without conscious intent. The majority of this type of muscle tissue is found in the [[digestive system|digestive]] and [[urinary system]]s where it acts by propelling forward food, [[chyme]], and feces in the former and urine in the latter. Other places smooth muscle can be found are within the [[uterus]], where it helps facilitate birth, and the [[eye]], where the [[pupillary sphincter]] controls [[pupil]] size.<ref>[http://global.britannica.com/science/smooth-muscle/ Smooth Muscle]</ref>\n\n===Cardiac muscle===\n[[Cardiac muscle]] is specific to the [[heart]]. It is also involuntary in its movement, and is additionally self-excitatory, contracting without outside stimuli.<ref>[http://global.britannica.com/science/muscle/Cardiac-muscle#ref524513/ Cardiac Muscle]</ref>\n\n==Actions of skeletal muscle==\nAs well as [[anatomical terms of motion]], which describe the motion made by a muscle, unique terminology is used to describe the action of a set of muscles.\n\n===Agonists and antagonists  {{anchor|Agonist|Antagonist}}===\nAgonist muscles and antagonist muscles refer to muscles that cause or inhibit a movement.\n\n''[[wikt:Agonist|Agonist]]'' muscles cause a movement to occur through their own activation.{{sfn|Taber|2001|pp=\"Agonist\"}} For example, the [[triceps brachii]] contracts, producing a shortening contraction, during the up phase of a push-up (elbow extension). During the down phase of a push-up, the same triceps brachii actively controls elbow flexion while producing a lengthening contraction. It is still the agonist, because while resisting gravity during relaxing, the triceps brachii continues to be the prime mover, or controller, of the joint action. Agonists are also interchangeably referred to as \"prime movers,\" since they are the muscles considered primarily responsible for generating or controlling a specific movement.\n\nAnother example is the dumbbell curl at the elbow. The \"elbow flexor\" group is the agonist, shortening during the lifting phase (elbow flexion). During the lowering phase the \"elbow flexor\" muscles lengthen, remaining the agonists because they are controlling the load and the movement (elbow extension). For both the lifting and lowering phase, the \"elbow extensor\" muscles are the antagonists (see below). They lengthen during the dumbbell lifting phase and shorten during the dumbbell lowering phase. Here it is important to understand that it is common practice to give a name to a muscle group (e.g. elbow flexors) based on the joint action they produce during a shortening (concentric) contraction. However, this naming convention does not mean they are only agonists during shortening. This term typically describes the function of [[skeletal muscle]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baechle|first=Thomas|title=Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning|year=2008|publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association|location=USA|isbn=978-0-7360-8465-9}}</ref>\n\n''[[wikt:Antagonist|Antagonist]]'' muscles are simply the muscles that produce an opposing joint torque to the agonist muscles.{{sfn|Taber|2001|pp=\"Antagonist\"}} This torque can aid in controlling a motion. The opposing torque can slow movement down - especially in the case of a ballistic movement. For example, during a very rapid (ballistic) discrete movement of the elbow, such as throwing a dart, the triceps muscles will be activated very briefly and strongly (in a \"burst\") to rapidly accelerate the extension movement at the elbow, followed almost immediately by a \"burst\" of activation to the elbow flexor muscles that decelerates the elbow movement to arrive at a quick stop. To use an automotive analogy, this would be similar to pressing your gas pedal rapidly and then immediately pressing the brake. Antagonism is not an intrinsic property of a particular muscle or muscle group; it is a role that a muscle plays depending on which muscle is currently the agonist. During slower joint actions that involve gravity, just as with the agonist muscle (mentioned above), the antagonist muscle can shorten and lengthen. Using the example above of the triceps brachii during a push-up, the elbow flexor muscles are the antagonists at the elbow during both the up phase and down phase of the movement. During the dumbbell curl, the elbow extensors are the antagonists for both the lifting and lowering phases.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Kenneth |title=Clinical Methods: The History, Physical, and Laboratory Examinations. 3rd edition. |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK396/ |website=ncbi |publisher=BUTTERWORTH}}</ref>\n\n===Agonist-antagonist pairs===\n[[File:Flexi\u00f3n del brazo.png|thumb|left|160px|The antagonistic pair of biceps and triceps working to flex the elbow.]]\nAntagonist and agonist muscles often occur in pairs, called ''antagonistic pairs''. As one muscle contracts, the other relaxes. An example of an antagonistic pair is the [[biceps]] and [[triceps]]; to contract, the triceps relaxes while the biceps contracts to lift the arm. \"Reverse motions\" need antagonistic pairs located in opposite sides of a joint or bone, including [[Anatomical terms of motion#Abduction adduction|abductor-adductor]] pairs and flexor-extensor pairs. These consist of an [[extensor muscle]], which \"opens\" the joint (by increasing the angle between the two bones) and a [[flexor muscle]], which does the opposite by decreasing the angle between two bones.\n\nHowever, muscles don't always work this way; sometimes agonists and antagonists contract at the same time to produce force, as per [[Lombard's paradox]]. Also, sometimes during a joint action controlled by an agonist muscle, the antagonist will be slightly activated, naturally. This occurs normally and is not considered to be a problem unless it is excessive or uncontrolled and disturbs the control of the joint action. This is called agonist/antagonist co-activation and serves to mechanically stiffen the joint.\n\nNot all muscles are paired in this way. An example of an exception is the [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=PURVES |first1=Augstine |title=Neural Ciructs |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11154/ |website=NCBI |publisher=Sinauer Association}}</ref>\n\n===Synergistic action{{Anchor|Synergist}}===\n[[File:Biceps Muscle CNX.jpg|thumb|The biceps brachii flexes the lower arm. The brachioradialis, in the forearm, and brachialis, located deep to the biceps in the upper arm, are both synergists that aid in this motion.]]\n\n''[[wikt:Synergism|Synergist]]'' muscles perform, or help perform, the same set of joint motion as the [[agonist (muscle)|agonists]]. Synergists muscles act on movable joints.  Synergists are sometimes referred to as \"neutralizers\" because they help cancel out, or neutralize, extra motion from the agonists to make sure that the force generated works within the desired plane of motion.\n\nMuscle fibers can only contract up to 40% of their fully stretched length. Thus the short fibers of [[pennate muscle]]s are more suitable where power rather than range of contraction is required. This limitation in the range of contraction affects all muscles, and those that act over several joints may be unable to shorten sufficiently to produce the full range of movement at all of them simultaneously (active insufficiency, e.g., the fingers cannot be fully flexed when the wrist is also flexed). Likewise, the opposing muscles may be unable to stretch sufficiently to allow such movement to take place (passive insufficiency). For both these reasons, it is often essential to use other muscles, called fixators or '''''synergists''''', in this type of action to fix certain of the joints so that others can be moved effectively, e.g., fixation of the wrist during full flexion of the fingers in clenching the fist. Synergists are muscles that facilitate the fixation action.\n\nThere is an important difference between a '''''helping synergist''''' muscle and a '''''true synergist''''' muscle. A true synergist muscle is one that only neutralizes an undesired joint action, whereas a helping synergist is one that neutralizes an undesired action but also assists with the desired action. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Neutralizer Action===\nA muscle that fixes or holds a bone so that the agonist can carry out the intended movement is said to have a neutralising action. A good famous example of this are the [[hamstrings]]; the [[semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]] and [[semimembranosus muscle]]s perform knee flexion and knee internal rotation whereas the [[biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]] carries out knee flexion and knee external rotation. For the knee to flex while not rotating in either direction, all three muscles contract to stabilize the knee while it moves in the desired way.\n\n====Composite muscle====\n''[[Composite muscle|Composite]]'' or ''hybrid'' muscles have more than one set of fibers that perform the same function, and are usually supplied by different nerves for different set of fibers. For example, the tongue itself is a composite muscle made up of various components like longitudinal, transverse, horizontal muscles with different parts innervated having different nerve supply.\n\n==Form==\n\n===Insertion and origin {{anchor|Insertion|Origin}}===\n[[File:Fascicle Muscle Shapes.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The seven general types of skeletal muscle]]\n\nThe ''[[wikt:insertion|insertion]]'' and ''[[wikt:origin|origin]]'' of a muscle are the two places where it is anchored, one at each end.

This can be reversed however, such as in a  [[chin up]] where the torso moves up to meet the arm.\n\n===== Insertion =====\nThe ''[[wikt:insertion|insertion]]'' of a muscle is the structure that it attaches to and tends to be moved by the [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] of the muscle. {{sfn|Taber|2001|loc=\"insertion\"}} This may be a [[bone]], a [[tendon]] or the subcutaneous dermal [[connective tissue]].

Bipennate muscle shortens less than unipennate muscle but develops greater tension when it does, translated into greater power but less range of motion. Pennate muscles generally also tire easily.

Marking Bateman's [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], the film stars Bateman as a middle-aged [[eighth grade#Canada and the United States|eighth grade]] dropout who enters the National Golden Quill Spelling Bee through a loophole. It also stars [[Kathryn Hahn]], [[Rohan Chand]], [[Ben Falcone]], [[Philip Baker Hall]], and [[Allison Janney]].\n\nDodge's screenplay for ''Bad Words'' was featured on the 2011 [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] and was shortly thereafter picked up by Bateman. In the original script, the story was set at the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]], but the name was changed to a fictional bee since the filmmakers did not expect Scripps to allow the use of their name in the film. After two other actors declined to play the main character, Bateman decided to take on the role himself, and cast the other roles by a combination of contacting friends and open casting calls. Filming took place in Los Angeles at the end of 2012.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2013, and had a limited release in the United States on March 14, 2014, expanding to a wide release on March 28. Produced for $10 million, it earned $7.8 million at the theatrical box office. It received mixed to positive reviews from critics: some enjoyed the humor and direction, while others found the main character unlikeable and the humor offensive.\n\n==Plot==\nForty-year-old Guy Trilby discovers a loophole in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee which stipulates that participants must have not graduated from the eighth grade, allowing him to enter since he dropped out of middle school. He attends and wins a regional spelling bee, and progresses to the national competition after confrontations with both the parents of children and the spelling bee hosts. He is accompanied by Jenny Widgeon, a relatively unknown journalist hoping to make a story out of his participation in the bee. On the flight to the national spelling bee, Guy meets Chaitanya Chopra, a 10-year-old entrant in the bee who persistently attempts to befriend Guy. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, Guy meets the director of the spelling bee, Dr. Bernice Deagan, who expresses anger at his participation in the bee and places him and his reporter in a cheap hotel. Guy learns that Chaitanya is staying in the same hotel, and takes him out one night to expose Chaitanya to the wilder side of life: stealing food, drinking, and hiring a prostitute to briefly \"flash\" Chaitanya.\n\nIn the bee, Guy actively tries to distract and disconcert his fellow competitors, at one point insinuating that he was sleeping with another contestant's mother. Despite Dr. Deagan's tampering with the word list to give Guy the most difficult words, he spells long, complicated words with relative ease, impressing and angering both parents and staff at the spelling bee, including the event's founder, Dr. William Bowman. However, the parents petition for his disqualification and the resignation of Deagan. While researching Guy's background, Jenny discovers that Bowman is Guy's father. She reveals this to him and he admits that his prime motivation for entering the bee was to embarrass his father in revenge for abandoning him and his mother when he was a child. Soon before the final stage of the bee, Guy overhears Chaitanya and his father discussing his strategy to win, which is to befriend Guy so that he will allow Chaitanya to win out of guilt. Guy storms into the room and ends his friendship with Chaitanya, despite Chaitanya's pleas that he genuinely wanted to be friends. They later sabotage each other: Guy burns Chaitanya's study book, \"Todd,\" and Chaitanya calls the LAPD and accuses Guy of kidnapping a young girl.\n\nMeanwhile, only ten competitors remain in the bee, and the pool is gradually reduced to just Guy and Chaitanya. When a contestant's mother attacks Guy verbally and is subdued by the police on live television, Bowman is forced to intervene, to his embarrassment. Having accomplished his goal, Guy deliberately misspells a word in an effort to let Chaitanya win. To prove his friendship, Chaitanya also misspells his word, and they soon begin to argue. This escalates into a physical fight, and when Bowman attempts to intervene, Chaitanya accidentally hits him with a chair. Although the bee is briefly halted, Bowman allows it to continue after deciding that both Guy and Chaitanya acted in an equally embarrassing manner. Their standoff of deliberately misspelling words continues until Guy intentionally misspells Chaitanya's word so that Chaitanya corrects him, thus causing Chaitanya to win the bee inadvertently. As Guy leaves, content, Chaitanya offers to give him half the winnings and names him co-winner of the bee. Guy writes a note to Bowman explaining his actions, which Bowman refuses to read until Guy reveals himself to be his son, and returns home. He resolves his conflict with Chaitanya by buying an old police car from an auction with his share of the winnings, and helping Chaitanya to chase down his school bullies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Guy Trilby\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Jenny Widgeon\n* [[Rohan Chand]] as Chaitanya Chopra\n* [[Ben Falcone]] as Pete Fowler\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Dr. William Bowman\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Dr. Bernice Deagan\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as Eric Tai's Mother\n* [[Judith Hoag]] as Petal Dubois\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Irene\n* [[Patricia Belcher]] as Ingrid\n* [[Anjul Nigam]] as Sriram\n* Michael Patrick McGill as Beet-Red Father\n* [[Bob Stephenson (actor)|Bob Stephenson]] as Bill Murhoff\n* [[Steve Witting]] as Proctor\n* [[Greg Cromer]] as Jeremy\n* [[Ethan Dizon]] as Ricky Irvine\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:JasonBateman-adjusted.jpg|right|thumb|Jason Bateman directed ''Bad Words'' and cast himself in the main role.]]\nAndrew Dodge's screenplay for ''Bad Words'' first received attention after its inclusion on the 2011 [[The Black List (survey)|Black List]], an annual survey of the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web|last=Finke|first=Nikki|title=The Black List 2011: Screenplay Roster|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/12/the-black-list-2011-screenplay-roster/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|accessdate=November 4, 2013|date=December 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/17/280673991/jason-bateman-taking-a-turn-as-the-big-bad|work=[[All Things Considered]]|first=Audie|last=Cornish|title=Jason Bateman, Taking A Turn As The Big Bad|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=March 17, 2014|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> The script was sent to actor [[Jason Bateman]], who had asked his agent to pursue directorial work, explaining that being able to direct films was \"really the only reason I've been acting for the last 20 years of this career\".<ref name=thr>{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Tatiana|title=Toronto: Jason Bateman on His Directorial Debut, 'Bad Words,' and Why He Cast Himself (Q&A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/toronto-bad-words-jason-bateman-622520|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=November 4, 2013|date=September 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter Bateman signed on to direct the film, he and Dodge spent a long time revising the script, particularly adjusting parts where the dark humor \"went a little bit too far\".<ref name=rogue>{{cite web|url=http://www.iamrogue.com/news/interviews/item/10853-iar-interview-jason-bateman-talks-bad-words.html|work=I Am Rogue|date=March 11, 2014|first=Jami|last=Philbrick|title= IAR INTERVIEW: Jason Bateman Talks 'Bad Words' |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> In the original script, the story was intended to take place at the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The setting was changed to the fictional Golden Quill Spelling Bee in [[Los Angeles]] since Bateman did not expect to receive permission from Scripps to use their name in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vagabuzz.com/badwordslocation |title=Jason Bateman Chose L.A.

It received mixed to positive reviews from critics: some enjoyed the humor and direction, while others found the main character unlikeable and the humor offensive.\n\n==Plot==\nForty-year-old Guy Trilby discovers a loophole in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee which stipulates that participants must have not graduated from the eighth grade, allowing him to enter since he dropped out of middle school. He attends and wins a regional spelling bee, and progresses to the national competition after confrontations with both the parents of children and the spelling bee hosts. He is accompanied by Jenny Widgeon, a relatively unknown journalist hoping to make a story out of his participation in the bee. On the flight to the national spelling bee, Guy meets Chaitanya Chopra, a 10-year-old entrant in the bee who persistently attempts to befriend Guy. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, Guy meets the director of the spelling bee, Dr. Bernice Deagan, who expresses anger at his participation in the bee and places him and his reporter in a cheap hotel. Guy learns that Chaitanya is staying in the same hotel, and takes him out one night to expose Chaitanya to the wilder side of life: stealing food, drinking, and hiring a prostitute to briefly \"flash\" Chaitanya.\n\nIn the bee, Guy actively tries to distract and disconcert his fellow competitors, at one point insinuating that he was sleeping with another contestant's mother. Despite Dr. Deagan's tampering with the word list to give Guy the most difficult words, he spells long, complicated words with relative ease, impressing and angering both parents and staff at the spelling bee, including the event's founder, Dr. William Bowman. However, the parents petition for his disqualification and the resignation of Deagan. While researching Guy's background, Jenny discovers that Bowman is Guy's father. She reveals this to him and he admits that his prime motivation for entering the bee was to embarrass his father in revenge for abandoning him and his mother when he was a child. Soon before the final stage of the bee, Guy overhears Chaitanya and his father discussing his strategy to win, which is to befriend Guy so that he will allow Chaitanya to win out of guilt. Guy storms into the room and ends his friendship with Chaitanya, despite Chaitanya's pleas that he genuinely wanted to be friends. They later sabotage each other: Guy burns Chaitanya's study book, \"Todd,\" and Chaitanya calls the LAPD and accuses Guy of kidnapping a young girl.\n\nMeanwhile, only ten competitors remain in the bee, and the pool is gradually reduced to just Guy and Chaitanya. When a contestant's mother attacks Guy verbally and is subdued by the police on live television, Bowman is forced to intervene, to his embarrassment. Having accomplished his goal, Guy deliberately misspells a word in an effort to let Chaitanya win. To prove his friendship, Chaitanya also misspells his word, and they soon begin to argue. This escalates into a physical fight, and when Bowman attempts to intervene, Chaitanya accidentally hits him with a chair. Although the bee is briefly halted, Bowman allows it to continue after deciding that both Guy and Chaitanya acted in an equally embarrassing manner. Their standoff of deliberately misspelling words continues until Guy intentionally misspells Chaitanya's word so that Chaitanya corrects him, thus causing Chaitanya to win the bee inadvertently. As Guy leaves, content, Chaitanya offers to give him half the winnings and names him co-winner of the bee. Guy writes a note to Bowman explaining his actions, which Bowman refuses to read until Guy reveals himself to be his son, and returns home. He resolves his conflict with Chaitanya by buying an old police car from an auction with his share of the winnings, and helping Chaitanya to chase down his school bullies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Guy Trilby\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Jenny Widgeon\n* [[Rohan Chand]] as Chaitanya Chopra\n* [[Ben Falcone]] as Pete Fowler\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Dr. William Bowman\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Dr. Bernice Deagan\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as Eric Tai's Mother\n* [[Judith Hoag]] as Petal Dubois\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Irene\n* [[Patricia Belcher]] as Ingrid\n* [[Anjul Nigam]] as Sriram\n* Michael Patrick McGill as Beet-Red Father\n* [[Bob Stephenson (actor)|Bob Stephenson]] as Bill Murhoff\n* [[Steve Witting]] as Proctor\n* [[Greg Cromer]] as Jeremy\n* [[Ethan Dizon]] as Ricky Irvine\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:JasonBateman-adjusted.jpg|right|thumb|Jason Bateman directed ''Bad Words'' and cast himself in the main role.]]\nAndrew Dodge's screenplay for ''Bad Words'' first received attention after its inclusion on the 2011 [[The Black List (survey)|Black List]], an annual survey of the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web|last=Finke|first=Nikki|title=The Black List 2011: Screenplay Roster|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/12/the-black-list-2011-screenplay-roster/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|accessdate=November 4, 2013|date=December 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/17/280673991/jason-bateman-taking-a-turn-as-the-big-bad|work=[[All Things Considered]]|first=Audie|last=Cornish|title=Jason Bateman, Taking A Turn As The Big Bad|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=March 17, 2014|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> The script was sent to actor [[Jason Bateman]], who had asked his agent to pursue directorial work, explaining that being able to direct films was \"really the only reason I've been acting for the last 20 years of this career\".<ref name=thr>{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Tatiana|title=Toronto: Jason Bateman on His Directorial Debut, 'Bad Words,' and Why He Cast Himself (Q&A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/toronto-bad-words-jason-bateman-622520|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=November 4, 2013|date=September 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter Bateman signed on to direct the film, he and Dodge spent a long time revising the script, particularly adjusting parts where the dark humor \"went a little bit too far\".<ref name=rogue>{{cite web|url=http://www.iamrogue.com/news/interviews/item/10853-iar-interview-jason-bateman-talks-bad-words.html|work=I Am Rogue|date=March 11, 2014|first=Jami|last=Philbrick|title= IAR INTERVIEW: Jason Bateman Talks 'Bad Words' |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> In the original script, the story was intended to take place at the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The setting was changed to the fictional Golden Quill Spelling Bee in [[Los Angeles]] since Bateman did not expect to receive permission from Scripps to use their name in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vagabuzz.com/badwordslocation |title=Jason Bateman Chose L.A.

It is programmed by its in-house production studio, [[Williams Street]]. It currently broadcasts nightly from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]. The block is marketed as a separate network from Cartoon Network for ratings purposes, similar to [[Nickelodeon]] On Thursday-Saturday. the nighttime branding of [[Nick at Nite|Nick At Nite]].\n\nDebuting in 2001, Adult Swim serves as the nighttime identity of Cartoon Network, and was established as alternative programming during the late night hours when Cartoon Network's primary target audience, children between the ages of 7 and 15, would normally be sleeping. In 2005, the block was granted its own [[Nielsen ratings]] report from Cartoon Network due to targeting a separate demographic. The block features stylistically varied animated and live-action shows; including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series, [[anime]], [[original video animation]], and [[short film]]s with generally minimal or no editing for content.\n\nThe block has frequently aired [[adult animation]] features, [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]], [[sketch comedy]], and [[Television pilot|pilots]]. The block's shows are known for their sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. Many of its programs are aesthetically [[experimental]], transgressive, improvised, and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] in nature. This has become a source of conflict, with some saying that Adult Swim is too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in [[absurdity|absurd]] and [[shock value|shock]] comedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|title=Thinking small|website=Channelweb.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105222547/http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|archive-date=January 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs with Cartoon Network, Adult Swim's reach through various services totals 94 million American households.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|title=Cable network coverage area household universe estimates: January 2016 \u2013 Broadcasting & Cable|website=Broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=November 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202182549/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|archive-date=December 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Creation and development ===\n{{See also|Space Ghost Coast to Coast}}\n[[Cartoon Network]]'s original head programmer, [[Mike Lazzo]], conceived<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|title=Frederator Studios Blogs \u2013 Fred Seibert's Blog \u2013 Dinner at [adult swim].|website=Archives.frederatorblogs.com|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630142003/http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Adult Swim. The block grew out of Cartoon Network's previous attempts at airing content appropriate for teenagers and young adults who might be watching the channel after 11 pm (ET/PT). The network began experimenting with its late night programming by airing anthology shows that presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts, such as ''[[ToonHeads]]'', ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]'', ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[Late Night Black and White]]'', and ''[[O Canada (TV series)|O Canada]]''. Another block, [[Toonami]]'s \"Midnight Run\", aired the network's action programming uncut with minimal edits.

That was followed by the ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' episode [[List of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! episodes|\"Tommy\"]], which featured the star and director of the film [[Tommy Wiseau]].\n* In 2010, Adult Swim re-aired ''The Room'' for a second year in a row, with bumps featuring [[Tommy Wiseau]] being interviewed on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''. Sex scenes remained censored, but the [[TV Parental Guidelines|parental rating]] was raised to TV-MA.\n* In 2011, ''The Room'' was aired once again with the TV-MA rating and was followed by a 15-minute special titled ''Earth Ghost'', a CGI version of the ''Lowe Country'' pilot shown on [[Adult Swim Video]] in 2007.\n* In 2012, Adult Swim replaced its lineup with [[Toonami]], a former programming block from [[Cartoon Network]]. After first playing the opening sequence of ''The Room'', the scene switched to the Toonami host T.O.M. noting that it was April Fools' Day before introducing that week's scheduled episode of ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]''. The Toonami bumps and programming would continue throughout the night, featuring ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!

T.O.M. also presented a review of ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured.

The episode \"[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]\" aired repeatedly from 8pm until midnight on TV (shortening [[Toonami]] in the process and pre-empting premieres of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''), and was also streaming on a loop on the adultswim.com streams all night. The bumps included new commissioned idents related to ''Rick and Morty'' and announcement promos of upcoming shows and seasons.\n* On March 31, 2018, Toonami premiered the first episode of ''[[FLCL|FLCL Alternative]]'', the show's third season (even as the second season had not been aired yet), albeit in Japanese with English subtitles, breaking Toonami's policy of only playing dubbed anime. Following ''FLCL'', the 2004 film ''[[Mind Game (film)|Mind Game]]'', directed by [[Masaaki Yuasa]], was played. Most of Toonami's scheduled programming for that night (featuring ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders]], [[Hunter \u00d7 Hunter]], [[Naruto: Shippuden (season 10)|Naruto: Shippuden]], [[Space Dandy]], [[Cowboy Bebop]] & [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG]]'') were pushed back to 2:45&nbsp;a.m. after the film, and aired subbed instead of dubbed. The short ''Scavengers'' finished off the block at 5:45&nbsp;a.m. The block aired special bumpers with T.O.M. and S.A.R.A. and a game review of ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', all dubbed to Japanese with English subtitles and pink colors instead of the usual green. The Adult Swim logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as [\u30a2\u30c0\u30eb\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30e0]), affecting both bumps and the channel bug. Block runner Jason DeMarco confirmed on Twitter that all original scheduled programming that was affected by the English subtitled joke after ''Mind Game'' would air the same episode dubbed the following week.\n* On April 1, 2018, in yet another rare double prank, Adult Swim aired normally until 11:00&nbsp;p.m., when it started airing an animated parody of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' titled \"Bushworld Adventures\", created by Michael R. Cusack.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adult Swim|title=Bushworld Adventures {{!}} Adult Swim|date=2018-04-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|accessdate=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406054404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|archive-date=April 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It follows Rick and Morty in [[Australia]] going on wild adventures in search to find the green cube that was left at Bendigo. It looped three more times until midnight, pre-empting ''Rick and Morty'' and two ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]'' reruns in the process. All of Adult Swim's nature-themed bumpers that aired throughout the hour were Australian-themed. This special short was also simulcasted on a loop in a marathon stream on adultswim.com all night.\n* In 2019, regular programming was replaced, beginning at midnight, with the debut of ''[[G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu]]'', an anime parody that aired until 5:45am, when an episode of ''[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]]'' played as a buffer between it and Cartoon Network's sign-on at 6am. It was simulcast both on TV and on Adult Swim's online live stream. It additionally served as the premiere series for the new 24/7 [[Adult Swim (Canada)|Adult Swim]] network in [[Canada]].\n* In 2020, regular programming was replaced again. The intro for a second season of ''G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu'' was played, but it would be interrupted by [[Post Malone]], who would host several bumpers (along with [[Swae Lee]] later on in the block) introducing stealth premieres of new seasons of ''[[Primal (TV series)|Primal]]'', ''[[Dream Corp, LLC]]'', ''[[Tigtone]]'', ''[[The Shivering Truth]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Lazor Wulf]]'', ''[[12 Oz. Mouse]]'' and ''[[Tender Touches]]''. The stealth premiere block also showcased pilots of new shows ''YOLO: Crystal Fantasy'', ''JJ Villard's Fairy Tales'' and ''Smiling Friends''. Malone would also make silent cameos on said shows via green screen.<ref>https://comicbook.com/anime/2020/04/01/adult-swim-april-fools-day-primal-new-episodes-reaction/</ref>\n\n=== Alternate reality games ===\n[[File:Adult Swim ARG first transmission from Delilah Aug 2017.png|thumb|right|alt=A black screen with the text \"Hello my name is D.E.L.I.L.A.H.\"|Image from part of the ARG transmission that aired on August 27, 2017.

This new account informed everyone that they were searching for their missing sister named Amelia. The bump transmissions then started referring viewers to this new Twitter account as well as several new [[Instagram]] accounts, continuing to provide puzzles that required solving. Some players have used [[Discord (software)|Discord]] to work together as a team in a dedicated server to solve the puzzles and share theories about the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discord.gg/HtGAT5T|title=Discord \u2013 Free voice and text chat for gamers|website=Discord|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref> The ARG has been consistently broadcasting new messages and puzzles every Sunday since the initial August 2017 broadcast, with only a short hiatus during the 2017 holiday break. On March 25, 2018 it was revealed that Amelia was safe and had been for quite some time. Players learned that Amelia's messages asking for help were actually sent 3 years prior and that their delay in being received was caused by [[time dilation]]. This revelation effectively completed the second chapter of the ARG, it also alluded to the next phase which has just started as of June 2018.\n\n== Programming ==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim|List of programs broadcast by Toonami}}\nOriginal shows currently in-production and seen on Adult Swim include ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'', ''[[Black Jesus (TV series)|Black Jesus]]'', ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', and ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]''. Adult Swim is best known for its inaugural slate of programming, which were parodies and remakes based on [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons (including ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law]]'' and ''[[Sealab 2021]]'').\n\nAdult Swim also airs [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs acquired from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] (such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''), original series produced for sister network [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] (''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Final Space]]''), and acquired and co-produced [[anime]] series. Adult Swim is currently one of the only networks in the United States that airs anime (besides [[Disney XD]]) and the only network that airs such programming aimed at young adults and teens rather than children.\n\nCurrently, anime and most [[Action film|action]]-genre programming air every Saturday night as part of [[Toonami]], a former Cartoon Network programming block that was relaunched as part of Adult Swim on May 26, 2012 as a \"block-within-a-block\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Cartoon Network shows that have gained a following among older viewers have also aired on Toonami; in particular, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' proved popular enough in reruns to warrant a [[Samurai Jack (season 5)|revival]] in 2017.

In June 2010, they began delaying episode availability on Adult Swim Video by one week after original television broadcast. Previously, episodes had appeared 1\u20133 days after broadcast.

Currently apps are available in the [[United States|U.S. only]] for the [[Amazon Fire TV]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (including [[Android TV]]), [[Apple TV]], [[iOS]], [[Chromecast]], [[Roku]] and [[Xbox One]]. Due to licensing agreements certain parts of the apps including access to the live stream and past shows require the viewer to use their subscription-television provider or OTT-platform username and password to authenticate their right to access such content. A downside to these apps is the fact that, unlike free-to-air television, they are not currently compliant with U.S. [[Closed captioning]] requirements.\n\n== International ==\n[[File:Mapa Adult Swim.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=World map with the United States, Canada, Brazil, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Russia, Tasmania, and New Zealand highlighted.|Adult Swim's international channel availability.]]\nAdult Swim has been actively expanding its reach across the world since 2005.

It is programmed by its in-house production studio, [[Williams Street]]. It currently broadcasts nightly from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]. The block is marketed as a separate network from Cartoon Network for ratings purposes, similar to [[Nickelodeon]] On Thursday-Saturday. the nighttime branding of [[Nick at Nite|Nick At Nite]].\n\nDebuting in 2001, Adult Swim serves as the nighttime identity of Cartoon Network, and was established as alternative programming during the late night hours when Cartoon Network's primary target audience, children between the ages of 7 and 15, would normally be sleeping. In 2005, the block was granted its own [[Nielsen ratings]] report from Cartoon Network due to targeting a separate demographic. The block features stylistically varied animated and live-action shows; including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series, [[anime]], [[original video animation]], and [[short film]]s with generally minimal or no editing for content.\n\nThe block has frequently aired [[adult animation]] features, [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]], [[sketch comedy]], and [[Television pilot|pilots]]. The block's shows are known for their sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. Many of its programs are aesthetically [[experimental]], transgressive, improvised, and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] in nature. This has become a source of conflict, with some saying that Adult Swim is too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in [[absurdity|absurd]] and [[shock value|shock]] comedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|title=Thinking small|website=Channelweb.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105222547/http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|archive-date=January 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs with Cartoon Network, Adult Swim's reach through various services totals 94 million American households.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|title=Cable network coverage area household universe estimates: January 2016 \u2013 Broadcasting & Cable|website=Broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=November 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202182549/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|archive-date=December 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Creation and development ===\n{{See also|Space Ghost Coast to Coast}}\n[[Cartoon Network]]'s original head programmer, [[Mike Lazzo]], conceived<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|title=Frederator Studios Blogs \u2013 Fred Seibert's Blog \u2013 Dinner at [adult swim].|website=Archives.frederatorblogs.com|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630142003/http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Adult Swim. The block grew out of Cartoon Network's previous attempts at airing content appropriate for teenagers and young adults who might be watching the channel after 11 pm (ET/PT). The network began experimenting with its late night programming by airing anthology shows that presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts, such as ''[[ToonHeads]]'', ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]'', ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[Late Night Black and White]]'', and ''[[O Canada (TV series)|O Canada]]''. Another block, [[Toonami]]'s \"Midnight Run\", aired the network's action programming uncut with minimal edits.

Sex scenes remained censored, but the [[TV Parental Guidelines|parental rating]] was raised to TV-MA.\n* In 2011, ''The Room'' was aired once again with the TV-MA rating and was followed by a 15-minute special titled ''Earth Ghost'', a CGI version of the ''Lowe Country'' pilot shown on [[Adult Swim Video]] in 2007.\n* In 2012, Adult Swim replaced its lineup with [[Toonami]], a former programming block from [[Cartoon Network]]. After first playing the opening sequence of ''The Room'', the scene switched to the Toonami host T.O.M. noting that it was April Fools' Day before introducing that week's scheduled episode of ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]''. The Toonami bumps and programming would continue throughout the night, featuring ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!

T.O.M. also presented a review of ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured.

The live all-nighter featured special guest [[Trixie Mattel]], Zach White, a guitar music performance and several confused call-ins.\n* In 2016, advertisements were shown for the April Fools' broadcast, recapping their 12-year history of pranks and hyping up that year's prank.<ref name=\":1\">{{Citation|last=Bad Man|title=Adult Swim \u2013 April Fools Promo 2016|date=2016-04-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSTAj51tikg|accessdate=2017-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410173827/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSTAj51tikg|archive-date=April 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> When midnight did occur, regular programming played, with the implication being that the prank for 2016 was that there was no prank.\n* On March 31, 2017, all the regularly scheduled episodes after midnight had a weird audio mix, including added laugh tracks, ''[[Seinfeld]]'' stings, robotic and pitch-shifted filters added to particular voices, various sound effects and alternate musical pieces.<ref>{{Citation|last=Promos & Bumpers & More|title=Adult Swim {{!}} April Fools Day Prank (2017) {{!}} Compilation #1|date=2017-04-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DT1PYuKmOk|accessdate=2017-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410172739/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DT1PYuKmOk|archive-date=April 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* On April 1, 2017, in another rare double prank, the evening portion of Adult Swim was replaced with the unannounced ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' Season 3 premiere. The episode \"[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]\" aired repeatedly from 8pm until midnight on TV (shortening [[Toonami]] in the process and pre-empting premieres of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''), and was also streaming on a loop on the adultswim.com streams all night. The bumps included new commissioned idents related to ''Rick and Morty'' and announcement promos of upcoming shows and seasons.\n* On March 31, 2018, Toonami premiered the first episode of ''[[FLCL|FLCL Alternative]]'', the show's third season (even as the second season had not been aired yet), albeit in Japanese with English subtitles, breaking Toonami's policy of only playing dubbed anime. Following ''FLCL'', the 2004 movie ''[[Mind Game (film)|Mind Game]]'', directed by [[Masaaki Yuasa]], was played. Most of Toonami's scheduled programming for that night (featuring ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders]], [[Hunter x Hunter]], [[Naruto: Shippuden (season 10)|Naruto: Shippuden]], [[Space Dandy]], [[Cowboy Bebop]] & [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG]]'') were pushed back to 2:45&nbsp;a.m. after the movie, and aired subbed instead of dubbed. The short ''Scavengers'' finished off the block at 5:45&nbsp;a.m. The block aired special bumpers with T.O.M. and S.A.R.A. and a game review of ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', all dubbed to Japanese with English subtitles and pink colors instead of the usual green. The Adult Swim logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as [\u30a2\u30c0\u30eb\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30e0]), affecting both bumps and the channel bug. Block runner Jason DeMarco confirmed on Twitter that all original scheduled programming that was affected by the English subtitled joke after ''Mind Game'' would air the same episode dubbed the following week.\n* On April 1, 2018, in yet another rare double prank, Adult Swim aired normally until 11:00&nbsp;p.m., when it started airing an animated parody of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' titled \"Bushworld Adventures\", created by Michael R. Cusack.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adult Swim|title=Bushworld Adventures {{!}} Adult Swim|date=2018-04-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|accessdate=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406054404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|archive-date=April 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It follows Rick and Morty in [[Australia]] going on wild adventures in search to find the green cube that was left at Bendigo. It looped three more times until midnight, pre-empting ''Rick and Morty'' and two ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]'' reruns in the process. All of Adult Swim's nature-themed bumpers that aired throughout the hour were Australian-themed. This special short was also simulcasted on a loop in a marathon stream on adultswim.com all night.\n* In 2019, regular programming was replaced, beginning at midnight, with the debut of ''[[G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu]]'', an anime parody that aired until 5:45am, when an episode of ''[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]]'' played as a buffer between it and Cartoon Network's sign-on at 6am. It was simulcast both on TV and on Adult Swim's online live stream. It additionally served as the premiere series for the new 24/7 [[Adult Swim (Canada)|Adult Swim]] network in [[Canada]].\n* In 2020, regular programming was replaced again. The intro for a second season of ''G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu'' was played, but it would be interrupted by [[Post Malone]], who would host several bumpers (along with [[Swae Lee]] later on in the block) introducing stealth premieres of new seasons of ''[[Primal (TV series)|Primal]]'', ''[[Dream Corp, LLC]]'', ''[[Tigtone]]'', ''[[The Shivering Truth]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Lazor Wulf]]'', ''[[12 Oz. Mouse]]'' and ''[[Tender Touches]]''. The stealth premiere block also showcased pilots of new shows ''YOLO: Crystal Fantasy'', ''JJ Villard's Fairy Tales'' and ''Smiling Friends''. Malone would also make silent cameos on said shows via green screen.<ref>https://comicbook.com/anime/2020/04/01/adult-swim-april-fools-day-primal-new-episodes-reaction/</ref>\n\n=== Alternate reality games ===\n[[File:Adult Swim ARG first transmission from Delilah Aug 2017.png|thumb|right|alt=A black screen with the text \"Hello my name is D.E.L.I.L.A.H.\"|Image from part of the ARG transmission that aired on August 27, 2017.

This new account informed everyone that they were searching for their missing sister named Amelia. The bump transmissions then started referring viewers to this new Twitter account as well as several new [[Instagram]] accounts, continuing to provide puzzles that required solving. Some players have used [[Discord (software)|Discord]] to work together as a team in a dedicated server to solve the puzzles and share theories about the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discord.gg/HtGAT5T|title=Discord \u2013 Free voice and text chat for gamers|website=Discord|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref> The ARG has been consistently broadcasting new messages and puzzles every Sunday since the initial August 2017 broadcast, with only a short hiatus during the 2017 holiday break. On March 25, 2018 it was revealed that Amelia was safe and had been for quite some time. Players learned that Amelia's messages asking for help were actually sent 3 years prior and that their delay in being received was caused by [[time dilation]]. This revelation effectively completed the second chapter of the ARG, it also alluded to the next phase which has just started as of June 2018.\n\n== Programming ==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim|List of programs broadcast by Toonami}}\nOriginal shows currently in-production and seen on Adult Swim include ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'', ''[[Black Jesus (TV series)|Black Jesus]]'', ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', and ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]''. Adult Swim is best known for its inaugural slate of programming, which were parodies and remakes based on [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons (including ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law]]'' and ''[[Sealab 2021]]'').\n\nAdult Swim also airs [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs acquired from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] (such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''), original series produced for sister network [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] (''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Final Space]]''), and acquired and co-produced [[anime]] series. Adult Swim is currently one of the only networks in the United States that airs anime (besides [[Disney XD]]) and the only network that airs such programming aimed at young adults and teens rather than children.\n\nCurrently, anime and most [[Action film|action]]-genre programming air every Saturday night as part of [[Toonami]], a former Cartoon Network programming block that was relaunched as part of Adult Swim on May 26, 2012 as a \"block-within-a-block\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Cartoon Network shows that have gained a following among older viewers have also aired on Toonami; in particular, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' proved popular enough in reruns to warrant a [[Samurai Jack (season 5)|revival]] in 2017.

In June 2010, they began delaying episode availability on Adult Swim Video by one week after original television broadcast. Previously, episodes had appeared 1\u20133 days after broadcast.

Currently apps are available in the [[United States|U.S. only]] for the [[Amazon Fire TV]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (including [[Android TV]]), [[Apple TV]], [[iOS]], [[Chromecast]], [[Roku]] and [[Xbox One]]. Due to licensing agreements certain parts of the apps including access to the live stream and past shows require the viewer to use their subscription-television provider or OTT-platform username and password to authenticate their right to access such content. A downside to these apps is the fact that, unlike free-to-air television, they are not currently compliant with U.S. [[Closed captioning]] requirements.\n\n== International ==\n[[File:Mapa Adult Swim.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=World map with the United States, Canada, Brazil, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Russia, Tasmania, and New Zealand highlighted.|Adult Swim's international channel availability.]]\nAdult Swim has been actively expanding its reach across the world since 2005.
