The names of her siblings are recorded on her father's tomb at [[St Laurence's Church, Upton-cum-Chalvey]].<ref>Frederic Madden, ''Collectanea Topographica Et Genealogica'', vol. 5 (London, 1838), p. 213: George Lipscombe, ''The History and Antiquities of the County of Buckingham'', vol. 4 (London, 1847), p. 475.</ref>\n\nDorothy's eldest sister Elizabeth (1575-1631) married the lawyer [[James Whitelocke]] in 1602. Another sister Anne Bulstrode (d. 1611) married the lawyer John Searle (1569-1622) in 1609.

They had a family connection to Lady Bedford's Harington family through their aunt Cecily Bulstrode who married her grandfather [[Robert Keilway]].\n\nShe married in 1609 or 1610, [[John Eyre (died 1639)|Sir John Eyre]] (1580-39), or \"Ayres\" of [[Great Chalfield Manor]], Wiltshire.<ref name=hist>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/eyre-sir-john-1580-1639 EYRE, Sir John (1580-1639), of Great Chalfield, Wilts.; later of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, Mdx.] ''[[The History of Parliament]]''. Retrieved 1 December 2017.</ref> After her marriage, Dorothy was known as \"Lady Eyre\" or \"Lady Ayres\". James Whitelocke, recalling the events of 1611, recorded that Eyre and Bulstrode were married without the consent of either family, and wrote, \"the man is one of the most dissolute, unjust, and vicious reprobates that lives upon the face of the earth\".<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 16-18, 25-6.</ref>\n\nThe queen gave presents of clothing to her gentlewomen, and gave Dorothy, \"Lady Eayres\", a gown of ash-colour taffeta on 4 July 1610 and a black satin gown on 14 October 1610.<ref>Jemma Field, [https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/cost.2017.0003 'The Wardrobe Goods of Anna of Denmark', ''Costume'', 51:1 (March, 2017), p. 21], & supplement nos. 23, 333, 384.</ref>\n\nIn 1611 Eyre attempted to murder [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Sir Edward Herbert]], whom he suspected of having an affair with his wife Dorothy Bulstrode. Herbert, two years earlier, had written an epitaph for Dorothy's sister Cecily. In his autobiography he describes his encounter with \"Sir John Ayres\" in detail. According to Herbert, [[Anne of Denmark]] obtained his portrait by [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]] and Dorothy had it copied in miniature by [[Isaac Oliver]], and she wore it in a gold locket concealed to view.<ref>James Lees-Milne, 'Two Portraits at Charlecote Park by William Larkin', ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 94, No. 597 (Dec., 1952), pp. 352-6.</ref> Herbert wrote, she \"wore it about her neck so low that she hid it under her breasts\". Herbert thought this the cause of Sir John Eyre's jealousy, and although Dorothy was of \"an excellent wit and discourse\", Herbert claimed he knew her only slightly. However, he also described visiting her chamber at the palace and finding her in bed examining the miniature by candlelight.<ref>Patricia Fumerton, 'Secret Arts: Elizabethan Miniatures and Sonnets', in Sephen Greenblatt, ''Representing the Renaissance'' (Berkeley, 1988), p. 124.</ref> Soon, following a summons to court from a \"great lady\", Herbert received warnings from [[Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester]], the Countess of Bedford, and [[Edward Hoby|Elizabeth, Lady Hoby]] another of the queen's gentlewomen, that Sir John Eyre planned to murder him in his bed. Herbert got in touch with Eyre to ask if he would fight a duel, but the answer was unclear.\n\nEyre and four accomplices caught up with Herbert and his two footmen at [[Great Scotland Yard|Scotland Yard]] as he was leaving [[Whitehall Palace]], and wounded his horse several times. Eyre broke Herbert's sword. Two other men helped Herbert, and after a prolonged struggle Herbert wounded Eyre, who was carried to the [[Thames]] vomiting. A few days later Eyre sent a message that he would kill Herbert with \"a musket out of a window\". Meanwhile, because Eyre publicly claimed Dorothy had confessed to being unfaithful, she sent a letter to her aunt [[John Croke|Lady Croke]] denying this, and Herbert was able to give this letter to the Privy Council. The [[Ludovic Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]] said that John Eyre was \"the most miserable man living\" because of the shame of Dorothy's letter proving him a liar, and because his father had disinherited him on hearing of the assault.<ref>Horace Walpole, ''The life of Edward Lord Herbert, of Cherbury. Written by himself'' (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 134-149.</ref>\n\nHerbert mentions that during the assault there were spectators of the \"Suffolk faction\" sided with Eyre, the year before Herbert had fought with [[Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk|Lord Walden de Walden]] in Germany.<ref>''HMC 5th Report (C. Griffith)'' (London, 1876), p. 408.</ref> Dorothy was pregnant and Eyre may have believed Herbert was the father of the child. Dorothy's son William Eyre was born in October 1611 at Flambards at [[Cold Norton]], [[Essex]], the house of Dorothy's mother Cecill, now Lady Brown. The child presumably died young, as he was not mentioned in Eyre's will.<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 25-6.</ref>\n\nJames Whitelocke described the christening of his own son James in May 1612. One godparent was [[Humphrey May]] (1573-1630), groom of the king's privy chamber, Whitelocke wrote he \"should have been for Dorothy\", apparently meaning he would have preferred him as a brother-in-law rather than the \"reprobate\" Eyre. May had been Whitelocke's friend at [[St John's College, Oxford]] and in chambers at the [[Inns of Court]].<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 21, 26, 61.</ref>\n\nEyre died in comparative poverty in 1639, leaving just 5 shillings to his wife.\n\n==Riper Years==\nDorothy Eyre later married John Clyffe (1597-1674).

Herbert, two years earlier, had written an epitaph for Dorothy's sister Cecily. In his autobiography he describes his encounter with \"Sir John Ayres\" in detail. According to Herbert, [[Anne of Denmark]] obtained his portrait by [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]] and Dorothy had it copied in miniature by [[Isaac Oliver]], and she wore it in a gold locket concealed to view.<ref>James Lees-Milne, 'Two Portraits at Charlecote Park by William Larkin', ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 94, No. 597 (Dec., 1952), pp. 352-6.</ref> Herbert wrote, she \"wore it about her neck so low that she hid it under her breasts\". Herbert thought this the cause of Sir John Eyre's jealousy, and although Dorothy was of \"an excellent wit and discourse\", Herbert claimed he knew her only slightly. However, he also described visiting her chamber at the palace and finding her in bed examining the miniature by candlelight.<ref>Patricia Fumerton, 'Secret Arts: Elizabethan Miniatures and Sonnets', in Sephen Greenblatt, ''Representing the Renaissance'' (Berkeley, 1988), p. 124.</ref> Soon, following a summons to court from a \"great lady\", Herbert received warnings from [[Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester]], the Countess of Bedford, and [[Edward Hoby|Elizabeth, Lady Hoby]] another of the queen's gentlewomen, that Sir John Eyre planned to murder him in his bed. Herbert got in touch with Eyre to ask if he would fight a duel, but the answer was unclear.\n\nEyre and four accomplices caught up with Herbert and his two footmen at [[Great Scotland Yard|Scotland Yard]] as he was leaving [[Whitehall Palace]], and wounded his horse several times. Eyre broke Herbert's sword. Two other men helped Herbert, and after a prolonged struggle Herbert wounded Eyre, who was carried to the [[Thames]] vomiting. A few days later Eyre sent a message that he would kill Herbert with \"a musket out of a window\". Meanwhile, because Eyre publicly claimed Dorothy had confessed to being unfaithful, she sent a letter to her aunt [[John Croke|Lady Croke]] denying this, and Herbert was able to give this letter to the Privy Council. The [[Ludovic Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]] said that John Eyre was \"the most miserable man living\" because of the shame of Dorothy's letter proving him a liar, and because his father had disinherited him on hearing of the assault.<ref>Horace Walpole, ''The life of Edward Lord Herbert, of Cherbury. Written by himself'' (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 134-149.</ref>\n\nHerbert mentions that during the assault there were spectators of the \"Suffolk faction\" sided with Eyre, the year before Herbert had fought with [[Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk|Lord Walden de Walden]] in Germany.<ref>''HMC 5th Report (C. Griffith)'' (London, 1876), p. 408.</ref> Dorothy was pregnant and Eyre may have believed Herbert was the father of the child. Dorothy's son William Eyre was born in October 1611 at Flambards at [[Cold Norton]], [[Essex]], the house of Dorothy's mother Cecill, now Lady Brown. The child presumably died young, as he was not mentioned in Eyre's will.<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 25-6.</ref>\n\nJames Whitelocke described the christening of his own son James in May 1612. One godparent was [[Humphrey May]] (1573-1630), groom of the king's privy chamber, Whitelocke wrote he \"should have been for Dorothy\", apparently meaning he would have preferred him as a brother-in-law rather than the \"reprobate\" Eyre. May had been Whitelocke's friend at [[St John's College, Oxford]] and in chambers at the [[Inns of Court]].<ref>John Bruce, ''Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke'' (Camden Society, London, 1858), pp. 21, 26, 61.</ref>\n\nEyre died in comparative poverty in 1639, leaving just 5 shillings to his wife.\n\n==Riper Years==\nDorothy Eyre later married John Clyffe (1597-1674).

Upon departing, Nikki attempts to call Jonesy on the cell phone just to tell him that she doesn't want to break up with him, and Jonesy wishes the same. The gang says good bye to Nikki and tell her they'll talk to her soon, as she bids them one final farewell.

{"title_page": "Hyperlink", "text_new": "{{short description|Computing term; reference to data that the reader can directly follow either by clicking, tapping, or hovering}}\n{{For|the American web series|Hyperlinked}}\n{{Selfref|For help creating links in Wikipedia, see [[Help:Contents/Links]].}}\n[[File:Hyperlink-Wikipedia.svg|thumb|250px|An example of a hyperlink with a mouse pointer hovering above it]]\n[[File:Sistema hipertextual.jpg|thumb|Several documents being connected by hyperlinks.]]\n\nIn [[computing]], a '''hyperlink''', or simply a '''link''', is a reference to [[Data (computing)|data]] that the [[user (computing)|user]] can follow by [[point and click|clicking]] or [[touchscreen|tapping]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp|title=HTML Links|website=www.w3schools.com|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref> A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. [[Hypertext]] is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called [[anchor text]]. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a ''hypertext system'', and to create a hyperlink is ''to hyperlink'' (or simply ''to link''). A user following hyperlinks is said to ''navigate'' or ''browse'' the hypertext.\n\nThe document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. For example, in an online reference work such as [[Wikipedia]], or [[Google]], many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]] such as tables of contents, [[footnotes]], [[bibliographies]], [[index (publishing)|indexes]], [[letter (message)|letters]] and [[glossaries]].\n\nIn some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as [[HTML element#Anchor|anchors]] and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.\n\nThe effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the [[World Wide Web]] most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab<ref>See https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tabbrows.htm</ref>). Another possibility is [[transclusion]], for which the link target is a document [[:wikt:fragment|fragment]] that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only persons browsing the document follow hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web ''spider'' or [[Web crawler|crawler]].\n\n==Types of links==\n\n===Inline links===\nAn [[Inline linking|inline link]] displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the user selecting the link.\n\nAn inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a [[thumbnail]], [[Image resolution|low resolution]] [[Preview (computing)|preview]], [[Cropping (image)|cropped]] section, or [[magnification|magnified]] section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with [[desktop publishing|print publishing]] software \u2013 e.g., with an [[external link]]. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a [[page layout]].\n\n===Anchor===\nAn anchor hyperlink is a link bound to a portion of a document<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BoiMpnq5bmUC&pg=PA28&dq=%C2%A0An+anchor+hyperlink+is+a+link+bound+to+a+portion+of+a+document#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0An%20anchor%20hyperlink%20is%20a%20link%20bound%20to%20a%20portion%20of%20a%20document&f=false|title=Multimedia, Hypermedia, and Virtual Reality: Models, Systems, and Application: First International Conference, MHVR'94, Moscow, Russia September (14\u201316), 1996.

For instance, it may also be a ''hot area'' in an image ([[image map]] in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image. One way to define it is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a [[Politics of Africa|political map of Africa]] may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping [[Skin (computing)|skins]] or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.\n\n===Fat link===\nA '''fat link''' (also known as a \"one-to-many\" link, an \"extended link\"<ref>\"[http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/#extended-link XML Linking Language (XLink) Version 1.0]\" accessed 2010-1-27</ref>) or a \"multi-tailed link\" <ref>\"HTML, Web Browsers, and Other Paraphernalia\" accessed 2011-08-15 https://web.archive.org/web/20130704143743/http://people.duke.edu/~mshumate/fiction/htt/tools.html#fatlink</ref> is a [[hyperlink]] which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a [[multivalued function]].\n\n==Uses in various technologies==\n\n===HTML===\n[[Tim Berners-Lee]] saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the [[Internet]]. Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the [[World Wide Web]]. Web pages are written in the hypertext mark-up language [[HTML]].\n\nThis is what a hyperlink to the home page of the [[W3C organization]] could look like in HTML code:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">\n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org\">W3C organization website</a>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n      \nThis HTML code consists of several [[HTML element|tags]]:\n* The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag '''<nowiki><a</nowiki>''', and includes a hyperlink reference '''<nowiki>href=\"http://www.w3.org</nowiki>\"''' to the '''URL''' for the page. (Note that the URL is enclosed in quotes.)\n* The [[URL]] is followed by '''>''', marking the end of the anchor opening tag.\n* The words that follow identify what is being linked; this is the only part of the code that is ordinarily visible on the screen when the page is rendered, but when the cursor hovers over the link, many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such as in the lower left-hand corner.\n* Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link already visited).\n* The anchor closing tag ('''<nowiki></a></nowiki>''') terminates the hyperlink code.\n\n[[Webgraph]] is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], formed from [[web page]]s as vertices and hyperlinks, as directed edges.\n\n===XLink: hyperlinks ===\n{{Main article|XLink}}\n\nThe [[W3C]] [[W3C#Recommendations and Certifications|Recommendation]] called '''[[XLink]]''' describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These '''extended links''' can be ''multidirectional'', linking from, within, and between XML documents. It can also describe ''simple links'', which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.\n\n===Wikis=== <!-- As of September 2016, this header is linked to by the redirect [[Wikilink]], so please don't change the header without adding the current title as an anchor. Also please leave '''wikilinks''' in bold.   -->\n{{Glossary term|Wikilink|wikilink}}\nWhile [[wiki]]s may use HTML-type hyperlinks, the use of [[wiki markup]], a set of [[lightweight markup language]]s specifically for wikis, provides simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments\u2014in other words, for creating '''wikilinks'''.\n[[File:Wiki-linking.png|thumb|alt=Simple image demonstrating how internal [[MediaWiki]] links work (that is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title: two opening square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two closing square brackets.| How internal [[MediaWiki]] links work when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title. ]]\n\nThe syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. [[Ward Cunningham]]'s original [[wiki software]], the [[WikiWikiWeb]] used [[CamelCase]] for this purpose. CamelCase was also used in the early version of [[Wikipedia]] and is still used in some wikis, such as [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Trac]], and [[PmWiki]]. A common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the term to be wikilinked. For example, the input \"<nowiki>[[zebras]]</nowiki>\" is converted by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a [[zebras]] article.\nHyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:\n* '''Internal wikilinks''' or '''intrawiki links''' lead to pages within the same wiki website.\n* '''[[Interwiki links]]''' are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages of other wikis that are associated with the first.\n* '''External links''' lead to other webpages (those not covered in the above two cases, wiki or not wiki).\n\nWikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that don't yet exist, which are instead shown in [[redlink|red]].<ref>Wikipedia: the missing manual By John Broughton, 2008, {{ISBN|0-596-51516-2}}, [https://archive.org/details/wikipediamissing00brou_0/page/75 p. 75] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207163213/https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA75 |date=2018-02-07 }}</ref> Another possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question mark after the wikilinked term.\n\n===Virtual worlds===\n{{main article|Hyperlinks in virtual worlds}}\nHyperlinks are being implemented in various 3D [[virtual world]] networks, including those that use the [[OpenSimulator]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid |title=Hypergrid \u2013 OpenSim |publisher=Opensimulator.org |date=2012-03-04 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> and [[Open Cobalt]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |title=Creating, Saving, and Loading Spaces \u2013 Cobalt \u2013 DukeWiki |publisher=Wiki.duke.edu |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221184439/https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |archivedate=2012-12-21 }}</ref> platforms.\n\n=== Permalinks ===\n{{Main|Digital preservation}}\nPermalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding hyperlink that are less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are used in order to [[Pointer (computer programming)#Typed pointers and casting|point]] and [[URL redirection#Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs|redirect]] readers to the same [[Web page]], blog post or any online digital media<ref name=\"techopedia.com\">{{cite web | url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | title = Definition of Permanent Link (Permalink)  | website = techopedia.com | language = en | access-date = Oct 31, 2018 | archive-url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | archive-date = March 2, 2012| url-status = live}}</ref>.\n\nThe scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in [[BMC Bioinformatics]] analyzed 15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters\u2019 [[Web of Science]] [[Science citation index|citation index]], founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived.<ref>{{cite web | first = Leighton | last = W.

This can refer to a document, e.g. a [[webpage]], or other resource, or to a position in a webpage. The latter is achieved by means of an [[HTML element]] with a \"name\" or \"id\" attribute at that position of the HTML document. The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a [[fragment identifier]] \u2014   \"#''id attribute''\" \u2014 appended.\n\nWhen linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the \"''id attribute''\" can be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another element of the PDF, for example, \"#''page=386''\".\n\n===Link behavior in web browsers===\nA [[web browser]] usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way, e.g. in a different [[color]], [[font]] or [[Typeface|style]]. The behavior and style of links can be specified using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) language.\n\nIn a graphical user interface, the appearance of a [[computer mouse|mouse]] [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] may change into a [[hand]] motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the [[user (computing)|user]] activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the [[file type]] and on the browser and its [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]], another program may be activated to open the file.\n\nThe HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link:\n* '''link destination''' (\"href\" pointing to a URL)\n* '''[[Anchor text|link label]]'''\n* '''link title'''\n* '''link target'''\n* '''link class''' or '''link id'''\n\nIt uses the [[HTML anchor|HTML element \"a\"]] with the attribute \"href\" (HREF is an abbreviation for \"Hypertext REFerence\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|url=http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|title=Making a Server (\"HREF\" is for \"hypertext reference\")|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=2012-10-25|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025220948/http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|archivedate=2012-10-25|author-link=Tim Berners-Lee}}</ref>) and optionally also the attributes \"title\", \"target\", and \"[[Cascading Style Sheets|class]]\" or \"id\":\n\n:<samp>&lt;a href=\"''URL''\" title=\"''link title''\" target=\"''link target''\" class=\"''link class''\"&gt;''link label''&lt;/a&gt;</samp>\n\nTo embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this form:\n\n:<code><nowiki><a href=\"http://example.com/\">Example</a></nowiki></code>\n\nIn a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word \"Example\" in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or document.\n\nWhen the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular [[Window (computing)|window]], but in a special [[Mouse hover|hover box]], which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer|IE]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the [[status bar]].\n\nNormally, a link opens in the current [[framing (World Wide Web)|frame]] or window, but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special \"target\" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session.\n\nCreation of new windows is probably the most common use of the \"target\" attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window names \"_blank\" and \"_new\" are usually available, and always cause a new window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.\n\nAnother special page name is \"_top\", which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window.\n\n==History==\n[[File:SRI ARC Engelbart Nov 1969.jpg|thumb|Douglas Engelbart and his team at [[SRI International|SRI]], 1969]]\nThe term \"hyperlink\" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by [[Ted Nelson]] at the start of [[Project Xanadu]]. Nelson had been inspired by \"[[As We May Think]]\", a popular 1945 essay by [[Vannevar Bush]]. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the [[Memex]]) in which one could link any two pages of information into a \"trail\" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.\n\nIn a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by [[Autodesk]] in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by [[Douglas Engelbart]] (with [[Jeff Rulifson]] as chief [[programmer]]) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]. [[Ben Shneiderman]] working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/ HyperTIES system] in 1983.  HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web.  In 1988, [[Ben Shneiderman]] and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish \"Hypertext Hands-On!\", the world's first electronic book.{{cn|date=February 2019|reason=First electronic book is a bold claim.}}\n\nA database program [[HyperCard]] was released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document. In 1990, [[Windows Help]], which was introduced with [[Microsoft Windows 3.0]], had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single [[Online help|help file]] together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic browser]] (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.\n\n==Legal issues==\n{{Main article|Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing}}\n\nWhile hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the [[World Wide Web|web]], some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.\n\nContentious in particular are [[deep linking|deep links]], which do not point to a site's [[home page]] or other entry point designated by the site owner, but to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site's own designated flow, and ''inline links'', which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the linking site's own content unless an explicit attribution is added.<ref>See [[Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing#Kelly v. Arriba Soft|''Arriba Soft'' case]]. The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is the first important decision of a US court on linking. In it the Ninth Circuit held the deep linking by Arriba Soft to images on Kelly's website to be legal under the fair use doctrine.</ref>\n\nIn certain [[jurisdiction]]s it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely [[reference]]s or [[citations]], but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, [[Karin Spaink]] was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere [[publication]] of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, [[Josephine Ho]] was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |title=The prosecution of Taiwan sexuality researcher and activist Josephine Ho |publisher=Sex.ncu.edu.tw |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208052339/http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, [[British Telecom]] sued [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) on web hyperlinks.

[[Hypertext]] is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called [[anchor text]]. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a ''hypertext system'', and to create a hyperlink is ''to hyperlink'' (or simply ''to link''). A user following hyperlinks is said to ''navigate'' or ''browse'' the hypertext.\n\nThe document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. For example, in an online reference work such as [[Wikipedia]], or [[Google]], many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]] such as tables of contents, [[footnotes]], [[bibliographies]], [[index (publishing)|indexes]], [[letter (message)|letters]] and [[glossaries]].\n\nIn some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as [[HTML element#Anchor|anchors]] and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.\n\nThe effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the [[World Wide Web]] most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new [[Tab (interface)|tab]]<ref>See https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tabbrows.htm</ref>). Another possibility is [[transclusion]], for which the link target is a document [[:wikt:fragment|fragment]] that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only persons browsing the document follow hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web ''spider'' or [[Web crawler|crawler]].\n\n==Types of links==\n\n===Inline links===\nAn [[Inline linking|inline link]] displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the user selecting the link.\n\nAn inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a [[thumbnail]], [[Image resolution|low resolution]] [[Preview (computing)|preview]], [[Cropping (image)|cropped]] section, or [[magnification|magnified]] section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with [[desktop publishing|print publishing]] software \u2013 e.g., with an [[external link]]. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a [[page layout]].\n\n===Anchor===\nAn anchor hyperlink is a link bound to a portion of a document<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BoiMpnq5bmUC&pg=PA28&dq=%C2%A0An+anchor+hyperlink+is+a+link+bound+to+a+portion+of+a+document#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0An%20anchor%20hyperlink%20is%20a%20link%20bound%20to%20a%20portion%20of%20a%20document&f=false|title=Multimedia, Hypermedia, and Virtual Reality: Models, Systems, and Application: First International Conference, MHVR'94, Moscow, Russia September (14\u201316), 1996.

For instance, it may also be a ''hot area'' in an image ([[image map]] in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image. One way to define it is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a [[Politics of Africa|political map of Africa]] may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping [[Skin (computing)|skins]] or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.\n\n===Fat link===\nA '''fat link''' (also known as a \"one-to-many\" link, an \"extended link\"<ref>\"[http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/#extended-link XML Linking Language (XLink) Version 1.0]\" accessed 2010-1-27</ref>) or a \"multi-tailed link\" <ref>\"HTML, Web Browsers, and Other Paraphernalia\" accessed 2011-08-15 https://web.archive.org/web/20130704143743/http://people.duke.edu/~mshumate/fiction/htt/tools.html#fatlink</ref> is a [[hyperlink]] which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a [[multivalued function]].\n\n==Uses in various technologies==\n\n===HTML===\n[[Tim Berners-Lee]] saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the [[Internet]]. Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the [[World Wide Web]]. Web pages are written in the hypertext mark-up language [[HTML]].\n\nThis is what a hyperlink to the home page of the [[W3C organization]] could look like in HTML code:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">\n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org\">W3C organization website</a>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n      \nThis HTML code consists of several [[HTML element|tags]]:\n* The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag '''<nowiki><a</nowiki>''', and includes a hyperlink reference '''<nowiki>href=\"http://www.w3.org</nowiki>\"''' to the '''URL''' for the page. (Note that the URL is enclosed in quotes.)\n* The [[URL]] is followed by '''>''', marking the end of the anchor opening tag.\n* The words that follow identify what is being linked; this is the only part of the code that is ordinarily visible on the screen when the page is rendered, but when the cursor hovers over the link, many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such as in the lower left-hand corner.\n* Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link already visited).\n* The anchor closing tag ('''<nowiki></a></nowiki>''') terminates the hyperlink code.\n\n[[Webgraph]] is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], formed from [[web page]]s as vertices and hyperlinks, as directed edges.\n\n===XLink: hyperlinks ===\n{{Main article|XLink}}\n\nThe [[W3C]] [[W3C#Recommendations and Certifications|Recommendation]] called '''[[XLink]]''' describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These '''extended links''' can be ''multidirectional'', linking from, within, and between XML documents. It can also describe ''simple links'', which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.\n\n===Wikis=== <!-- As of September 2016, this header is linked to by the redirect [[Wikilink]], so please don't change the header without adding the current title as an anchor. Also please leave '''wikilinks''' in bold.   -->\n{{Glossary term|Wikilink|wikilink}}\nWhile [[wiki]]s may use HTML-type hyperlinks, the use of [[wiki markup]], a set of [[lightweight markup language]]s specifically for wikis, provides simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments\u2014in other words, for creating '''wikilinks'''.\n[[File:Wiki-linking.png|thumb|alt=Simple image demonstrating how internal [[MediaWiki]] links work (that is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title: two opening square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two closing square brackets.| How internal [[MediaWiki]] links work when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title. ]]\n\nThe syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. [[Ward Cunningham]]'s original [[wiki software]], the [[WikiWikiWeb]] used [[CamelCase]] for this purpose. CamelCase was also used in the early version of [[Wikipedia]] and is still used in some wikis, such as [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Trac]], and [[PmWiki]]. A common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the term to be wikilinked. For example, the input \"<nowiki>[[zebras]]</nowiki>\" is converted by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a [[zebras]] article.\nHyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:\n* '''Internal wikilinks''' or '''intrawiki links''' lead to pages within the same wiki website.\n* '''[[Interwiki links]]''' are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages of other wikis that are associated with the first.\n* '''External links''' lead to other webpages (those not covered in the above two cases, wiki or not wiki).\n\nWikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that don't yet exist, which are instead shown in [[redlink|red]].<ref>Wikipedia: the missing manual By John Broughton, 2008, {{ISBN|0-596-51516-2}}, [https://archive.org/details/wikipediamissing00brou_0/page/75 p. 75] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207163213/https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA75 |date=2018-02-07 }}</ref> Another possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question mark after the wikilinked term.\n\n===Virtual worlds===\n{{main article|Hyperlinks in virtual worlds}}\nHyperlinks are being implemented in various 3D [[virtual world]] networks, including those that use the [[OpenSimulator]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid |title=Hypergrid \u2013 OpenSim |publisher=Opensimulator.org |date=2012-03-04 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> and [[Open Cobalt]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |title=Creating, Saving, and Loading Spaces \u2013 Cobalt \u2013 DukeWiki |publisher=Wiki.duke.edu |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221184439/https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |archivedate=2012-12-21 }}</ref> platforms.\n\n=== Permalinks ===\n{{Main|Digital preservation}}\nPermalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding hyperlink that are less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are used in order to [[Pointer (computer programming)#Typed pointers and casting|point]] and [[URL redirection#Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs|redirect]] readers to the same [[Web page]], blog post or any online digital media<ref name=\"techopedia.com\">{{cite web | url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | title = Definition of Permanent Link (Permalink)  | website = techopedia.com | language = en | access-date = Oct 31, 2018 | archive-url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | archive-date = March 2, 2012| url-status = live}}</ref>.\n\nThe scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in [[BMC Bioinformatics]] analyzed 15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters\u2019 [[Web of Science]] [[Science citation index|citation index]], founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived.<ref>{{cite web | first = Leighton | last = W.

This can refer to a document, e.g. a [[webpage]], or other resource, or to a position in a webpage. The latter is achieved by means of an [[HTML element]] with a \"name\" or \"id\" attribute at that position of the HTML document. The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a [[fragment identifier]] \u2014   \"#''id attribute''\" \u2014 appended.\n\nWhen linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the \"''id attribute''\" can be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another element of the PDF, for example, \"#''page=386''\".\n\n===Link behavior in web browsers===\nA [[web browser]] usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way, e.g. in a different [[color]], [[font]] or [[Typeface|style]]. The behavior and style of links can be specified using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) language.\n\nIn a graphical user interface, the appearance of a [[computer mouse|mouse]] [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] may change into a [[hand]] motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the [[user (computing)|user]] activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the [[file type]] and on the browser and its [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]], another program may be activated to open the file.\n\nThe HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link:\n* '''link destination''' (\"href\" pointing to a URL)\n* '''[[Anchor text|link label]]'''\n* '''link title'''\n* '''link target'''\n* '''link class''' or '''link id'''\n\nIt uses the [[HTML anchor|HTML element \"a\"]] with the attribute \"href\" (HREF is an abbreviation for \"Hypertext REFerence\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|url=http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|title=Making a Server (\"HREF\" is for \"hypertext reference\")|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=2012-10-25|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025220948/http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|archivedate=2012-10-25|author-link=Tim Berners-Lee}}</ref>) and optionally also the attributes \"title\", \"target\", and \"[[Cascading Style Sheets|class]]\" or \"id\":\n\n:<samp>&lt;a href=\"''URL''\" title=\"''link title''\" target=\"''link target''\" class=\"''link class''\"&gt;''link label''&lt;/a&gt;</samp>\n\nTo embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this form:\n\n:<code><nowiki><a href=\"http://example.com/\">Example</a></nowiki></code>\n\nIn a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word \"Example\" in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or document.\n\nWhen the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular [[Window (computing)|window]], but in a special [[Mouse hover|hover box]], which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer|IE]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the [[status bar]].\n\nNormally, a link opens in the current [[framing (World Wide Web)|frame]] or window, but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special \"target\" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session.\n\nCreation of new windows is probably the most common use of the \"target\" attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window names \"_blank\" and \"_new\" are usually available, and always cause a new window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.\n\nAnother special page name is \"_top\", which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window.\n\n==History==\n[[File:SRI ARC Engelbart Nov 1969.jpg|thumb|Douglas Engelbart and his team at [[SRI International|SRI]], 1969]]\nThe term \"hyperlink\" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by [[Ted Nelson]] at the start of [[Project Xanadu]]. Nelson had been inspired by \"[[As We May Think]]\", a popular 1945 essay by [[Vannevar Bush]]. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the [[Memex]]) in which one could link any two pages of information into a \"trail\" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.\n\nIn a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by [[Autodesk]] in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by [[Douglas Engelbart]] (with [[Jeff Rulifson]] as chief [[programmer]]) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]. [[Ben Shneiderman]] working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/ HyperTIES system] in 1983.  HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web.  In 1988, [[Ben Shneiderman]] and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish \"Hypertext Hands-On!\", the world's first electronic book.{{cn|date=February 2019|reason=First electronic book is a bold claim.}}\n\nA database program [[HyperCard]] was released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document. In 1990, [[Windows Help]], which was introduced with [[Microsoft Windows 3.0]], had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single [[Online help|help file]] together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic browser]] (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.\n\n==Legal issues==\n{{Main article|Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing}}\n\nWhile hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the [[World Wide Web|web]], some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.\n\nContentious in particular are [[deep linking|deep links]], which do not point to a site's [[home page]] or other entry point designated by the site owner, but to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site's own designated flow, and ''inline links'', which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the linking site's own content unless an explicit attribution is added.<ref>See [[Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing#Kelly v. Arriba Soft|''Arriba Soft'' case]]. The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is the first important decision of a US court on linking. In it the Ninth Circuit held the deep linking by Arriba Soft to images on Kelly's website to be legal under the fair use doctrine.</ref>\n\nIn certain [[jurisdiction]]s it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely [[reference]]s or [[citations]], but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, [[Karin Spaink]] was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere [[publication]] of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, [[Josephine Ho]] was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |title=The prosecution of Taiwan sexuality researcher and activist Josephine Ho |publisher=Sex.ncu.edu.tw |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208052339/http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, [[British Telecom]] sued [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) on web hyperlinks.

[[Jean Hagen]] played his serious and loving wife Margaret. Their daughter Terry was played by Sherry Jackson, and their son Rusty by Rusty Hamer. The show's premise involved Danny rarely having time to spend with his family and Margaret having to deal with the children virtually on her own. She often felt neglected by Danny, and on several occasions felt like leaving him. Margaret was a society woman and strict with the children, but loved her family. \n\n[[Louise Beavers]] made several appearances during this era as the Williams' maid, Louise Evans, and often was at odds with Danny and sided with Margaret in most of the couple's arguments. [[Nana Bryant]] often appeared as Margaret's kind mother, of whom Danny and the children were fond, but Margaret, who had been raised by her aunt and uncle because of her mother often being away on stage tours, was not as warm to her mother. (Bryant died in late 1955, and rather than the character being recast, she simply disappeared. When Louise Beavers became ill in 1955, [[Amanda Randolph]] assumed the role of Louise.)\n\n===Series changes===\nFor its first four years,\"Make Room For Daddy\"on ABC (retitled \"The Danny Thomas Show\"starting in the Fall of 1957 on CBS) garnered decent ratings, but failed to make the list of the top 30 programs. Shortly after the third season finished filming, Jean Hagen left the show over dissatisfaction with her role and frequent clashes with Danny Thomas. Thomas was upset with her for leaving, and felt the show would not last without her. However, he decided to push on. At the start of the fourth season, Both Thomas and producer [[Sheldon Leonard]] were faced with a serious dilemma\u2014how to explain Hagen's absence. To have \"Danny\" and \"Margaret\" divorce in that era would have been unacceptable to television audiences, so it was explained that Margaret had died suddenly off-screen. It was a risky move because until this time, no character on a TV situation comedy had died.\n\nDanny now was a widower juggling a performing career while raising two children on his own. He had Louise and his friends often looking after the children while he was touring. He decided to move them to a boarding school, but later relented and the family moved into a new apartment. During the fourth season, Danny dated a few other women and nearly got engaged to a widowed singer until he found out she did not like children. By season's end, the ratings had suffered and it was decided that a wife and mother was needed to complete the family unit.\n\nIn a four-part story arc that began airing in April 1957, son Rusty fell ill with the [[measles]] and Danny hired Kathy O'Hara ([[Marjorie Lord]]), a young Irish nurse, to look after him. Kathy was a widow with a little girl (played by Lelani Sorenson). Danny and Kathy became fast friends and, not surprisingly, Danny quickly fell in love with her, as did the kids. In the season finale, the two became engaged. In a curious twist, ABC at this point canceled the series, which proved to be fortunate. In the spring of 1957, ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', which had reigned as the top-rated show for almost all of its six-year run on CBS, was ending production. When CBS heard that ABC was cancelling the series, CBS picked it up as part of its 1957-58 schedule.\n\nThe show, now titled \"The Danny Thomas Show\" made its CBS debut on Monday, October 7, 1957 at 9:00 inheriting the time slot vacated by ''I Love Lucy''. The fifth-season premiere episode, \"Lose Me In Las Vegas,\" had Danny and Kathy already married and on their honeymoon. The Williams family moved into a larger brand-new apartment and, with the change of network, the producers also changed Kathy's daughter. Lelani Sorenson was dropped from the cast and replaced by [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda. Linda then was adopted by Danny, and the show's ratings dramatically increased.<ref>[http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1957.htm ClassicTVHits.com TV Ratings: 1957-1958]</ref> At the end of its fifth season, ''The Danny Thomas Show'' posted its highest rating, ranking at No. 2. During this season, Amanda Randolph was sick and rarely appeared as Louise, who was said to be recovering from the flu, with Kathy doing most of the housework.\n\nIn the early part of the sixth season, Sherry Jackson left the show and the character of Terry was said to have gone to a girls school in Paris. Jackson commented on her close friendship with Jean Hagen and why she left the series, saying, \"The major perk was Jean Hagen. I adored her. We had a great time. She and I were best buddies; she was my only friend from the ''Make Room for Daddy'' cast. What made me specifically want to leave the show? I had a five-year contract, Jean had a three-year contract. Jean was thoroughly fed up with the series and made it clear that she didn't want to come back. When she left, I was devastated. I didn't want to continue, either. I wanted to break my contract. They wouldn't let me leave, but gave me less to do; that's why I'm in fewer shows from ages 14\u201316.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn Season 7, the character of Terry was brought back, but recast with Penney Parker. Terry was featured in a seven-episode story arc that had her engaged and eventually married to Pat Hannigan ([[Pat Harrington, Jr.]]), a nightclub friend of Danny's. After the wedding, the Hannigans moved to California and Terry was rarely mentioned, never to be seen on the show again.\n\nIn the last two seasons, with Thomas and Lord tired of their roles, Danny and Kathy both regularly traveled, and for much of the tenth season they toured Europe (with a handful of episodes featuring location footage). Rusty and Linda were looked after by Danny's manager, Charlie Halper ([[Sid Melton]]) and his wife Bunny ([[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]). During the 11th and final season, Thomas decided to retire from the show and the program ended in the spring of 1964, finishing as still one of the most popular television programs and ranking at number nine.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Danny Thomas Jean Hagen Make Room for Daddy 1953.JPG|thumb|150px|Danny and Margaret Williams]]\n[[File:Milton berle angela cartright rusty hamer.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Milton Berle]] spends some time with Linda and Rusty after  Danny and he quit show business.]]\n* [[Danny Thomas]] as Danny Williams\n* [[Jean Hagen]] as Margaret Williams (1953&ndash;1956)\n* [[Marjorie Lord]] as Kathy \"Clancey\" O'Hara Williams (1957&ndash;1964)\n* [[Rusty Hamer]] as Rusty Williams\n* [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda Williams (1957&ndash;1964)\n* [[Sherry Jackson]] as Terry Williams (1953&ndash;1958)\n* Penney Parker as Terry Williams (1959&ndash;1960)\n* [[Louise Beavers]] as Louise (1953&ndash;1955)\n* [[Amanda Randolph]] as Louise (1955&ndash;1964)\n\n===Supporting===\n[[File:Danny Thomas show hans conried 1964.jpg|thumb|150px|Uncle Tonoose (Hans Conried) gets a lecture from his older brother, Tufik (played by Danny Thomas).]]\nThe supporting cast included:\n* [[Sid Melton]] as Charlie Halper\n* [[Pat Carroll]] as Bunny Halper (1961&ndash;1964)\n* [[Sheldon Leonard]] as Phil Brokaw (1957&ndash;1961)\n* [[Ben Lessy]] as Benny (1953&ndash;1959)\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Liz O'Neal (1955&ndash;1957)\n* [[Pat Harrington, Jr.]] as Pat Hannigan (1959&ndash;1960)\n* [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] as Jesse Leeds (1953&ndash;1957)\n\n===Notable guest stars===\n[[Hans Conried]] had frequent guest appearances as Danny's eccentric [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] \"Uncle Tonoose\".

In the seventh season, Danny Thomas is arrested by [[Sheriff Andy Taylor]] (Andy Griffith) and detained in the small town of [[Mayberry]] in an episode titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\". The episode aired on February 15, 1960, and ''The Andy Griffith Show'' premiered later that year on October 3.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0639971/ ''The Danny Thomas Show'', \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\"]</ref>\n\nThe series also [[Fictional crossover|crossed over]] to several other series, including ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]''<ref>[http://www.poobala.com/lucyanddanny.html ''The Danny Thomas Show/Make Room For Daddy and I Love Lucy/The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour'']</ref> and ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0616273/ ''The Joey Bishop Show'',\"This Is Your Life\"]</ref>\n\n[[Morey Amsterdam]] guest-starred as Buddy Sorrell of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' in the episode \"The Women Behind the Jokes\".\n\nSome episodes featured [[Bill Dana]] as [[Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez (character)|Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez]], which led to the spin-off series ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]''. Danny Thomas played himself in one episode.\n\n==Sequel==\n[[File:Make Room for Granddaddy cast 1970.JPG|thumb|180px|The cast for ''Make Room for Granddaddy'']]\n[[File:Diana Ross Roosevelt Grier Danny Thomas Make Room for Granddaddy 1971.JPG|thumb|180px|Guest star [[Diana Ross]] with Roosevelt Grier and Thomas in 1971]]\n\nThe show ended in 1964, but Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, Rusty Hamer, Sherry Jackson, Amanda Randolph and Hans Conried returned in 1965 for a two-hour-long \"reunion\" special on [[NBC]], ''The Danny Thomas TV Family Reunion'', considered the first TV reunion show, and ''Make More Room for Daddy'', which aired as an episode of ''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'' in November 1967. Shortly after filming the second special in 1967, Randolph died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 70. A CBS reunion special, ''Make Room for Granddaddy'', was aired in 1969. The special did so well that it was picked up as a series by CBS, but Thomas considered its assigned time slot to be too quiet and pulled the show.\n\nABC brought it back on a weekly basis in 1970, in ''Make Room for Granddaddy''. For the series premiere, Sherry Jackson reprised her role of oldest daughter Terry. No mention was made of her husband Pat Hannigan. Instead, for this new version of the series, Terry's husband was named Bill, who was a soldier. In this episode, Terry left her son, six-year-old Michael (played by Michael Hughes), in the care of grandparents Danny and Kathy so she could join Bill, who was stationed overseas. In addition to Lord, Hamer and Cartwright, the only other returning regulars were Sid Melton as Charley Halper and Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose. During that season, new characters were played by [[Stanley Myron Handelman]] and former [[American football|football]] player [[Rosey Grier|Roosevelt Grier]]. The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were [[rural purge|purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers]] after the [[Prime Time Access Rule|loss of a half-hour of daily program time]] in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.<ref>Geoffrey Mark Fidelman,''The Lucy Book'', Renaissance Books, page 269.)</ref>\n<!-- \n===Episode list for ''Make Room for Granddaddy''===\n# \"Make Room for Grandson\" / 1970.09.23\n# \"The Return of Barney Shaker\" / 1970.09.30\n# \"This Granddaddy Is Rated X\" / 1970.10.07\n# \"'''The Great Emancipator'''\" / 1970.10.14\n# \"'''A Time for Loving'''\" / 1970.10.21\n# \"'''Is This Trip Necessary?'''\" / 1970.10.28\n# \"'''Teaching Linda to Drive'''\" / 1970.11.04\n# \"'''Tonoose the Exile'''\" / 1970.11.11\n# \"'''A Hamburger for Frank'''\" / 1970.11.18\n# \"'''The Arrangement'''\" / 1970.11.25\n# \"'''He Did It His Way'''\" / 1970.12.02\n# \"'''Women of the World, Unite'''\" / 1970.12.16\n# \"'''The Teen Idol'''\" / 1970.12.30\n# \"'''Cheating the Cheater'''\" / 1971.01.06\n# \"'''The Horrible Horoscope'''\" / 1971.01.13\n# \"'''Lucy and the Lecher'''\" / 1971.01.21\n# \"'''Of Mice and Mini'''\" / 1971.01.28\n# \"'''Will the Real Diana Please Stand Up?'''\" / 1971.02.04\n# \"'''Over Thirty Is Out'''\" / 1971.02.11\n# \"'''Karate Kate'''\" / 1971.02.18\n# \"'''The Greatest Ear in the Business'''\" / 1971.02.25\n# \"'''The Big Hang-Up'''\" / 1971.03.04\n# \"'''The Arm Wrestle'''\" / 1971.03.11\n# \"'''Monument for Uncle Tonoose'''\" / 1971.03.18\n -->\n\n== Reruns ==\nReruns of the show( Using the original title \"Make Room For Daddy) were aired weekdays on NBC from October 4, 1960 to March 26, 1965.The episodes shown were from season one through season nine).CBS aired primetime repeats April 19 through September 6, 1965, on Monday nights at 9:30 p.m ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]]).

[[Jean Hagen]] played his serious and loving wife Margaret. Their daughter Terry was played by Sherry Jackson, and their son Rusty by Rusty Hamer. The show's premise involved Danny rarely having time to spend with his family and Margaret having to deal with the children virtually on her own. She often felt neglected by Danny, and on several occasions felt like leaving him. Margaret was a society woman and strict with the children, but loved her family. \n\n[[Louise Beavers]] made several appearances during this era as the Williams' maid, Louise Evans, and often was at odds with Danny and sided with Margaret in most of the couple's arguments.

In the seventh season, Danny Thomas is arrested by [[Sheriff Andy Taylor]] (Andy Griffith) and detained in the small town of [[Mayberry]] in an episode titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\". The episode aired on February 15, 1960, and ''The Andy Griffith Show'' premiered later that year on October 3.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0639971/ ''The Danny Thomas Show'', \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\"]</ref>\n\nThe series also [[Fictional crossover|crossed over]] to several other series, including ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]''<ref>[http://www.poobala.com/lucyanddanny.html ''The Danny Thomas Show/Make Room For Daddy and I Love Lucy/The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour'']</ref> and ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0616273/ ''The Joey Bishop Show'',\"This Is Your Life\"]</ref>\n\n[[Morey Amsterdam]] guest-starred as Buddy Sorrell of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' in the episode \"The Women Behind the Jokes\".\n\nSome episodes featured [[Bill Dana]] as [[Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez (character)|Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez]], which led to the spin-off series ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]''. Danny Thomas played himself in one episode.\n\n==Sequel==\n[[File:Make Room for Granddaddy cast 1970.JPG|thumb|180px|The cast for ''Make Room for Granddaddy'']]\n[[File:Diana Ross Roosevelt Grier Danny Thomas Make Room for Granddaddy 1971.JPG|thumb|180px|Guest star [[Diana Ross]] with Roosevelt Grier and Thomas in 1971]]\n\nThe show ended in 1964, but Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, Rusty Hamer, Sherry Jackson, Amanda Randolph and Hans Conried returned in 1965 for a two-hour-long \"reunion\" special on [[NBC]], ''The Danny Thomas TV Family Reunion'', considered the first TV reunion show, and ''Make More Room for Daddy'', which aired as an episode of ''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'' in November 1967. Shortly after filming the second special in 1967, Randolph died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 70. A CBS reunion special, ''Make Room for Granddaddy'', was aired in 1969. The special did so well that it was picked up as a series by CBS, but Thomas considered its assigned time slot to be too quiet and pulled the show.\n\nABC brought it back on a weekly basis in 1970, in ''Make Room for Granddaddy''. For the series premiere, Sherry Jackson reprised her role of oldest daughter Terry. No mention was made of her husband Pat Hannigan. Instead, for this new version of the series, Terry's husband was named Bill, who was a soldier. In this episode, Terry left her son, six-year-old Michael (played by Michael Hughes), in the care of grandparents Danny and Kathy so she could join Bill, who was stationed overseas. In addition to Lord, Hamer and Cartwright, the only other returning regulars were Sid Melton as Charley Halper and Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose. During that season, new characters were played by [[Stanley Myron Handelman]] and former [[American football|football]] player [[Rosey Grier|Roosevelt Grier]]. The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were [[rural purge|purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers]] after the [[Prime Time Access Rule|loss of a half-hour of daily program time]] in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.<ref>Geoffrey Mark Fidelman,''The Lucy Book'', Renaissance Books, page 269.)</ref>\n<!-- \n===Episode list for ''Make Room for Granddaddy''===\n# \"Make Room for Grandson\" / 1970.09.23\n# \"The Return of Barney Shaker\" / 1970.09.30\n# \"This Granddaddy Is Rated X\" / 1970.10.07\n# \"'''The Great Emancipator'''\" / 1970.10.14\n# \"'''A Time for Loving'''\" / 1970.10.21\n# \"'''Is This Trip Necessary?'''\" / 1970.10.28\n# \"'''Teaching Linda to Drive'''\" / 1970.11.04\n# \"'''Tonoose the Exile'''\" / 1970.11.11\n# \"'''A Hamburger for Frank'''\" / 1970.11.18\n# \"'''The Arrangement'''\" / 1970.11.25\n# \"'''He Did It His Way'''\" / 1970.12.02\n# \"'''Women of the World, Unite'''\" / 1970.12.16\n# \"'''The Teen Idol'''\" / 1970.12.30\n# \"'''Cheating the Cheater'''\" / 1971.01.06\n# \"'''The Horrible Horoscope'''\" / 1971.01.13\n# \"'''Lucy and the Lecher'''\" / 1971.01.21\n# \"'''Of Mice and Mini'''\" / 1971.01.28\n# \"'''Will the Real Diana Please Stand Up?'''\" / 1971.02.04\n# \"'''Over Thirty Is Out'''\" / 1971.02.11\n# \"'''Karate Kate'''\" / 1971.02.18\n# \"'''The Greatest Ear in the Business'''\" / 1971.02.25\n# \"'''The Big Hang-Up'''\" / 1971.03.04\n# \"'''The Arm Wrestle'''\" / 1971.03.11\n# \"'''Monument for Uncle Tonoose'''\" / 1971.03.18\n -->\n\n== Reruns ==\nReruns of the show( Using the original title \"Make Room For Daddy) were aired weekdays on NBC from October 4, 1960 to March 26, 1965.The episodes shown were from season one through season nine).CBS aired primetime repeats April 19 through September 6, 1965, on Monday nights at 9:30 p.m ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]]).
