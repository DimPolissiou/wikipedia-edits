As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining the illusion of a shared design, the British design departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 to such a degree that it was effectively a new design.<ref name=\"thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk\">http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/jaguar/history.php</ref>\n\nA separate partnership was formed between [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Turbomeca]] to develop the [[Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour|Adour]] afterburning turbofan engine.<ref name=\"JAWA80 p105\">Taylor 1980, p. 105.</ref><ref name=\"JAWA80 p708\">Taylor 1980, p. 708.</ref> The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca's Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their [[joint venture]] would use elements of both.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes, including the [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]], who maintained a winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The area was explored by the [[Vancouver Expedition]] of 1792, which landed on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claimed the land for [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The Snohomish and other tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, \nrelocating to the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]] and relinquishing its lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]], opening the region to American settlement.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] on Port Gardner Bay in 1861 and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Over the next several years a handful of settlers moved to the area, but it wasn't until 1890 that plans for platting a town were conceived.\n\nOn July 17, 1890, The steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' left [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] for an Alaskan cruise with [[Henry Hewitt, Jr.]] and [[Charles L. Colby]] aboard. During this \"Fateful voyage\" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The [[Rucker Brothers]] filed their [[plat]] at Port Gardner, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat was later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group.\n\nOn September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what was to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that would become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and [[Colgate Hoyt]]. In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator [[Edward Everett]].\n\nOn November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred {{convert|434.15|acre|km2}} of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, \"The Remarkable Document\" was drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development.\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W. Wetmore]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] was tasked with construction of several public works projects in the Everett area, including a new county airport that later became [[Paine Field]]. The airport was appropriated for military use during [[World War II]], but was later turned over to county ownership.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> The [[Boeing Company]] selected a {{convert|780|acre|ha|adj=mid}} plot of land north of the airport in June 1966 to build a [[Boeing Everett Factory|new airplane factory]] for its [[Boeing 747]] passenger jetliner, which would become the world's first \"jumbo jet\".

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes, including the [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]], who maintained a winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The area was explored by the [[Vancouver Expedition]] of 1792, which landed on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claimed the land for [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The Snohomish and other tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, \nrelocating to the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]] and relinquishing its lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]], opening the region to American settlement.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] on Port Gardner Bay in 1861 and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Over the next several years a handful of settlers moved to the area, but it wasn't until 1890 that plans for platting a town were conceived.\n\nOn July 17, 1890, The steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' left [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] for an Alaskan cruise with [[Henry Hewitt, Jr.]] and [[Charles L. Colby]] aboard. During this \"Fateful voyage\" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The [[Rucker Brothers]] filed their [[plat]] at Port Gardner, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat was later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group.\n\nOn September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what was to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that would become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and [[Colgate Hoyt]]. In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator [[Edward Everett]].\n\nOn November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred {{convert|434.15|acre|km2}} of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, \"The Remarkable Document\" was drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development.\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W. Wetmore]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] was tasked with construction of several public works projects in the Everett area, including a new county airport that later became [[Paine Field]]. The airport was appropriated for military use during [[World War II]], but was later turned over to county ownership.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> The [[Boeing Company]] selected a {{convert|780|acre|ha|adj=mid}} plot of land north of the airport in June 1966 to build a [[Boeing Everett Factory|new airplane factory]] for its [[Boeing 747]] passenger jetliner, which would become the world's first \"jumbo jet\".

Governmental planners and business networks like to use the name \"silicon\" or \"valley\" to describe their own areas as a result of the success of [[Silicon Valley]] in [[California]].  Nevertheless, there are a few qualitative differences between these places, and metrics may be applied to measure their dominance.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* How much and to what extent public and/or private research and development (R&D) funds are spent in the zones\n* What percentage of local employment is technology related.\n* If the zone is mainly government funded or is mainly corporate driven (or is it a mix of both)\n* If mainly corporate, how much revenue and profit and which corporations have headquarters there.\n* If mainly corporate, how much [[venture capital]] has been made available to companies in the zone.\n* What supporting higher educational institutions (e.g., universities or colleges) are located in nearby.\n\n== Globally prominent clusters ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n<!-- Note: this area should be a summary of major globally dominant in a particular field.

San Francisco and nearby areas including Berkeley and Oakland are technically not part of Silicon Valley but have seen growth in industries such as [[web development]] (2013\u20132016) and [[venture capital]].  Silicon Valley has maintained dominance for decades in core industries such as microprocessor development as well as software and web development.  \n*[[IT cluster Rhine-Main-Neckar]], [[Germany]]: Europe's largest software cluster, is globally dominant in [[business software]], [[IT security]] research and [[Biopharmaceutical|biopharmaceuticals]]\n* [[CERN]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] is globally dominant in [[particle physics]].\n* [[Dulles Technology Corridor]] is globally dominant in telecom, satellite, and defense industries.\n* [[Hsinchu Science Park]]: [[Hsinchu City]] and [[Hsinchu County]], [[Taiwan]] is the dominant area worldwide for [[pure-play semiconductor foundry]] market.\n* [[Silicon Alley]] or NYC is globally dominant in [[fintech]] although Shenzhen is also coming up strong in this area.\n* [[Silicon Fen]]: The name given to the region around Cambridge, England, which is home to a large cluster of high-tech businesses focusing on software, electronics and biotechnology.

Governmental planners and business networks like to use the name \"silicon\" or \"valley\" to describe their own areas as a result of the success of [[Silicon Valley]] in [[California]].  Nevertheless, there are a few qualitative differences between these places, and metrics may be applied to measure their dominance.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* How much and to what extent public and/or private research and development (R&D) funds are spent in the zones\n* What percentage of local employment is technology related.\n* If the zone is mainly government funded or is mainly corporate driven (or is it a mix of both)\n* If mainly corporate, how much revenue and profit and which corporations have headquarters there.\n* If mainly corporate, how much [[venture capital]] has been made available to companies in the zone.\n* What supporting higher educational institutions (e.g., universities or colleges) are located in nearby.\n\n== Globally prominent clusters ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n<!-- Note: this area should be a summary of major globally dominant in a particular field.

San Francisco and nearby areas including Berkeley and Oakland are technically not part of Silicon Valley but have seen growth in industries such as [[web development]] (2013\u20132016) and [[venture capital]].  Silicon Valley has maintained dominance for decades in core industries such as microprocessor development as well as software and web development.  \n*[[IT cluster Rhine-Main-Neckar]], [[Germany]]: Europe's largest software cluster, is globally dominant in [[business software]], [[IT security]] research and [[Biopharmaceutical|biopharmaceuticals]]\n* [[CERN]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] is globally dominant in [[particle physics]].\n* [[Dulles Technology Corridor]] is globally dominant in telecom, satellite, and defense industries.\n* [[Hsinchu Science Park]]: [[Hsinchu City]] and [[Hsinchu County]], [[Taiwan]] is the dominant area worldwide for [[pure-play semiconductor foundry]] market.\n* [[Silicon Alley]] or NYC is globally dominant in [[fintech]] although Shenzhen is also coming up strong in this area.\n* [[Silicon Fen]]: The name given to the region around Cambridge, England, which is home to a large cluster of high-tech businesses focusing on software, electronics and biotechnology.

The movie starts with the [[suicide]] of the protagonist and uses [[reverse chronology]] to depict some of the key events of the past 20 years of his life that led to his death. It was the ninth highest grossing domestic film of 2000 with 311,000 admissions in Seoul.<ref name= \"2000grosses\">{{cite web |url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm00.html |title=2000 |publisher=koreanfilm.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt was received well, especially in film festivals. Spurred by the success of Lee Chang-dong's directorial debut, ''[[Green Fish]]'', ''Peppermint Candy'' was chosen as the opening film for the [[Busan International Film Festival]] in its first showing in 1999. It won multiple awards at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] and won the South Korean cinema industry's [[Grand Bell Awards]] for best film of 2000.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the beginning, the main character Yong-ho wanders to a reunion of his old student group. After causing some general mayhem with his deranged antics, he leaves and climbs atop a nearby train track. Facing an oncoming train, he exclaims \"I want to go back again!\" What follows is a series of prior events in the main character's life that show how he became the suicidal man portrayed in this scene.\n\nThe first flashback takes place only a few days before Yong-ho's death. At this point he is already clearly suicidal, spending the last of his money on a gun and contemplates who he should use it on. After confronting his former business partner and ex-wife Hong-ja, the husband of his teenage crush Sun-im pays him a surprise visit. Yong-ho is taken to visit a [[coma]]tose Sun-im in a hospital, and presents some peppermint candies she used to give him.\n\nThe next flashback shows Yong-ho's life five years earlier. At first glance, he seems to be a rather successful businessman, but the problems in his life become clear when he confronts his wife, who is having an [[affair]] with her driving instructor. Yong-ho is unable to claim [[moral high ground]], since he is also shown having an affair, with an assistant from his workplace. Finally, Yong-ho is shown with his wife at their new house, having dinner with his colleagues, where it becomes apparent that the marriage isn't working.\n\nOn the third flashback, Yong-ho is shown as a police officer in 1987. At the beginning, he is shown along with his pregnant wife at a mundane scene. After this, he is shown apprehending a witness and brutally [[torture|torturing]] him for information about another man's whereabouts. This leads Yong-ho to [[Kunsan]] where he and his fellow police officers capture the wanted man. While in Kunsan, Yong-ho is distracted from his work by fruitlessly trying to search for Sun-im and instead ends up on a one-night stand with a woman.\n\nThe following flashback shows Yong-ho when he is just starting his career as a policeman and is pressured by his peers to torture a crime suspect, presumably a student demonstrator. Shortly afterward, he is visited by Sun-im. Yong-ho coldly and cruelly dismisses her by feigning interest in another woman, his future wife Hong-ja. At the final scene of this sequence, Yong-ho is shown sleeping with Hong-ja, whom it is shown he never truly cared about.\n\nDuring the next flashback, it's May 1980 and Yong-ho is performing his [[mandatory military service]]. While Sun-im is trying to visit him, his company is taken to quell the [[Gwangju Democratization Movement]]. Yong-ho gets shot in the leg and is told to stay behind. This leads to a scene where he confronts a harmless and presumably innocent student, whom he accidentally shoots and kills.\n\nThe last flashback shows Yong-ho as a part of the student group that reunited at the beginning of the movie. This is also where he meets Sun-im for the first time. The scene poignantly shows the innocence that Yong-ho had, before his country molded him into the violent and jaded man he is at the start of the film by pitting him against his friends.\n\n==Analysis==\nThe events of Yong-ho's life that are shown in the movie can be seen as representing some of the major events of Korea's recent history. The student demonstrations of the early 1980s leading to the [[Gwangju massacre]] are shown, as Yong-ho becomes traumatized by the shooting incident.<ref name=\"leong\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mediacircus.net/peppermintcandy.html |title=Peppermint Candy Movie Review |publisher=mediacircus.net |last=Leong |first=Anthony |year=2001 |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref> The tightening grip on the country by the military government during the 1980s is mirrored by Yong-ho losing his innocence and becoming more and more cynical during his stint as a brutal policeman. Similarly, Yong-ho losing his job during the late 1990s mirrors the [[Asian financial crisis]].<ref name= \"kfodescription\">{{cite web |url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm00.html#candy |title=Peppermint Candy |publisher=koreanfilm.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nYong-ho's life represents the struggle between [[historiography]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. Despite his desperate desire to move on from his past, mnemonic traces overpower the psychoanalytical aspects of his life. These mnemonic traces include the train, the camera, and the peppermint candy as well as Sun-im and her surrogates throughout the vignettes, which led the psychoanalysis of his life to triumph over historiography. The relationship between historiography and psychoanalysis can be seen in historicism and progressivism, where Yong-ho chooses to look back on his past instead of looking solely at his future to move forward. The major traumatic events that were historically imposed on him were so embedded in his life that he could not simply move on.

The movie starts with the [[suicide]] of the protagonist and uses [[reverse chronology]] to depict some of the key events of the past 20 years of his life that led to his death. It was the ninth highest grossing domestic film of 2000 with 311,000 admissions in Seoul.<ref name= \"2000grosses\">{{cite web |url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm00.html |title=2000 |publisher=koreanfilm.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt was received well, especially in film festivals. Spurred by the success of Lee Chang-dong's directorial debut, ''[[Green Fish]]'', ''Peppermint Candy'' was chosen as the opening film for the [[Busan International Film Festival]] in its first showing in 1999. It won multiple awards at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] and won the South Korean cinema industry's [[Grand Bell Awards]] for best film of 2000.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the beginning, the main character Yong-ho wanders to a reunion of his old student group. After causing some general mayhem with his deranged antics, he leaves and climbs atop a nearby train track. Facing an oncoming train, he exclaims \"I want to go back again!\" What follows is a series of prior events in the main character's life that show how he became the suicidal man portrayed in this scene.\n\nThe first flashback takes place only a few days before Yong-ho's death. At this point he is already clearly suicidal, spending the last of his money on a gun and contemplates who he should use it on. After confronting his former business partner and ex-wife Hong-ja, the husband of his teenage crush Sun-im pays him a surprise visit. Yong-ho is taken to visit a [[coma]]tose Sun-im in a hospital, and presents some peppermint candies she used to give him.\n\nThe next flashback shows Yong-ho's life five years earlier. At first glance, he seems to be a rather successful businessman, but the problems in his life become clear when he confronts his wife, who is having an [[affair]] with her driving instructor. Yong-ho is unable to claim [[moral high ground]], since he is also shown having an affair, with an assistant from his workplace. Finally, Yong-ho is shown with his wife at their new house, having dinner with his colleagues, where it becomes apparent that the marriage isn't working.\n\nOn the third flashback, Yong-ho is shown as a police officer in 1987. At the beginning, he is shown along with his pregnant wife at a mundane scene. After this, he is shown apprehending a witness and brutally [[torture|torturing]] him for information about another man's whereabouts. This leads Yong-ho to [[Kunsan]] where he and his fellow police officers capture the wanted man. While in Kunsan, Yong-ho is distracted from his work by fruitlessly trying to search for Sun-im and instead ends up on a one-night stand with a woman.\n\nThe following flashback shows Yong-ho when he is just starting his career as a policeman and is pressured by his peers to torture a crime suspect, presumably a student demonstrator. Shortly afterward, he is visited by Sun-im. Yong-ho coldly and cruelly dismisses her by feigning interest in another woman, his future wife Hong-ja. At the final scene of this sequence, Yong-ho is shown sleeping with Hong-ja, whom it is shown he never truly cared about.\n\nDuring the next flashback, it's May 1980 and Yong-ho is performing his [[mandatory military service]]. While Sun-im is trying to visit him, his company is taken to quell the [[Gwangju Democratization Movement]]. Yong-ho gets shot in the leg and is told to stay behind. This leads to a scene where he confronts a harmless and presumably innocent student, whom he accidentally shoots and kills.\n\nThe last flashback shows Yong-ho as a part of the student group that reunited at the beginning of the movie. This is also where he meets Sun-im for the first time. The scene poignantly shows the innocence that Yong-ho had, before his country molded him into the violent and jaded man he is at the start of the film by pitting him against his friends.\n\n==Analysis==\nThe events of Yong-ho's life that are shown in the movie can be seen as representing some of the major events of Korea's recent history. The student demonstrations of the early 1980s leading to the [[Gwangju massacre]] are shown, as Yong-ho becomes traumatized by the shooting incident.<ref name=\"leong\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mediacircus.net/peppermintcandy.html |title=Peppermint Candy Movie Review |publisher=mediacircus.net |last=Leong |first=Anthony |year=2001 |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref> The tightening grip on the country by the military government during the 1980s is mirrored by Yong-ho losing his innocence and becoming more and more cynical during his stint as a brutal policeman. Similarly, Yong-ho losing his job during the late 1990s mirrors the [[Asian financial crisis]].<ref name= \"kfodescription\">{{cite web |url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm00.html#candy |title=Peppermint Candy |publisher=koreanfilm.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nYong-ho's life represents the struggle between [[historiography]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. Despite his desperate desire to move on from his past, mnemonic traces overpower the psychoanalytical aspects of his life. These mnemonic traces include the train, the camera, and the peppermint candy as well as Sun-im and her surrogates throughout the vignettes, which led the psychoanalysis of his life to triumph over historiography. The relationship between historiography and psychoanalysis can be seen in historicism and progressivism, where Yong-ho chooses to look back on his past instead of looking solely at his future to move forward. The major traumatic events that were historically imposed on him were so embedded in his life that he could not simply move on. However, finally reflecting back on his past allows him to accept what happened and finally advance into the future. Unfortunately, this was moments before he committed suicide when he turned to face the train. The train is the symbol that guides the film in reverse chronology, and his cry to return to the past signifies his tragically late recognition of the past's significance for his life.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shin |first1=Chi-Yun |first2=Julian |last2=Stringer |title=New Korean Cinema |edition=1st |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |year=2005 |pages=166\u2013167}}</ref>\n\nIssues of masculinity in South Korean culture arise in the film.
