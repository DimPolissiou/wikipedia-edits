Previous Agriculture Commissioners had put their own names on the stickers for decades, but Fried was the first to put a color photograph of herself smiling on the sticker. The decision sparked allegations by the Florida GOP, who accused Fried of using taxpayer funds to increase her political exposure. The Florida legislature quickly passed a law limiting the taxpayer-funded stickers to only \u201ca combination of lettering, numbering, words, or the department logo.\u201d The stickers then began to be replaced with a new design that does not have her photograph. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Ogles |first1=Jacob |title=Face off: New Nikki Fried stickers continue popping up statewide |url=https://floridapolitics.com/archives/319643-the-transition-to-faceless-nikki-fried-stickers-continues-at-pumps-statewide |website=Florida Politics |accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |last1=Turner |first1=Jim |title=Nikki Fried gas pump stickers spark dispute with Florida House GOP |url=https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/02/03/nikki-fried-gas-pump-stickers-spark-dispute-with-florida-house-gop/ |website=Tampa Bay Times |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019 the department appointed two registered lobbyists for the Florida Sugar Cane League to consult on the [[Lake Okeechobee]] System Operating Manual Project Delivery Team, which was set to advise the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] on procedures for lake levels. Environmentalists have called for lake levels to be lowered to prevent harmful discharges, while the sugar industry has advocated for keeping levels high to avoid the threat of low water supply for farmers and municipalities.

Previous Agriculture Commissioners had put their own names on the stickers for decades, but Fried was the first to put a color photograph of herself smiling on the sticker. The decision sparked allegations by the Florida GOP, who accused Fried of using taxpayer funds to increase her political exposure. The Florida legislature quickly passed a law limiting the taxpayer-funded stickers to only \u201ca combination of lettering, numbering, words, or the department logo.\u201d The stickers then began to be replaced with a new design that does not have her photograph. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Ogles |first1=Jacob |title=Face off: New Nikki Fried stickers continue popping up statewide |url=https://floridapolitics.com/archives/319643-the-transition-to-faceless-nikki-fried-stickers-continues-at-pumps-statewide |website=Florida Politics |accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |last1=Turner |first1=Jim |title=Nikki Fried gas pump stickers spark dispute with Florida House GOP |url=https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/02/03/nikki-fried-gas-pump-stickers-spark-dispute-with-florida-house-gop/ |website=Tampa Bay Times |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019 the department appointed two registered lobbyists for the Florida Sugar Cane League to consult on the [[Lake Okeechobee]] System Operating Manual Project Delivery Team, which was set to advise the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] on procedures for lake levels. Environmentalists have called for lake levels to be lowered to prevent harmful discharges, while the sugar industry has advocated for keeping levels high to avoid the threat of low water supply for farmers and municipalities. U.S. Congressman [[Brian Mast]] ([[FL-18]]) sent a letter to the Corps of Engineers seeking the lobbyists removal, alleging the appointments were an attempt to force sugar industry influence into the process.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fineout |first1=Gary |last2=Dixon |first2=Matt |title=Florida Playbook |url=https://www.politico.com/newsletters/florida-playbook/2020/01/10/gaetz-murphy-cross-part-lines-on-iran-vote-miami-dade--mayor-to-challenge-mucarsel-powell-mast-calls-out-nikki-fried-488033 |website=Politico}}</ref> Seven Florida environmental groups, including [[Friends of the Everglades]] and Everglades Trust, called for the members to be removed and criticized their appointment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Treadway |first1=Tyler |title=Environmental Groups join Mast, want sugar lobbyists off Lake planning panel |url=www.amp.tcpalm.com/amp/4457290002 |website=TCPalm |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref> While Fried originally defended the appointments as expert consultants, she later fired their consulting firm and removed them from working on the project. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Treadway |first1=Tyler |title=Agriculture Commissioner Fires, takes consultants tied to sugar farmers off Lake Panel |url=https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-lagoon/health2020/02/03/agriculture-commissioner-fires-consulting-firm-tied-sugar-industry/4643779002/ |website=TCPalm |accessdate=03 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019 Fried abstained from a cabinet vote on the nominee for state Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) Commissioner, in apparent contravention of Florida state law. Florida law states cabinet officials \"may not abstain\" from cabinet votes unless there is a conflict of interest. Fried said she had concerns over the transparency of the nomination and said her interpretation of the law did not mandate her to vote yes or no.
