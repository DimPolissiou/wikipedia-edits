There is now considerable evidence that nutritional imbalances during [[gestation]] and [[lactation]] are linked to [[non-communicable disease]]s, such as [[obesity]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], and [[cancer]].  If metabolic disturbances occur during critical time windows of development, the resulting epigenetic alterations can lead to permanent changes in tissue and organ structure or function and predispose individuals to disease.<ref name=\"Gallou\">{{cite journal | author = Gallou-Kabani C, Vige A, Gross MS, Junien C | year = 2007 | title = Nutri-epigenomics: Lifelong remodelling of our epigenomes by nutritional and metabolic factors and beyond | url = | journal = Clin Chem Lab Med. | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 321\u20137 | doi = 10.1515/CCLM.2007.081 | pmid = 17378726 }}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Epigenetics]] relates to heritable changes in [[gene]] function that occur independently of alterations in primary [[DNA]] sequence.  Two major epigenetic mechanisms implicated in nutriepigenomics are [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone]] modification.  DNA methylation in [[gene promoter]] regions usually results in [[gene silencing]] and influences gene expression.  While this form of gene silencing is extremely important in development and cellular differentiation, aberrant DNA methylation can be detrimental and has been linked to various disease processes, such as cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Berdasco M, Esteller M | year = 2010 | title = Aberrant epigenetic landscape in cancer: How cellular identity goes awry | url = | journal = Dev Cell. | volume = 19 | issue = 5| pages = 698\u2013711 | doi = 10.1016/j.devcel.2010.10.005 | pmid = 21074720 }}</ref>  The methyl groups used in DNA methylation are often derived from dietary sources, such as folate and [[choline]], and explains why diet can have a significant impact on methylation patterns and gene expression.<ref name=\"Pozharny\">{{cite journal | author = Pozharny Y, Lambertini L, Clunie G, Ferrara L, Lee MJ | date = Mar 2010 | title = Epigenetics in women's health care | url = | journal = Mt Sinai J Med. | volume = 77 | issue = 2| pages = 225\u201335 | doi = 10.1002/msj.20176 | pmid = 20309920 }}</ref>  Gene silencing can also be reinforced through the recruitment of [[histone deacetylases]] to decrease transcriptional activation.  Conversely, [[histone acetylation]] induces transcriptional activation to increase gene expression.  Dietary components can influence these epigenetic events, thereby altering gene expression and disturbing functions such as appetite control, metabolic balance and fuel utilization.<ref name=\"Gallou\"/>\n\nVarious genetic sequences can be targeted for epigenetic modification.  A [[transcriptome]]-wide analysis in mice found that a protein-restricted (PR) diet during gestation resulted in differential gene expression in approximately 1% of the fetal genes analyzed (235/22,690).

As the number of overweight reproductive-age women increases, the number of overweight children and infants also increases.<ref name=\"Simmons\"/>  It has been postulated that maternal obesity causes an accumulation of fat in fetal [[adipose tissue]] (adiposity) and predisposes babies for obesity in childhood and adulthood.<ref name = \"Simmons\"/>  Animal studies have shown that maternal overnutrition may impact brain development and cause disruptions to programming of the [[hypothalamus]].  Offspring that were exposed to a high-fat or high-caloric maternal diet had increased levels of insulin, glucose and leptin.  It is hypothesized that these elevations are due to disturbances in the complex neuronal network that includes the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) pathways.<ref name=\"Tamashiro\"/>  This altered neuronal signaling can consequently impact food-intake behavior and lead to diet-induced obesity in adulthood.  While epigenetic modifications are most likely involved in the development of obesity, the specific target genes have yet to be identified.  Genes involved in adipogenesis, such as fibroblast growth-factor-2, phosphatase and tensin homologue, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A and oestrogen receptor-alpha, possess multiple [[CpG islands]] in their promoter sites and may act as epigenetic targets.<ref name=\"Campion\">{{cite journal | author = Campion J, Milagro FI, Martinez JA | date = Jul 2009 | title = Individuality and epigenetics in obesity | url = | journal = Obes Rev | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 383\u201392 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00595.x | pmid = 19413700 }}</ref>  Furthermore, it has been shown that prenatal exposure to a hypomethylating agent, such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), is associated with increased body weight and suggests modified DNA methylation as a mechanism for increasing susceptibility to obesity.<ref name=\"Campion\"/>\n\n==== Folate ====\nIt has long been realized that maternal folate intake during pregnancy is linked to fetal development and growth, and can reduce the risk of serious birth defects.  Folate is a source of [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM), which is used to supply DNA methyltransferases with methyl groups.  Therefore, changes in folate supply have a substantial effect on DNA methylation patterns.  Low levels of folate are associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, poor growth of the placenta and uterus, and intrauterine growth retardation.<ref name=\"Pozharny\"/>  Several complex diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and [[autism]] have also been linked to maternal folate status.  Based on animal studies it has been hypothesized that reduced folate intake could increase the risk of [[neural tube defects]] by reducing the amount of methylayed DNA during cranial neural tube closure.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dunlevy LP, Burren KA, Mills K, Chitty LS, Copp AJ, Greene ND | date = Jul 2006 | title = Integrity of the methylation cycle is essential for mammalian neural tube closure | url = | journal = Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol | volume = 76 | issue = 7| pages = 544\u201352 | doi = 10.1002/bdra.20286 | pmid = 16933307 }}</ref>  Recently it was discovered that folate protection from congenital heart defects is linked to epigenetics and Wnt signaling.  Multiple environmental factors target the [[Wnt signaling pathway]] during embryogenesis and can cause misregulation of the pathway.  [[Folic acid]] metabolism generates SAM, thereby altering the methylation states of histones H3K9, H3K4, and H3K27 and genetically altering Wnt signaling.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Linask KK, Huhta J | year = 2010 | title = Folate protection from congenital heart defects linked with canonical wnt signaling and epigenetics | journal = Curr Opin Pediatr | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 561\u20136 | doi = 10.1097/MOP.0b013e32833e2723 | pmid = 20844350 | pmc = 3004285 }}</ref>\n\nRecently a [[Blind experiment|double-blind]] placebo controlled trial of high dose [[Folinic acid|Folinic Acid]] (Leucovorin Calcium) demonstrated efficacy at improving verbal communication in children with [[autism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frye|first=R.

It has been shown that maternal diet in late pregnancy and an infant's diet in the beginning weeks can all have significant impacts on gene expression. Therefore, perinatal nutrition is both late-stage ''in utero'' nutrition and lactation.\n\n==== Bone health ====\nBone mass and the development of [[osteoporosis]] have been studied in relation to perinatal nutrition.  An important factor to consider when investigating perinatal nutrition is whether the baby was [[breastfeeding|breast-fed]] or formula-fed.  Studies have shown that breast-fed babies have increased bone mass compared to those were not breast-fed, and that this small increase in bone mass during a period of critical development could potentially program the skeleton to continue along a \u201chealthy\u201d growth trajectory.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11000344 | volume=67 | issue=4 | title=Birth weight, birth length, and bone density in prepubertal children: evidence for an association that may be mediated by genetic factors | date=October 2000 | author=Jones G, Dwyer T | journal=Calcif.

Therefore, healthy bone programming is most likely influenced by various epigenetic mechanisms, such as imprinting of the growth promoting genes IGF-2, or changes to the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA).<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19536660 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9173-5_3 | volume=646 | title=Developmental origins of osteoporosis: the role of maternal nutrition | year=2009 | author=Cooper C, Harvey N, Cole Z, Hanson M, Dennison E | journal=Adv.

Brain development occurs most rapidly during fetal development and infancy, and research has shown that exposure to certain environmental conditions can have long-lasting effects on [[cognition]].  Specifically, n-3 [[fatty acids]], [[iodine]], [[iron]] and [[choline]] have been shown to influence brain development and impact cognitive ability and behavior.

Individuals with type-1 diabetes experience a pre-clinical diabetes phase characterized by [[autoimmunity]] against [[pancreatic islets]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eisenbarth GS | year = 1986 | title = Type I diabetes mellitus.

However, foods that are consumed during adulthood can also impact gene expression and disease pathogenesis.  Cancer is the disease most commonly associated with adult nutrition and epigenetic modifications. DNA hypomethelation promotes cancer progression by allowing increased gene transcription, while hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes and further promote uncontrolled [[cell division]] and [[tumor]] formation.  Compounds found in foods, such as [[genistein]] and [[tea polyphenols]], are able to regulate DNA methyltransferases and histone acetylation in cultured cancer cells and may provide protection against certain types of cancer.<ref name=\"Campion\"/>  Other dietary compounds, such as [[diallyl disulfide]] present in garlic and [[sulforaphane]] present in cruciferous vegetables, have been associated with cancer prevention in clinical trials.<ref name=\"Davis\">{{cite journal | pmid = 17345961 | volume=65 | issue=2 | title=Dietary components impact histone modifications and cancer risk | date=February 2007 | author=Davis CD, Ross SA | journal=Nutr.

Micronutrients, such as zinc and iron, may also be restricted to investigate the effects on offspring. Additionally, rats fed diets lacking or including methyl donors are often used to study the effects of diet on epigenomics, as variations within the methylation of DNA are common means of silencing or expressing genes.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12163687 | volume=132 | issue=8 Suppl | title=Diet, methyl donors and DNA methylation: interactions between dietary folate, methionine and choline | date=August 2002 | author=Niculescu MD, Zeisel SH | journal=J.

Two major epigenetic mechanisms implicated in nutriepigenomics are [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone]] modification.  DNA methylation in [[gene promoter]] regions usually results in [[gene silencing]] and influences gene expression.  While this form of gene silencing is extremely important in development and cellular differentiation, aberrant DNA methylation can be detrimental and has been linked to various disease processes, such as cancer.<ref>Berdasco M, Esteller M. \"Aberrant epigenetic landscape in cancer: How cellular identity goes awry.

A [[transcriptome]]-wide analysis in mice found that a protein-restricted (PR) diet during gestation resulted in differential gene expression in approximately 1% of the fetal genes analyzed (235/22,690).

As the number of overweight reproductive-age women increases, the number of overweight children and infants also increases.<ref name=\"Simmons\"/>  It has been postulated that maternal obesity causes an accumulation of fat in fetal [[adipose tissue]] (adiposity) and predisposes babies for obesity in childhood and adulthood.<ref name = \"Simmons\"/>  Animal studies have shown that maternal overnutrition may impact brain development and cause disruptions to programming of the [[hypothalamus]].  Offspring that were exposed to a high-fat or high-caloric maternal diet had increased levels of insulin, glucose and leptin.  It is hypothesized that these elevations are due to disturbances in the complex neuronal network that includes the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) pathways.<ref name=\"Tamashiro\"/>  This altered neuronal signaling can consequently impact food-intake behavior and lead to diet-induced obesity in adulthood.  While epigenetic modifications are most likely involved in the development of obesity, the specific target genes have yet to be identified.  Genes involved in adipogenesis, such as fibroblast growth-factor-2, phosphatase and tensin homologue, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A and oestrogen receptor-alpha, possess multiple [[CpG islands]] in their promoter sites and may act as epigenetic targets.<ref name=\"Campion\">Campion J, Milagro FI, Martinez JA. \"Individuality and epigenetics in obesity.

Folate is a source of [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM), which is used to supply DNA methyltransferases with methyl groups.  Therefore, changes in folate supply have a substantial effect on DNA methylation patterns.  Low levels of folate are associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, poor growth of the placenta and uterus, and intrauterine growth retardation.<ref name=\"Pozharny\"/>  Several complex diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and [[autism]] have also been linked to maternal folate status.  Based on animal studies it has been hypothesized that reduced folate intake could increase the risk of [[neural tube defects]] by reducing the amount of methylayed DNA during cranial neural tube closure.<ref>Dunlevy LP, Burren KA, Mills K, Chitty LS, Copp AJ, Greene ND. \"Integrity of the methylation cycle is essential for mammalian neural tube closure.

It has been shown that maternal diet in late pregnancy and an infant's diet in the beginning weeks can all have significant impacts on gene expression. Therefore, perinatal nutrition is both late-stage ''in utero'' nutrition and lactation.\n\n==== Bone health ====\nBone mass and the development of [[osteoporosis]] have been studied in relation to perinatal nutrition.  An important factor to consider when investigating perinatal nutrition is whether the baby was [[breastfeeding|breast-fed]] or formula-fed.  Studies have shown that breast-fed babies have increased bone mass compared to those were not breast-fed, and that this small increase in bone mass during a period of critical development could potentially program the skeleton to continue along a \u201chealthy\u201d growth trajectory.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11000344 | volume=67 | issue=4 | title=Birth weight, birth length, and bone density in prepubertal children: evidence for an association that may be mediated by genetic factors | date=October 2000 | author=Jones G, Dwyer T | journal=Calcif.

However, foods that are consumed during adulthood can also impact gene expression and disease pathogenesis.  Cancer is the disease most commonly associated with adult nutrition and epigenetic modifications.

Initially known for playing \"tough guys\" with a tender streak, he went on to achieve success with more complex and challenging roles over a 45-year career in film and, later, television. He was a four-time nominee for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] (winning once), and also winning two [[BAFTA]] Awards and one [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Lead Actor.\n\nLancaster performed as a circus acrobat in the 1930s. After serving in [[World War II]], the 32-year-old Lancaster landed a role in a Broadway play and drew the attention of a Hollywood agent. \n\nHis breakthrough role was the film noir ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' in 1946 alongside [[Ava Gardner]]. A critical success, it launched both of their careers.\n\nIn 1953, Lancaster played the illicit lover of [[Deborah Kerr]] in the military drama ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''. A box office smash, it won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and landed a Best Actor nomination for Lancaster. In 1956, he starred in ''[[The Rainmaker (1956 film)|The Rainmaker]]'', with [[Katharine Hepburn]], earning a Best Actor Golden Globe nomination, and in ''[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]'' in 1957, with frequent co-star Kirk Douglas. \n\nDuring the 1950s, his production company, [[Hecht-Hill-Lancaster]], was highly successful, with Lancaster acting in films such as: ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' in 1956, a box office smash in which he used his acrobatic skills; ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957), a dark drama today considered a classic; ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), a WWII submarine drama with [[Clark Gable]]; and ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958), a hotel-set drama which received seven Oscar nominations.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Lancaster starred in a string of critically successful films, each in very disparate roles. Playing a charismatic biblical con-man in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]'' in 1960 won him the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Actor. He played a Nazi war criminal in 1961 in the all-star, war-crime-trial film, ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]''. \n\nPlaying a bird expert prisoner in ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' in 1962, he earned the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor and his third Oscar nomination. In 1963, Lancaster traveled to Italy to star as an Italian prince in the epic period drama ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|The Leopard]]''. In 1964, he played a US Air Force General who, opposed by a Colonel played by Kirk Douglas, tries to overthrow the President in ''[[Seven Days in May]]''. Then, in 1966, he played an explosives expert in the western ''[[The Professionals (1966 film)|The Professionals]]''.\n\nIn 1970, Lancaster starred in the box-office hit, air-disaster drama ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]''. He experienced a career resurgence in 1980 with the crime-romance ''[[Atlantic City (1980 film)|Atlantic City]]'', winning the BAFTA for Best Actor and landing his fourth Oscar nomination. Starting in the late 1970s, he also appeared in television mini-series, including the award-winning [[Separate but Equal (film)|''Separate but Equal'']] with [[Sidney Poitier]]. \n\nHe continued acting into his late 70s, until a stroke in 1990 forced him to retire; four years later he died from a heart attack. His final film role was in the Oscar-nominated ''[[Field of Dreams]]''.\n\nThe [[American Film Institute]] ranks Lancaster as #19 of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest male stars]] of classic Hollywood cinema.<ref>[http://afi.com/100years/stars.aspx \"AFI's 50 GREATEST AMERICAN SCREEN LEGENDS\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222091649/http://www.afi.com/100Years/stars.aspx |date=February 22, 2019 }} ''[[American Film Institute]].''

He developed a great interest and skill in gymnastics while attending [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], where he was a [[basketball]] star.

The show only ran three weeks, but his performance attracted the interest of a Hollywood agent, [[Harold Hecht]]. Lancaster had other offers but Hecht promised him the opportunity to produce their own movies within five years of hitting Hollywood.\n\nThrough Hecht, Lancaster was brought to the attention of producer [[Hal B. Wallis]], who signed him to a non-exclusive eight-movie contract.\n\n===Hal Wallis===\n\nLancaster's first filmed movie was ''[[Desert Fury]]'' for Wallis in 1947, where Lancaster was billed after [[John Hodiak]] and [[Lizabeth Scott]].

The movie, directed by [[Alexander Mackendrick]], was a critical success but a commercial disappointment.

Four starred Lancaster: ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), a war film with [[Clark Gable]], directed by [[Robert Wise]], which was mildly popular; ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958), a hotel-set drama with Kerr and [[Rita Hayworth]] (who married James Hill), based on a play by [[Terence Rattigan]] which received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and Oscar awards for lead actor for [[David Niven]] and supporting actress [[Wendy Hiller]], and was both a critical and commercial success; ''[[The Devil's Disciple (1959 film)|The Devil's Disciple]]'' (1959), with Douglas and [[Laurence Olivier]], which lost money (and saw Lancaster fire Mackendirck during shooting);<ref>\"1959: Probable Domestic Take\", ''Variety'', January 6, 1960 p 34</ref> and the western ''[[The Unforgiven (1960 film)|The Unforgiven]]'' (1960), with [[Audrey Hepburn]], which was a critical and commercial disappointment.<ref>pp. 151\u2013152 Larkins, Bob &  Magers, Boyd ''The Films of Audie Murphy'' McFarland, August 19, 2009</ref>\n\nThree were made without Lancaster, all of which lost money: ''[[The Bachelor Party]]'' (1957), from another TV play by Chayefsky, and directed by Delbert Mann; ''[[Take a Giant Step]]'' (1959), about a black student; and ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll (1959 film)|Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' (1960), from an Australian play, shot in Australia and Britain.\n\nAdditionally, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster served as the production company for the 1960\u201361 TV series ''[[Whiplash (TV series)|Whiplash]]''.\n\nThe Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions company dissolved in 1960 after Hill ruptured his relationship with both Hecht and Lancaster.<ref>Hill went on to produce a single additional film, ''[[The Happy Thieves]]'', in a new production company, Hillworth Productions, co-owned with his wife [[Rita Hayworth]].</ref>\n\n===Hecht and Lancaster===\n[[File:Burt Lancaster 1960.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of Lancaster after he won an Oscar for ''Elmer Gantry'' (1960). Artist: [[Nicholas Volpe]]]]\nLancaster played the title role in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]'' (1960), written and directed by Richard Brooks for United Artists. The film received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor. Lancaster won the [[33rd Academy Awards|1960 Academy Award]] for Best Actor, a Golden Globe Award, and the [[New York Film Critics Award]] for his performance.\n\nHecht and Lancaster worked together on ''[[The Young Savages]]'' (1961), directed by [[John Frankenheimer]] and produced by Hecht. [[Sydney Pollack]] worked as a dialogue coach.\n\nLancaster starred in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961) for [[Stanley Kramer]], alongside [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Richard Widmark]] and a number of other iconic stars. The film was both a commercial and critical success, receiving 11 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.\n\nHe then did another film with Hecht and Frankenheimer (replacing [[Charles Crichton]]), ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962), a largely fictionalized biography. In it he plays [[Robert Stroud]], a federal prisoner incarcerated for life for two murders, who begins to collect birds and over time becomes an expert in bird diseases even publishing a book. The film shows Stroud transferred to the maximum security Alcatraz prison where he is not allowed to keep birds and as he ages he gets married, markets bird remedies, helps stop a prison rebellion, and writes a book on the history of the U.S. penal system, but never gets paroled. The sympathetic performance earned Lancaster a Best Actor Oscar nomination, a BAFTA Award for Best Actor, and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Dramatic Role. Hecht went on to produce five films without Lancaster's assistance, through his company Harold Hecht Films Productions between 1961 and 1967, including another Academy Award winner, ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', starring [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Jane Fonda]].\n\n===Collaborations with younger filmmakers===\nLancaster made ''[[A Child Is Waiting]]'' (1963) with [[Judy Garland]].

Initially known for playing \"tough guys\" with a tender streak, he went on to achieve success with more complex and challenging roles over a 45-year career in film and, later, television. He was a four-time nominee for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] (winning once), and also winning two [[BAFTA]] Awards and one [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Lead Actor.\n\nLancaster performed as a circus acrobat in the 1930s. After serving in [[World War II]], the 32-year-old Lancaster landed a role in a Broadway play and drew the attention of a Hollywood agent. \n\nHis breakthrough role was the film noir ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' in 1946 alongside [[Ava Gardner]]. A critical success, it launched both of their careers.\n\nIn 1953, Lancaster played the illicit lover of [[Deborah Kerr]] in the military drama ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''. A box office smash, it won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and landed a Best Actor nomination for Lancaster. In 1956, he starred in ''[[The Rainmaker (1956 film)|The Rainmaker]]'', with [[Katharine Hepburn]], earning a Best Actor Golden Globe nomination, and in ''[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]'' in 1957, with frequent co-star Kirk Douglas. \n\nDuring the 1950s, his production company, [[Hecht-Hill-Lancaster]], was highly successful, with Lancaster acting in films such as: ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' in 1956, a box office smash in which he used his acrobatic skills; ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957), a dark drama today considered a classic; ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), a WWII submarine drama with [[Clark Gable]]; and ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958), a hotel-set drama which received seven Oscar nominations.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Lancaster starred in a string of critically successful films, each in very disparate roles. Playing a charismatic biblical con-man in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]'' in 1960 won him the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Actor. He played a Nazi war criminal in 1961 in the all-star, war-crime-trial film, ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]''. \n\nPlaying a bird expert prisoner in ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' in 1962, he earned the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor and his third Oscar nomination. In 1963, Lancaster traveled to Italy to star as an Italian prince in the epic period drama ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|The Leopard]]''. In 1964, he played a US Air Force General who, opposed by a Colonel played by Kirk Douglas, tries to overthrow the President in ''[[Seven Days in May]]''. Then, in 1966, he played an explosives expert in the western ''[[The Professionals (1966 film)|The Professionals]]''.\n\nIn 1970, Lancaster starred in the box-office hit, air-disaster drama ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]''. He experienced a career resurgence in 1980 with the crime-romance ''[[Atlantic City (1980 film)|Atlantic City]]'', winning the BAFTA for Best Actor and landing his fourth Oscar nomination. Starting in the late 1970s, he also appeared in television mini-series, including the award-winning [[Separate but Equal (film)|''Separate but Equal'']] with [[Sidney Poitier]]. \n\nHe continued acting into his late 70s, until a stroke in 1990 forced him to retire; four years later he died from a heart attack. His final film role was in the Oscar-nominated ''[[Field of Dreams]]''.\n\nThe [[American Film Institute]] ranks Lancaster as #19 of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest male stars]] of classic Hollywood cinema.<ref>[http://afi.com/100years/stars.aspx \"AFI's 50 GREATEST AMERICAN SCREEN LEGENDS\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222091649/http://www.afi.com/100Years/stars.aspx |date=February 22, 2019 }} ''[[American Film Institute]].''

He developed a great interest and skill in gymnastics while attending [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], where he was a [[basketball]] star. Before he graduated from DeWitt Clinton, his mother died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Lancaster was accepted by [[New York University]] with an athletic scholarship, but subsequently dropped out.<ref>Buford 2008, p. 28.</ref>\n\n==Circus career==\n {{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Circus-Lancaster-Cravat.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Lancaster and [[Nick Cravat]], performing with the [[Federal Theatre Project]] Circus (1935\u201338)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Circus-Lancaster.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Cravat and Lancaster performing on the horizontal bars\n}}\n\nAt the age of 9, Lancaster met [[Nick Cravat]] with whom he developed a lifelong partnership.<ref name=Andreychukp3>Andreychuk 2005, p. 3.</ref> Together, they learned to act in local theatre productions and circus arts at [[Union Settlement Association|Union Settlement]], one of the city's oldest settlement houses.<ref name=Andreychukp3/> In the 1930s, they formed the acrobat duo Lang and Cravat and soon joined the Kay Brothers circus. However, in 1939, an injury forced Lancaster to give up the profession, with great regret.

The show only ran three weeks, but his performance attracted the interest of a Hollywood agent, [[Harold Hecht]]. Lancaster had other offers but Hecht promised him the opportunity to produce their own movies within five years of hitting Hollywood.\n\nThrough Hecht, Lancaster was brought to the attention of producer [[Hal B. Wallis]], who signed him to a non-exclusive eight-movie contract.\n\n===Hal Wallis===\n\nLancaster's first filmed movie was ''[[Desert Fury]]'' for Wallis in 1947, where Lancaster was billed after [[John Hodiak]] and [[Lizabeth Scott]].

It was also well received.<ref name=\"Grossers1947\"/> Wallis released his films through Paramount, and so Lancaster and other Wallis contractees made cameos in ''[[Variety Girl]]'' in 1947.\n\nLancaster's next film was a thriller for Wallis in 1947, ''[[I Walk Alone]]'', co-starring Scott and a young [[Kirk Douglas]], who was also under contract to Wallis.

Robinson]]. His third film for Wallis was an adaptation of ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number (film)|Sorry, Wrong Number]]'' in 1948, with [[Barbara Stanwyck]].\n\n===Norma Productions===\n\nHecht kept to his promise to Lancaster to turn producer. The two of them formed a company, Norma Productions, and did a deal with Universal to make a thriller in England, ''[[Kiss the Blood Off My Hands]]'' in 1948, with [[Joan Fontaine]] and directed by Norman Foster. It made a profit of only $50,000, but was critically acclaimed.<ref name=\"Grossers1948\"/>\n\nBack in Hollywood, Lancaster made another film noir with Siodmak, ''[[Criss Cross (film)|Criss Cross]]'', in 1949. It was originally going to be produced by Hellinger and when Hellinger died, another took over. [[Tony Curtis]] made an early appearance.\n\nLancaster appeared in a fourth picture for Wallis, ''[[Rope of Sand]]'', in 1949.\n\nNorma Productions signed a three-picture deal with [[Warner Bros.]] The first was 1950's ''[[The Flame and the Arrow]]'', a swashbuckler movie, in which Lancaster drew on his circus skills. Nick Cravat had a supporting role and the film was a huge commercial success, making $6 million. It was Warners' most popular film of the year and established an entirely new image for Lancaster.<ref name=\"warners\">Warner Bros financial information in The William Shaefer Ledger.

The first film was 1951's ''[[Ten Tall Men]]'', where Lancaster was a member of the [[French Foreign Legion]]. [[Robert Aldrich]] worked on the movie as a production manager.\n\nThe second was 1952's ''[[The First Time (1952 film)|The First Time]]'', a comedy which was the directorial debut of [[Frank Tashlin]].

The first film under the new name was another swashbuckler: 1952's ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'', directed by Siodmak. Co-starring Cravat, it was extremely popular.\n\nLancaster changed pace once more by doing a straight dramatic part in 1952's ''[[Come Back, Little Sheba (1952 film)|Come Back, Little Sheba]]'', based on a Broadway hit, with [[Shirley Booth]], produced by Wallis and directed by [[Daniel Mann]].\n\nAlternating with adventure films, he went into ''[[South Sea Woman]]'' in 1952 at Warners.

Four starred Lancaster: ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), a war film with [[Clark Gable]], directed by [[Robert Wise]], which was mildly popular; ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958), a hotel-set drama with Kerr and [[Rita Hayworth]] (who married James Hill), based on a play by [[Terence Rattigan]] which received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and Oscar awards for lead actor for [[David Niven]] and supporting actress [[Wendy Hiller]], and was both a critical and commercial success; ''[[The Devil's Disciple (1959 film)|The Devil's Disciple]]'' (1959), with Douglas and [[Laurence Olivier]], which lost money (and saw Lancaster fire Mackendirck during shooting);<ref>\"1959: Probable Domestic Take\", ''Variety'', January 6, 1960 p 34</ref> and the western ''[[The Unforgiven (1960 film)|The Unforgiven]]'' (1960), with [[Audrey Hepburn]], which was a critical and commercial disappointment.<ref>pp. 151\u2013152 Larkins, Bob &  Magers, Boyd ''The Films of Audie Murphy'' McFarland, August 19, 2009</ref>\n\nThree were made without Lancaster, all of which lost money: ''[[The Bachelor Party]]'' (1957), from another TV play by Chayefsky, and directed by Delbert Mann; ''[[Take a Giant Step]]'' (1959), about a black student; and ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll (1959 film)|Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' (1960), from an Australian play, shot in Australia and Britain.\n\nAdditionally, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster served as the production company for the 1960\u201361 TV series ''[[Whiplash (TV series)|Whiplash]]''.\n\nThe Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions company dissolved in 1960 after Hill ruptured his relationship with both Hecht and Lancaster.<ref>Hill went on to produce a single additional film, ''[[The Happy Thieves]]'', in a new production company, Hillworth Productions, co-owned with his wife [[Rita Hayworth]].</ref>\n\n===Hecht and Lancaster===\n[[File:Burt Lancaster 1960.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of Lancaster after he won an Oscar for ''Elmer Gantry'' (1960). Artist: [[Nicholas Volpe]]]]\nLancaster played the title role in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]'' (1960), written and directed by Richard Brooks for United Artists. The film received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor. Lancaster won the [[33rd Academy Awards|1960 Academy Award]] for Best Actor, a Golden Globe Award, and the [[New York Film Critics Award]] for his performance.\n\nHecht and Lancaster worked together on ''[[The Young Savages]]'' (1961), directed by [[John Frankenheimer]] and produced by Hecht. [[Sydney Pollack]] worked as a dialogue coach.\n\nLancaster starred in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961) for [[Stanley Kramer]], alongside [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Richard Widmark]] and a number of other iconic stars. The film was both a commercial and critical success, receiving 11 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.\n\nHe then did another film with Hecht and Frankenheimer (replacing [[Charles Crichton]]), ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962), a largely fictionalized biography. In it he plays [[Robert Stroud]], a federal prisoner incarcerated for life for two murders, who begins to collect birds and over time becomes an expert in bird diseases even publishing a book. The film shows Stroud transferred to the maximum security Alcatraz prison where he is not allowed to keep birds and as he ages he gets married, markets bird remedies, helps stop a prison rebellion, and writes a book on the history of the U.S. penal system, but never gets paroled. The sympathetic performance earned Lancaster a Best Actor Oscar nomination, a BAFTA Award for Best Actor, and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Dramatic Role. Hecht went on to produce five films without Lancaster's assistance, through his company Harold Hecht Films Productions between 1961 and 1967, including another Academy Award winner, ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', starring [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Jane Fonda]].\n\n===Collaborations with younger filmmakers===\nLancaster made ''[[A Child Is Waiting]]'' (1963) with [[Judy Garland]].

Based on ''Black Guard'', the first in a series of six novels of [[Wicked City (novel)|the same name]] by [[Hideyuki Kikuchi]], the film is the solo [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] of [[Yoshiaki Kawajiri]], who also served as the [[character designer]], [[storyboard artist]], [[animation director]] and a key [[animator]].\n\nThe story takes place towards the end of the 20th century and explores the idea that the human world secretly coexists with the [[demon]] world with a secret police force known as the Black Guard protecting the boundary.\n\n==Plot==\nThe existence of the \"Black World\"\u2014an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]] populated by supernatural demons\u2014is known to few humans. For centuries, a peace treaty between the Black World and the world of humans has been maintained to ensure relative harmony. Both sides of the continuum are protected by an organization of [[secret agent]]s called the Black Guard, specifically from a group of radicalized members of the Black World.\n\nRenzabur\u014d Taki, a [[salaryman]] electronics salesman by day, and a Black Guard when needed, has [[casual sex]] with Kanako, a young woman who he has been meeting at a local bar for three months. Kanako reveals herself to be a [[spider]]-like doppelg\u00e4nger from the Black World Radicals and escapes with a sample of Taki's [[semen]]. The next day, Taki is assigned to protect Giuseppe Mayart, a [[comic relief|comical]] and perverted two-hundred-year-old mystic who is a signatory for a ratified treaty between the Human World and the Black World in [[Tokyo]], and a target for the Radicals. Taki is also informed that he will be working with a partner: a Black Guard from the Black World.\n\nWhile awaiting Mayart's arrival at [[Narita Airport|Narita]], Taki is attacked by two Radicals at the [[runway]], but is saved by his partner\u2014a beautiful [[fashion model]] named Makie. Taki and Makie eventually meet Mayart; the trio take shelter in a [[Hibiya]] hotel with spiritual barriers to protect it from Radicals. While playing chess to pass time, the hotelier explains to Taki, who is unsure of his responsibilities within the Black Guard, that he will only value his position once he knows what he is protecting. During an assault on the hotel by a Radical, Mayart sneaks out.\n\nMakie and Taki find him in a [[soapland]] in the grip of a Radical who has sapped his health, prompting a frantic trip to a spiritual hospital under Black Guard protection. Halfway there, Makie is taken prisoner by a [[tentacle erotica|tentacle demon]], and Taki is forced to leave her behind. Upon their arrival at the clinic, Mayart begins his recovery, while Mr. Shadow\u2014the leader of the Radicals\u2014uses a psychic projection to taunt Taki into rescuing Makie. Ignoring Mayart's threats that he will be fired, he pursues Shadow to a dilapidated building far from the hospital, where he finds Makie being [[gang rape]]d by Radicals. A female Radical attempts to seduce Taki, asking him if he ever copulated with Makie, but he kills her and the Radicals violating Makie, and wounds Shadow.\n\nWhile tending to each other, Makie reveals to Taki that she was once romantically involved with a member of the Radicals, and that she joined the Black Guard because of her belief in the need for peace between the two worlds. Upon returning to the clinic, the pair are fired by Taki's superior, who deems Taki's desires a liability to his duties. While driving through a tunnel with a stowaway Mayart, they are ensnared by Kanako, who\u2014having determined that Taki and Makie were partnered for genetic reasons\u2014attempts to kill them again. Bolts of supernatural lightning kill Kanako, while Taki and Makie are wounded. They later awaken inside a church, and engage in passionate lovemaking.\n\nA final attack by Shadow comes against Taki and Makie, which is deflected by more lighting generated by a surprisingly healthy Mayart, who reveals that he was actually hired to protect his \"bodyguards\". Mayart and Taki almost succeed in defeating Shadow, but the final blow comes from Makie, whose powers have increased due to her being impregnated by Taki. Mayart explains that the two are essential to the new peace treaty; Taki and Makie were selected to be the first couple from both worlds that can produce half-human, half-demon children, and their bond will be instrumental in ensuring everlasting peace between the two worlds. Although angry with Mayart because they were not informed of the Black Guard's plans, Taki implicitly admits that he has fallen for Makie and, per the hotelier's advice, wants to protect her and their child. The trio leave to attend the peace ceremony. Taki remains in the Black Guard to ensure the protection of both worlds and his loved ones.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character !!

Based on ''Black Guard'', the first in a series of six novels of [[Wicked City (novel)|the same name]] by [[Hideyuki Kikuchi]], the film is the solo [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] of [[Yoshiaki Kawajiri]], who also served as the [[character designer]], [[storyboard artist]], [[animation director]] and a key [[animator]].\n\nThe story takes place towards the end of the 20th century and explores the idea that the human world secretly coexists with the [[demon]] world with a secret police force known as the Black Guard protecting the boundary.\n\n==Plot==\nThe existence of the \"Black World\"\u2014an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]] populated by supernatural demons\u2014is known to few humans. For centuries, a peace treaty between the Black World and the world of humans has been maintained to ensure relative harmony. Both sides of the continuum are protected by an organization of [[secret agent]]s called the Black Guard, specifically from a group of radicalized members of the Black World.\n\nRenzabur\u014d Taki, a [[salaryman]] electronics salesman by day, and a Black Guard when needed, has [[casual sex]] with Kanako, a young woman who he has been meeting at a local bar for three months. Kanako reveals herself to be a [[spider]]-like doppelg\u00e4nger from the Black World Radicals and escapes with a sample of Taki's [[semen]]. The next day, Taki is assigned to protect Giuseppe Mayart, a [[comic relief|comical]] and perverted two-hundred-year-old mystic who is a signatory for a ratified treaty between the Human World and the Black World in [[Tokyo]], and a target for the Radicals. Taki is also informed that he will be working with a partner: a Black Guard from the Black World.\n\nWhile awaiting Mayart's arrival at [[Narita Airport|Narita]], Taki is attacked by two Radicals at the [[runway]], but is saved by his partner\u2014a beautiful [[fashion model]] named Makie. Taki and Makie eventually meet Mayart; the trio take shelter in a [[Hibiya]] hotel with spiritual barriers to protect it from Radicals. While playing chess to pass time, the hotelier explains to Taki, who is unsure of his responsibilities within the Black Guard, that he will only value his position once he knows what he is protecting. During an assault on the hotel by a Radical, Mayart sneaks out.\n\nMakie and Taki find him in a [[soapland]] in the grip of a Radical who has sapped his health, prompting a frantic trip to a spiritual hospital under Black Guard protection. Halfway there, Makie is taken prisoner by a [[tentacle erotica|tentacle demon]], and Taki is forced to leave her behind. Upon their arrival at the clinic, Mayart begins his recovery, while Mr. Shadow\u2014the leader of the Radicals\u2014uses a psychic projection to taunt Taki into rescuing Makie. Ignoring Mayart's threats that he will be fired, he pursues Shadow to a dilapidated building far from the hospital, where he finds Makie being [[gang rape]]d by Radicals. A female Radical attempts to seduce Taki, asking him if he ever copulated with Makie, but he kills her and the Radicals violating Makie, and wounds Shadow.\n\nWhile tending to each other, Makie reveals to Taki that she was once romantically involved with a member of the Radicals, and that she joined the Black Guard because of her belief in the need for peace between the two worlds. Upon returning to the clinic, the pair are fired by Taki's superior, who deems Taki's desires a liability to his duties. While driving through a tunnel with a stowaway Mayart, they are ensnared by Kanako, who\u2014having determined that Taki and Makie were partnered for genetic reasons\u2014attempts to kill them again. Bolts of supernatural lightning kill Kanako, while Taki and Makie are wounded. They later awaken inside a church, and engage in passionate lovemaking.\n\nA final attack by Shadow comes against Taki and Makie, which is deflected by more lighting generated by a surprisingly healthy Mayart, who reveals that he was actually hired to protect his \"bodyguards\". Mayart and Taki almost succeed in defeating Shadow, but the final blow comes from Makie, whose powers have increased due to her being impregnated by Taki. Mayart explains that the two are essential to the new peace treaty; Taki and Makie were selected to be the first couple from both worlds that can produce half-human, half-demon children, and their bond will be instrumental in ensuring everlasting peace between the two worlds. Although angry with Mayart because they were not informed of the Black Guard's plans, Taki implicitly admits that he has fallen for Makie and, per the hotelier's advice, wants to protect her and their child. The trio leave to attend the peace ceremony. Taki remains in the Black Guard to ensure the protection of both worlds and his loved ones.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character !!

Savlov stated that the film was easier to follow than ''[[Urotsukid\u014dji]]: Legend of the Overfiend'', due to ''Wicked City''{{'s}} more linear and rapid storyline, and the lack of flashbacks and [[cyberpunk]] jargon that Savlov disliked in the genre. Savlov also appreciated the clarified animation. Savlov commented, \"This may not be the second coming of ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', but it's a step in the right direction.\"<ref>Savlov, Marc (February 4, 1994).

Arrington thought that the visuals and the fight scenes were generally done well, and that the dubbing into English was acceptable, though exhibited some \"wooden elements\" endemic to all anime titles. Regarding the sexual violence in the film, Arrington found it excluded recommendation for most viewers, commenting, \"Though not nearly as gruesome as ''Legend of the Overfiend'', ''Wicked City'' is definitely not for children and not really for adults either.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Arrington, Chuck|title= Wicked City|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|date=December 3, 2000 |url= https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/1369/wicked-city/|accessdate=2012-06-01}}</ref>\n\nTheron Martin of ''[[Anime News Network]]'' said that \"in all, ''Wicked City'' isn't great fare, but if explicit, sexually-charged supernatural action stories appeal to you then it should fit the bill quite nicely.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://animenewsnetwork.com/review/wicked-city/dvd-remastered-special-edition/.98543|title= Wicked City DVD - Remastered Special Edition|first= Theron|last= Martin|date= March 13, 2016|accessdate= March 14, 2016|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>\n\n==Related films==\n''[[The Wicked City (1992 film)|Wicked City]]'', a Hong Kong live-action adaptation of the film was made in 1992 produced by [[Film Workshop]] Ltd.
