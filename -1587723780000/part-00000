These absorbed photons generally come from background continuum radiation (the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation) and a spectrum will show a drop in the continuum radiation at the wavelength associated with the absorbed photons.\n\nThe two states must be [[bound state]]s in which the electron is bound to the atom or molecule, so the transition is sometimes referred to as a \"bound\u2013bound\" transition, as opposed to a transition in which the electron is ejected out of the atom completely (\"bound\u2013free\" transition) into a [[continuous spectrum|continuum]] state, leaving an [[ionization|ionized]] atom, and generating continuum radiation.\n\nA [[photon]] with an energy equal to the difference {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>1</sub>}} between the energy levels is released or absorbed in the process.

In strict thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation field is said to be [[black-body radiation]] and is described by [[Planck's law]]. For local thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation field does not have to be a black-body field, but the rate of interatomic collisions must vastly exceed the rates of absorption and emission of quanta of light, so that the interatomic collisions entirely dominate the distribution of states of atomic excitation. Circumstances occur in which local thermodynamic equilibrium does not prevail, because the strong radiative effects overwhelm the tendency to the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] of molecular velocities. For example, in the atmosphere of the Sun, the great strength of the radiation dominates. In the upper atmosphere of the Earth, at altitudes over 100&nbsp;km, the rarity of intermolecular collisions is decisive.\n\nIn the cases of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] and of [[local thermodynamic equilibrium]], the number densities of the atoms, both excited and unexcited, may be calculated from the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]], but for other cases, (e.g. [[laser]]s) the calculation is more complicated.\n\n== Einstein coefficients ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Stimulated emission]] -->\nIn 1916, [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that there are three processes occurring in the formation of an atomic spectral line.

The process is described by the Einstein coefficient ''A''<sub>21</sub> (''s''<sup>&minus;1</sup>), which gives the probability per unit time that an electron in state 2 with energy <math>E_2</math> will decay spontaneously to state 1 with energy <math>E_1</math>, emitting a photon with an energy {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''h\u03bd''}}. Due to the [[Uncertainty Principle#Energy-time uncertainty principle|energy-time uncertainty principle]], the transition actually produces photons within a narrow range of frequencies called the [[spectral linewidth]].

From the thermodynamic viewpoint, this process must be regarded as negative absorption.

Therefore, any relationship that we can derive between the coefficients at, say, thermodynamic equilibrium will be valid universally.\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, we will have a simple balancing, in which the net change in the number of any excited atoms is zero, being balanced by loss and gain due to all processes. With respect to bound-bound transitions, we will have [[detailed balance|detailed balancing]] as well, which states that the net exchange between any two levels will be balanced. This is because the probabilities of transition cannot be affected by the presence or absence of other excited atoms. Detailed balance (valid only at equilibrium) requires that the change in time of the number of atoms in level 1 due to the above three processes be zero:\n\n:<math>0 = A_{21} n_2 + B_{21} n_2 \\rho(\\nu) - B_{12} n_1 \\rho(\\nu).</math>\n\nAlong with detailed balancing, at temperature {{math|''T''}} we may use our knowledge of the equilibrium energy distribution of the atoms, as stated in the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]], and the equilibrium distribution of the photons, as stated in [[Planck's law of black body radiation]] to derive universal relationships between the Einstein coefficients.\n\nFrom Boltzmann distribution we have for the number of excited atomic species ''i'':\n\n: <math>\\frac{n_i}{n} = \\frac{g_i e^{-E_i/kT}}{Z},</math>\n\nwhere ''n'' is the total number density of the atomic species, excited and unexcited, ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is the [[temperature]], <math>g_i</math> is the degeneracy (also called the multiplicity) of state ''i'', and ''Z'' is the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]].

In strict thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation field is said to be [[black-body radiation]] and is described by [[Planck's law]]. For local thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation field does not have to be a black-body field, but the rate of interatomic collisions must vastly exceed the rates of absorption and emission of quanta of light, so that the interatomic collisions entirely dominate the distribution of states of atomic excitation. Circumstances occur in which local thermodynamic equilibrium does not prevail, because the strong radiative effects overwhelm the tendency to the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] of molecular velocities. For example, in the atmosphere of the Sun, the great strength of the radiation dominates. In the upper atmosphere of the Earth, at altitudes over 100&nbsp;km, the rarity of intermolecular collisions is decisive.\n\nIn the cases of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] and of [[local thermodynamic equilibrium]], the number densities of the atoms, both excited and unexcited, may be calculated from the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]], but for other cases, (e.g. [[laser]]s) the calculation is more complicated.\n\n== Einstein coefficients ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Stimulated emission]] -->\nIn 1916, [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that there are three processes occurring in the formation of an atomic spectral line.

The process is described by the Einstein coefficient ''A''<sub>21</sub> (''s''<sup>&minus;1</sup>), which gives the probability per unit time that an electron in state 2 with energy <math>E_2</math> will decay spontaneously to state 1 with energy <math>E_1</math>, emitting a photon with an energy {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''h\u03bd''}}. Due to the [[Uncertainty Principle#Energy-time uncertainty principle|energy-time uncertainty principle]], the transition actually produces photons within a narrow range of frequencies called the [[spectral linewidth]]. If <math>n_i</math> is the number density of atoms in state ''i'' , then the change in the number density of atoms in state 2 per unit time due to spontaneous emission will be\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{dn_2}{dt}\\right)_\\text{spontaneous} = -A_{21} n_2.</math>\n\nThe same process results in increasing of the population of the state 1:\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{dn_1}{dt}\\right)_\\text{spontaneous} = A_{21} n_2.</math>\n\n=== Stimulated emission ===\n{{main article|Stimulated emission}}\n[[File:AtomicLineInEm.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of atomic stimulated emission]]\n[[Stimulated emission]] (also known as induced emission) is the process by which an electron is induced to jump from a higher energy level to a lower one by the presence of electromagnetic radiation at (or near) the frequency of the transition. From the thermodynamic viewpoint, this process must be regarded as negative absorption.  The process is described by the Einstein coefficient <math>B_{21}</math> (m<sup>3</sup> J<sup>&minus;1</sup> s<sup>&minus;2</sup>), which gives the probability per unit time per unit spectral radiance of the radiation field that an electron in state 2 with energy <math>E_2</math> will decay to state 1 with energy <math>E_1</math>, emitting a photon with an energy {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''h\u03bd''}}. The change in the number density of atoms in state 1 per unit time due to induced emission will be\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{dn_1}{dt}\\right)_\\text{neg. absorb.} = B_{21} n_2 \\rho(\\nu),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho(\\nu)</math> denotes the radiance in a 1 Hz bandwidth of the isotropic radiation field at the frequency of the transition (see [[Planck's law]]).\n\nStimulated emission is one of the fundamental processes that led to the development of the [[laser]]. Laser radiation is, however, very far from the present case of isotropic radiation.\n\n=== Photon absorption ===\n{{main article|Absorption (optics)}}\n[[File:AtomicLineAb.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of atomic absorption]]\nAbsorption is the process by which a photon is absorbed by the atom, causing an electron to jump from a lower energy level to a higher one. The process is described by the Einstein coefficient <math>B_{12}</math> (J<sup>&minus;1</sup> m<sup>2</sup> ), which gives the probability per unit time per unit spectral radiance of the radiation field that an electron in state 1 with energy <math>E_1</math> will absorb a photon with an energy {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''h\u03bd''}} and jump to state 2 with energy <math>E_2</math>. The change in the number density of atoms in state 1 per unit time due to absorption will be\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{dn_1}{dt}\\right)_\\text{pos. absorb.} = -B_{12} n_1 \\rho(\\nu).</math>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Detailed balancing ==\nThe Einstein coefficients are fixed probabilities per time associated with each atom, and do not depend on the state of the gas of which the atoms are a part. Therefore, any relationship that we can derive between the coefficients at, say, thermodynamic equilibrium will be valid universally.\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, we will have a simple balancing, in which the net change in the number of any excited atoms is zero, being balanced by loss and gain due to all processes. With respect to bound-bound transitions, we will have [[detailed balance|detailed balancing]] as well, which states that the net exchange between any two levels will be balanced. This is because the probabilities of transition cannot be affected by the presence or absence of other excited atoms. Detailed balance (valid only at equilibrium) requires that the change in time of the number of atoms in level 1 due to the above three processes be zero:\n\n:<math>0 = A_{21} n_2 + B_{21} n_2 \\rho(\\nu) - B_{12} n_1 \\rho(\\nu).</math>\n\nAlong with detailed balancing, at temperature {{math|''T''}} we may use our knowledge of the equilibrium energy distribution of the atoms, as stated in the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]], and the equilibrium distribution of the photons, as stated in [[Planck's law of black body radiation]] to derive universal relationships between the Einstein coefficients.\n\nFrom Boltzmann distribution we have for the number of excited atomic species ''i'':\n\n: <math>\\frac{n_i}{n} = \\frac{g_i e^{-E_i/kT}}{Z},</math>\n\nwhere ''n'' is the total number density of the atomic species, excited and unexcited, ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is the [[temperature]], <math>g_i</math> is the degeneracy (also called the multiplicity) of state ''i'', and ''Z'' is the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]].

The car was engineered by Nissan's [[Aichi Kokuki|Aichi Manufacturing Division]] and launched in 1991 as compact passenger van, and it grew larger with each generation over the years. Earlier versions were [[front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] with a [[beam axle|live axle]] mounted on [[leaf spring]]s.\n\nLater versions had a multilink [[Independent suspension|independent rear suspension]], and were [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-wheel drive]] or [[Four-wheel drive|4WD]]. The most popular version was the 2.3&nbsp;L diesel engine version and it was unusual in that it had eight seats instead of the expected seven.\n\nIt is a \"junior\" model to the [[Nissan Elgrand]] in Japan; its name is from the Latin word ''\"[[wikt:serenus|ser\u0113nus]]\"'', meaning \"clear, tranquil, pleasant\" and offers a minivan approach in comparison to the [[Nissan Lafesta]] which is an MPV.\n\nThe Serena is designed to comply with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese vehicle class]], which means its external dimensions are restricted to 4.7 m in length and 1.7 m in width.\n\n== {{anchor|C23}} First generation (C23; 1991\u20132000) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = Nissan Serena, Denpasar (cropped).jpg\n| caption = Nissan Serena 1.6i FGX (Indonesia)\n| aka = {{ubl | Nissan Vanette Cargo/E | Nissan Vanette Serena | LDV Cub }}\nOtokar Nissan Largo (Turkey)\nSadahatama Oba Mage (Sri Lanka) \n| production = 1991\u20132000\n| assembly = Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]] ([[Nissan#Manufacturing locdations|Oppama Plant]])<br />Spain: [[Barcelona]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[van]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout#Front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| engine = {{ubl | '''[[Petrol engine|Petrol]]''': | 1.6&nbsp;L [[Nissan GA engine#GA16DE|''GA16DE'']] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 2.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan SR engine|''SR20DE'']] I4 | '''[[Diesel engine|Diesel]]''': | 2.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan CD engine#CD20|''CD20'']] I4 | 2.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan CD engine#CD20T|''CD20T'']]/[[Nissan CD engine#CD20ET|''CD20ET'']] [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4 }}\n| transmission = {{ubl|5-speed manual|4-speed automatic}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2735|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4355|-|4380|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1825|-|1915|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{ubl|{{convert|1250|-|1610|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (2WD)|{{convert|1610|-|1730|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (4WD)}}\n| successor = [[Renault Trafic|Nissan Primastar]] (Europe)\n}}\n[[File:Nissan Serena C23 (rear).jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Serena C23 rear]]\nModels were manufactured in Japan from 1991 onwards, and many were imported into Australasia and the United Kingdom. Nissan produced many different trim levels - FX, SX etc. Full-Auto (full-time) 4WD versions were also produced providing greater stability and better handling. The naturally aspirated 2.3&nbsp;L diesel was never manufactured for the Japanese market and its seating arrangement and interior fittings are not the same as the 2.0&nbsp;L petrol (SR20DE), 2.0&nbsp;L diesel [[Nissan CD engine#CD20|CD20]] and turbo-diesel [[Nissan CD engine#CD20T|CD20T]] models manufactured in Japan for the local market. It was exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealerships called ''Nissan Bluebird Store'.'\n\nThroughout its production the C23 model underwent several facelifts although the interior design and body largely remained unchanged, for example, addition of airbags and bench seats for the second and third rows. Each facelift model can be identified by front grille design which was updated in 1994 and 1997.\n\nIn European markets, the C23 Serena had 1.6 or 2.0&nbsp;L petrols, or 2.3&nbsp;L diesel engines LD23. Trim levels were LX, SLX, SGX and SGXi. ''[[Auto Express]]'' once named the Serena as the slowest passenger car in the benchmark 0-60&nbsp;mph (now 62&nbsp;mph) test, with the 2.3&nbsp;L diesel version (added in the mid 1990s) taking 27.8 seconds to reach that speed.\n\nUntil around 2002, the standard petrol engine was an [[Nissan SR engine|SR20DE]]. A variety of other engines were used over the years, including [[Diesel engine|diesels]] specifically the [[Nissan CD engine#CD20|CD20]] (for the commercial van version), [[Nissan CD engine#CD20T|CD20T]] 1,973&nbsp;cc Diesel Turbo, and the [[Nissan CD engine#CD20ET|CD20ET]].\n\n===Europe===\nThe '''Nissan Vanette''' was a series of small vans manufactured in [[Spain]] by Nissan alongside the European market Serena models. The van was produced in two versions, the Vanette E, which shared the basic body shell with the Nissan Serena people carrier, differing only in not having rear windows and passenger seats, and the Vanette Cargo, which was longer and had a higher roof line from behind the front seats.\n\nIn June 1998, [[LDV Group]] entered into an agreement with Nissan, to sell a rebranded version of the Vanette Cargo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/1998/6/24/ldv-to-launch-own-version-of-nissan-cargo-one-tonne-van/3517/|title=LDV to launch own version of Nissan Cargo one-tonne van|publisher=fleetnews.co.uk|website=FleetNews UK|date=24 June 1998|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> This was named the LDV Cub, alongside the Vanette, it was sold in Britain. The model was discontinued in 2001, and replaced by a rebadged version of the [[Renault Trafic|Opel Vivaro/Renault Trafic]], called the Nissan Primastar, which is produced in [[Luton]], England and [[Barcelona]], Spain.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:1995 Nissan Vanette Cargo Diesel 2.3 Front.jpg|Nissan Vanette Cargo (pre-facelift)\nFile:1995 Nissan Vanette Cargo Diesel 2.3 Rear.jpg|Nissan Vanette Cargo (pre-facelift)\nFile:2001 Nissan Vanette E 2.4.jpg|Nissan Vanette E (facelift)\nFile:2001 LDV Cub Diesel 2.3 Front.jpg|LDV Cub\n</gallery>\n\n===Reputation===\nThe Nissan Serena Mk1 is said to have an [[reputation|image]] problem by some, in particular ''[[Fifth Gear]]'' presenter [[Quentin Willson]], who remarked in a 1997 ''[[Top Gear (1977 TV Series)|Top Gear]]'' episode that ''\"...the Nissan Serena was about as seductive as a [[Skip (container)|skip]] and as desirable as an old shoe.\"''\n\nBy 2000, the Nissan Serena was described as the worst new car sale on Britain, by ''Top Gear'''s ''Buyers Guide'', with \"absolutely nothing to recommend it for\".\n\nAlthough the Nissan Serena handles better than most people expect it to (due to its mid-mounted engine), its power-to-weight ratio is particularly poor, as shown by the 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h averages listed below. The only models with marginally acceptable acceleration are powered by the SR20DE engine.\n\n===Nissan Largo===\n'''Largo''' was the model name used for a Nissan passenger van based on the C23 Serena between 1992 and 1998.

The most popular version was the 2.3&nbsp;L diesel engine version and it was unusual in that it had eight seats instead of the expected seven.\n\nIt is a \"junior\" model to the [[Nissan Elgrand]] in Japan; its name is from the Latin word ''\"[[wikt:serenus|ser\u0113nus]]\"'', meaning \"clear, tranquil, pleasant\" and offers a minivan approach in comparison to the [[Nissan Lafesta]] which is an MPV.\n\nThe Serena is designed to comply with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese vehicle class]], which means its external dimensions are restricted to 4.7 m in length and 1.7 m in width.\n\n== {{anchor|C23}} First generation (C23; 1991\u20132000) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = Nissan Serena, Denpasar (cropped).jpg\n| caption = Nissan Serena 1.6i FGX (Indonesia)\n| aka = {{ubl | Nissan Vanette Cargo/E | Nissan Vanette Serena | LDV Cub }}\nOtokar Nissan Largo (Turkey)\n| production = 1991\u20132000\n| assembly = Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]] ([[Nissan#Manufacturing locdations|Oppama Plant]])<br />Spain: [[Barcelona]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[van]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout#Front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| engine = {{ubl | '''[[Petrol engine|Petrol]]''': | 1.6&nbsp;L [[Nissan GA engine#GA16DE|''GA16DE'']] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 2.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan SR engine|''SR20DE'']] I4 | '''[[Diesel engine|Diesel]]''': | 2.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan CD engine#CD20|''CD20'']] I4 | 2.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan CD engine#CD20T|''CD20T'']]/[[Nissan CD engine#CD20ET|''CD20ET'']] [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4 }}\n| transmission = {{ubl|5-speed manual|4-speed automatic}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2735|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4355|-|4380|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1825|-|1915|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{ubl|{{convert|1250|-|1610|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (2WD)|{{convert|1610|-|1730|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (4WD)}}\n| successor = [[Renault Trafic|Nissan Primastar]] (Europe)\n}}\n[[File:Nissan Serena C23 (rear).jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Serena C23 rear]]\nModels were manufactured in Japan from 1991 onwards, and many were imported into Australasia and the United Kingdom. Nissan produced many different trim levels - FX, SX etc. Full-Auto (full-time) 4WD versions were also produced providing greater stability and better handling. The naturally aspirated 2.3&nbsp;L diesel was never manufactured for the Japanese market and its seating arrangement and interior fittings are not the same as the 2.0&nbsp;L petrol (SR20DE), 2.0&nbsp;L diesel [[Nissan CD engine#CD20|CD20]] and turbo-diesel [[Nissan CD engine#CD20T|CD20T]] models manufactured in Japan for the local market. It was exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealerships called ''Nissan Bluebird Store'.'\n\nThroughout its production the C23 model underwent several facelifts although the interior design and body largely remained unchanged, for example, addition of airbags and bench seats for the second and third rows. Each facelift model can be identified by front grille design which was updated in 1994 and 1997.\n\nIn European markets, the C23 Serena had 1.6 or 2.0&nbsp;L petrols, or 2.3&nbsp;L diesel engines LD23. Trim levels were LX, SLX, SGX and SGXi. ''[[Auto Express]]'' once named the Serena as the slowest passenger car in the benchmark 0-60&nbsp;mph (now 62&nbsp;mph) test, with the 2.3&nbsp;L diesel version (added in the mid 1990s) taking 27.8 seconds to reach that speed.\n\nUntil around 2002, the standard petrol engine was an [[Nissan SR engine|SR20DE]]. A variety of other engines were used over the years, including [[Diesel engine|diesels]] specifically the [[Nissan CD engine#CD20|CD20]] (for the commercial van version), [[Nissan CD engine#CD20T|CD20T]] 1,973&nbsp;cc Diesel Turbo, and the [[Nissan CD engine#CD20ET|CD20ET]].\n\n===Europe===\nThe '''Nissan Vanette''' was a series of small vans manufactured in [[Spain]] by Nissan alongside the European market Serena models. The van was produced in two versions, the Vanette E, which shared the basic body shell with the Nissan Serena people carrier, differing only in not having rear windows and passenger seats, and the Vanette Cargo, which was longer and had a higher roof line from behind the front seats.\n\nIn June 1998, [[LDV Group]] entered into an agreement with Nissan, to sell a rebranded version of the Vanette Cargo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/1998/6/24/ldv-to-launch-own-version-of-nissan-cargo-one-tonne-van/3517/|title=LDV to launch own version of Nissan Cargo one-tonne van|publisher=fleetnews.co.uk|website=FleetNews UK|date=24 June 1998|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> This was named the LDV Cub, alongside the Vanette, it was sold in Britain. The model was discontinued in 2001, and replaced by a rebadged version of the [[Renault Trafic|Opel Vivaro/Renault Trafic]], called the Nissan Primastar, which is produced in [[Luton]], England and [[Barcelona]], Spain.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:1995 Nissan Vanette Cargo Diesel 2.3 Front.jpg|Nissan Vanette Cargo (pre-facelift)\nFile:1995 Nissan Vanette Cargo Diesel 2.3 Rear.jpg|Nissan Vanette Cargo (pre-facelift)\nFile:2001 Nissan Vanette E 2.4.jpg|Nissan Vanette E (facelift)\nFile:2001 LDV Cub Diesel 2.3 Front.jpg|LDV Cub\n</gallery>\n\n===Reputation===\nThe Nissan Serena Mk1 is said to have an [[reputation|image]] problem by some, in particular ''[[Fifth Gear]]'' presenter [[Quentin Willson]], who remarked in a 1997 ''[[Top Gear (1977 TV Series)|Top Gear]]'' episode that ''\"...the Nissan Serena was about as seductive as a [[Skip (container)|skip]] and as desirable as an old shoe.\"''\n\nBy 2000, the Nissan Serena was described as the worst new car sale on Britain, by ''Top Gear'''s ''Buyers Guide'', with \"absolutely nothing to recommend it for\".\n\nAlthough the Nissan Serena handles better than most people expect it to (due to its mid-mounted engine), its power-to-weight ratio is particularly poor, as shown by the 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h averages listed below. The only models with marginally acceptable acceleration are powered by the SR20DE engine.\n\n===Nissan Largo===\n'''Largo''' was the model name used for a Nissan passenger van based on the C23 Serena between 1992 and 1998. Unlike the previous Largo, which was essentially a widened C22 [[Nissan Vanette]], the W30 Largo was a totally rebodied, wider Serena with more equipment such as four-wheel-drive. It was exclusive to ''[[Nissan#Japan|Nissan Satio Store]]'' locations as a large load carrying vehicle next to the [[Nissan Sunny|Sunny]]. The Largo was available with either a 2.4-litre petrol or a 2.0-litre turbo-diesel, both mid engined (under the front seats).\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:Nissan Largo 1993.jpg|W30 Nissan Largo (pre-facelift)\nFile:Nissan Largo 001.JPG|W30 Nissan Largo Highway Star (facelift)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|C24}} Second generation (C24; 1999\u20132013) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation\n| image = 1999-2001 Nissan Serena.jpg\n| production = 1999\u20132005 (Japan)<br />2001\u20132012 (Taiwan)<br />Mid 2001\u20132013 (Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines)<br />2004\u20132012 (Indonesia)<br />2007\u2013present (China)\n| assembly = Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]] ([[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Oppama Plant]])<br />Indonesia: [[Purwakarta]] ([[Nissan Motor Indonesia]])<ref>{{cite web|title=Nissan Evalia akan Diproduksi di Indonesia |trans-title=Nissan to manufacture the Evalia in Indonesia | language = Indonesian | url=http://www.tempo.co/read/news/2012/04/05/124395046/Nissan-Evalia-akan-Diproduksi-di-Indonesia | publisher = tempo.co | date = 2012-04-05 | accessdate = 2012-09-06}}</ref><br />PRC:[[Zhengzhou, Henan]]([[Zhengzhou Nissan]])<br />Taiwan: [[Miaoli County|Miaoli]]<br />Malaysia: [[Kuala Lumpur]] ([[Tan Chong Motor#Segambut, Kuala Lumpur|TCMA]])<br />Thailand: [[Bangkok]]<br />Philippines: [[Manila]]\n| body_style = 5-door [[minivan]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, front-wheel-drive]]<br />[[Front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, four-wheel-drive]]\n| related = [[Dongfeng Yumsun]]<br />[[ZNA Succe]]\n| engine = {{ubl\n | 1.5&nbsp;L ''4A15'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan SR engine#SR20DE|SR20DE]]'' I4\n | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan QR engine#QR20DE|QR20DE]]'' I4\n | 2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan YD engine#YD25DDTi|YD25DDTi]]'' I4\n | 2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan QR engine#QR25DE|QR25DE]]'' I4\n }}\n| transmission = {{ubl | 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | [[Continuous variable transmission|Hyper CVT]] | 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] }}\n| wheelbase         = {{convert|2695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length            = {{convert|4590|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width             ={{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height            = {{convert|1825|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight            = {{convert|1580|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n[[File:Nissan Serena C24 002.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Serena C24 rear]]\nThe second generation Serena was launched in Japan in July 1999.
