This was despite the 2012\u20132016 OECD BEPS Project.

The concept of a corporate charging its costs from one jurisdiction against its profits in another jurisdiction (i.e. [[transfer pricing]]) is well understood and accepted.  However, IP enables a corporate to \"revalue\" its costs dramatically.  For example, a major piece of software might have cost US$1 billion to develop in salaries and overheads.  IP accounting enables the legal ownership of the software to be relocated to a tax haven where it can be revalued to being worth US$100 billion, which becomes the new price at which it is charged out against global profits; thus ''shifting'' all global profits back to the tax haven.

However, because of this, they are unable to sign full bilateral [[tax treaties]] with other higher-tax jurisdictions.  Instead, their tax treaties are restricted and limited so as to avoid the use of the tax haven (e.g. withholding taxes on transfers to the haven).  To solve this issue, other tax havens maintain higher non-zero \"headline\" rates of corporate taxation, but instead provide complex and confidential BEPS tools and PTRs which bring the \"effective\" corporate tax rate closer to zero; they all feature prominently in the leading jurisdictions for IP law (see graphic).  These \"corporate tax havens\" (or Conduit OFCs), further increase respectability by requiring the corporate using their BEPS tools/PTRs to main a \"substantial presence\" in the haven; this is called an [[Corporate tax haven#employment tax|employment tax]], and can cost the corporate circa 2\u20133% of revenues.   However, these initiatives enable the corporate tax haven to maintain large networks of full bilateral tax treaties, that allow corporates based in the haven to ''shift'' global untaxed profits back to the haven (and on to Sink OFCs, as shown above).  These \"corporate tax havens\" strongly deny any association with being a tax haven and maintain high levels of compliance and transparency, with many being OECD-whitelisted (and are OECD or EU members).  Many of the {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}} are \"corporate tax haves\".\n\n===Conduits and Sinks===\n{{Main|Conduit and Sink OFCs}}\nIn 2017, the [[University of Amsterdam]]'s [[CORPNET]] research group published the results of their multi-year [[big data]] analysis of over 98 million global corporate connections.  CORPNET ignored any prior definition of a tax haven or any legal or tax structuring concepts, to instead follow a purely quantitative approach.

While the legislation was effective, further US Treasury regulations were required in 2014\u20132016 to prevent the much larger [[merger tax inversion]]s, which culminated with the effective block of the proposed 2016 USD$160 billion of Pfizer-Allergan in Ireland.

The OECD BEPS Multilateral Instrument (\"MLI\"), was adopted on 24 November 2016 and has since been signed by over 78 jurisdictions; it came into force in July 2018.  The MLI has been criticised for \"watering down\" several of its proposed initiatives, including country\u2013by\u2013country\u2013reporting (\"CbCr\"), and for providing several opt-outs which several OECD and EU tax havens availed of.

In its press release, the OECD announced its proposals had the backing of the U.S., as well as China, Brazil, and India.  The new proposals contain more fundamental reforms to corporate taxation around the taxing of profits where a product is consumed, rather than where the product's value is created (as currently done).  While the EU had been a long-term advocate of this concept, the US had traditionally blocked it.  However, it is believed the passing of the 2017 TCJA has changed Washington's view on US corporate use of tax havens, who still remain the largest users of tax havens in the world.  In response to this new OECD initiative, the EU, and the French in particular, dropped their \"Digital Tax\" proposal in favour of allowing the OECD BEPS 2.0 initiative reach a conclusion, which it is scheduled to do by 2020.\n\n==History==\n===General phases===\nWhile areas of low taxation are recorded in Ancient Greece, tax academics identify what we know as tax havens as being a modern phenomenon,<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/><ref name=\"sol.piccolo\">{{cite book | author=Sol Piccolo | year=1992 | title=International Business Taxation | url=https://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Picciotto%201992%20International%20Business%20Taxation.pdf | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0899307770 | author-link=Sol Piccolo | access-date=23 April 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103035111/http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Picciotto%201992%20International%20Business%20Taxation.pdf | archive-date=3 January 2019 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and note the following phases in their development:\n\n* ''19th Century New Jersey and Delaware Corporations''.  In the 1880s, New Jersey was in financial difficulty and the Governor, [[Leon Abbett]], backed a plan by a New York lawyer, Mr. Dill, to create a more liberal regime for establishing corporate structures, including availability \"off-the-shelf companies\" (but not non-resident companies).  Delaware followed with the ''General Incorporation Act in 1898'', on the basis of lobbying from other New York lawyers.  Because of the restrictive incorporation regime in the Anglo-Saxon world as a result of the [[South Sea Bubble]], New Jersey and Delaware were successful, and though not explicitly tax havens (e.g. US Federal and State taxes applied), many future tax havens would copy their \"liberal\" incorporation regimes.<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/history-of-tax-havens|title=History of Tax Havens|author=Ronen Palan|publisher=History & Policy|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=23 April 2019|author-link=Ronen Palan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007200857/http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/history-of-tax-havens|archive-date=7 October 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* ''Post World War I''.  The modern concept of a tax haven is generally accepted to have emerged at an uncertain point in the immediate aftermath of [[World War I]].<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/><ref>\"[T]he tax haven is a creature of the twentieth century, and began to be used extensively because of the high levels of tax which prevailed after the First World War\" at para 26.1, ''Tolley's International Tax Planning'' (2002), {{ISBN|0-7545-1339-4}}</ref> [[Bermuda]] sometimes claims to have been the first tax haven based upon the creation of the first [[offshore company|offshore companies]] legislation in 1935 by the newly created law firm of [[Conyers Dill & Pearman]].<ref>See generally, Introduction to ''Tolley's International Initiatives Affecting Financial Havens'' (2001), {{ISBN|0-406-94264-1}}</ref> However most tax academics identify the Zurich-Zug-Liechtenstein triangle as the first \"tax haven hub\" created during the mid-1920s.<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/><ref>The ''Personen- und Gesellschaftsrecht'' of 20 January 1926</ref>  Liechtenstein's 1924 Civil Code created the infamous ''Anstalt'' corporate vehicle, while Zurich an Zug developed the ''Societ\u00e9 Anonyme'' and other [[Brass plate company|brass plate companies]].<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/>   Tax academic [[Ronen Palan]] identifies two of the three major groups of tax havens, as emerging during this period:\n:* ''British Empire-based tax havens''.  The 1929 court case of ''Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Co. Ltd. V. Todd'' in Britain created the \"non-resident corporation\" and recognised a British-registered company with no business activities in Britain is not liable to British taxation. Tax academic [[Sol Picciotto]] noted the creation of such \"non-resident\" companies was \"a loophole which, in a sense, made Britain a tax haven\".  The ruling applied to the British Empire, including Bermuda, Barbados, and The Cayman Islands.<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/><ref name=\"sol.piccolo\"/>\n:* ''European-based tax havens''. The Zurich-Zug-Litchenstien triangle expanded and was joined by Luxembourg in 1929 when they created tax-free ''holding companies''.<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/>  However in 1934, as a reaction to the global depression, the Swiss Banking Act of 1934 put bank secrecy under Swiss criminal law.<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/>  Secrecy and privacy would become an important and distinctive part of the European-based tax havens, in comparison with other tax havens.<ref name=\"sol.piccolo\"/>\n\n* ''Post World War II Offshore financial centres''.  Currency controls enacted post World War II led to the creation of the Eurodollar market and the rise in [[offshore financial centre]]s (OFCs).<ref name=\"imf\"/>  Many of these OFCs were traditional tax havens from the Post World War I phase, including The Caymans and Bermuda, however new centres such as Hong Kong, and Singapore began to emerge.<ref name=\"imf\"/>  London's position as a global [[financial centre]] for these OFCs was secured when the [[Bank of England]] ruled in 1957 that transactions executed by UK banks on behalf of a lender and borrower who were not located in the UK, were not to be officially viewed as having taken place in the UK for regulatory or tax purposes, even though the transaction was only ever recorded as taking place in London.<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/><ref name=\"sol.piccolo\"/><ref name=\"eurodollar\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/07/the-real-goldfinger-the-london-banker-who-broke-the-world|title=The real Goldfinger: the London banker who broke the world|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 September 2017|access-date=23 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331045225/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/07/the-real-goldfinger-the-london-banker-who-broke-the-world|archive-date=31 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  The rise of OFCs would continue so that by 2008, The Cayman Islands would be the 4th largest financial centre in the world, while Singapore and Hong Kong had become major [[Financial centre|Regional Financial Centre]]s (RFCs).<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/>  By 2010, tax academics would consider OFCs to be synonymous with tax havens, and that most of their services involved taxation.<ref name=\"missing profits\"/><ref name=\"nicholas.shaxson\"/>\n* ''Emerging economy-based tax havens''.  As well as the dramatic rise in OFCs, from the late 1960s onwards, new tax havens began to emerge to service developing and emerging markets, which became Palan's third group.  The first Pacific tax haven was [[Norfolk Island]] (1966), a self-governing external territory of Australia.  It was followed by Vanuatu (1970\u201371), Nauru (1972), the Cook Islands (1981), Tonga (1984), Samoa (1988), the Marshall Islands (1990), and Nauru (1994).<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/>  All these havens introduced familiar legislation modeled on the successful British Empire and European tax havens, including near-zero taxation for exempt companies, and non-residential companies, Swiss-style bank secrecy laws, trust companies laws, offshore insurance laws, flags of convenience for shipping fleets and aircraft leasing, and beneficial regulations for new online services (e.g. gambling, pornography, etc.).<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/><ref name=\"jason\">{{cite book|title=Havens in a Storm: The Struggle for Global Tax Regulation|author=Jason Sharman|year=2006|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|pages=224|jstor=10.7591/j.ctt7z6jm|chapter=The Struggle for Global Tax Regulation|isbn=9780801445040}}</ref>\n* ''Corporate-focused tax havens''.  In 1981, the US IRS published the ''Gordon Report'' on the use of tax havens by US taxpayers, which highlighted the use by tax havens by US corporations.<ref name=\"gordon2\"/>  In 1983, US corporation McDermott International executed the first [[tax inversion]] to Panama.<ref name=\"hallCBO\"/>  The EU Commission showed that Apple Inc. had begun to use the infamous [[Double Irish]] BEPS tool as early as 1991.  US tax academic [[James R. Hines Jr.]] showed in 1994 that US corporations were achieving effective rates of taxation of circa 4% in corporate-focused OECD tax havens like Ireland.<ref name=\"h3\"/>  When in 2004, the US Congress stopped \"naked tax inversions\" by US corporations to Caribbean tax havens with the introduction of IRS Regulation 7874, a much larger wave of US corporate \"merger inversions\" started that involved moving to OECD tax havens.<ref name=\"hallCBO\"/>  A new class of corporate tax haven had emerged that was OECD-compliant, transparent, but offered complex [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) tools that could achieve net tax rates similar to traditional tax havens.<ref name=\"jason\"/><ref name=\"nicholas.shaxson\"/>  Initiatives by the OECD to curb tax havens would mainly impact Palan's third group of ''Emerging economy-based tax havens'', however, the corporate-focused tax havens were drawn from the largest OFCs that had emerged from the ''British Empire-based tax havens'' and ''European-based tax havens'', and included the Netherlands, Singapore, Ireland, and the U.K., and even reformed traditional tax havens such as Luxembourg, Hong Kong, the Caribbean (the Cayman, Bermuda, and the British Virgin Islands) and Switzerland.<ref name=\"nicholas.shaxson\"/>  The scale of their BEPS activities meant that this group of 10 jurisdictions would dominate academic tax haven lists from 2010, including [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines 2010 list|Hines' 2010 list]], the [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Conduit and Sink OFC 2017 list]], and [[Gabriel Zucman#T\u00f8rsl\u00f8v-Wier-Zucman 2018 list|Zucman's 2018 list]].\n\n===Notable events===\n* 1929. British Courts rule in ''Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Co. Ltd. V. Todd.'' that a British-registered company with no business activities in Britain is not liable to British taxation.

The ruling applied to the British Empire, including Bermuda, Barbados, and The Cayman Islands.<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/>\n* 1934. As a reaction to the global depression, the Swiss Banking Act of 1934 put bank secrecy under Swiss criminal law. The law required \"absolute silence in respect to a professional secret\" (i.e. accounts in Swiss banks).  \"Absolute\" means protection from any government, including the Swiss. The law even made inquiry or research into the \"trade secrets\" of Swiss banks, a criminal offense.<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/>\n* 1981. The US Treasury and the US Attorney General are given: ''Tax havens and their use by United States taxpayers: An Overview'' by Richard A.

Research by Zucman and Wright (2018) estimated that most of the TCJA repatriation benefit went to the shareholders of U.S. multinationals, and not the U.S. exchequer.<ref name=\"zucwright\"/>{{efn|Zucman and Wright's analysis assumed that U.S. multinationals were going to pay a U.S. 35% rate eventually (e.g. they would repatriate their untaxed offshore cash at some stage in the future); if the assumption is made that they were going to permanently leave their offshore cash outside of the U.S., then the U.S. exchequer was the main beneficiary}}\n\nAcademics who study tax havens, attribute Washington's support of U.S. corporate use of tax havens to a \"[[Ireland as a tax haven#Source of contradictions|political compromise]]\" between Washington, and other higher-tax OECD nations, to compensate for shortcomings of the U.S. \"worldwide\" tax system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34115.pdf|title=Reform of U.S. International Taxation: Alternatives|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|author=Jane G.

This was despite the 2012\u20132016 OECD BEPS Project.  In 2015, Apple executed the largest recorded BEPS transaction in history when it moved US$300 billion of its IP to Ireland, in what was called a hybrid-tax inversion.\n\nThe largest [[Base erosion and profit shifting#Tools|BEPS tools]] are the ones that use [[intellectual property]] (IP) accounting to ''shift'' profits between jurisdictions.  The concept of a corporate charging its costs from one jurisdiction against its profits in another jurisdiction (i.e. [[transfer pricing]]) is well understood and accepted.  However, IP enables a corporate to \"revalue\" its costs dramatically.  For example, a major piece of software might have cost US$1 billion to develop in salaries and overheads.  IP accounting enables the legal ownership of the software to be relocated to a tax haven where it can be revalued to being worth US$100 billion, which becomes the new price at which it is charged out against global profits; thus ''shifting'' all global profits back to the tax haven.  IP has been described as \"the leading corporate tax avoidance vehicle\".<ref name=\"ucla\">{{cite journal | url=https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/62-1-1.pdf | page=4 | title=Intellectual Property Law Solutions to Tax Avoidance | journal=UCLA Law Review | volume=62 | issue=2 | date=2015 | author=Andrew Blair-Stanek | quote=Intellectual property (IP) has become the leading tax avoidance vehicle in the world today. | access-date=2 May 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316232500/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/62-1-1.pdf | archive-date=16 March 2015 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"fordam\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fordhamiplj.org/2016/08/30/ip-tax-avoidance-ireland/ | author=Ted Mulvany | title=Intellectual Property and Tax Avoidance in Ireland | publisher=[[Fordham Intellectual Property, Media & Entertainment Law Journal]] | date=30 August 2016 | accessdate=27 April 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502112434/http://www.fordhamiplj.org/2016/08/30/ip-tax-avoidance-ireland/ | archive-date=2 May 2019 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Corporate tax haven===\n{{Main|Corporate tax haven}}\n[[File:GIPC Intellectual Property 2018 (Patents Sub-Category).png|thumb|2018 [[Global Intellectual Property Center|Global Innovation Property Centre]] (GIPC) Legal Systems League Table: ''Patents'' Sub-Category.<ref name=\"gipc1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GIPC_IP_Index_2018.pdf|title=U.S. Chamber International IP Index, 6th Edition, 2018|publisher=[[Global Intellectual Property Center]]|date=February 2018|page=6|access-date=2 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218015504/http://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GIPC_IP_Index_2018.pdf|archive-date=18 December 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]\nTraditional tax havens, such as the Caribbean or Channel Island havens, are often clear about the tax-free nature of their status to individuals and corporates.  However, because of this, they are unable to sign full bilateral [[tax treaties]] with other higher-tax jurisdictions.  Instead, their tax treaties are restricted and limited so as to avoid the use of the tax haven (e.g. withholding taxes on transfers to the haven).  To solve this issue, other tax havens maintain higher non-zero \"headline\" rates of corporate taxation, but instead provide complex and confidential BEPS tools and PTRs which bring the \"effective\" corporate tax rate closer to zero; they all feature prominently in the leading jurisdictions for IP law (see graphic).  These \"corporate tax havens\" (or Conduit OFCs), further increase respectability by requiring the corporate using their BEPS tools/PTRs to main a \"substantial presence\" in the haven; this is called an [[Corporate tax haven#employment tax|employment tax]], and can cost the corporate circa 2\u20133% of revenues.   However, these initiatives enable the corporate tax haven to maintain large networks of full bilateral tax treaties, that allow corporates based in the haven to ''shift'' global untaxed profits back to the haven (and on to Sink OFCs, as shown above).  These \"corporate tax havens\" strongly deny any association with being a tax haven and maintain high levels of compliance and transparency, with many being OECD-whitelisted (and are OECD or EU members).  Many of the {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}} are \"corporate tax haves\".\n\n===Conduits and Sinks===\n{{Main|Conduit and Sink OFCs}}\nIn 2017, the [[University of Amsterdam]]'s [[CORPNET]] research group published the results of their multi-year [[big data]] analysis of over 98 million global corporate connections.  CORPNET ignored any prior definition of a tax haven or any legal or tax structuring concepts, to instead follow a purely quantitative approach.  CORPNET's results split the understanding of tax havens into [[Sink OFC]]s, which are traditional tax havens to which corporates route untaxed funds, and [[Conduit OFC]]s, which are the jurisdictions that create the OECD-compliant tax structures that enable the untaxed funds to be routed from the higher-tax jurisdictions to the Sink OFCs.  Despite following a purely quantitative approach, CORPNET's top 5 Conduit OFCs and top 5 Sink OFCs closely match the other academic {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}}.

While the legislation was effective, further US Treasury regulations were required in 2014\u20132016 to prevent the much larger [[merger tax inversion]]s, which culminated with the effective block of the proposed 2016 USD$160 billion of Pfizer-Allergan in Ireland.

The OECD BEPS Multilateral Instrument (\"MLI\"), was adopted on 24 November 2016 and has since been signed by over 78 jurisdictions; it came into force in July 2018.  The MLI has been criticised for \"watering down\" several of its proposed initiatives, including country\u2013by\u2013country\u2013reporting (\"CbCr\"), and for providing several opt-outs which several OECD and EU tax havens availed of.

In its press release, the OECD announced its proposals had the backing of the U.S., as well as China, Brazil, and India.  The new proposals contain more fundamental reforms to corporate taxation around the taxing of profits where a product is consumed, rather than where the product's value is created (as currently done).  While the EU had been a long-term advocate of this concept, the US had traditionally blocked it.  However, it is believed the passing of the 2017 TCJA has changed Washington's view on US corporate use of tax havens, who still remain the largest users of tax havens in the world.  In response to this new OECD initiative, the EU, and the French in particular, dropped their \"Digital Tax\" proposal in favour of allowing the OECD BEPS 2.0 initiative reach a conclusion, which it is scheduled to do by 2020.\n\n==History==\n===General phases===\nWhile areas of low taxation are recorded in Ancient Greece, tax academics identify what we know as tax havens as being a modern phenomenon,<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/><ref name=\"sol.piccolo\">{{cite book | author=Sol Piccolo | year=1992 | title=International Business Taxation | url=https://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Picciotto%201992%20International%20Business%20Taxation.pdf | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0899307770 | author-link=Sol Piccolo | access-date=23 April 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103035111/http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Picciotto%201992%20International%20Business%20Taxation.pdf | archive-date=3 January 2019 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and note the following phases in their development:\n\n* ''19th Century New Jersey and Delaware Corporations''.  In the 1880s, New Jersey was in financial difficulty and the Governor, [[Leon Abbett]], backed a plan by a New York lawyer, Mr. Dill, to create a more liberal regime for establishing corporate structures, including availability \"off-the-shelf companies\" (but not non-resident companies).  Delaware followed with the ''General Incorporation Act in 1898'', on the basis of lobbying from other New York lawyers.  Because of the restrictive incorporation regime in the Anglo-Saxon world as a result of the [[South Sea Bubble]], New Jersey and Delaware were successful, and though not explicitly tax havens (e.g. US Federal and State taxes applied), many future tax havens would copy their \"liberal\" incorporation regimes.<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/history-of-tax-havens|title=History of Tax Havens|author=Ronen Palan|publisher=History & Policy|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=23 April 2019|author-link=Ronen Palan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007200857/http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/history-of-tax-havens|archive-date=7 October 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* ''Post World War I''.  The modern concept of a tax haven is generally accepted to have emerged at an uncertain point in the immediate aftermath of [[World War I]].<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/><ref>\"[T]he tax haven is a creature of the twentieth century, and began to be used extensively because of the high levels of tax which prevailed after the First World War\" at para 26.1, ''Tolley's International Tax Planning'' (2002), {{ISBN|0-7545-1339-4}}</ref> [[Bermuda]] sometimes claims to have been the first tax haven based upon the creation of the first [[offshore company|offshore companies]] legislation in 1935 by the newly created law firm of [[Conyers Dill & Pearman]].<ref>See generally, Introduction to ''Tolley's International Initiatives Affecting Financial Havens'' (2001), {{ISBN|0-406-94264-1}}</ref> However most tax academics identify the Zurich-Zug-Liechtenstein triangle as the first \"tax haven hub\" created during the mid-1920s.<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/><ref>The ''Personen- und Gesellschaftsrecht'' of 20 January 1926</ref>  Liechtenstein's 1924 Civil Code created the infamous ''Anstalt'' corporate vehicle, while Zurich an Zug developed the ''Societ\u00e9 Anonyme'' and other [[Brass plate company|brass plate companies]].<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/>   Tax academic [[Ronen Palan]] identifies two of the three major groups of tax havens, as emerging during this period:\n:* ''British Empire-based tax havens''.  The 1929 court case of ''Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Co. Ltd. V. Todd'' in Britain created the \"non-resident corporation\" and recognised a British-registered company with no business activities in Britain is not liable to British taxation. Tax academic [[Sol Picciotto]] noted the creation of such \"non-resident\" companies was \"a loophole which, in a sense, made Britain a tax haven\".  The ruling applied to the British Empire, including Bermuda, Barbados, and The Cayman Islands.<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/><ref name=\"sol.piccolo\"/>\n:* ''European-based tax havens''. The Zurich-Zug-Litchenstien triangle expanded and was joined by Luxembourg in 1929 when they created tax-free ''holding companies''.<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/>  However in 1934, as a reaction to the global depression, the Swiss Banking Act of 1934 put bank secrecy under Swiss criminal law.<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/>  Secrecy and privacy would become an important and distinctive part of the European-based tax havens, in comparison with other tax havens.<ref name=\"sol.piccolo\"/>\n\n* ''Post World War II Offshore financial centres''.  Currency controls enacted post World War II led to the creation of the Eurodollar market and the rise in [[offshore financial centre]]s (OFCs).<ref name=\"imf\"/>  Many of these OFCs were traditional tax havens from the Post World War I phase, including The Caymans and Bermuda, however new centres such as Hong Kong, and Singapore began to emerge.<ref name=\"imf\"/>  London's position as a global [[financial centre]] for these OFCs was secured when the [[Bank of England]] ruled in 1957 that transactions executed by UK banks on behalf of a lender and borrower who were not located in the UK, were not to be officially viewed as having taken place in the UK for regulatory or tax purposes, even though the transaction was only ever recorded as taking place in London.<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/><ref name=\"sol.piccolo\"/><ref name=\"eurodollar\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/07/the-real-goldfinger-the-london-banker-who-broke-the-world|title=The real Goldfinger: the London banker who broke the world|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 September 2017|access-date=23 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331045225/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/07/the-real-goldfinger-the-london-banker-who-broke-the-world|archive-date=31 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  The rise of OFCs would continue so that by 2008, The Cayman Islands would be the 4th largest financial centre in the world, while Singapore and Hong Kong had become major [[Financial centre|Regional Financial Centre]]s (RFCs).<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/>  By 2010, tax academics would consider OFCs to be synonymous with tax havens, and that most of their services involved taxation.<ref name=\"missing profits\"/><ref name=\"nicholas.shaxson\"/>\n* ''Emerging economy-based tax havens''.  As well as the dramatic rise in OFCs, from the late 1960s onwards, new tax havens began to emerge to service developing and emerging markets, which became Palan's third group.  The first Pacific tax haven was [[Norfolk Island]] (1966), a self-governing external territory of Australia.  It was followed by Vanuatu (1970\u201371), Nauru (1972), the Cook Islands (1981), Tonga (1984), Samoa (1988), the Marshall Islands (1990), and Nauru (1994).<ref name=\"ronen.palan2\"/>  All these havens introduced familiar legislation modeled on the successful British Empire and European tax havens, including near-zero taxation for exempt companies, and non-residential companies, Swiss-style bank secrecy laws, trust companies laws, offshore insurance laws, flags of convenience for shipping fleets and aircraft leasing, and beneficial regulations for new online services (e.g. gambling, pornography, etc.).<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/><ref name=\"jason\">{{cite book|title=Havens in a Storm: The Struggle for Global Tax Regulation|author=Jason Sharman|year=2006|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|pages=224|jstor=10.7591/j.ctt7z6jm|chapter=The Struggle for Global Tax Regulation|isbn=9780801445040}}</ref>\n* ''Corporate-focused tax havens''.  In 1981, the US IRS published the ''Gordon Report'' on the use of tax havens by US taxpayers, which highlighted the use by tax havens by US corporations.<ref name=\"gordon2\"/>  In 1983, US corporation McDermott International executed the first [[tax inversion]] to Panama.<ref name=\"hallCBO\"/>  The EU Commission showed that Apple Inc. had begun to use the infamous [[Double Irish]] BEPS tool as early as 1991.  US tax academic [[James R. Hines Jr.]] showed in 1994 that US corporations were achieving effective rates of taxation of circa 4% in corporate-focused OECD tax havens like Ireland.<ref name=\"h3\"/>  When in 2004, the US Congress stopped \"naked tax inversions\" by US corporations to Caribbean tax havens with the introduction of IRS Regulation 7874, a much larger wave of US corporate \"merger inversions\" started that involved moving to OECD tax havens.<ref name=\"hallCBO\"/>  A new class of corporate tax haven had emerged that was OECD-compliant, transparent, but offered complex [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) tools that could achieve net tax rates similar to traditional tax havens.<ref name=\"jason\"/><ref name=\"nicholas.shaxson\"/>  Initiatives by the OECD to curb tax havens would mainly impact Palan's third group of ''Emerging economy-based tax havens'', however, the corporate-focused tax havens were drawn from the largest OFCs that had emerged from the ''British Empire-based tax havens'' and ''European-based tax havens'', and included the Netherlands, Singapore, Ireland, and the U.K., and even reformed traditional tax havens such as Luxembourg, Hong Kong, the Caribbean (the Cayman, Bermuda, and the British Virgin Islands) and Switzerland.<ref name=\"nicholas.shaxson\"/>  The scale of their BEPS activities meant that this group of 10 jurisdictions would dominate academic tax haven lists from 2010, including [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines 2010 list|Hines' 2010 list]], the [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Conduit and Sink OFC 2017 list]], and [[Gabriel Zucman#T\u00f8rsl\u00f8v-Wier-Zucman 2018 list|Zucman's 2018 list]].\n\n===Notable events===\n* 1929. British Courts rule in ''Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Co. Ltd. V. Todd.'' that a British-registered company with no business activities in Britain is not liable to British taxation.

The ruling applied to the British Empire, including Bermuda, Barbados, and The Cayman Islands.<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/>\n* 1934. As a reaction to the global depression, the Swiss Banking Act of 1934 put bank secrecy under Swiss criminal law. The law required \"absolute silence in respect to a professional secret\" (i.e. accounts in Swiss banks).  \"Absolute\" means protection from any government, including the Swiss. The law even made inquiry or research into the \"trade secrets\" of Swiss banks, a criminal offense.<ref name=\"ronen.palan\"/>\n* 1981. The US Treasury and the US Attorney General are given: ''Tax havens and their use by United States taxpayers: An Overview'' by Richard A.

A study in July 2017, [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]], split the understanding of an OFC into 24 Sink OFCs (e.g. traditional [[tax haven]]s, to which a disproportionate amount of value disappears from the economic system), and five Conduit OFCs (e.g. modern [[corporate tax haven]]s, through which a disproportionate amount of value moves toward the Sink OFCs).  In June 2018, research showed that OFCs had become the dominant locations for corporate tax avoidance BEPS schemes, costing US$200 billion in lost annual tax revenues.

On the 23 June 2000, the IMF published a working paper on OFCs which expanded the FSF list to 46 OFCs, but split into three Groups based on the level of co-operation and adherence to international standards by the OFC.<ref name=\"IMFJune2000\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/mae/oshore/2000/eng/back.htm|title=Offshore Financial Centers: IMF Background Paper|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=23 June 2000}}</ref>  The IMF paper categorised OFCs as a third type of [[financial centre]], and listed them in order of importance: International Financial Centre (\"IFC\"), Regional Financial Centres (\"RFC\") and Offshore Financial Centres (\"OFC\"); and gave a definition of an OFC:\n\n{{quote|A more practical definition of an OFC is a center where the bulk of financial sector activity is offshore on both sides of the balance sheet, (that is the counterparties of the majority of financial institutions liabilities and assets are non-residents), where the transactions are initiated elsewhere, and where the majority of the institutions involved are controlled by non-residents|source=IMF Background Paper: Offshore Financial Centres (June 2000)<ref name=\"IMFJune2000\"/>}}\n\nThe June 2000 IMF paper then listed three major attributes of offshore financial centres:<ref name=\"IMFJune2000\"/>\n{{ordered list|type=lower-roman\n| Jurisdictions that have relatively large numbers of financial institutions engaged primarily in business with non-residents; and\n| Financial systems with external assets and liabilities out of proportion to domestic financial intermediation designed to finance domestic economies; and\n| More popularly, centers which provide some of the following services: low or zero taxation; moderate or light financial regulation; banking secrecy and anonymity.\n}}\n\nA subsequent April 2007 IMF on OFCs, established a quantitative approach to defining OFCs which the paper stated was captured by the following definition:<ref name=\"imf\"/>\n\n{{quote|An OFC is a country or jurisdiction that provides financial services to nonresidents on a scale that is incommensurate with the size and the financing of its domestic economy.|source=IMF Working Paper: Concept of Offshore Financial Centers: In Search of an Operational Definition (April 2007)<ref name=\"imf\"/> }}\n\nThe April 2007 IMF paper used a quantitative ''proxy text'' for the above definition: ''More specifically, it can be considered that the ratio of net financial services exports to GDP could be an indicator of the OFC status of a country or jurisdiction''.  This approach produced a revised list of 22 OFCs,{{efn|name=IMF2007|The 104 jurisdictions in the IMF's 2007 quantitative study sample, did not include several of those in the IMF\u2013FSF 2000 lists that are generally recognised as tax havens or OFCs, such as Andorra, the British Virgin Islands, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Montserrat, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

However, since the early academic papers into OFCs in the late 1970s, and the FSF-IMF investigations, it has been consistently noted that tax planning is one of the prime drivers of OFC activity.  The other most commonly noted prime driver is favorable regulation, or regulatory arbitrage, such as in OFCs like Liberia, that focus on shipping.\n\nIn April\u2013June 2000, when the FSF\u2013IMF produced lists of OFCs, commentators highlighted the similarity with [[tax haven]] lists.<ref name=\"TJN1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Identifying_Tax_Havens_Jul_07.pdf |title=Identifying Tax Havens and Offshore Finance Centres|quote=Various attempts have been made to identify and list tax havens and offshore finance centres (OFCs).

OFC securitisation involves the provision of legal structures, registered in the OFC, into which foreign capital is placed to finance foreign assets (e.g. aircraft, ships, mortgages assets etc.), used by foreign operators and foreign investors.  The OFC thus behaves more like a ''legal conduit'' rather than providing actual banking services.  This has seen a rise in large specialist legal and accounting firms, who provide the legal structures for securitisations, in OFC locations.  In normal securitisations, the foreign capital, assets and operators can all come from major ''onshore'' locations.  For example, Deutsche Bank in Germany might lend Euro 5 billion into an Irish Section 110 SPV (the Irish securitisation legal structure), which then buys Euro 5 billion in aircraft engines from Boeing, and then leases the engines to Delta Airlines.  The reason why Deutsche Bank would use an Irish Section 110 SPV is that it is tax neutral,{{efn|name=tax}} and that it has certain legal features, particularly [[Orphan structure|orphaning]], which are helpful to Deutsche Bank, but which are not available in Germany.  Orphaning poses considerable risks of tax abuse and tax avoidance to the tax base of higher-tax jurisdictions; even Ireland discovered a major domestic tax avoidance scheme in 2016, by U.S. distressed debt funds, using the [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Vulture fund tax avoidance|Irish Section 110 SPVs]], on Irish domestic investments.\n\n==Defences==\n\n===Better regulations===\n\nOFCs sometimes market themselves as ''leaders in regulation'' operating under the highest standards with the most advanced legal systems.  Because OFCs are willing to create legal structures for broad classes of assets, including [[intellectual property]] (\"IP\") assets, cryptocurrency assets, and carbon credit assets, there is a justification that OFCs are often at the forefront of certain types of regulation.  However, in the area of more general regulation, there is little real evidence to support these claims.  In addition, there are contrary examples, even from the biggest OFCs, of poor regulation and oversight. (see [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Unregulated shadow banking|here]]).\n\nSupporters of OFCs also claim that the costs of regulation and operation in OFCs are lower than in the major [[financial centres]] due to scale effects and cheaper operating locations.  However, there have been no credible studies or evidence put forward, as yet, to demonstrate that it is cheaper to operate from OFCs than major IFCs/RFCs.  There is evidence that OFCs have faster approval times, even 24 hours, for approval of new legal structures and [[special purpose vehicles]], however critics highlight this aspect as a sign of weaker regulation and oversight in OFCs (e.g. [[brass plate company]]).\n\n===Securitisation transactions===\n\n{{see also|Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)}}\n\nOne of the most important service lines for OFCs is in providing legal structures for global [[securitisation]] transactions for all types of asset classes, including aircraft finance, shipping finance, equipment finance, and collateralised loan vehicles.  OFCs provide what are called ''tax neutral'' [[special purpose vehicles]] (\"SPVs\") where no taxes, VAT, levies or duties are taken by the OFC on the SPV.  In addition, aggressive legal structuring, including [[Orphan structures]], is facilitated to support requirements for [[Bankruptcy remote]]ness, which would not be allowed in larger [[financial centres]], as it could damage the local tax base, but are needed by banks in securitisations.  As the ''effective'' tax rate in most OFCs is near zero (e.g. they are really tax havens), this is a lower risk, although, the experience of U.S. distressed debt funds abusing [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Vulture fund tax avoidance|Irish Section 110 SPVs]] in 2012\u20132016 is notable.  However, OFCs play a key role in providing the legal structure for global securitisation transactions that could not be performed from the main [[financial centres]].\n\n===Promotion of growth===\n\nThe most controversial claim is that OFCs promote global economic growth by providing a preferred platform, even if due to tax avoidance or regulatory arbitrage reasons, from which global capital is more readily deployed.<ref>{{cite web|first = Leonid |last = Bershidsky|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-07-25/fighting-corporate-tax-avoidance-can-kill-economic-growth|title=Fighting tax dodgers can kill economic growth|publisher=Bloomberg|date=25 July 2018}}</ref>  There are strong academic advocates, and studies, on both sides of this argument.  Some of the most cited researchers into tax havens/offshore financial centres, including [[James R. Hines Jr.|Hines]], [[Dhammika Dharmapala|Dharmapala]] and [[Mihir A. Desai|Desai]] show evidence that, in certain cases, tax havens/OFCs, appear to promote economic growth in neighbouring higher-tax countries, and can solve issues that the higher-tax countries can have in their own tax or regulatory systems, which deter capital investment.\n\n{{quote|Tax havens{{efn|name=Hines|From 2010, Hines stated in ''Treasure Islands'' that: \"Tax havens are also known as \u201coffshore financial centres\u201d or \u201cinternational financial centers\u201d, phrases that may carry slightly different connotations but nevertheless are used almost interchangeably with \u201ctax havens.\u201d\"}} change the nature of tax competition among other countries, very possibly permitting them to sustain high domestic tax rates that are effectively mitigated for mobile international investors whose transactions are routed through tax havens.

Similarly, it is quite common for fleets of ships to be separately owned by separate offshore companies to try to circumvent laws relating to group liability under certain environmental legislation.\n*'''Asset protection''': Wealthy individuals who live in politically unstable countries utilise offshore companies to hold family wealth to avoid potential [[Nationalization|expropriation]] or [[exchange control]] restrictions in the country in which they live. These structures work best when the wealth is foreign-earned, or has been expatriated over a significant period of time (aggregating annual exchange control allowances).<ref>Legitimate asset protection against future political or economic risk should be distinguished from unlawfully attempting to evade creditors; see below.</ref>\n*'''Avoidance of forced heirship provisions''': Many countries from France to [[Saudi Arabia]] (and the U.S. state of [[Louisiana]]) continue to employ [[forced heirship]] provisions in their succession law, limiting the testator's freedom to distribute assets upon death. By placing assets into an offshore company, and then having probate for the shares in the offshore determined by the laws of the offshore jurisdiction (usually in accordance with a specific [[Will (law)|will]] or [[codicil (will)|codicil]] sworn for that purpose), the testator can sometimes avoid such strictures.\n*'''Collective Investment Vehicles''': [[Mutual funds]], [[Hedge funds]], [[unit trust]]s and [[SICAV]]s are formed offshore to facilitate international distribution. By being domiciled in a low tax jurisdiction investors only have to consider the tax implications of their own domicile or residency.\n*'''Derivatives and securities trading''': Wealthy individuals often form offshore vehicles to engage in risky investments, such as [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and global securities trading, which may be extremely difficult to engage in directly onshore due to cumbersome financial markets regulation.\n*'''Exchange control trading vehicles'':''''' In countries where there is either [[exchange control]] or is perceived to be increased political risk with the repatriation of funds, major exporters often form trading vehicles in offshore companies so that the sales from exports can be \"parked\" in the offshore vehicle until needed for further investment. Trading vehicles of this nature have been criticised in a number of shareholder lawsuits which allege that by manipulating the ownership of the trading vehicle, majority shareholders can illegally avoid paying minority shareholders their fair share of trading profits.\n\n[[File:Hong Kong China Middle-Island-01.jpg|thumb|[[Hong Kong]] is frequently a financial center for corporate structuring. ]]\n\n* '''Joint venture vehicles''': Offshore jurisdictions are frequently used to set up [[joint venture]] companies, either as a compromise neutral jurisdiction (see for example, [[TNK-BP]]) and/or because the jurisdiction where the joint venture has its commercial centre has insufficiently sophisticated corporate and commercial laws.\n*'''Stock market listing vehicles''': Successful companies who are unable to obtain a [[stock market]] listing because of the underdevelopment of the [[corporate law]] in their home country often transfer shares into an offshore vehicle, and list the offshore vehicle. Offshore vehicles are listed on the [[NASDAQ]], [[Alternative Investment Market]], the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and the [[Singapore Exchange|Singapore Stock Exchange]].\n*'''Trade finance vehicles''': Large corporate groups often form offshore companies, sometimes under an [[orphan structure]] to enable them to obtain financing (either from [[bond (finance)|bond issues]] or by way of a [[syndicated loan]]) and to treat the financing as \"[[off-balance-sheet]]\" under applicable accounting procedures. In relation to bond issues, offshore special purpose vehicles are often used in relation to [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] transactions (particularly [[securitization|securitisations]]).\n*'''Creditor avoidance''': Highly indebted persons may seek to escape the effect of bankruptcy by transferring cash and assets into an anonymous offshore company.<ref>In practice, such attempts are rarely effective. A [[trustee in bankruptcy]] will usually have access to all of the debtor's financial records, and will usually have little difficulty tracing where the assets were transferred to. [[Fraudulent conveyance|Transfers to defraud creditors]] are prohibited in most jurisdictions (offshore and onshore) and a bankruptcy trustee usually has little difficulty persuading a local court to nullify the transfer. Despite the poor prognosis for success, applications to courts in offshore jurisdictions seem to indicate that insolvent individuals still try this strategy from time to time, notwithstanding that it is usually a serious criminal offence in both jurisdictions.</ref>\n*'''Market manipulation''': The [[Enron scandal|Enron]] and [[Parmalat#Financial fraud (2002\u20132005)|Parmalat]] scandals demonstrated how companies could form offshore vehicles to manipulate financial results.\n*'''Tax evasion''': Although numbers are difficult to ascertain, it is widely believed that individuals in wealthy nations unlawfully [[tax evasion|evade tax]] through not declaring gains made by offshore vehicles that they own. Multinationals including [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[Sony]] have been accused of [[Transfer pricing|transferring profits]] from the higher-tax jurisdictions in which they are made to zero-tax offshore centres.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/28/transfer-pricing-illegal-glaxo-dodging-taxes-personal-finance-transferprice.html|title=Illicit Transfer Pricing Endangers Shareholders|last=Morais|first=Richard C.|date=28 August 2009|work=Forbes}}</ref>\n\n===Ship and aircraft registrations===\n{{See also|Flags of convenience}}\n[[File:EsclusasdeMiraflores2Barcos 08-130.jpg|thumb|Commercial ships register in [[Central America]]n states to avoid scrutiny from foreign countries. ''Pictured'': a large carrier ship docking in [[Panama]].]]\nMany offshore financial centres also provide registrations for ships (notably [[Bahamas]] and [[Panama]]) or [[Aircraft registration|aircraft]] (notably [[Aruba]], [[Bermuda]] and the [[Cayman Islands]]). Aircraft are frequently registered in offshore jurisdictions where they are leased or purchased by carriers in [[emerging markets]] but financed by banks in major onshore financial centres. The financing institution is reluctant to allow the aircraft to be registered in the carrier's home country (either because it does not have sufficient regulation governing [[civil aviation]], or because it feels the courts in that country would not cooperate fully if it needed to enforce any [[security interest]] over the aircraft), and the carrier is reluctant to have the aircraft registered in the financier's jurisdiction (often the United States or the United Kingdom) either because of personal or political reasons, or because they fear spurious lawsuits and potential arrest of the aircraft.\n\nFor example, in 2003, state carrier [[Pakistan International Airlines]] re-registered its entire fleet in the Cayman Islands as part of the financing of its purchase of eight new [[Boeing 777]]s; the U.S. bank refused to allow the aircraft to remain registered in Pakistan, and the airline refused to have the aircraft registered in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/PIA-pledges-its-fleet-to-fake-firm/articleshow/229197.cms|title=PIA pledges its fleet to fake firm|work=The Times of India|date = 12 October 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Insurance===\n{{See also|Captive insurance}}\nA number of offshore jurisdictions promote the incorporation of [[captive insurance]] companies within the jurisdiction to allow the sponsor to manage risk. In more sophisticated offshore insurance markets, onshore [[insurance]] companies can also establish an offshore subsidiary in the jurisdiction to reinsure certain risks underwritten by the onshore parent, and thereby reduce overall reserve and capital requirements. Onshore [[reinsurance]] companies may also incorporate an offshore subsidiary to reinsure catastrophic risks.\n\nBermuda's insurance and re-insurance market is now the third largest in the world.<ref>13 of the world's top 40 reinsurers are based in Bermuda, including [[American International Group|American International Underwriters Group]], [[HSBC|HSBC Insurance Solutions]], [[Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (X)|XL Capital Limited]] and [[ACE Ltd.|ACE Limited]].</ref> There are also signs the primary insurance market is becoming increasingly focused upon Bermuda; in September 2006 [[Hiscox|Hiscox PLC]], the [[FTSE 250]] insurance company announced that it planned to relocate to Bermuda citing tax and regulatory advantages.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/09/12/cnhiscox12.xml|title=Hiscox to be domiciled in 'favourable' Bermuda|last=Muspratt|first=Caroline|date=12 September 2006|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Collective investment vehicles===\n{{See also|Offshore fund}}\n[[File:Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands.jpg|thumb|The [[Cayman Islands]] are the market leaders in [[offshore fund]]ing.]]\nMany offshore jurisdictions specialise in the formation of [[collective investment scheme]]s, or [[collective investment scheme|mutual funds]].

Offshore jurisdictions tend to impose few if any restrictions on what investment strategy the mutual funds may pursue and no limitations on the amount of [[leverage (finance)|leverage]] which mutual funds can employ in their investment strategy. Many offshore jurisdictions ([[Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Guernsey]]) allow promoters to incorporate ''[[segregated portfolio company|segregated portfolio companies]]'' (or SPCs) for use as mutual funds; the unavailability of a similar corporate vehicle onshore has also helped fuel the growth of offshore incorporated funds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n===Banking===\n{{See also|Offshore bank}}\nTraditionally, a number of offshore jurisdictions offered banking licences to institutions with relatively little scrutiny. International initiatives have largely stopped this practice, and very few offshore financial centres will now issue licences to [[offshore bank]]s that do not already hold a banking licence in a major onshore jurisdiction. The most recent reliable figures for offshore banks indicates that the Cayman Islands has 285<ref>Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (2006)</ref> licensed banks, the [[Bahamas]] <ref>Not treating Switzerland (with 500) as an offshore financial centre for these purposes.</ref> has 301.

They highlight the Eurodollar capital market as particularly important.<ref name=\"eurodollar\"/> However, as OFCs developed in the 1980s, it became apparent that OFC banks were not just recycling Eurodollars from foreign corporate transactions, but also capital from tax avoidance (e.g. money being hidden in tax havens), and also from other criminal and illegal sources.<ref name=\"imf\"/>  Many OFCs, such as Switzerland, had banking secrecy laws protecting the identity of the owners of the ''offshore'' capital in the OFC.  Over the years, a {{slink|#Regulatory clampdown}} has weakened the ability for OFCs to provide bank secrecy.  Shadow banking, however, remains a key part of OFCs services, and the [[Financial Stability Forum]] list of major shadow banking locations are all recognized OFCs.<ref name=\"FSF1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P050318-1.pdf|title=Global Shadow Banking and Monitoring Report: 2017|date=5 March 2018|quote=Jurisdictions with the largest financial systems relative to GDP (Exhibit 2-3) tend to have relatively larger OFI [or Shadow Banking] sectors: Luxembourg (at 92% of total financial assets), the Cayman Islands (85%), Ireland (76%) and the Netherlands (58%)|page=30|publisher=[[Financial Stability Forum]]|accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Several jurisdictions included in this Report had OFI [shadow banking institution]{{efn|name=OFI|The FSF loosely defines ''other financial intermediaries'' as shadow banking; they are more specifically defined by the FSF as: \"OFIs comprise all financial institutions that are not central banks, banks, insurance corporations, pension funds, public financial institutions, or financial auxiliaries\"}}  sectors that were quite large compared to the size of their domestic economy: OFI assets were 2,118 times GDP in the Cayman Islands, 246 times GDP in Luxembourg, 13 times GDP in Ireland, and 8.6 times GDP in the Netherlands.

Unlike traditional shadow banking, where the OFC bank needs to access a pool of ''offshore capital'' to operate, securitisation involves no provision of capital.  OFC securitisation involves the provision of legal structures, registered in the OFC, into which foreign capital is placed to finance foreign assets (e.g. aircraft, ships, mortgages assets etc.), used by foreign operators and foreign investors.  The OFC thus behaves more like a ''legal conduit'' rather than providing actual banking services.  This has seen a rise in large specialist legal and accounting firms, who provide the legal structures for securitisations, in OFC locations.  In normal securitisations, the foreign capital, assets and operators can all come from major ''onshore'' locations.  For example, Deutsche Bank in Germany might lend Euro 5 billion into an Irish Section 110 SPV (the Irish securitisation legal structure), which then buys Euro 5 billion in aircraft engines from Boeing, and then leases the engines to Delta Airlines.  The reason why Deutsche Bank would use an Irish Section 110 SPV is that it is tax neutral,{{efn|name=tax}} and that it has certain legal features, particularly [[Orphan structure|orphaning]], which are helpful to Deutsche Bank, but which are not available in Germany.  Orphaning poses considerable risks of tax abuse and tax avoidance to the tax base of higher-tax jurisdictions; even Ireland discovered a major domestic tax avoidance scheme in 2016, by U.S. distressed debt funds, using the [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Vulture fund tax avoidance|Irish Section 110 SPVs]], on Irish domestic investments.\n\n==Defences==\n\n===Better regulations===\n\nOFCs sometimes market themselves as ''leaders in regulation'' operating under the highest standards with the most advanced legal systems.  Because OFCs are willing to create legal structures for broad classes of assets, including [[intellectual property]] (\"IP\") assets, cryptocurrency assets, and carbon credit assets, there is a justification that OFCs are often at the forefront of certain types of regulation.  However, in the area of more general regulation, there is little real evidence to support these claims.  In addition, there are contrary examples, even from the biggest OFCs, of poor regulation and oversight. (see [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Unregulated shadow banking|here]]).\n\nSupporters of OFCs also claim that the costs of regulation and operation in OFCs are lower than in the major [[financial centres]] due to scale effects and cheaper operating locations.  However, there have been no credible studies or evidence put forward, as yet, to demonstrate that it is cheaper to operate from OFCs than major IFCs/RFCs.  There is evidence that OFCs have faster approval times, even 24 hours, for approval of new legal structures and [[special purpose vehicles]], however critics highlight this aspect as a sign of weaker regulation and oversight in OFCs (e.g. [[brass plate company]]).\n\n===Securitisation transactions===\n\n{{see also|Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)}}\n\nOne of the most important service lines for OFCs is in providing legal structures for global [[securitisation]] transactions for all types of asset classes, including aircraft finance, shipping finance, equipment finance, and collateralised loan vehicles.  OFCs provide what are called ''tax neutral'' [[special purpose vehicles]] (\"SPVs\") where no taxes, VAT, levies or duties are taken by the OFC on the SPV.  In addition, aggressive legal structuring, including [[Orphan structures]], is facilitated to support requirements for [[Bankruptcy remote]]ness, which would not be allowed in larger [[financial centres]], as it could damage the local tax base, but are needed by banks in securitisations.  As the ''effective'' tax rate in most OFCs is near zero (e.g. they are really tax havens), this is a lower risk, although, the experience of U.S. distressed debt funds abusing [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Vulture fund tax avoidance|Irish Section 110 SPVs]] in 2012\u20132016 is notable.  However, OFCs play a key role in providing the legal structure for global securitisation transactions that could not be performed from the main [[financial centres]].\n\n===Promotion of growth===\n\nThe most controversial claim is that OFCs promote global economic growth by providing a preferred platform, even if due to tax avoidance or regulatory arbitrage reasons, from which global capital is more readily deployed.<ref>{{cite web|first = Leonid |last = Bershidsky|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-07-25/fighting-corporate-tax-avoidance-can-kill-economic-growth|title=Fighting tax dodgers can kill economic growth|publisher=Bloomberg|date=25 July 2018}}</ref>  There are strong academic advocates, and studies, on both sides of this argument.  Some of the most cited researchers into tax havens/offshore financial centres, including [[James R. Hines Jr.|Hines]], [[Dhammika Dharmapala|Dharmapala]] and [[Mihir A. Desai|Desai]] show evidence that, in certain cases, tax havens/OFCs, appear to promote economic growth in neighbouring higher-tax countries, and can solve issues that the higher-tax countries can have in their own tax or regulatory systems, which deter capital investment.\n\n{{quote|Tax havens{{efn|name=Hines|From 2010, Hines stated in ''Treasure Islands'' that: \"Tax havens are also known as \u201coffshore financial centres\u201d or \u201cinternational financial centers\u201d, phrases that may carry slightly different connotations but nevertheless are used almost interchangeably with \u201ctax havens.\u201d\"}} change the nature of tax competition among other countries, very possibly permitting them to sustain high domestic tax rates that are effectively mitigated for mobile international investors whose transactions are routed through tax havens.

Similarly, it is quite common for fleets of ships to be separately owned by separate offshore companies to try to circumvent laws relating to group liability under certain environmental legislation.\n*'''Asset protection''': Wealthy individuals who live in politically unstable countries utilise offshore companies to hold family wealth to avoid potential [[Nationalization|expropriation]] or [[exchange control]] restrictions in the country in which they live. These structures work best when the wealth is foreign-earned, or has been expatriated over a significant period of time (aggregating annual exchange control allowances).<ref>Legitimate asset protection against future political or economic risk should be distinguished from unlawfully attempting to evade creditors; see below.</ref>\n*'''Avoidance of forced heirship provisions''': Many countries from France to [[Saudi Arabia]] (and the U.S. state of [[Louisiana]]) continue to employ [[forced heirship]] provisions in their succession law, limiting the testator's freedom to distribute assets upon death. By placing assets into an offshore company, and then having probate for the shares in the offshore determined by the laws of the offshore jurisdiction (usually in accordance with a specific [[Will (law)|will]] or [[codicil (will)|codicil]] sworn for that purpose), the testator can sometimes avoid such strictures.\n*'''Collective Investment Vehicles''': [[Mutual funds]], [[Hedge funds]], [[unit trust]]s and [[SICAV]]s are formed offshore to facilitate international distribution. By being domiciled in a low tax jurisdiction investors only have to consider the tax implications of their own domicile or residency.\n*'''Derivatives and securities trading''': Wealthy individuals often form offshore vehicles to engage in risky investments, such as [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and global securities trading, which may be extremely difficult to engage in directly onshore due to cumbersome financial markets regulation.\n*'''Exchange control trading vehicles'':''''' In countries where there is either [[exchange control]] or is perceived to be increased political risk with the repatriation of funds, major exporters often form trading vehicles in offshore companies so that the sales from exports can be \"parked\" in the offshore vehicle until needed for further investment. Trading vehicles of this nature have been criticised in a number of shareholder lawsuits which allege that by manipulating the ownership of the trading vehicle, majority shareholders can illegally avoid paying minority shareholders their fair share of trading profits.\n\n[[File:Hong Kong China Middle-Island-01.jpg|thumb|[[Hong Kong]] is frequently a financial center for corporate structuring. ]]\n\n* '''Joint venture vehicles''': Offshore jurisdictions are frequently used to set up [[joint venture]] companies, either as a compromise neutral jurisdiction (see for example, [[TNK-BP]]) and/or because the jurisdiction where the joint venture has its commercial centre has insufficiently sophisticated corporate and commercial laws.\n*'''Stock market listing vehicles''': Successful companies who are unable to obtain a [[stock market]] listing because of the underdevelopment of the [[corporate law]] in their home country often transfer shares into an offshore vehicle, and list the offshore vehicle. Offshore vehicles are listed on the [[NASDAQ]], [[Alternative Investment Market]], the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and the [[Singapore Exchange|Singapore Stock Exchange]].\n*'''Trade finance vehicles''': Large corporate groups often form offshore companies, sometimes under an [[orphan structure]] to enable them to obtain financing (either from [[bond (finance)|bond issues]] or by way of a [[syndicated loan]]) and to treat the financing as \"[[off-balance-sheet]]\" under applicable accounting procedures. In relation to bond issues, offshore special purpose vehicles are often used in relation to [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] transactions (particularly [[securitization|securitisations]]).\n*'''Creditor avoidance''': Highly indebted persons may seek to escape the effect of bankruptcy by transferring cash and assets into an anonymous offshore company.<ref>In practice, such attempts are rarely effective. A [[trustee in bankruptcy]] will usually have access to all of the debtor's financial records, and will usually have little difficulty tracing where the assets were transferred to. [[Fraudulent conveyance|Transfers to defraud creditors]] are prohibited in most jurisdictions (offshore and onshore) and a bankruptcy trustee usually has little difficulty persuading a local court to nullify the transfer. Despite the poor prognosis for success, applications to courts in offshore jurisdictions seem to indicate that insolvent individuals still try this strategy from time to time, notwithstanding that it is usually a serious criminal offence in both jurisdictions.</ref>\n*'''Market manipulation''': The [[Enron scandal|Enron]] and [[Parmalat#Financial fraud (2002\u20132005)|Parmalat]] scandals demonstrated how companies could form offshore vehicles to manipulate financial results.\n*'''Tax evasion''': Although numbers are difficult to ascertain, it is widely believed that individuals in wealthy nations unlawfully [[tax evasion|evade tax]] through not declaring gains made by offshore vehicles that they own. Multinationals including [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[Sony]] have been accused of [[Transfer pricing|transferring profits]] from the higher-tax jurisdictions in which they are made to zero-tax offshore centres.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/28/transfer-pricing-illegal-glaxo-dodging-taxes-personal-finance-transferprice.html|title=Illicit Transfer Pricing Endangers Shareholders|last=Morais|first=Richard C.|date=28 August 2009|work=Forbes}}</ref>\n\n===Ship and aircraft registrations===\n{{See also|Flags of convenience}}\n[[File:EsclusasdeMiraflores2Barcos 08-130.jpg|thumb|Commercial ships register in [[Central America]]n states to avoid scrutiny from foreign countries. ''Pictured'': a large carrier ship docking in [[Panama]].]]\nMany offshore financial centres also provide registrations for ships (notably [[Bahamas]] and [[Panama]]) or [[Aircraft registration|aircraft]] (notably [[Aruba]], [[Bermuda]] and the [[Cayman Islands]]). Aircraft are frequently registered in offshore jurisdictions where they are leased or purchased by carriers in [[emerging markets]] but financed by banks in major onshore financial centres. The financing institution is reluctant to allow the aircraft to be registered in the carrier's home country (either because it does not have sufficient regulation governing [[civil aviation]], or because it feels the courts in that country would not cooperate fully if it needed to enforce any [[security interest]] over the aircraft), and the carrier is reluctant to have the aircraft registered in the financier's jurisdiction (often the United States or the United Kingdom) either because of personal or political reasons, or because they fear spurious lawsuits and potential arrest of the aircraft.\n\nFor example, in 2003, state carrier [[Pakistan International Airlines]] re-registered its entire fleet in the Cayman Islands as part of the financing of its purchase of eight new [[Boeing 777]]s; the U.S. bank refused to allow the aircraft to remain registered in Pakistan, and the airline refused to have the aircraft registered in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/PIA-pledges-its-fleet-to-fake-firm/articleshow/229197.cms|title=PIA pledges its fleet to fake firm|work=The Times of India|date = 12 October 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Insurance===\n{{See also|Captive insurance}}\nA number of offshore jurisdictions promote the incorporation of [[captive insurance]] companies within the jurisdiction to allow the sponsor to manage risk. In more sophisticated offshore insurance markets, onshore [[insurance]] companies can also establish an offshore subsidiary in the jurisdiction to reinsure certain risks underwritten by the onshore parent, and thereby reduce overall reserve and capital requirements. Onshore [[reinsurance]] companies may also incorporate an offshore subsidiary to reinsure catastrophic risks.\n\nBermuda's insurance and re-insurance market is now the third largest in the world.<ref>13 of the world's top 40 reinsurers are based in Bermuda, including [[American International Group|American International Underwriters Group]], [[HSBC|HSBC Insurance Solutions]], [[Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (X)|XL Capital Limited]] and [[ACE Ltd.|ACE Limited]].</ref> There are also signs the primary insurance market is becoming increasingly focused upon Bermuda; in September 2006 [[Hiscox|Hiscox PLC]], the [[FTSE 250]] insurance company announced that it planned to relocate to Bermuda citing tax and regulatory advantages.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/09/12/cnhiscox12.xml|title=Hiscox to be domiciled in 'favourable' Bermuda|last=Muspratt|first=Caroline|date=12 September 2006|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Collective investment vehicles===\n{{See also|Offshore fund}}\n[[File:Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands.jpg|thumb|The [[Cayman Islands]] are the market leaders in [[offshore fund]]ing.]]\nMany offshore jurisdictions specialise in the formation of [[collective investment scheme]]s, or [[collective investment scheme|mutual funds]].

Offshore jurisdictions tend to impose few if any restrictions on what investment strategy the mutual funds may pursue and no limitations on the amount of [[leverage (finance)|leverage]] which mutual funds can employ in their investment strategy. Many offshore jurisdictions ([[Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Guernsey]]) allow promoters to incorporate ''[[segregated portfolio company|segregated portfolio companies]]'' (or SPCs) for use as mutual funds; the unavailability of a similar corporate vehicle onshore has also helped fuel the growth of offshore incorporated funds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n===Banking===\n{{See also|Offshore bank}}\nTraditionally, a number of offshore jurisdictions offered banking licences to institutions with relatively little scrutiny. International initiatives have largely stopped this practice, and very few offshore financial centres will now issue licences to [[offshore bank]]s that do not already hold a banking licence in a major onshore jurisdiction. The most recent reliable figures for offshore banks indicates that the Cayman Islands has 285<ref>Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (2006)</ref> licensed banks, the [[Bahamas]] <ref>Not treating Switzerland (with 500) as an offshore financial centre for these purposes.</ref> has 301.

Hines Jr.''' (born 9 July 1958) is an American [[economist]] and a founder of academic research into corporate-focused [[tax havens]], and the effect of U.S. corporate tax policy on the behaviors of U.S. multinationals.  His papers were some of the first to analyse ''[[base erosion and profit shifting|profit shifting]]'', and to establish quantitative features of tax havens. Hines showed that being a tax haven could be a prosperous strategy for a jurisdiction, and controversially, that tax havens can promote economic growth.  Hines showed that use of tax havens by U.S. multinationals had maximized long-term U.S. exchequer tax receipts, at the expense of other jurisdictions. Hines is the most cited author on the research of tax havens, and his work on tax havens was relied upon by the [[Council of Economic Advisors|CEA]] when drafting the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].\n\n==Biography==\nJames Hines was born in Chicago in 1958.  He went to [[Yale University]] for his B.Sc and M.Sc in 1980.  He completed his PhD in [[Harvard University]] in 1986.  After various teaching and research posts in [[Princeton University]] and Harvard University, in 1997 he became Professor of Economics at the [[University of Michigan]].

Hines Jr.''' (born 9 July 1958) is an American [[economist]] and a founder of academic research into corporate-focused [[tax havens]], and the effect of U.S. corporate tax policy on the behaviors of U.S. multinationals.  His papers were some of the first to analyse ''[[base erosion and profit shifting|profit shifting]]'', and to establish quantitative features of tax havens. Hines showed that being a tax haven could be a prosperous strategy for a jurisdiction, and controversially, that tax havens can promote economic growth.  Hines showed that use of tax havens by U.S. multinationals had maximized long-term U.S. exchequer tax receipts, at the expense of other jurisdictions. Hines is the most cited author on the research of tax havens, and his work on tax havens was relied upon by the [[Council of Economic Advisors|CEA]] when drafting the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].\n\n==Biography==\nJames Hines was born in Chicago in 1958.  He went to [[Yale University]] for his B.Sc and M.Sc in 1980.  He completed his PhD in [[Harvard University]] in 1986.  After various teaching and research posts in [[Princeton University]] and Harvard University, in 1997 he became Professor of Economics at the [[University of Michigan]].  Hines is a research associate of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], and a research director of the International Tax Policy Forum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/e/phi111.html|title=RePec DATABASE: James R.

In such cases, the model can be viewed as a [[black box]], i.e. the output is an \"opaque\" function of its inputs.\n\nQuite often, some or all of the model inputs are subject to sources of [[Uncertainty quantification|uncertainty]], including [[Measurement uncertainty|errors of measurement]], absence of information and poor or partial understanding of the driving forces and mechanisms.  This uncertainty imposes a limit on our [[confidence]] in the response or output of the model. Further, models may have to cope with the natural intrinsic variability of the system (aleatory), such as the occurrence of [[stochastic]] events.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Der Kiureghian |first=A. |last2=Ditlevsen |first2=O. |year=2009 |title=Aleatory or epistemic? Does it matter? |journal=Structural Safety |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=105\u2013112 |doi=10.1016/j.strusafe.2008.06.020}}</ref>\n\nGood modeling practice requires that the modeler provide an evaluation of the confidence in the model. This requires, first, a [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] of the uncertainty in any model results ([[uncertainty analysis]]); and second, an evaluation of how much each input is contributing to the output uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis addresses the second of these issues (although uncertainty analysis is usually a necessary precursor), performing the role of ordering by importance the strength and relevance of the inputs in determining the variation in the output.<ref name=\"Primer\" />\n\nIn models involving many input variables, sensitivity analysis is an essential ingredient of model building and quality assurance. National and international agencies involved in [[impact assessment]] studies have included sections devoted to sensitivity analysis in their guidelines. Examples are the [[European Commission]] (see e.g. the guidelines for [[impact assessment]]),<ref name=\"EC_GUIDE\">http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/commission_guidelines/docs/iag_2009_en.pdf</ref> the White House [[Office of Management and Budget]], the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and [[US Environmental Protection Agency]]'s modeling guidelines.<ref>http://www.epa.gov/CREM/library/cred_guidance_0309.pdf</ref>\n\n==Settings and constraints==\nThe choice of method of sensitivity analysis is typically dictated by a number of problem constraints or settings. Some of the most common are\n* '''Computational expense:''' Sensitivity analysis is almost always performed by running the model a (possibly large) number of times, i.e. a [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]]-based approach.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Helton |first2=J. D. |last2=Johnson |first3=C. J. |last3=Salaberry |first4=C.

This is not unusual with very complex models.\n** The model has a large number of uncertain inputs. Sensitivity analysis is essentially the exploration of the [[Dimension|multidimensional input space]], which grows exponentially in size with the number of inputs. See the [[curse of dimensionality]].\n:Computational expense is a problem in many practical sensitivity analyses. Some methods of reducing computational expense include the use of emulators (for large models), and screening methods (for reducing the dimensionality of the problem). Another method is to use an event-based sensitivity analysis method for variable selection for time-constrained applications.<ref name=\"tavakoli1\">{{cite journal |last=Tavakoli |first= Siamak |first2=Alireza |last2=Mousavi |title=Event tracking for real-time unaware sensitivity analysis (EventTracker) |journal=IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=348\u2013359 |doi=10.1109/tkde.2011.240|url= http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/8690 }}</ref> This is an input variable selection (IVS) method that assembles together information about the trace of the changes in system inputs and outputs using sensitivity analysis to produce an input/output trigger/event matrix that is designed to map the relationships between input data as causes that trigger events and the output data that describes the actual events. The cause-effect relationship between the causes of state change i.e. input variables and the effect system output parameters determines which set of inputs have a genuine impact on a given output. The method has a clear advantage over analytical and computational IVS method since it tries to understand and interpret system state change in the shortest possible time with minimum computational overhead.<ref name=\"tavakoli1\"/><ref name=\"tavakoli2\">{{cite journal |last=Tavakoli |first=Siamak |first2=Alireza |last2=Mousavi |first3=Stefan |last3=Poslad |title=Input variable selection in time-critical knowledge integration applications: A review, analysis, and recommendation paper |journal=Advanced Engineering Informatics |year=2013 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=519\u2013536 |doi=10.1016/j.aei.2013.06.002 |url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/8691 }}</ref>\n* '''Correlated inputs:''' Most common sensitivity analysis methods assume [[Independence (probability theory)|independence]] between model inputs, but sometimes inputs can be strongly correlated. This is still an immature field of research and definitive methods have yet to be established.\n* '''Nonlinearity:''' Some sensitivity analysis approaches, such as those based on [[linear regression]], can inaccurately measure sensitivity when the model response is [[nonlinear system|nonlinear]] with respect to its inputs. In such cases, [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|variance-based measures]] are more appropriate.\n* '''Model interactions:''' [[Interaction (statistics)|Interactions]] occur when the perturbation of two or more inputs ''simultaneously'' causes variation in the output greater than that of varying each of the inputs alone. Such interactions are present in any model that is non-[[Additive map|additive]], but will be neglected by methods such as scatterplots and one-at-a-time perturbations.<ref name=\"OAT\">{{cite journal |last=Saltelli |first=A. |last2=Annoni |first2=P. |year=2010 |title=How to avoid a perfunctory sensitivity analysis |journal=Environmental Modeling and Software |volume=25 |issue= 12|pages=1508\u20131517 |doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.04.012}}</ref> The effect of interactions can be measured by the [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|total-order sensitivity index]].\n* '''Multiple outputs:''' Virtually all sensitivity analysis methods consider a single [[univariate]] model output, yet many models output a large number of possibly spatially or time-dependent data. Note that this does not preclude the possibility of performing different sensitivity analyses for each output of interest. However, for models in which the outputs are correlated, the sensitivity measures can be hard to interpret.\n* '''Given data:''' While in many cases the practitioner has access to the model, in some instances a sensitivity analysis must be performed with \"given data\", i.e. where the sample points (the values of the model inputs for each run) cannot be chosen by the analyst. This may occur when a sensitivity analysis has to be performed retrospectively, perhaps using data from an optimisation or uncertainty analysis, or when data comes from a [[Discrete probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] source.<ref name=\"voodoo\">{{cite journal |last=Paruolo |first=P. |last2=Saisana |first2=M. |last3=Saltelli |first3=A. |year=2013 |title=Ratings and Rankings: Voodoo or Science? |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A]] |volume=176 |issue=3 |pages=609\u2013634 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-985X.2012.01059.x |arxiv=1104.3009 }}</ref>\n\n==Types of sensitivity analysis==\n===One-at-a-time (OAT)===\n\nOne of the simplest and most common approaches is that of changing one-factor-at-a-time (OAT), to see what effect this produces on the output.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Campbell |year=2008 |title=Photosynthetic Control of Atmospheric Carbonyl Sulfide During the Growing Season |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=322 |issue=5904 |pages=1085\u20131088 |doi=10.1126/science.1164015 |display-authors=etal |pmid=19008442|bibcode=2008Sci...322.1085C |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/82r9s2x3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Bailis |first2=M. |last2=Ezzati |first3=D. |last3=Kammen |year=2005 |title=Mortality and Greenhouse Gas Impacts of Biomass and Petroleum Energy Futures in Africa |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=308 |issue= 5718|pages=98\u2013103 |doi=10.1126/science.1106881 |pmid=15802601|bibcode=2005Sci...308...98B }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Murphy |year=2004 |title=Quantification of modelling uncertainties in a large ensemble of climate change simulations |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=430 |issue= 7001|pages=768\u2013772 |doi= 10.1038/nature02771|display-authors=etal |pmid=15306806|bibcode=2004Natur.430..768M}}</ref> OAT customarily involves\n\n* Moving one input variable, keeping others at their baseline (nominal) values, then,\n* Returning the variable to its nominal value, then repeating for each of the other inputs in the same way.\n\nSensitivity may then be measured by monitoring changes in the output, e.g. by [[partial derivatives]] or [[linear regression]]. This appears a logical approach as any change observed in the output will unambiguously be due to the single variable changed. Furthermore, by changing one variable at a time, one can keep all other variables fixed to their central or baseline values. This increases the comparability of the results (all 'effects' are computed with reference to the same central point in space) and minimizes the chances of computer programme crashes, more likely when several input factors are changed simultaneously.\nOAT is frequently preferred by modellers because of practical reasons. In case of model failure under OAT analysis the modeller immediately knows which is the input factor responsible for the failure.<ref name=\"OAT\" />\n\nDespite its simplicity however, this approach does not fully explore the input space, since it does not take into account the simultaneous variation of input variables.

Similar to OAT, local methods do not attempt to fully explore the input space, since they examine small perturbations, typically one variable at a time.\n\n\n===Regression analysis===\n[[Regression analysis]], in the context of sensitivity analysis, involves fitting a [[linear regression]] to the model response and using [[Standardized coefficient|standardized regression coefficients]] as direct measures of sensitivity. The regression is required to be linear with respect to the data (i.e. a hyperplane, hence with no quadratic terms, etc., as regressors) because otherwise it is difficult to interpret the standardised coefficients. This method is therefore most suitable when the model response is in fact linear;  linearity can be confirmed, for instance, if the [[coefficient of determination]] is large.

These can be expressed as conditional expectations, i.e., considering a model ''Y''=''f''('''''X''''') for '''''X'''''={''X''<sub>''1''</sub>, ''X''<sub>''2''</sub>, ... ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>}, a measure of sensitivity of the ''i''th variable ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> is given as,\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Var} \\left( E_{\\textbf{X}_{\\sim i}} \\left( Y \\mid X_i \\right)\n\\right)\n</math>\n\nwhere \"Var\" and \"''E''\" denote the variance and expected value operators respectively, and '''''X'''''<sub>''~i''</sub> denotes the set of all input variables except ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>. This expression essentially measures the contribution ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> alone to the uncertainty (variance) in ''Y'' (averaged over variations in other variables), and is known as the ''first-order sensitivity index'' or ''main effect index''. Importantly, it does not measure the uncertainty caused by interactions with other variables. A further measure, known as the ''total effect index'', gives the total variance in ''Y'' caused by ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> ''and'' its interactions with any of the other input variables. Both quantities are typically standardised by dividing by Var(''Y'').\n\nVariance-based methods allow full exploration of the input space, accounting for interactions, and nonlinear responses. For these reasons they are widely used when it is feasible to calculate them. Typically this calculation involves the use of [[Monte Carlo integration|Monte Carlo]] methods, but since this can involve many thousands of model runs, other methods (such as emulators) can be used to reduce computational expense when necessary. Note that full variance decompositions are only meaningful when the input factors are independent from one another.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Saltelli | first1 = A. | last2 = Tarantola | first2 = S. | year = 2002 | title = On the relative importance of input factors in mathematical models: safety assessment for nuclear waste disposal | url = | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 97 | issue = 459| pages = 702\u2013709 | doi=10.1198/016214502388618447}}</ref>\n\n===Variogram analysis of response surfaces (''VARS'')===\n\nOne of the major shortcomings of the previous sensitivity analysis methods is that none of them considers the spatially ordered structure of the response surface/output of the model ''Y''=''f''('''''X''''') in the parameter space. By utilizing the concepts of directional [[variogram]]s and covariograms, variogram analysis of response surfaces (VARS) addresses this weakness through recognizing a spatially continuous correlation structure to the values of ''Y'', and hence also to the values of <math> \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x_i} </math>.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Razavi|first1=Saman|last2=Gupta|first2=Hoshin V.|title=A new framework for comprehensive, robust, and efficient global sensitivity analysis: 1.

Accordingly, in the VARS framework, the values of directional [[variogram]]s for a given perturbation scale can be considered as a comprehensive illustration of sensitivity information, through linking variogram analysis to both direction and perturbation scale concepts. As a result, the VARS framework accounts for the fact that sensitivity is a scale-dependent concept, and thus overcomes the scale issue of traditional sensitivity analysis methods.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haghnegahdar|first1=Amin|last2=Razavi|first2=Saman|title=Insights into sensitivity analysis of Earth and environmental systems models: On the impact of parameter perturbation scale|journal=Environmental Modelling & Software|date=September 2017|volume=95|pages=115\u2013131|doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.03.031}}</ref> More importantly, VARS is able to provide relatively stable and statistically robust estimates of parameter sensitivity with much lower computational cost than other strategies (about two orders of magnitude more efficient).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=H|last2=Razavi|first2=S|editor1-last=Petropoulos|editor1-first=George|editor2-last=Srivastava|editor2-first=Prashant|title=Sensitivity Analysis in Earth Observation Modelling|date=2016|isbn=9780128030318|pages=397\u2013415|edition=1st|chapter-url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/sensitivity-analysis-in-earth-observation-modelling/petropoulos/978-0-12-803011-0|language=en|chapter=Challenges and Future Outlook of Sensitivity Analysis}}</ref> Noteworthy, it has been shown that there is a theoretical link between the VARS framework and the [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|variance-based]] and derivative-based approaches.\n\n===Screening===\nScreening is a particular instance of a sampling-based method. The objective here is rather to identify which input variables are contributing significantly to the output uncertainty in high-dimensionality models, rather than exactly quantifying sensitivity (i.e. in terms of variance). Screening tends to have a relatively low computational cost when compared to other approaches, and can be used in a preliminary analysis to weed out uninfluential variables before applying a more informative analysis to the remaining set. One of the most commonly used screening method is the [[Elementary effects method|elementary effect method]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = M.

The advantage of this approach is that it can also deal with \"given data\", i.e., a set of arbitrarily-placed data points, and gives a direct visual indication of sensitivity. Quantitative measures can also be drawn, for example by measuring the [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between ''Y'' and ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, or even by estimating variance-based measures by [[nonlinear regression]].<ref name=\"voodoo\" />\n\n==Alternative methods==\nA number of methods have been developed to overcome some of the constraints discussed above, which would otherwise make the estimation of sensitivity measures infeasible (most often due to [[computational expense]]). Generally, these methods focus on efficiently calculating variance-based measures of sensitivity.\n\n===Emulators===\nEmulators (also known as metamodels, surrogate models or response surfaces) are [[Data modeling|data-modeling]]/[[machine learning]] approaches that involve building a relatively simple mathematical function, known as an ''emulator'', that approximates the input/output behavior of the model itself.<ref name=\"emcomp\">{{cite journal | last1 = Storlie | first1 = C.B. | last2 = Swiler | first2 = L.P. | last3 = Helton | first3 = J.C. | last4 = Sallaberry | first4 = C.J. | year = 2009 | title = Implementation and evaluation of nonparametric regression procedures for sensitivity analysis of computationally demanding models | url = | journal = Reliability Engineering & System Safety | volume = 94 | issue = 11| pages = 1735\u20131763 | doi=10.1016/j.ress.2009.05.007}}</ref> In other words, it is the concept of \"modeling a model\" (hence the name \"metamodel\"). The idea is that, although computer models may be a very complex series of equations that can take a long time to solve, they can always be regarded as a function of their inputs ''Y''=''f''('''''X'''''). By running the model at a number of points in the input space, it may be possible to fit a much simpler emulator ''\u03b7''('''''X'''''), such that ''\u03b7''('''''X''''')\u2248''f''('''''X''''') to within an acceptable margin of error.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Shangying|last2=Fan|first2=Kai|last3=Luo|first3=Nan|last4=Cao|first4=Yangxiaolu|last5=Wu|first5=Feilun|last6=Zhang|first6=Carolyn|last7=Heller|first7=Katherine A.|last8=You|first8=Lingchong|date=2019-09-25|title=Massive computational acceleration by using neural networks to emulate mechanism-based biological models|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=4354|doi=10.1038/s41467-019-12342-y|issn=2041-1723|pmc=6761138|pmid=31554788}}</ref> Then, sensitivity measures can be calculated from the emulator (either with Monte Carlo or analytically), which will have a negligible additional computational cost.

This requires the following steps,\n# Sampling (running) the model at a number of points in its input space. This requires a sample design.\n# Selecting a type of emulator (mathematical function) to use.\n# \"Training\" the emulator using the sample data from the model \u2013 this generally involves adjusting the emulator parameters until the emulator mimics the true model as well as possible.\n\nSampling the model can often be done with [[low-discrepancy sequences]], such as the [[Sobol sequence]] \u2013 due to mathematician [[Ilya M. Sobol]] or [[Latin hypercube sampling]], although random designs can also be used, at the loss of some efficiency. The selection of the emulator type and the training are intrinsically linked since the training method will be dependent on the class of emulator. Some types of emulators that have been used successfully for sensitivity analysis include,\n* [[Gaussian processes]]<ref name=\"oak\" /> (also known as [[kriging]]), where any combination of output points is assumed to be distributed as a [[multivariate Gaussian distribution]].

The HDMR approach exploits the fact that the model can usually be well-approximated by neglecting higher-order interactions (second or third-order and above). The terms in the truncated series can then each be approximated by e.g. polynomials or splines (REFS) and the response expressed as the sum of the main effects and interactions up to the truncation order. From this perspective, HDMRs can be seen as emulators which neglect high-order interactions; the advantage is that they are able to emulate models with higher dimensionality than full-order emulators.\n\n===Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST)===\n{{Main article| Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing }}\n\nThe Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) uses the [[Fourier series]] to represent a multivariate function (the model) in the frequency domain, using a single frequency variable. Therefore, the integrals required to calculate sensitivity indices become univariate, resulting in computational savings.\n\n===Other===\nMethods based on Monte Carlo filtering.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hornberger |first=G. |first2=R. |last2=Spear |year=1981 |title=An approach to the preliminary analysis of environmental systems |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |volume=7 |issue= |pages=7\u201318 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Saltelli |first=A. |first2=S. |last2=Tarantola |first3=F. |last3=Campolongo |first4=M. |last4=Ratto |year=2004 |title=Sensitivity Analysis in Practice: A Guide to Assessing Scientific Models |location= |publisher=John Wiley and Sons }}</ref> These are also sampling-based and the objective here is to identify regions in the space of the input factors corresponding to particular values (e.g. high or low) of the output.\n\n==Other issues==\n\n===Assumptions vs. inferences===\nIn uncertainty and sensitivity analysis there is a crucial trade off between how scrupulous an analyst is in exploring the input [[:wikt:assumption|assumptions]] and how wide the resulting [[inference]] may be. The point is well illustrated by the econometrician [[Edward E. Leamer]]:<ref>{{cite journal |first=Edward E. |last=Leamer |title=Let's Take the Con Out of Econometrics |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=73 |issue=1 |year=1983 |pages=31\u201343 |jstor=1803924 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Edward E. |last=Leamer |title=Sensitivity Analyses Would Help |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=75 |issue=3 |year=1985 |pages=308\u2013313 |jstor=1814801 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I have proposed a form of organized sensitivity analysis that I call 'global sensitivity analysis' in which a neighborhood of alternative assumptions is selected and the corresponding interval of inferences is identified. Conclusions are judged to be sturdy only if the neighborhood of assumptions is wide enough to be credible and the corresponding interval of inferences is narrow enough to be useful.</blockquote>\n\nNote Leamer's emphasis is on the need for 'credibility' in the selection of assumptions. The easiest way to invalidate a model is to demonstrate that it is fragile with respect to the uncertainty in the assumptions or to show that its assumptions have not been taken 'wide enough'. The same concept is expressed by Jerome R. Ravetz, for whom bad modeling is when ''uncertainties in inputs must be suppressed lest outputs become indeterminate.''<ref>Ravetz, J.R., 2007, ''No-Nonsense Guide to Science'', New Internationalist Publications Ltd.</ref>\n\n===Pitfalls and difficulties===\nSome common difficulties in sensitivity analysis include\n* Too many model inputs to analyse. Screening can be used to reduce dimensionality. Another way to tackle the curse of dimensionality is to use sampling based on low discrepancy sequences<ref>O. Tsvetkova, T.B.M.J. Ouarda, Quasi-Monte Carlo technique in global sensitivity analysis of wind resource assessment with a study on UAE, J. Renew. Sustain. Energy. 11 (2019). doi:10.1063/1.5120035.</ref>\n* The model takes too long to run. Emulators (including HDMR) can reduce the number of model runs needed.\n* There is not enough information to build probability distributions for the inputs. Probability distributions can be constructed from [[expert elicitation]], although even then it may be hard to build distributions with great confidence. The subjectivity of the probability distributions or ranges will strongly affect the sensitivity analysis.\n* Unclear purpose of the analysis. Different statistical tests nd measures are applied to the problem and different factors rankings are obtained. The test should instead be tailored to the purpose of the analysis, e.g. one uses Monte Carlo filtering if one is interested in which factors are most responsible for generating high/low values of the output.\n* Too many model outputs are considered. This may be acceptable for quality assurance of sub-models but should be avoided when presenting the results of the overall analysis.\n* Piecewise sensitivity. This is when one performs sensitivity analysis on one sub-model at a time. This approach is non conservative as it might overlook interactions among factors in different sub-models (Type II error).\n* Commonly used OAT approach is not valid for nonlinear models. Global methods should be used instead.<ref>A. Saltelli, K. Aleksankina, W. Becker, P. Fennell, F. Ferretti, N. Holst, S. Li, Q.

For example, [[global climate model]]s are used for both short-term [[weather forecasts]] and long-term [[climate change]]. Moreover, computer models are increasingly used for environmental decision-making at a local scale, for example for assessing the impact of a waste water treatment plant on a river flow, or for assessing the behavior and life-length of bio-filters for contaminated waste water. Similarly, sensitivity analyses can be used to evaluate the effect of demographic and environmental variables on the viability of populations to guide wildlife management <ref name=\"Applicability and limitations of sensitivity analyses for wildlife management\">{{cite journal |last=Manlik |first=O. |last2=Lacy |first2=R.C. |last3=Sherwin |first3=W.B.|year=2018 |title=Applicability and limitations of sensitivity analyses for wildlife management |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=1430\u20131440 |doi=10.1111/1365-2664.13044 }}</ref>\n\nIn either case, sensitivity analysis may help to understand the contribution of the various sources of uncertainty to the model output uncertainty and the system performance in general. In these cases, depending on model complexity, different sampling strategies may be advisable and traditional sensitivity indices have to be generalized to cover multiple model outputs,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fass\u00f2 |first=Alessandro |year=2006 |title=Sensitivity Analysis for Environmental Models and Monitoring Networks |journal=Preprint |url=http://www.iemss.org/iemss2006/papers/s7/268_Fasso_0.pdf }}</ref> [[heteroskedastic]] effects and correlated inputs.<ref name=\"tavakoli2\"/>\n\n===Business===\nIn a decision problem, the analyst may want to identify cost drivers as well as other quantities for which we need to acquire better knowledge in order to make an informed decision. On the other hand, some quantities have no influence on the predictions, so that we can save resources at no loss in accuracy by relaxing some of the conditions. See [[Corporate finance#Quantifying uncertainty|Corporate finance: Quantifying uncertainty]].\nAdditionally to the general motivations listed above, sensitivity analysis can help in a variety of other circumstances specific to business:\n\n* To identify critical assumptions or compare alternative model structures\n* To guide future data collections\n* To optimize the tolerance of manufactured parts in terms of the uncertainty in the parameters\n* To optimize resources allocation\n\nHowever, there are also some problems associated with sensitivity analysis in the business context:\n* Variables are often interdependent ([[correlation|correlated]]), which makes examining each variable individually unrealistic. E.G. changing one factor such as sales volume, will most likely affect other factors such as the selling price.\n* Often the assumptions upon which the analysis is based are made by using past experience/data which may not hold in the future.\n* Assigning a maximum and minimum (or optimistic and pessimistic) value is open to subjective interpretation. For instance, one person's 'optimistic' forecast may be more conservative than that of another person performing a different part of the analysis. This sort of subjectivity can adversely affect the accuracy and overall objectivity of the analysis.\n\n===Social sciences===\nSensitivity analysis is common practice in social sciences.

Sensitivity analysis allows designers to assess the effects and sources of uncertainties, in the interest of building robust models.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Becker | first1 = W. | last2 = Rowson | first2 = J. | last3 = Oakley | first3 = J.E. | last4 = Yoxall | first4 = A. | last5 = Manson | first5 = G. | last6 = Worden | first6 = K. | year = 2011 | title = Bayesian sensitivity analysis of a model of the aortic valve | url = | journal = Journal of Biomechanics | volume = 44 | issue = 8| pages = 1499\u2013506 | doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.03.008| pmid = 21481873 }}</ref>\n\n===In meta-analysis===\nIn a [[meta analysis]], a sensitivity analysis tests if the results are sensitive to restrictions on the data included. Common examples are large trials only, higher quality trials only, and more recent trials only. If results are consistent it provides stronger evidence of an effect and of [[generalizability]].<ref>[http://clinicalevidence.bmj.com/ceweb/resources/glossary.jsp clinicalevidence.bmj.com > Glossary > sensitivity analysis] Retrieved on June 21, 2010</ref>\n\n===Multi-criteria decision making===\nSometimes a sensitivity analysis may reveal surprising insights about the subject of interest.  For instance, the field of  [[multi-criteria decision making]] (MCDM) studies (among other topics) the problem of how to select the best alternative among a number of competing alternatives.  This is an important task in [[decision making]].  In such a setting each alternative is described in terms of a set of evaluative criteria.  These criteria are associated with weights of importance.  Intuitively, one may think that the larger the weight for a criterion is, the more critical that criterion should be.  However, this may not be the case.  It is important to distinguish here the notion of ''criticality'' with that of ''importance.''  By ''critical,'' we mean that a criterion with small change (as a percentage) in its weight, may cause a significant change of the final solution.  It is possible criteria with rather small weights of importance (i.e., ones that are not so important in that respect) to be much more critical in a given situation than ones with larger weights.<ref name = 'SENSITIVITY'>{{cite journal | title = A Sensitivity Analysis Approach for Some Deterministic Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Methods | journal = Decision Sciences | year=1997 | first = E. | last = Triantaphyllou | authorlink = |author2=A.

This, in turn, may dramatically improve the effectiveness of the initial study and assist in the successful implementation of the final solution.\n\n===Time-critical decision making===\n{{see also|Window of opportunity}}\nProducing time-critical accurate knowledge about the state of a system (effect) under computational and data acquisition (cause) constraints is a major challenge, especially if the knowledge required is critical to the system operation where the safety of operators or integrity of costly equipment is at stake, e.g., during manufacturing or during environment substrate drilling.\nUnderstanding and interpreting, a chain of interrelated events, predicted or unpredicted, that may or may not result in a specific state of the system, is the core challenge of this research. Sensitivity analysis may be used to identify which set of input data signals has a significant impact on the set of system state information (i.e. output). Through a cause-effect analysis technique, sensitivity can be used to support the filtering of unsolicited data to reduce the communication and computational capabilities of a standard supervisory control and data acquisition system.<ref name=\"tavakoli2\"/>\n\n===Model calibration and improvement===\nOne application of sensitivity analysis addresses the question of \"What's important to model or system development?\" One can seek to identify important connections between observations, model inputs, and predictions or forecasts. That is, one can seek to understand what observations (measurements of dependent variables) are most and least important to model inputs (parameters representing system characteristics or excitation), what model inputs are most and least important to predictions or forecasts, and what observations are most and least important to the predictions and forecasts. Often the results are surprising, lead to finding problems in the data or model development, and fixing the problems. This leads to better models.<ref name=\"Model Analysis\"/><ref name=\"Methods and Guidelines\"/> In biomedical engineering, sensitivity analysis can be used to determine system dynamics in ODE-based kinetic models. Parameters corresponding to stages of differentiation can be varied to determine which parameter is most influential on cell fate. Therefore, the most limiting step can be identified and the cell state for most advantageous scale-up and expansion can be determined.<ref> {{cite journal | last1 = Selekman | first1 = JA | last2 = Das | first2 = A | last3 = Grundl | first3 = NJ | last4 = Palecek | first4 = SP | year = 2013 | title = Improving efficiency of human pluripotent stem cell differentiation platforms using an integrated experimental and computational approach | url = | journal = Biotechnol Bioeng | volume = 110 | issue = 11| pages = 3024\u201337 }}</ref> Additionally, complex networks in systems biology can be better understood through fitting mass-action kinetic models.

In these cases the framing of the analysis itself, its institutional context, and the motivations of its author may become a matter of great importance, and a pure sensitivity analysis \u2013 with its emphasis on parametric uncertainty \u2013 may be seen as insufficient. The emphasis on the framing may derive inter-alia from the relevance of the policy study to different constituencies that are characterized by different norms and values, and hence by a different story about 'what the problem is' and foremost about 'who is telling the story'. Most often the framing includes more or less implicit assumptions, which could be political (e.g. which group needs to be protected) all the way to technical (e.g. which variable can be treated as a constant).\n\nIn order to take these concerns into due consideration the instruments of SA have been extended to provide an assessment of the entire knowledge and model generating process. This approach has been called 'sensitivity auditing'. It takes inspiration from NUSAP,<ref name=\"NUSAP\">{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Sluijs | first1 = JP | last2 = Craye | first2 = M | last3 = Funtowicz | first3 = S | last4 = Kloprogge | first4 = P | last5 = Ravetz | first5 = J | last6 = Risbey | first6 = J | year = 2005 | title = Combining quantitative and qualitative measures of uncertainty in model based environmental assessment: the NUSAP system | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 481\u2013492 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2005.00604.x| pmid = 15876219 }}</ref> a method used to qualify the worth of quantitative information with the generation of `Pedigrees' of numbers.

In a design of experiments, one studies the effect of some process or intervention (the 'treatment') on some objects (the 'experimental units'). In sensitivity analysis one looks at the effect of varying the inputs of a mathematical model on the output of the model itself. In both disciplines one strives to obtain information from the system with a minimum of physical or numerical experiments.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Causality]]\n* [[Elementary effects method]]\n* [[Experimental uncertainty analysis]]\n* [[Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing]]\n* [[Info-gap decision theory]]\n* [[Interval FEM]]\n* [[Perturbation analysis]]\n* [[Probabilistic design]]\n* [[Probability bounds analysis]]\n* [[Robustification]]\n* [[ROC curve]]\n* [[Uncertainty quantification]]\n* [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Cannav\u00f3 | first1 = F. | year = 2012 | title = Sensitivity analysis for volcanic source modeling quality assessment and model selection | url = | journal = Computers & Geosciences | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 52\u201359 | doi = 10.1016/j.cageo.2012.03.008 | bibcode = 2012CG.....44...52C }}\n*Fass\u00f2 A.

In such cases, the model can be viewed as a [[black box]], i.e. the output is an \"opaque\" function of its inputs.\n\nQuite often, some or all of the model inputs are subject to sources of [[Uncertainty quantification|uncertainty]], including [[Measurement uncertainty|errors of measurement]], absence of information and poor or partial understanding of the driving forces and mechanisms.  This uncertainty imposes a limit on our [[confidence]] in the response or output of the model. Further, models may have to cope with the natural intrinsic variability of the system (aleatory), such as the occurrence of [[stochastic]] events.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Der Kiureghian |first=A. |last2=Ditlevsen |first2=O. |year=2009 |title=Aleatory or epistemic?

This requires, first, a [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] of the uncertainty in any model results ([[uncertainty analysis]]); and second, an evaluation of how much each input is contributing to the output uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis addresses the second of these issues (although uncertainty analysis is usually a necessary precursor), performing the role of ordering by importance the strength and relevance of the inputs in determining the variation in the output.<ref name=\"Primer\" />\n\nIn models involving many input variables, sensitivity analysis is an essential ingredient of model building and quality assurance. National and international agencies involved in [[impact assessment]] studies have included sections devoted to sensitivity analysis in their guidelines. Examples are the [[European Commission]] (see e.g. the guidelines for [[impact assessment]]),<ref name=\"EC_GUIDE\">http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/commission_guidelines/docs/iag_2009_en.pdf</ref> the White House [[Office of Management and Budget]], the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and [[US Environmental Protection Agency]]'s modeling guidelines.<ref>http://www.epa.gov/CREM/library/cred_guidance_0309.pdf</ref>\n\n==Settings and constraints==\nThe choice of method of sensitivity analysis is typically dictated by a number of problem constraints or settings. Some of the most common are\n* '''Computational expense:''' Sensitivity analysis is almost always performed by running the model a (possibly large) number of times, i.e. a [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]]-based approach.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

This is not unusual with very complex models.\n** The model has a large number of uncertain inputs. Sensitivity analysis is essentially the exploration of the [[Dimension|multidimensional input space]], which grows exponentially in size with the number of inputs. See the [[curse of dimensionality]].\n:Computational expense is a problem in many practical sensitivity analyses. Some methods of reducing computational expense include the use of emulators (for large models), and screening methods (for reducing the dimensionality of the problem). Another method is to use an event-based sensitivity analysis method for variable selection for time-constrained applications.<ref name=\"tavakoli1\">{{cite journal |last=Tavakoli |first= Siamak |first2=Alireza |last2=Mousavi |title=Event tracking for real-time unaware sensitivity analysis (EventTracker) |journal=IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=348\u2013359 |doi=10.1109/tkde.2011.240|url= http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/8690 }}</ref> This is an input variable selection (IVS) method that assembles together information about the trace of the changes in system inputs and outputs using sensitivity analysis to produce an input/output trigger/event matrix that is designed to map the relationships between input data as causes that trigger events and the output data that describes the actual events. The cause-effect relationship between the causes of state change i.e. input variables and the effect system output parameters determines which set of inputs have a genuine impact on a given output.

In such cases, [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|variance-based measures]] are more appropriate.\n* '''Model interactions:''' [[Interaction (statistics)|Interactions]] occur when the perturbation of two or more inputs ''simultaneously'' causes variation in the output greater than that of varying each of the inputs alone. Such interactions are present in any model that is non-[[Additive map|additive]], but will be neglected by methods such as scatterplots and one-at-a-time perturbations.<ref name=\"OAT\">{{cite journal |last=Saltelli |first=A. |last2=Annoni |first2=P. |year=2010 |title=How to avoid a perfunctory sensitivity analysis |journal=Environmental Modeling and Software |volume=25 |issue= 12|pages=1508\u20131517 |doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.04.012}}</ref> The effect of interactions can be measured by the [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|total-order sensitivity index]].\n* '''Multiple outputs:''' Virtually all sensitivity analysis methods consider a single [[univariate]] model output, yet many models output a large number of possibly spatially or time-dependent data. Note that this does not preclude the possibility of performing different sensitivity analyses for each output of interest. However, for models in which the outputs are correlated, the sensitivity measures can be hard to interpret.\n* '''Given data:''' While in many cases the practitioner has access to the model, in some instances a sensitivity analysis must be performed with \"given data\", i.e. where the sample points (the values of the model inputs for each run) cannot be chosen by the analyst.

This appears a logical approach as any change observed in the output will unambiguously be due to the single variable changed. Furthermore, by changing one variable at a time, one can keep all other variables fixed to their central or baseline values. This increases the comparability of the results (all 'effects' are computed with reference to the same central point in space) and minimizes the chances of computer programme crashes, more likely when several input factors are changed simultaneously.\nOAT is frequently preferred by modellers because of practical reasons. In case of model failure under OAT analysis the modeller immediately knows which is the input factor responsible for the failure.<ref name=\"OAT\" />\n\nDespite its simplicity however, this approach does not fully explore the input space, since it does not take into account the simultaneous variation of input variables. This means that the OAT approach cannot detect the presence of [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] between input variables.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Czitrom|first=Veronica|authorlink= Veronica Czitrom |year=1999 |title=One-Factor-at-a-Time Versus Designed Experiments |journal=American Statistician |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=126\u2013131 |doi=10.2307/2685731|jstor= 2685731}}</ref>\n\n==Sensitivity analysis methods==\n[[File:Sensitivity scheme.jpg|thumb|right | upright=2 | Ideal scheme of a possibly sampling-based sensitivity analysis.

Similar to OAT, local methods do not attempt to fully explore the input space, since they examine small perturbations, typically one variable at a time.\n\n\n===Regression analysis===\n[[Regression analysis]], in the context of sensitivity analysis, involves fitting a [[linear regression]] to the model response and using [[Standardized coefficient|standardized regression coefficients]] as direct measures of sensitivity. The regression is required to be linear with respect to the data (i.e. a hyperplane, hence with no quadratic terms, etc., as regressors) because otherwise it is difficult to interpret the standardised coefficients. This method is therefore most suitable when the model response is in fact linear;  linearity can be confirmed, for instance, if the [[coefficient of determination]] is large. The advantages of regression analysis are that it is simple and has a low computational cost.\n\n===Variance-based methods===\n{{Main article|Variance-based sensitivity analysis}}\nVariance-based methods<ref>Sobol', I.

New York: John Wiley and Sons.</ref> are a class of probabilistic approaches which quantify the input and output uncertainties as [[probability distribution]]s, and decompose the output variance into parts attributable to input variables and combinations of variables. The sensitivity of the output to an input variable is therefore measured by the amount of variance in the output caused by that input. These can be expressed as conditional expectations, i.e., considering a model ''Y''=''f''('''''X''''') for '''''X'''''={''X''<sub>''1''</sub>, ''X''<sub>''2''</sub>, ... ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>}, a measure of sensitivity of the ''i''th variable ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> is given as,\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Var} \\left( E_{\\textbf{X}_{\\sim i}} \\left( Y \\mid X_i \\right)\n\\right)\n</math>\n\nwhere \"Var\" and \"''E''\" denote the variance and expected value operators respectively, and '''''X'''''<sub>''~i''</sub> denotes the set of all input variables except ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>. This expression essentially measures the contribution ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> alone to the uncertainty (variance) in ''Y'' (averaged over variations in other variables), and is known as the ''first-order sensitivity index'' or ''main effect index''. Importantly, it does not measure the uncertainty caused by interactions with other variables. A further measure, known as the ''total effect index'', gives the total variance in ''Y'' caused by ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> ''and'' its interactions with any of the other input variables. Both quantities are typically standardised by dividing by Var(''Y'').\n\nVariance-based methods allow full exploration of the input space, accounting for interactions, and nonlinear responses. For these reasons they are widely used when it is feasible to calculate them. Typically this calculation involves the use of [[Monte Carlo integration|Monte Carlo]] methods, but since this can involve many thousands of model runs, other methods (such as emulators) can be used to reduce computational expense when necessary. Note that full variance decompositions are only meaningful when the input factors are independent from one another.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Saltelli | first1 = A. | last2 = Tarantola | first2 = S. | year = 2002 | title = On the relative importance of input factors in mathematical models: safety assessment for nuclear waste disposal | url = | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 97 | issue = 459| pages = 702\u2013709 | doi=10.1198/016214502388618447}}</ref>\n\n===Variogram analysis of response surfaces (''VARS'')===\n\nOne of the major shortcomings of the previous sensitivity analysis methods is that none of them considers the spatially ordered structure of the response surface/output of the model ''Y''=''f''('''''X''''') in the parameter space. By utilizing the concepts of directional [[variogram]]s and covariograms, variogram analysis of response surfaces (VARS) addresses this weakness through recognizing a spatially continuous correlation structure to the values of ''Y'', and hence also to the values of <math> \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x_i} </math>.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Razavi|first1=Saman|last2=Gupta|first2=Hoshin V.|title=A new framework for comprehensive, robust, and efficient global sensitivity analysis: 1.

Accordingly, in the VARS framework, the values of directional [[variogram]]s for a given perturbation scale can be considered as a comprehensive illustration of sensitivity information, through linking variogram analysis to both direction and perturbation scale concepts. As a result, the VARS framework accounts for the fact that sensitivity is a scale-dependent concept, and thus overcomes the scale issue of traditional sensitivity analysis methods.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haghnegahdar|first1=Amin|last2=Razavi|first2=Saman|title=Insights into sensitivity analysis of Earth and environmental systems models: On the impact of parameter perturbation scale|journal=Environmental Modelling & Software|date=September 2017|volume=95|pages=115\u2013131|doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.03.031}}</ref> More importantly, VARS is able to provide relatively stable and statistically robust estimates of parameter sensitivity with much lower computational cost than other strategies (about two orders of magnitude more efficient).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=H|last2=Razavi|first2=S|editor1-last=Petropoulos|editor1-first=George|editor2-last=Srivastava|editor2-first=Prashant|title=Sensitivity Analysis in Earth Observation Modelling|date=2016|isbn=9780128030318|pages=397\u2013415|edition=1st|chapter-url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/sensitivity-analysis-in-earth-observation-modelling/petropoulos/978-0-12-803011-0|language=en|chapter=Challenges and Future Outlook of Sensitivity Analysis}}</ref> Noteworthy, it has been shown that there is a theoretical link between the VARS framework and the [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|variance-based]] and derivative-based approaches.\n\n===Screening===\nScreening is a particular instance of a sampling-based method. The objective here is rather to identify which input variables are contributing significantly to the output uncertainty in high-dimensionality models, rather than exactly quantifying sensitivity (i.e. in terms of variance). Screening tends to have a relatively low computational cost when compared to other approaches, and can be used in a preliminary analysis to weed out uninfluential variables before applying a more informative analysis to the remaining set. One of the most commonly used screening method is the [[Elementary effects method|elementary effect method]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = M.

The advantage of this approach is that it can also deal with \"given data\", i.e., a set of arbitrarily-placed data points, and gives a direct visual indication of sensitivity. Quantitative measures can also be drawn, for example by measuring the [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between ''Y'' and ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, or even by estimating variance-based measures by [[nonlinear regression]].<ref name=\"voodoo\" />\n\n==Alternative methods==\nA number of methods have been developed to overcome some of the constraints discussed above, which would otherwise make the estimation of sensitivity measures infeasible (most often due to [[computational expense]]). Generally, these methods focus on efficiently calculating variance-based measures of sensitivity.\n\n===Emulators===\nEmulators (also known as metamodels, surrogate models or response surfaces) are [[Data modeling|data-modeling]]/[[machine learning]] approaches that involve building a relatively simple mathematical function, known as an ''emulator'', that approximates the input/output behavior of the model itself.<ref name=\"emcomp\">{{cite journal | last1 = Storlie | first1 = C.B. | last2 = Swiler | first2 = L.P. | last3 = Helton | first3 = J.C. | last4 = Sallaberry | first4 = C.J. | year = 2009 | title = Implementation and evaluation of nonparametric regression procedures for sensitivity analysis of computationally demanding models | url = | journal = Reliability Engineering & System Safety | volume = 94 | issue = 11| pages = 1735\u20131763 | doi=10.1016/j.ress.2009.05.007}}</ref> In other words, it is the concept of \"modeling a model\" (hence the name \"metamodel\").

By running the model at a number of points in the input space, it may be possible to fit a much simpler emulator ''\u03b7''('''''X'''''), such that ''\u03b7''('''''X''''')\u2248''f''('''''X''''') to within an acceptable margin of error.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Shangying|last2=Fan|first2=Kai|last3=Luo|first3=Nan|last4=Cao|first4=Yangxiaolu|last5=Wu|first5=Feilun|last6=Zhang|first6=Carolyn|last7=Heller|first7=Katherine A.|last8=You|first8=Lingchong|date=2019-09-25|title=Massive computational acceleration by using neural networks to emulate mechanism-based biological models|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=4354|doi=10.1038/s41467-019-12342-y|issn=2041-1723|pmc=6761138|pmid=31554788}}</ref> Then, sensitivity measures can be calculated from the emulator (either with Monte Carlo or analytically), which will have a negligible additional computational cost.

This requires a sample design.\n# Selecting a type of emulator (mathematical function) to use.\n# \"Training\" the emulator using the sample data from the model \u2013 this generally involves adjusting the emulator parameters until the emulator mimics the true model as well as possible.\n\nSampling the model can often be done with [[low-discrepancy sequences]], such as the [[Sobol sequence]] \u2013 due to mathematician [[Ilya M.

The selection of the emulator type and the training are intrinsically linked since the training method will be dependent on the class of emulator.

The HDMR approach exploits the fact that the model can usually be well-approximated by neglecting higher-order interactions (second or third-order and above). The terms in the truncated series can then each be approximated by e.g. polynomials or splines (REFS) and the response expressed as the sum of the main effects and interactions up to the truncation order. From this perspective, HDMRs can be seen as emulators which neglect high-order interactions; the advantage is that they are able to emulate models with higher dimensionality than full-order emulators.\n\n===Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST)===\n{{Main article| Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing }}\n\nThe Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) uses the [[Fourier series]] to represent a multivariate function (the model) in the frequency domain, using a single frequency variable.

The point is well illustrated by the econometrician [[Edward E. Leamer]]:<ref>{{cite journal |first=Edward E. |last=Leamer |title=Let's Take the Con Out of Econometrics |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=73 |issue=1 |year=1983 |pages=31\u201343 |jstor=1803924 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Edward E. |last=Leamer |title=Sensitivity Analyses Would Help |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=75 |issue=3 |year=1985 |pages=308\u2013313 |jstor=1814801 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I have proposed a form of organized sensitivity analysis that I call 'global sensitivity analysis' in which a neighborhood of alternative assumptions is selected and the corresponding interval of inferences is identified. Conclusions are judged to be sturdy only if the neighborhood of assumptions is wide enough to be credible and the corresponding interval of inferences is narrow enough to be useful.</blockquote>\n\nNote Leamer's emphasis is on the need for 'credibility' in the selection of assumptions. The easiest way to invalidate a model is to demonstrate that it is fragile with respect to the uncertainty in the assumptions or to show that its assumptions have not been taken 'wide enough'. The same concept is expressed by Jerome R. Ravetz, for whom bad modeling is when ''uncertainties in inputs must be suppressed lest outputs become indeterminate.''<ref>Ravetz, J.R., 2007, ''No-Nonsense Guide to Science'', New Internationalist Publications Ltd.</ref>\n\n===Pitfalls and difficulties===\nSome common difficulties in sensitivity analysis include\n* Too many model inputs to analyse. Screening can be used to reduce dimensionality. Another way to tackle the curse of dimensionality is to use sampling based on low discrepancy sequences<ref>O. Tsvetkova, T.B.M.J.

Energy. 11 (2019). doi:10.1063/1.5120035.</ref>\n* The model takes too long to run. Emulators (including HDMR) can reduce the number of model runs needed.\n* There is not enough information to build probability distributions for the inputs. Probability distributions can be constructed from [[expert elicitation]], although even then it may be hard to build distributions with great confidence. The subjectivity of the probability distributions or ranges will strongly affect the sensitivity analysis.\n* Unclear purpose of the analysis. Different statistical tests nd measures are applied to the problem and different factors rankings are obtained. The test should instead be tailored to the purpose of the analysis, e.g. one uses Monte Carlo filtering if one is interested in which factors are most responsible for generating high/low values of the output.\n* Too many model outputs are considered. This may be acceptable for quality assurance of sub-models but should be avoided when presenting the results of the overall analysis.\n* Piecewise sensitivity. This is when one performs sensitivity analysis on one sub-model at a time. This approach is non conservative as it might overlook interactions among factors in different sub-models (Type II error).\n* Commonly used OAT approach is not valid for nonlinear models. Global methods should be used instead.<ref>A. Saltelli, K. Aleksankina, W. Becker, P. Fennell, F. Ferretti, N. Holst, S. Li, Q.

Moreover, computer models are increasingly used for environmental decision-making at a local scale, for example for assessing the impact of a waste water treatment plant on a river flow, or for assessing the behavior and life-length of bio-filters for contaminated waste water.

See [[Corporate finance#Quantifying uncertainty|Corporate finance: Quantifying uncertainty]].\nAdditionally to the general motivations listed above, sensitivity analysis can help in a variety of other circumstances specific to business:\n\n* To identify critical assumptions or compare alternative model structures\n* To guide future data collections\n* To optimize the tolerance of manufactured parts in terms of the uncertainty in the parameters\n* To optimize resources allocation\n\nHowever, there are also some problems associated with sensitivity analysis in the business context:\n* Variables are often interdependent ([[correlation|correlated]]), which makes examining each variable individually unrealistic. E.G. changing one factor such as sales volume, will most likely affect other factors such as the selling price.\n* Often the assumptions upon which the analysis is based are made by using past experience/data which may not hold in the future.\n* Assigning a maximum and minimum (or optimistic and pessimistic) value is open to subjective interpretation. For instance, one person's 'optimistic' forecast may be more conservative than that of another person performing a different part of the analysis. This sort of subjectivity can adversely affect the accuracy and overall objectivity of the analysis.\n\n===Social sciences===\nSensitivity analysis is common practice in social sciences. A famous early example is Mroz (1987), who analysed [[econometric model]]s of female labor market participation.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Thomas A. |last=Mroz |title=The Sensitivity of an Empirical Model of Married Women's Hours of Work to Economic and Statistical Assumptions |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=55 |issue=4 |year=1987 |pages=765\u2013799 |doi=10.2307/1911029 |jstor=1911029 }}</ref>\n\nIn modern econometrics the use of sensitivity analysis to anticipate criticism is the subject of one of [[Peter Kennedy (economist)|Peter Kennedy]]'s \"ten commandments of applied econometrics\":<ref>{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=P. |year=2007 |title=A Guide to Econometrics |edition=Fifth |publisher=Blackwell |location= |isbn= 9780262611831|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8I5SP69e4kC }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Thou shall confess in the presence of sensitivity.

Sensitivity analysis can be used for [[optimal experimental design]], e.g. determining initial conditions, measurement positions, and sampling time, to generate informative data which are critical to estimation accuracy. A great number of parameters in a complex model can be candidates for estimation but not all are estimable.<ref name=\"SRI\"/> Sensitivity analysis can be used to identify the influential parameters which can be determined from available data while screening out the unimportant ones. Sensitivity analysis can also be used to identify the redundant species and reactions allowing model reduction.\n\n===Engineering===\nModern [[engineering]] design makes extensive use of computer models to test designs before they are manufactured. Sensitivity analysis allows designers to assess the effects and sources of uncertainties, in the interest of building robust models.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Becker | first1 = W. | last2 = Rowson | first2 = J. | last3 = Oakley | first3 = J.E. | last4 = Yoxall | first4 = A. | last5 = Manson | first5 = G. | last6 = Worden | first6 = K. | year = 2011 | title = Bayesian sensitivity analysis of a model of the aortic valve | url = | journal = Journal of Biomechanics | volume = 44 | issue = 8| pages = 1499\u2013506 | doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.03.008| pmid = 21481873 }}</ref>\n\n===In meta-analysis===\nIn a [[meta analysis]], a sensitivity analysis tests if the results are sensitive to restrictions on the data included. Common examples are large trials only, higher quality trials only, and more recent trials only.

For instance, the field of  [[multi-criteria decision making]] (MCDM) studies (among other topics) the problem of how to select the best alternative among a number of competing alternatives.  This is an important task in [[decision making]].  In such a setting each alternative is described in terms of a set of evaluative criteria.  These criteria are associated with weights of importance.  Intuitively, one may think that the larger the weight for a criterion is, the more critical that criterion should be.  However, this may not be the case.  It is important to distinguish here the notion of ''criticality'' with that of ''importance.''  By ''critical,'' we mean that a criterion with small change (as a percentage) in its weight, may cause a significant change of the final solution.  It is possible criteria with rather small weights of importance (i.e., ones that are not so important in that respect) to be much more critical in a given situation than ones with larger weights.<ref name = 'SENSITIVITY'>{{cite journal | title = A Sensitivity Analysis Approach for Some Deterministic Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Methods | journal = Decision Sciences | year=1997 | first = E. | last = Triantaphyllou | authorlink = |author2=A.

This, in turn, may dramatically improve the effectiveness of the initial study and assist in the successful implementation of the final solution.\n\n===Time-critical decision making===\n{{see also|Window of opportunity}}\nProducing time-critical accurate knowledge about the state of a system (effect) under computational and data acquisition (cause) constraints is a major challenge, especially if the knowledge required is critical to the system operation where the safety of operators or integrity of costly equipment is at stake, e.g., during manufacturing or during environment substrate drilling.\nUnderstanding and interpreting, a chain of interrelated events, predicted or unpredicted, that may or may not result in a specific state of the system, is the core challenge of this research. Sensitivity analysis may be used to identify which set of input data signals has a significant impact on the set of system state information (i.e. output). Through a cause-effect analysis technique, sensitivity can be used to support the filtering of unsolicited data to reduce the communication and computational capabilities of a standard supervisory control and data acquisition system.<ref name=\"tavakoli2\"/>\n\n===Model calibration and improvement===\nOne application of sensitivity analysis addresses the question of \"What's important to model or system development?\" One can seek to identify important connections between observations, model inputs, and predictions or forecasts. That is, one can seek to understand what observations (measurements of dependent variables) are most and least important to model inputs (parameters representing system characteristics or excitation), what model inputs are most and least important to predictions or forecasts, and what observations are most and least important to the predictions and forecasts. Often the results are surprising, lead to finding problems in the data or model development, and fixing the problems. This leads to better models.<ref name=\"Model Analysis\"/><ref name=\"Methods and Guidelines\"/> In biomedical engineering, sensitivity analysis can be used to determine system dynamics in ODE-based kinetic models. Parameters corresponding to stages of differentiation can be varied to determine which parameter is most influential on cell fate. Therefore, the most limiting step can be identified and the cell state for most advantageous scale-up and expansion can be determined.<ref> Selekman JA, Das A, Grundl NJ, Palecek SP. Improving efficiency of human pluripotent stem cell differentiation platforms using an integrated experimental and computational approach. Biotechnol Bioeng. 2013;110(11):3024-37.</ref> Additionally, complex networks in systems biology can be better understood through fitting mass-action kinetic models. Sensitivity analysis on rate coefficients can then be conducted to determine optimal therapeutic targets within the system of interest.<ref> Tian D, Solodin NM, Rajbhandari P, Bjorklund K, Alarid ET, Kreeger PK.

In these cases the framing of the analysis itself, its institutional context, and the motivations of its author may become a matter of great importance, and a pure sensitivity analysis \u2013 with its emphasis on parametric uncertainty \u2013 may be seen as insufficient. The emphasis on the framing may derive inter-alia from the relevance of the policy study to different constituencies that are characterized by different norms and values, and hence by a different story about 'what the problem is' and foremost about 'who is telling the story'. Most often the framing includes more or less implicit assumptions, which could be political (e.g. which group needs to be protected) all the way to technical (e.g. which variable can be treated as a constant).\n\nIn order to take these concerns into due consideration the instruments of SA have been extended to provide an assessment of the entire knowledge and model generating process. This approach has been called 'sensitivity auditing'. It takes inspiration from NUSAP,<ref name=\"NUSAP\">{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Sluijs | first1 = JP | last2 = Craye | first2 = M | last3 = Funtowicz | first3 = S | last4 = Kloprogge | first4 = P | last5 = Ravetz | first5 = J | last6 = Risbey | first6 = J | year = 2005 | title = Combining quantitative and qualitative measures of uncertainty in model based environmental assessment: the NUSAP system | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 481\u2013492 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2005.00604.x| pmid = 15876219 }}</ref> a method used to qualify the worth of quantitative information with the generation of `Pedigrees' of numbers. Likewise, sensitivity auditing has been developed to provide pedigrees of models and model-based inferences.<ref name=\"Latinorum\">Saltelli, A., van der Sluijs, J., Guimar\u00e3es Pereira, \u00c2., 2013, Funtowiz, S.O., What do I make of your Latinorum?

Sensitivity auditing is recommended in the European Commission guidelines for impact assessment <ref name=\"EC_GUIDE\"/>, as well as in the report Science Advice for Policy by European Academies <ref>Science Advice for Policy by European Academies, Making sense of science for policy under conditions of complexity and uncertainty, Berlin, 2019.</ref>.\n\n==Related concepts==\n{{unsourced|section|date=February 2020}}\nSensitivity analysis is closely related with uncertainty analysis; while the latter studies the overall [[uncertainty]] in the conclusions of the study, sensitivity analysis tries to identify what source of uncertainty weighs more on the study's conclusions.\n\nThe problem setting in sensitivity analysis also has strong similarities with the field of [[design of experiments]]. In a design of experiments, one studies the effect of some process or intervention (the 'treatment') on some objects (the 'experimental units'). In sensitivity analysis one looks at the effect of varying the inputs of a mathematical model on the output of the model itself. In both disciplines one strives to obtain information from the system with a minimum of physical or numerical experiments.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Causality]]\n* [[Elementary effects method]]\n* [[Experimental uncertainty analysis]]\n* [[Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing]]\n* [[Info-gap decision theory]]\n* [[Interval FEM]]\n* [[Perturbation analysis]]\n* [[Probabilistic design]]\n* [[Probability bounds analysis]]\n* [[Robustification]]\n* [[ROC curve]]\n* [[Uncertainty quantification]]\n* [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Cannav\u00f3 | first1 = F. | year = 2012 | title = Sensitivity analysis for volcanic source modeling quality assessment and model selection | url = | journal = Computers & Geosciences | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 52\u201359 | doi = 10.1016/j.cageo.2012.03.008 | bibcode = 2012CG.....44...52C }}\n*Fass\u00f2 A.

{"title_page": "Breast cancer classification", "text_new": "'''Breast cancer classification''' divides [[breast cancer]] into categories according to different schemes criteria and serving a different purpose. The major categories are the [[histopathology|histopathological]] type, the [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|grade]] of the tumor, the [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|stage]] of the tumor, and the expression of [[protein]]s and [[gene]]s. As knowledge of cancer cell biology develops these classifications are updated.\n\nThe purpose of classification is to select the best treatment. The effectiveness of a specific treatment is demonstrated for a specific breast cancer (usually by randomized, controlled trials). That treatment may not be effective in a different breast cancer. Some breast cancers are aggressive and life-threatening, and must be treated with aggressive treatments that have major adverse effects. Other breast cancers are less aggressive and can be treated with less aggressive treatments, such as lumpectomy.\n\nTreatment [[algorithm]]s rely on breast cancer classification to define specific subgroups that are each treated according to [[Evidence-based medicine|the best evidence available]].  Classification aspects must be carefully tested and validated, such that [[confounding|confounding effects]] are minimized, making them either true '''''[[prognosis|prognostic]] factors''''', which estimate disease outcomes such as disease-free or overall survival '''''in the absence of therapy''''', or true '''''predictive factors''''', which estimate the likelihood of response or lack of response '''''to a specific treatment'''''.<ref name=\"pmid17993229\">{{cite book |vauthors=Gonzalez-Angulo AM, Morales-Vasquez F, Hortobagyi GN |title=Overview of resistance to systemic therapy in patients with breast cancer |journal=Adv.

A variant from this approach, defined on the basis of [[physical exam]] findings, is that [[inflammatory breast cancer]] (IBC), a form of ductal carcinoma or malignant cancer in the ducts, is distinguished from other [[carcinoma]]s by the [[inflammation|inflamed]] appearance of the affected breast, which correlates with increased cancer aggressivity.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Giordano SH, Hortobagyi GN |title=Inflammatory breast cancer: Clinical progress and the main problems that must be addressed |journal=Breast Cancer Res. |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=284\u20138 |year=2003 |pmid=14580242 |pmc=314400  |doi=10.1186/bcr608}}</ref>\n\n== Schemes or aspects ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nBreast cancers can be classified by different schemata. Each of these aspects influences treatment response and prognosis. Description of a breast cancer would optimally include all of these classification aspects, as well as other findings, such as signs found on [[physical exam]]. A full classification includes [[Breast cancer classification#Histopathology|histopathological type]], [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|grade]], [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|stage]] [[Breast cancer classification#TNM system|(TNM)]], [[Breast cancer classification#Receptor status|receptor status]], and the presence or absence of genes as determined by [[Breast cancer classification#DNA classification|DNA testing]]:\n*  '''Histopathology'''. Although breast cancer has many different [[Histopathology|histologies]], the considerable majority of breast cancers are derived from the epithelium lining the ducts or lobules, and are classified as [[mammary ductal carcinoma]]. ''[[Carcinoma in situ]]'' is proliferation of cancer cells within the epithelial tissue without invasion of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, ''invasive carcinoma'' invades the surrounding tissue.<ref>[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec18/ch253/ch253e.html Merck Manual, Professional Edition], Ch. 253, Breast Cancer.</ref> Perineural and/or [[lymphovascular space invasion]] is usually considered as part of the histological description of a breast cancer, and when present may be associated with more aggressive disease.\n* '''Grade'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|Grading]] focuses on the appearance of the breast cancer cells compared to the appearance of normal breast tissue.  Normal cells in an organ like the breast become differentiated, meaning that they take on specific shapes and forms that reflect their function as part of that organ. Cancerous cells lose that differentiation. In cancer, the cells that would normally line up in an orderly way to make up the milk ducts become disorganized. Cell division becomes uncontrolled. Cell nuclei become less uniform. Pathologists describe cells as well differentiated (low-grade), moderately differentiated (intermediate-grade), and poorly differentiated (high-grade) as the cells progressively lose the features seen in normal breast cells. Poorly differentiated cancers have a worse prognosis.\n*  '''Stage'''. The [[TNM classification]] for [[Cancer staging|staging]] [[Breast cancer classification#Staging|breast cancer]] is based on the size of the cancer where it originally started in the body and the locations to which it has travelled. These cancer characteristics are described as the size of the tumor (T), whether or not the tumor has spread to the [[lymph nodes]] (N) in the armpits, neck, and inside the chest, and whether the tumor has metastasized (M) (i.e. spread to a more distant part of the body). Larger size, nodal spread, and metastasis have a larger stage number and a worse prognosis. The main stages are:\n** Stage 0 which is in situ disease or [[Paget's disease of the nipple]]. Stage 0 is a pre-cancerous or marker condition, either [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).\n** Stages 1\u20133 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.\n** Stage 4 is a [[metastasis|metastatic cancer]]. [[Metastatic breast cancer]] has a less favorable prognosis.\n* '''Receptor status'''. Cells have [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on their surface and in their [[cytoplasm]] and [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Chemical messengers such as [[hormone]]s bind to receptors, and this causes changes in the cell. Breast cancer cells may or may not have many different types of receptors, the three most important in the present classification being: [[estrogen receptor]] (ER), [[progesterone receptor]] (PR), and [[HER2/neu]]. Cells with or without these receptors are called ER positive (ER+), ER negative (ER-), PR positive (PR+), PR negative (PR-), HER2 positive (HER2+), and HER2 negative (HER2-). Cells with none of these receptors are called basal-like or [[triple negative breast cancer|triple negative]].\n* '''DNA-based classification'''. Understanding the specific details of a particular breast cancer may include looking at the cancer cell [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] by several different laboratory approaches.

classifies the cancer as well differentiated (low-grade), moderately differentiated (intermediate-grade), and poorly differentiated (high-grade), reflecting progressively less normal appearing cells that have a worsening prognosis. Although grading is fundamentally based on how biopsied, cultured cells behave, in practice the grading of a given cancer is derived by assessing the cellular appearance of the tumor. The closer the appearance of the cancer cells to normal cells, the slower their growth and the better the prognosis. If cells are not well differentiated, they will appear immature, will divide more rapidly, and will tend to spread. Well differentiated is given a grade of 1, moderate is grade 2, while poor or undifferentiated is given a higher grade of 3 or 4 (depending upon the scale used).\n\nThe '''Nottingham system'''<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Elston |first1= CW |last2= Ellis |first2= IO |title= Pathologic prognostic factors in breast cancer.

American Joint Committee on Cancer 2010 May 5.http://www.cancerstaging.org/mission/whatis.html</ref> is the process of determining how much cancer there is in the body and where it is located.  The underlying purpose of staging is to describe the extent or severity of an individual's cancer, and to bring together cancers that have similar [[prognosis]] and treatment.<ref name=\"whatis20100505\" /> Staging of breast cancer is one aspect of breast cancer classification that assists in making appropriate treatment choices, when considered along with other classification aspects such as [[estrogen receptor]] and [[progesterone receptor]] levels in the cancer tissue, the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ([[HER2/neu]]) status, menopausal status, and the person's general health.<ref name=\"NCI-stage\">National Cancer Institute. Stage Information for Breast Cancer.http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/breast/healthprofessional/page3</ref>\n\nStaging information that is obtained prior to surgery, for example by mammography, x-rays and CT scans, is called clinical staging and staging by surgery is known as pathological staging.\n\nPathologic staging is more accurate than clinical staging, but clinical staging is the first and sometimes the only staging type. For example, if clinical staging reveals stage IV disease, extensive surgery may not be helpful, and (appropriately) incomplete pathological staging information will be obtained.\n\nThe [[American Joint Committee on Cancer]] (AJCC) and the [[International Union Against Cancer]] (UICC) recommend [[TNM staging system|TNM staging]], which is a two step procedure.

However, it is worth checking whether the author updated the staging system during the study, or modified the usual classification rules for specific use in the investigation.\n\nA different effect on staging arises from evolving technologies that are used to assign patients to particular categories, such that increasingly sensitive methods tend to cause individual cancers to be reassigned to higher stages, making it improper to compare that cancer's prognosis to the historical expectations for that stage.\n\nFinally, of course, a further important consideration is the effect of improving treatments over time as well.\n\nPrevious editions featured three [[metastatic]] values (MX, M0 and M1) which referred respectively to absence of adequate information, the confirmed absence, or the presence of breast cancer cells in locations other than the breast and regional lymph nodes, such as to bone, brain, lung.\n\nAJCC has provided web accessible poster versions of the current versions of these copyrighted TNM descriptors and groups,<ref name=\"AJCC7-BR\">AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition, updated Cancer Staging Posters.http://www.cancerstaging.org/staging/posters/breast8.5x11.pdf</ref> and readers should refer to that up to date, accurate information<ref name=\"AJCC7-BR\" /> or to the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI)<ref name=\"NCI-stage\" /> or [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]]<ref name=\"NCCN-Breast2011-2\" />  sites which reprints these with AJCC permission.\n\nFor accurate, complete, current details refer to the accessible copyrighted documentation from AJCC,<ref name=\"AJCC7-BR\" /> or to the authorized documentation from NCI<ref name=\"NCI-stage\" /> or [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network|NCCN]];<ref name=\"NCCN-Breast2011-2\" /> for past editions refer to AJCC.<ref name=\"pastEd\" />\n\n== Receptor status ==\nThe [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] status of [[breast cancer]]s has traditionally been identified by [[immunohistochemistry]] (IHC), which stains the cells based on the presence of [[estrogen]] [[estrogen receptor|receptors]] (ER), [[progesterone receptor]]s (PR) and [[HER2]]. This remains the most common method of testing for receptor status, but DNA [[DNA microarray|multi-gene expression profiles]] can categorize breast cancers into molecular subtypes that generally correspond to IHC receptor status; one commercial source is the BluePrint test, as discussed in the [[Breast cancer classification#MammaPrint and BluePrint|following section]].\n\nReceptor status is a critical assessment for all breast cancers as it determines the suitability of using [[Targeted therapy|targeted treatments]] such as [[tamoxifen]] and or [[trastuzumab]]. These treatments are now some of the most effective [[adjuvant]] treatments of breast cancer. Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cancer cells depend on estrogen for their growth, so they can be treated with drugs to reduce either the effect of estrogen (e.g. [[tamoxifen]]) or the actual level of estrogen (e.g. [[aromatase inhibitors]]), and generally have a better [[prognosis]].

Although the significance of many of those genetic differences is unknown, independent analyses by different research groups has found that certain groups of genes have a tendency to co-express.  These co-expressing [[Genetic cluster|clusters]] have included [[hormone]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor-related]] genes, [[HER2]]-related genes, a group of basal-like genes, and [[Cell proliferation|proliferation]] genes. As might therefore be anticipated, there is considerable similarity between the receptor and microarray classifications, but assignment of individual tumors is by no means identical. By way of illustration, some analyses have suggested that approximately 75% of receptor classified [[triple-negative breast cancer]]s (TNBC) basal-like [[tumor]]s have the expected DNA expression profile, and a similar 75% of tumors with a typical basal-like DNA expression profile are receptor TNBC as well. To say this in a different way to emphasize things, this means that 25% of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) basal-like tumors as defined by one or other classification are excluded from the alternative classification's results. Which classification scheme (receptor [[immunohistochemistry|IHC]] or [[DNA microarrays|DNA expression profile]]) more reliably assorts particular cancers to effective therapies is under investigation.\n\nSeveral commercially marketed [[DNA microarray]] tests analyze [[Genetic cluster|clusters]] of [[gene]]s and may help decide which possible treatment is most effective for a particular [[cancer]].<ref name=\"pmid20065178\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sparano JA, Solin LJ |title=Defining the clinical utility of gene expression assays in breast cancer: the intersection of science and art in clinical decision making |journal=J.

It was designed for use in [[estrogen]] [[estrogen receptor|receptor]] (ER) positive [[tumor]]s.  The test is run on [[formalin]] fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Oncotype results are reported as a Recurrence Score (RS), where a higher RS is associated with a worse [[prognosis]], referring to the likelihood of recurrence without treatment. In addition to that [[prognostic]] role, a higher RS is also associated with a higher probability of response to [[chemotherapy]], which is termed a positive [[predictive]] factor.\n\nA summary of [[clinical trial]]s using Oncotype is included in the [[Oncotype DX|Oncotype DX main article]]. These results suggest that not only does Oncotype stratify estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer into different [[prognostic]] groups, but also suggest that cancers that have a particularly favorable Oncotype DX microarray result tend to derive minimal benefit from [[adjuvant]] [[chemotherapy]] and so it may be appropriate to choose to avoid side effects from that additional treatment. As an additional example, a [[neoadjuvant]] clinical treatment program that included initial chemotherapy followed by surgery and subsequent additional chemotherapy, [[radiotherapy]], and [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]] found a strong correlation of the Oncotype [[Cancer#Classification|classification]] with the likelihood of a [[Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors|complete response]] (CR) to the presurgical chemotherapy.<ref name=\"pmid16145055\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gianni L, Zambetti M, Clark K |title=Gene expression profiles in paraffin-embedded core biopsy tissue predict response to chemotherapy in women with locally advanced breast cancer |journal=J.

The major categories are the [[histopathology|histopathological]] type, the [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|grade]] of the tumor, the [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|stage]] of the tumor, and the expression of [[protein]]s and [[gene]]s. As knowledge of cancer cell biology develops these classifications are updated.\n\nThe purpose of classification is to select the best treatment. The effectiveness of a specific treatment is demonstrated for a specific breast cancer (usually by randomized, controlled trials). That treatment may not be effective in a different breast cancer. Some breast cancers are aggressive and life-threatening, and must be treated with aggressive treatments that have major adverse effects. Other breast cancers are less aggressive and can be treated with less aggressive treatments, such as lumpectomy.\n\nTreatment [[algorithm]]s rely on breast cancer classification to define specific subgroups that are each treated according to [[Evidence-based medicine|the best evidence available]].  Classification aspects must be carefully tested and validated, such that [[confounding|confounding effects]] are minimized, making them either true '''''[[prognosis|prognostic]] factors''''', which estimate disease outcomes such as disease-free or overall survival '''''in the absence of therapy''''', or true '''''predictive factors''''', which estimate the likelihood of response or lack of response '''''to a specific treatment'''''.<ref name=\"pmid17993229\">{{cite book |vauthors=Gonzalez-Angulo AM, Morales-Vasquez F, Hortobagyi GN |title=Overview of resistance to systemic therapy in patients with breast cancer |journal=Adv.

A variant from this approach, defined on the basis of [[physical exam]] findings, is that [[inflammatory breast cancer]] (IBC), a form of ductal carcinoma or malignant cancer in the ducts, is distinguished from other [[carcinoma]]s by the [[inflammation|inflamed]] appearance of the affected breast, which correlates with increased cancer aggressivity.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Giordano SH, Hortobagyi GN |title=Inflammatory breast cancer: Clinical progress and the main problems that must be addressed |journal=Breast Cancer Res. |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=284\u20138 |year=2003 |pmid=14580242 |pmc=314400  |doi=10.1186/bcr608}}</ref>\n\n== Schemes or aspects ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nBreast cancers can be classified by different schemata. Each of these aspects influences treatment response and prognosis. Description of a breast cancer would optimally include all of these classification aspects, as well as other findings, such as signs found on [[physical exam]]. A full classification includes [[Breast cancer classification#Histopathology|histopathological type]], [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|grade]], [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|stage]] [[Breast cancer classification#TNM system|(TNM)]], [[Breast cancer classification#Receptor status|receptor status]], and the presence or absence of genes as determined by [[Breast cancer classification#DNA classification|DNA testing]]:\n*  '''Histopathology'''. Although breast cancer has many different [[Histopathology|histologies]], the considerable majority of breast cancers are derived from the epithelium lining the ducts or lobules, and are classified as [[mammary ductal carcinoma]]. ''[[Carcinoma in situ]]'' is proliferation of cancer cells within the epithelial tissue without invasion of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, ''invasive carcinoma'' invades the surrounding tissue.<ref>[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec18/ch253/ch253e.html Merck Manual, Professional Edition], Ch. 253, Breast Cancer.</ref> Perineural and/or [[lymphovascular space invasion]] is usually considered as part of the histological description of a breast cancer, and when present may be associated with more aggressive disease.\n* '''Grade'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|Grading]] focuses on the appearance of the breast cancer cells compared to the appearance of normal breast tissue.  Normal cells in an organ like the breast become differentiated, meaning that they take on specific shapes and forms that reflect their function as part of that organ. Cancerous cells lose that differentiation. In cancer, the cells that would normally line up in an orderly way to make up the milk ducts become disorganized. Cell division becomes uncontrolled. Cell nuclei become less uniform. Pathologists describe cells as well differentiated (low-grade), moderately differentiated (intermediate-grade), and poorly differentiated (high-grade) as the cells progressively lose the features seen in normal breast cells. Poorly differentiated cancers have a worse prognosis.\n*  '''Stage'''. The [[TNM classification]] for [[Cancer staging|staging]] [[Breast cancer classification#Staging|breast cancer]] is based on the size of the cancer where it originally started in the body and the locations to which it has travelled. These cancer characteristics are described as the size of the tumor (T), whether or not the tumor has spread to the [[lymph nodes]] (N) in the armpits, neck, and inside the chest, and whether the tumor has metastasized (M) (i.e. spread to a more distant part of the body). Larger size, nodal spread, and metastasis have a larger stage number and a worse prognosis. The main stages are:\n** Stage 0 which is in situ disease or [[Paget's disease of the nipple]]. Stage 0 is a pre-cancerous or marker condition, either [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).\n** Stages 1\u20133 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.\n** Stage 4 is a [[metastasis|metastatic cancer]]. [[Metastatic breast cancer]] has a less favorable prognosis.\n* '''Receptor status'''. Cells have [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on their surface and in their [[cytoplasm]] and [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Chemical messengers such as [[hormone]]s bind to receptors, and this causes changes in the cell. Breast cancer cells may or may not have many different types of receptors, the three most important in the present classification being: [[estrogen receptor]] (ER), [[progesterone receptor]] (PR), and [[HER2/neu]]. Cells with or without these receptors are called ER positive (ER+), ER negative (ER-), PR positive (PR+), PR negative (PR-), HER2 positive (HER2+), and HER2 negative (HER2-). Cells with none of these receptors are called basal-like or [[triple negative breast cancer|triple negative]].\n* '''DNA-based classification'''. Understanding the specific details of a particular breast cancer may include looking at the cancer cell [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] by several different laboratory approaches. When specific DNA mutations or gene expression profiles are identified in the cancer cells this may guide the selection of treatments, either by targeting these changes, or by predicting from these alterations which non-targeted therapies are most effective.\n* '''Other classification approaches'''.\n** Computer models such as Adjuvant! can combine the various classification aspects according to validated [[algorithm]]s and present visually appealing graphics that assist in treatment decisions.\n** The USC/Van Nuys prognostic index (VNPI) classifies [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS) into dissimilar risk categories that may be treated accordingly.\n** The choice of which treatment to receive can be substantially influenced by [[comorbidity]] assessments.\n** Familial breast cancers may potentially undergo dissimilar treatment (such as [[mastectomy]]).\n\n== Histopathology ==\n[[File:Pie chart of incidence and prognosis of histopathologic breast cancer types.png|thumb|310px|Histopathologic types of breast cancer, with relative incidences and prognoses.<ref name=IncidenceMalignancy>References for pie chart is located at [[Commons:File:Pie_chart_of_incidence_and_prognosis_of_histopathologic_breast_cancer_types.png#References|Image description page in commons]]</ref>]]\nHistopathologic classification is based upon characteristics seen upon [[Optical microscope|light microscopy]] of biopsy specimens.

classifies the cancer as well differentiated (low-grade), moderately differentiated (intermediate-grade), and poorly differentiated (high-grade), reflecting progressively less normal appearing cells that have a worsening prognosis. Although grading is fundamentally based on how biopsied, cultured cells behave, in practice the grading of a given cancer is derived by assessing the cellular appearance of the tumor. The closer the appearance of the cancer cells to normal cells, the slower their growth and the better the prognosis. If cells are not well differentiated, they will appear immature, will divide more rapidly, and will tend to spread.

American Joint Committee on Cancer 2010 May 5.http://www.cancerstaging.org/mission/whatis.html</ref> is the process of determining how much cancer there is in the body and where it is located.  The underlying purpose of staging is to describe the extent or severity of an individual's cancer, and to bring together cancers that have similar [[prognosis]] and treatment.<ref name=\"whatis20100505\" /> Staging of breast cancer is one aspect of breast cancer classification that assists in making appropriate treatment choices, when considered along with other classification aspects such as [[estrogen receptor]] and [[progesterone receptor]] levels in the cancer tissue, the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ([[HER2/neu]]) status, menopausal status, and the person's general health.<ref name=\"NCI-stage\">National Cancer Institute. Stage Information for Breast Cancer.http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/breast/healthprofessional/page3</ref>\n\nStaging information that is obtained prior to surgery, for example by mammography, x-rays and CT scans, is called clinical staging and staging by surgery is known as pathological staging.\n\nPathologic staging is more accurate than clinical staging, but clinical staging is the first and sometimes the only staging type. For example, if clinical staging reveals stage IV disease, extensive surgery may not be helpful, and (appropriately) incomplete pathological staging information will be obtained.\n\nThe [[American Joint Committee on Cancer]] (AJCC) and the [[International Union Against Cancer]] (UICC) recommend [[TNM staging system|TNM staging]], which is a two step procedure. Their TNM system, which they now develop jointly, first classifies cancer by several factors, '''T''' for '''t'''umor, '''N''' for '''n'''odes, '''M''' for '''m'''etastasis, and then groups these TNM factors into overall stages.\n\n===Primary Tumor (T)===\n'''T'''umor&nbsp;\u2013 The [[tumor]] values (TX, T0, Tis, T1, T2, T3 or T4) depend on the cancer at the primary site of origin in the breast, as follows:<ref name=Alkabban2019>Originally copied from {{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482286/|title=Cancer, Breast|author=Fadi M.

However, it is worth checking whether the author updated the staging system during the study, or modified the usual classification rules for specific use in the investigation.\n\nA different effect on staging arises from evolving technologies that are used to assign patients to particular categories, such that increasingly sensitive methods tend to cause individual cancers to be reassigned to higher stages, making it improper to compare that cancer's prognosis to the historical expectations for that stage.\n\nFinally, of course, a further important consideration is the effect of improving treatments over time as well.\n\nPrevious editions featured three [[metastatic]] values (MX, M0 and M1) which referred respectively to absence of adequate information, the confirmed absence, or the presence of breast cancer cells in locations other than the breast and regional lymph nodes, such as to bone, brain, lung.\n\nAJCC has provided web accessible poster versions of the current versions of these copyrighted TNM descriptors and groups,<ref name=\"AJCC7-BR\">AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition, updated Cancer Staging Posters.http://www.cancerstaging.org/staging/posters/breast8.5x11.pdf</ref> and readers should refer to that up to date, accurate information<ref name=\"AJCC7-BR\" /> or to the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI)<ref name=\"NCI-stage\" /> or [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]]<ref name=\"NCCN-Breast2011-2\" />  sites which reprints these with AJCC permission.\n\nFor accurate, complete, current details refer to the accessible copyrighted documentation from AJCC,<ref name=\"AJCC7-BR\" /> or to the authorized documentation from NCI<ref name=\"NCI-stage\" /> or [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network|NCCN]];<ref name=\"NCCN-Breast2011-2\" /> for past editions refer to AJCC.<ref name=\"pastEd\" />\n\n== Receptor status ==\nThe [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] status of [[breast cancer]]s has traditionally been identified by [[immunohistochemistry]] (IHC), which stains the cells based on the presence of [[estrogen]] [[estrogen receptor|receptors]] (ER), [[progesterone receptor]]s (PR) and [[HER2]]. This remains the most common method of testing for receptor status, but DNA [[DNA microarray|multi-gene expression profiles]] can categorize breast cancers into molecular subtypes that generally correspond to IHC receptor status; one commercial source is the BluePrint test, as discussed in the [[Breast cancer classification#MammaPrint and BluePrint|following section]].\n\nReceptor status is a critical assessment for all breast cancers as it determines the suitability of using [[Targeted therapy|targeted treatments]] such as [[tamoxifen]] and or [[trastuzumab]]. These treatments are now some of the most effective [[adjuvant]] treatments of breast cancer. Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cancer cells depend on estrogen for their growth, so they can be treated with drugs to reduce either the effect of estrogen (e.g. [[tamoxifen]]) or the actual level of estrogen (e.g. [[aromatase inhibitors]]), and generally have a better [[prognosis]].

Although the significance of many of those genetic differences is unknown, independent analyses by different research groups has found that certain groups of genes have a tendency to co-express.  These co-expressing [[Genetic cluster|clusters]] have included [[hormone]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor-related]] genes, [[HER2]]-related genes, a group of basal-like genes, and [[Cell proliferation|proliferation]] genes. As might therefore be anticipated, there is considerable similarity between the receptor and microarray classifications, but assignment of individual tumors is by no means identical. By way of illustration, some analyses have suggested that approximately 75% of receptor classified [[triple-negative breast cancer]]s (TNBC) basal-like [[tumor]]s have the expected DNA expression profile, and a similar 75% of tumors with a typical basal-like DNA expression profile are receptor TNBC as well. To say this in a different way to emphasize things, this means that 25% of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) basal-like tumors as defined by one or other classification are excluded from the alternative classification's results. Which classification scheme (receptor [[immunohistochemistry|IHC]] or [[DNA microarrays|DNA expression profile]]) more reliably assorts particular cancers to effective therapies is under investigation.\n\nSeveral commercially marketed [[DNA microarray]] tests analyze [[Genetic cluster|clusters]] of [[gene]]s and may help decide which possible treatment is most effective for a particular [[cancer]].<ref name=\"pmid20065178\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sparano JA, Solin LJ |title=Defining the clinical utility of gene expression assays in breast cancer: the intersection of science and art in clinical decision making |journal=J.

It was designed for use in [[estrogen]] [[estrogen receptor|receptor]] (ER) positive [[tumor]]s.  The test is run on [[formalin]] fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Oncotype results are reported as a Recurrence Score (RS), where a higher RS is associated with a worse [[prognosis]], referring to the likelihood of recurrence without treatment. In addition to that [[prognostic]] role, a higher RS is also associated with a higher probability of response to [[chemotherapy]], which is termed a positive [[predictive]] factor.\n\nA summary of [[clinical trial]]s using Oncotype is included in the [[Oncotype DX|Oncotype DX main article]]. These results suggest that not only does Oncotype stratify estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer into different [[prognostic]] groups, but also suggest that cancers that have a particularly favorable Oncotype DX microarray result tend to derive minimal benefit from [[adjuvant]] [[chemotherapy]] and so it may be appropriate to choose to avoid side effects from that additional treatment. As an additional example, a [[neoadjuvant]] clinical treatment program that included initial chemotherapy followed by surgery and subsequent additional chemotherapy, [[radiotherapy]], and [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]] found a strong correlation of the Oncotype [[Cancer#Classification|classification]] with the likelihood of a [[Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors|complete response]] (CR) to the presurgical chemotherapy.<ref name=\"pmid16145055\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gianni L, Zambetti M, Clark K |title=Gene expression profiles in paraffin-embedded core biopsy tissue predict response to chemotherapy in women with locally advanced breast cancer |journal=J.

Solarz]], Democrat of New York, and then-Senator [[Larry Pressler]], Republican of North Dakota.  These amendments required that all military and economic aid be cut off for any non-nuclear nations that illegally exported or attempted to export nuclear-related materials from the United States.  Such exports violated the United Nations [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT), but without those amendments, there were no penalties for violations.<ref name='Hersh93' />   \n\nBarlow's early work included an effort to sound the alarm about procurement activities in the US directed by [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], who had \u201cacquired\u201d nuclear blueprints from a Dutch employer in 1975 and used those to get a job as head of Pakistan's nuclear program.  The CIA had known about Khan's activities from the beginning.

After a few failed sting operations,<ref name='Hersh93' /> Barlow became convinced that the officials in the State Department were warning targets of sealed arrest warrants in FBI operations and illegally approving export licenses for restricted goods.<ref name=\"Ryland2007\"/><ref name='HT'>{{cite Q|Q88310866}}<!-- America fails the IQ test, Hindustan Times, 2008-01-17--></ref> Barlow and others in the working group stopped sharing their plans with the State Department.<ref name='Hersh93' />  \n\nIn July 1987, the FBI arrested Arshad Z. Pervez, a Pakistani-born Canadian, as he attempted to buy twenty-five tons of a specially strengthened steel, for which the primary use would be a uranium enrichment program, according to Barlow.  This arrest was highly publicized and attracted the attention of the [[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation|Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee]], chaired by Representative Solarz.  Retired Army Major General David W. Einsel, then working for the CIA, and Barlow were asked to testify before that committee in a classified briefing.  Einsel gave evasive answers when asked if Pakistan had attempted to purchase anything that would have been a violation of the Solarz amendment, either directly or via a third party in a different country.  Solarz then asked essentially the same question of Barlow, who replied that the CIA knew of \u201cscores\u201d of Pakistani attempts to violate American export law.<ref name='Hersh93' />  \n\nBarlow said that after that testimony, he was so harassed by Einsel and other senior CIA personnel that he resigned in 1988,<ref name='Hersh93' />  though not before receiving the CIA's Exceptional Accomplishment Award.<ref name='Leyton2007'/>  \n\nIn 1989 he was hired as a proliferation analyst for the Department of Defense.  He was in a chain of command below [[Stephen J. Hadley]], then [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Global Strategic Affairs]], who reported to the [[Under-Secretary of Defense for Policy]] when [[Dick Cheney]] was the [[Secretary of Defense]].<ref name=\"Ryland2007\"/>  \n\nDuring the debate over the sale of [[F-16]]s to Pakistan in 1989, the U.S. administration was constrained by the 1985 [[Pressler amendment]] of the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] which prohibited the sale of any [[mat\u00e9riel]] or armaments which might assist in the development or delivery of nuclear weapons. Barlow's analysis of Pakistan's nuclear program indicated that Pakistan possessed the capability to use the fighters to drop nuclear bombs, and the report which he submitted to Dick Cheney concluded that the F-16 sale indisputably violated the NPT and the Solarz and Pressler Ammendments. He drew on details available to the intelligence community about how Pakistan had used the F-16s it already possessed.<ref name='Leyton2007'/>\n\nHe then learned that Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur Hughes had given testimony before Congress that stated the exact opposite, including that using F-16s to deliver nuclear weapons \"far exceeded the state of art in Pakistan.\" Barlow knew this was not true.  He checked the files and found that his reports had been \u201cmysteriously substituted or altered\u201d<ref name='HT'/> and \"willfully falsified by officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense\",<ref name=\"Ryland2007\"/> including then-Undersecretary of Defense for Policy [[Paul Wolfowitz]] and then-Deputy Undersecretary of Defense [[Scooter Libby]].  Barlow then told his superiors that congress had been misled and urged that the record be corrected.  Within days, Barlow was fired.<ref name='Leyton2007'/> <ref name='Hersh93' /><ref name=\"Econ\">{{cite Q|Q88317062}}<!-- Pakistan's nuclear ambitions: The spider's stratagem, The Economist, January 3, 2008--></ref>\n\n==Events following dismissal==\n\nBarlow is ''not'' a whistleblower in the traditional sense.  He was persecuted for saying things in a classified briefing to a committee of the US Congress that his management did not want shared with Congress.  Later he was fired for asking his managers to correct the record when blatantly false statements had been made to Congress.  \n\nBarlow brought a legal action for wrongful dismissal that received considerable attention, including from the United States Congress.  In this he was defended by Paul Wolfowitz, who said \"there have been times on that issue when I specifically sensed that people thought we could somehow construct a policy on a house of cards that the Congress wouldn't know what the Pakistanis were doing\".  He concluded that the retaliation Barlow had faced was \"wrong\".  \n\nFollowing congressionally ordered investigations, the inspector general at the State Department concluded that Barlow had been fired as a reprisal.  However, the inspectors general at the CIA and the Defense Department stated that the Pentagon was within its rights to fire Barlow.  A final investigation by Congress' own [[Government Accountability Office]] was completed in 1997 and \"largely vindicated\" Barlow, who had his security clearance restored.<ref name='Leyton2007'/> During the investigation, the State department inspector-general, [[Sherman Funk]], described Barlow as \"one of the most brilliant analysts I've ever seen\".<ref name='Hersh93'/>  \n\nHis security clearances were restored, but he was unable to get rehired permanently by the government, presumably because of the cloud over his record.  He subsequently found occasional jobs as a contractor for federal agencies including the CIA, the State Department, the FBI and Sandia National Laboratories.<ref name='Leyton2007'/>  However, in 2013 he had been unemployed since his last job at Sandia had been eliminated in 2004, and he was living in a [[Recreational vehicle|motor home]].<ref name='Stein2013'>{{cite Q|Q63257553}}.<!-- Stein (2013) The Perils of Whistle-Blowing, Newsweek--></ref>  \n\nThe activities of the Defense Department officials, however, including Cheney, Libby, Wolfowitz and Hadley, were never investigated. Rep. [[Stephen Solarz]], a major player in counter-proliferation, told [[Seymour Hersh]] for the latter's famous expos\u00e9 of the Pakistani nuclear program that \"If what Barlow says is true, this would have been a major scandal of [[Iran-Contra]] proportions, and the officials involved would have had to resign.

Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons is one of the major foreign-policy issues of the nation\u2014not to mention the law of the land.\u201d<ref name='Hersh93'/>\n\nBarlow, however, was unable to find employment after his clearance was removed and marriage broke up. \"They viciously tried to destroy my life, personally and professionally\" he is quoted as saying. \"Not just my career, but they went after my marriage, my livelihood, and smeared my name in truly extraordinary ways that no one had ever seen before or since\u2014at least not until the [[Valerie Plame affair|Wilsons were victims of the same people]] years later.\" According to Barlow the allegations included the \"fabrication\" that he \"was an 'intended' Congressional spy\", that he was an alcoholic, had not paid his taxes, and was an adulterer. \"Then they accused me of being psychotic and used that to invade my marital privacy, including that of my now ex-wife who also worked at the CIA, and sought to destroy my marriage as punishment.\"<ref name=\"Ryland2007\"/>\n\nAlthough he was found to have breached no national security regulations and was vindicated, Barlow did not receive his government pension and has had trouble finding employment.

Solarz]], Democrat of New York, and then-Senator [[Larry Pressler]], Republican of North Dakota.  These amendments required that all military and economic aid be cut off for any non-nuclear nations that illegally exported or attempted to export nuclear-related materials from the United States.  Such exports violated the United Nations [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT), but without those amendments, there were no penalties for violations.<ref name='Hersh93' />   \n\nBarlow's early work included an effort to sound the alarm about procurement activities in the US directed by [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], who had \u201cacquired\u201d nuclear blueprints from a Dutch employer in 1975 and used those to get a job as head of Pakistan's nuclear program.  The CIA had known about Khan's activities from the beginning.  Barlow reportedly discovered that Pakistan's nuclear program depended upon clandestine and illegal procurement activity within the US.<ref name='Ryland2007'>{{cite Q|Q88309584}}<!--They sold out the world for an F-16 sale--></ref>\n\nIn mid-1986 Barlow became the CIA's delegate to the Nuclear Export Violations Working Group (N.E.V.W.G.), a newly formed top-secret panel that brought together the policy, law-enforcement, and intelligence communities in an effort to stop illegal American exports to non-nuclear nations. After a few failed sting operations,<ref name='Hersh93' /> Barlow became convinced that the officials in the State Department were warning targets of sealed arrest warrants in FBI operations and illegally approving export licenses for restricted goods.<ref name=\"Ryland2007\"/><ref name='HT'>{{cite Q|Q88310866}}<!-- America fails the IQ test, Hindustan Times, 2008-01-17--></ref> Barlow and others in the working group stopped sharing their plans with the State Department.<ref name='Hersh93' />  \n\nIn July 1987, the FBI arrested Arshad Z. Pervez, a Pakistani-born Canadian, as he attempted to buy twenty-five tons of a specially strengthened steel, for which the primary use would be a uranium enrichment program, according to Barlow.  This arrest was highly publicized and attracted the attention of the [[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and Nonproliferation|Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee]], chaired by Representative Solarz.  Retired Army Major General David W. Einsel, then working for the CIA, and Barlow were asked to testify before that committee in a classified briefing.  Einsel gave evasive answers when asked if Pakistan had attempted to purchase anything that would have been a violation of the Solarz amendment, either directly or via a third party in a different country.  Solarz then asked essentially the same question of Barlow, who replied that the CIA knew of \u201cscores\u201d of Pakistani attempts to violate American export law.<ref name='Hersh93' />  \n\nBarlow said that after that testimony, he was so harassed by Einsel and other senior CIA personnel that he resigned in 1988,<ref name='Hersh93' />  though not before receiving the CIA's Exceptional Accomplishment Award.<ref name='Leyton2007'/>  \n\nIn 1989 he was hired as a proliferation analyst for the Department of Defense.  He was in a chain of command below [[Stephen J. Hadley]], then [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Global Strategic Affairs]], who reported to the [[Under-Secretary of Defense for Policy]] when [[Dick Cheney]] was the [[Secretary of Defense]].<ref name=\"Ryland2007\"/>  \n\nDuring the debate over the sale of [[F-16]]s to Pakistan in 1989, the U.S. administration was constrained by the 1985 [[Pressler amendment]] of the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] which prohibited the sale of any [[mat\u00e9riel]] or armaments which might assist in the development or delivery of nuclear weapons. Barlow's analysis of Pakistan's nuclear program indicated that Pakistan possessed the capability to use the fighters to drop nuclear bombs, and the report which he submitted to Dick Cheney concluded that the F-16 sale indisputably violated the NPT and the Solarz and Pressler Ammendments. He drew on details available to the intelligence community about how Pakistan had used the F-16s it already possessed.<ref name='Leyton2007'/>\n\nHe then learned that Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur Hughes had given testimony before Congress that stated the exact opposite, including that using F-16s to deliver nuclear weapons \"far exceeded the state of art in Pakistan.\" Barlow knew this was not true.  He checked the files and found that his reports had been \u201cmysteriously substituted or altered\u201d<ref name='HT'/> and \"willfully falsified by officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense\",<ref name=\"Ryland2007\"/> including then-Undersecretary of Defense for Policy [[Paul Wolfowitz]] and then-Deputy Undersecretary of Defense [[Scooter Libby]].  Barlow then told his superiors that congress had been misled and urged that the record be corrected.

He was persecuted for saying things in a classified briefing to a committee of the US Congress that his management did not want shared with Congress.  Later he was fired for asking his managers to correct the record when blatantly false statements had been made to Congress.  \n\nBarlow brought a legal action for wrongful dismissal that received considerable attention, including from the United States Congress.  In this he was defended by Paul Wolfowitz, who said \"there have been times on that issue when I specifically sensed that people thought we could somehow construct a policy on a house of cards that the Congress wouldn't know what the Pakistanis were doing\".  He concluded that the retaliation Barlow had faced was \"wrong\".  \n\nFollowing congressionally ordered investigations, the inspector general at the State Department concluded that Barlow had been fired as a reprisal.  However, the inspectors general at the CIA and the Defense Department stated that the Pentagon was within its rights to fire Barlow.  A final investigation by Congress' own [[Government Accountability Office]] was completed in 1997 and \"largely vindicated\" Barlow, who had his security clearance restored.<ref name='Leyton2007'/> During the investigation, the State department inspector-general, [[Sherman Funk]], described Barlow as \"one of the most brilliant analysts I've ever seen\".<ref name='Hersh93'/>  \n\nHis security clearances were restored, but he was unable to get rehired permanently by the government, presumably because of the cloud over his record.  He subsequently found occasional jobs as a contractor for federal agencies including the CIA, the State Department, the FBI and Sandia National Laboratories.<ref name='Leyton2007'/>  However, in 2013 he had been unemployed since his last job at Sandia had been eliminated in 2004, and he was living in a [[Recreational vehicle|motor home]].<ref name='Stein2013'>{{cite Q|Q63257553}}.<!-- Stein (2013) The Perils of Whistle-Blowing, Newsweek--></ref>  \n\nThe activities of the Defense Department officials, however, including Cheney, Libby, Wolfowitz and Hadley, were never investigated. Rep. [[Stephen Solarz]], a major player in counter-proliferation, told [[Seymour Hersh]] for the latter's famous expos\u00e9 of the Pakistani nuclear program that \"If what Barlow says is true, this would have been a major scandal of [[Iran-Contra]] proportions, and the officials involved would have had to resign.

Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons is one of the major foreign-policy issues of the nation\u2014not to mention the law of the land.\u201d<ref name='Hersh93'/>\n\nBarlow, however, was unable to find employment after his clearance was removed and marriage broke up. \"They viciously tried to destroy my life, personally and professionally\" he is quoted as saying. \"Not just my career, but they went after my marriage, my livelihood, and smeared my name in truly extraordinary ways that no one had ever seen before or since\u2014at least not until the [[Valerie Plame affair|Wilsons were victims of the same people]] years later.\" According to Barlow the allegations included the \"fabrication\" that he \"was an 'intended' Congressional spy\", that he was an alcoholic, had not paid his taxes, and was an adulterer. \"Then they accused me of being psychotic and used that to invade my marital privacy, including that of my now ex-wife who also worked at the CIA, and sought to destroy my marriage as punishment.\"<ref name=\"Ryland2007\"/>\n\nAlthough he was found to have breached no national security regulations and was vindicated, Barlow did not receive his government pension and has had trouble finding employment.

[[Sculpture]] is among the oldest of the arts. Even before painting cave walls, early humans fashioned shapes from stone. From these beginnings, artifacts have evolved to their current complexity.\n\n==Material origin and qualities==\n[[File:TheWestWindByGould.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Ridgeway Gould]], ''The West Wind.'' (frontal view) 1876]]\n{{Main|Marble}}\nMarble is a [[metamorphic rock]] derived from [[limestone]], composed mostly of [[calcite]] (a crystalline form of [[calcium carbonate]], CaCO<sub>3</sub>). The original source of the parent limestone is the seabed deposition of calcium carbonate in the form of microscopic animal skeletons or similar materials. Marble is formed when the limestone is transformed by heat and pressure after being overlain by other materials. The finest marbles for sculpture have no or few stains, though natural stains can be incorporated into the work itself.\n\n===Advantages===\nAmong the commonly available stones, only marble has a slight translucency i.e. [[subsurface scattering]] that is comparable to that of human [[skin]]. It is this translucency that gives a marble sculpture a visual depth beyond its surface and this evokes a certain realism when used for figurative works. Marble also has the advantage that, when first quarried, it is relatively soft and easy to work, refine, and polish.{{cn|date=January 2019}} As the finished marble ages, it becomes harder and more durable. Preference to the cheaper and less translucent [[limestone]] is based largely on the fineness of marble's grain, which enables the sculptor to render minute detail in a manner not always possible with limestone. In contrast to limestone, marble is also extremely weather-resistant. As a result, surface changes due to the immediate environment are not always visible to the naked eye. This feature can pose challenges when dating ancient works.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Margolis | first1 = Stanley V | year = 1989 | title = Authenticating Ancient Marble Sculpture | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 260 | issue = 6| pages = 104\u201311 }}</ref>\n\n===Disadvantages===\n[[File:TheWestWindByGouldSide.jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas Ridgeway Gould. ''The West Wind.'' (profile)  1876.]]\n\nMarble does not bear handling well as it will absorb skin oils when touched, which leads to yellow brownish staining. While more resistant than limestone it is subject to attack by weak acids, and so performs poorly in outdoor environments subject to [[acid rain]]. For severe environments, [[granite]] is a more lasting material but one which is far more difficult to work and much less suitable for refined works. Compared to metals such as [[bronze]], furthermore, marble is inflexible and vulnerable to fracturing. This drawback means that sculptors must incorporate specific supporting features into the sculpture to prevent collapse. In Thomas Ridgeway Gould's ''The West Wind,'' for example, he poised the figure's short and slender ankles delicately upon the balls of her small feet. This would not be possible without the deliberate decision by Gould to distribute almost all of the marble's weight to her massive, flowing skirt. Unlike bronze sculpture, this statue is not hollow; her drapery is one solid block of marble.<ref>For a description of the greater flexibility of bronze sculptures and the ease with which ''action'' and ''extension'' may be expressed through bronze, see [[bronze sculpture]]. Note especially the sculpture [[:Image:Jet\u00e9 - Statue by Enzo Plazzotta - Millbank - Westminster - London - 240404.jpg|''Jet\u00e9'']].</ref>\n\n[[File:DianaLouvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Diana of Versailles]] statue in the [[Louvre]]: note use of skirt, tree stump, and stag for support of the body and lower arm and the \"pinning\" of the upper arm to the arrows in the quiver, forming several closed loops that are thus stronger]]\n\n==Developing a sculpture==\n[[File:Jop.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.5|A pitching tool for carving stone]]\nSculptors usually begin by knocking off, or \"pitching,\" large portions of unwanted stone. A suitable tool for this task is a point [[chisel]], which is a long, hefty piece of steel with a point at one end and a broad striking surface at the other. A pitching tool may also be used at this early stage, which is a wedge-shaped chisel with a broad, flat edge. The pitching tool is useful for splitting the stone and removing large, unwanted chunks. \n\nThe sculptor may also use a [[mallet]], which is similar to a hammer with a broad, barrel-shaped head. When the mallet connects to the tool, energy is transferred through the tool, shattering the stone. Most sculptors work rhythmically, turning the tool with each blow so that the stone is removed quickly and evenly. This is the \"roughing out\" stage of the sculpting process. While a mallet provides the force needed to fracture the marble, it must be used accurately. The smallest miscalculation can ruin the intended sculpture and even injure the sculptor. \n\nSome artists prefer to carve directly onto the stone, without a model; the [[Renaissance]] artist [[Michelangelo]], for example, claimed that his job was to free the human form trapped inside the block. Other artists sculpt a preliminary model out of clay or wax and then translate its features to stone through the use of [[calipers]] or a [[pointing machine]]. \n\nOnce the general shape of the statue has been determined, the sculptor uses other tools to refine the figure. A toothed chisel or claw chisel has multiple gouging surfaces which create parallel lines in the stone. These tools are generally used to add texture to the figure. An artist might mark out specific lines by using calipers to measure an area of stone to be addressed and marking the removal area with pencil, charcoal or chalk. The stone carver generally uses a shallower stroke at this point in the process.\n\nEventually, the sculptor has changed the stone from a rough block into the general shape of the finished statue. Tools called [[rasp]]s and [[riffler]]s are then used to enhance the shape into its final form. A rasp is a flat, steel tool with a coarse surface. The sculptor uses broad, sweeping strokes to remove excess stone as small chips or dust. A riffler is a smaller variation of the rasp, which can be used to create details such as folds of clothing or locks of hair.\n\nPolishing is the last step of the carving process. Sculptors use a variety of fine, abrasive materials such as sandpaper or emery paper to highlight patterns in the stone and to accentuate its natural sheen.<ref>[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/sculpture/marble.htm Marble Sculpture (c.600 BCE - present)], Encyclopedia of Sculpture</ref> Some sculptors may also use [[tin oxide]] to achieve a high-lustre polish. Regardless of the method, however, a glossy marble sculpture will appear more translucent than one that has not been polished.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fleming|display-authors=etal|first1=Roland W. |title=Perceiving Translucent Materials |journal=Journal of Vision |date=2004 |volume=4 |issue=8 |page=133 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221283118_Perceiving_translucent_materials |accessdate=29 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Tools==\n{{external media | width = 150px | align = right | headerimage=[[File:Marble sculpture - Rodin.jpg|150px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWUuGDovHEI Carving Marble with Traditional Tools], (2:47), [[J.

This is used to strike the chisel.\n*Gli Scalpelli \u2013 The [[chisel]]s. These come in various types:\n**La Subbia \u2013 (the Point) a pointed chisel or punch\n**L'Unghietto \u2013 (Round or Rondel Chisel) Literally, \"little fingernail\"\n**La Gradina \u2013 (Toothed Chisel or Claw) a chisel with multiple teeth-\n**Lo Scalpello \u2013 a flat chisel\n*Lo Scapezzatore \u2013 (Pitcher or Pitching Tool) a hefty chisel with a broad blunt edge, for splitting.\n*Il Martello Pneumatico \u2013 [[Jackhammer|Pneumatic hammer]]\n*Il Flessibile \u2013 an angle grinder, fitted with an [[electrolysis]]-applied diamond studded blade\n*Hand Drill\nIn addition to those hand tools listed above, the marble sculptor uses a variety of hammers \u2013 both for the striking of edge tools (chisels and hand drills) and for striking the stone directly (Bocciarda a Martello in Italian, Boucharde in French, Bush Hammer in English).  Following the work of the hammer and chisel, the sculptor will sometimes refine the form further through the use of rasps, files and abrasive rubbing stones and/or sandpaper to smooth the surface contours of the form.\n\n==Tool technique==\n[[Image:Statue of winged Nike (Paris 2002).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Winged Victory of Samothrace]]'', [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] [[marble]] [[sculpture]] of the 3rd century BC]]\n\nHammer and point work is the technique used in working stone, in use at least since [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times, as it is described in the legend of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], and even earlier, the ancient Greek sculptors used it from c. 650 BC. It consists of holding the pointed chisel against the stone and swinging the hammer at it as hard as possible. When the hammer connects with the striking end of the chisel, its energy is transferred down the length and concentrates on a single point on the surface of the block, breaking the stone. This is continued in a line following the desired contour. It may sound simple but many months are required to attain competency. A good stone worker can maintain a rhythm of relatively longer blows (about one per second), swinging the hammer in a wider arc, lifting the chisel between blows to flick out any chips that remain in the way, and repositioning it for the next blow. This way, one can drive the point deeper into the stone and remove more material at a time. Some stoneworkers also spin the subbia in their fingers between hammer blows, thus applying with each blow a different part of the point to the stone. This helps prevent the point from breaking.\n\n[[Image:RecliningHermaphrodite.jpg|thumb|right|The 1st-century BC sculpture 'The Reclining Hermaphroditus', in the [[Museo Nazionale Romano]], Palazzo Massimo Alle Terme in Rome]]\n\n==A few well-known marble sculptures==\n* [[Parthenon Marbles]], in the [[Acropolis Museum]], [[Athens]]\n* [[Venus de Milo|Aphrodite of Milos]], (Venus de Milo) in the [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]\n* ''[[Michelangelo's David|David]]'' by [[Michelangelo]], in [[Florence]]\n* ''[[Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons]]'' by [[Agesander]], in the [[Vatican Museums]], [[Vatican City]]\n* ''[[Michelangelo's Moses|Moses]]'' by Michelangelo, in [[Rome]]\n* ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]'' by Michelangelo, in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]\n* ''[[Discobolus]]'' Lancellotti, the Lancellotti [[discus]] thrower in the [[Museo Nazionale Romano]], [[Rome]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of sculptors]]\n* [[Stone sculpture]]\n* [[Marble]]\n* [[Carrara marble]]\n* [[Sculpture]]\n* [[Topic outline of sculpture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlights_search_results.aspx?searchText=marble+sculpture Marble sculpture at the British Museum]\n*[http://www.vinodmurtimuseum.com/ Marble Sculpture from India] We Craft Sculptures on Marble\n*[http://artofmaking.ac.uk/ The Art of Making in Antiquity: Stoneworking in the Roman World] King's College, London\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marble Sculpture}}\n[[Category:Carving]]\n[[Category:Sculpture techniques]]\n[[Category:Marble sculptures| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Marble statue|the song by Gigolo Aunts|Everybody Happy}}\n[[File:La Table aux Amours (The Demidoff Table).JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[Lorenzo Bartolini]], (Italian, 1777\u20131850), ''La Table aux Amours (The Demidoff Table),'' [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]], Marble sculpture]]\n\n'''Marble sculpture''' is the [[art]] of creating three-dimensional forms from [[marble]].

Note especially the sculpture [[:Image:Jet\u00e9 - Statue by Enzo Plazzotta - Millbank - Westminster - London - 240404.jpg|''Jet\u00e9'']].</ref>\n\n[[File:DianaLouvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Diana of Versailles]] statue in the [[Louvre]]: note use of skirt, tree stump, and stag for support of the body and lower arm and the \"pinning\" of the upper arm to the arrows in the quiver, forming several closed loops that are thus stronger]]\n\n==Developing a sculpture==\n[[File:Jop.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.5|A pitching tool for carving stone]]\nSculptors usually begin by knocking off, or \"pitching,\" large portions of unwanted stone. A suitable tool for this task is a point [[chisel]], which is a long, hefty piece of steel with a point at one end and a broad striking surface at the other. A pitching tool may also be used at this early stage, which is a wedge-shaped chisel with a broad, flat edge. The pitching tool is useful for splitting the stone and removing large, unwanted chunks. \n\nThe sculptor may also use a [[mallet]], which is similar to a hammer with a broad, barrel-shaped head. When the mallet connects to the tool, energy is transferred through the tool, shattering the stone. Most sculptors work rhythmically, turning the tool with each blow so that the stone is removed quickly and evenly. This is the \"roughing out\" stage of the sculpting process. While a mallet provides the force needed to fracture the marble, it must be used accurately. The smallest miscalculation can ruin the intended sculpture and even injure the sculptor. \n\nSome artists prefer to carve directly onto the stone, without a model; the [[Renaissance]] artist [[Michelangelo]], for example, claimed that his job was to free the human form trapped inside the block. Other artists sculpt a preliminary model out of clay or wax and then translate its features to stone through the use of [[calipers]] or a [[pointing machine]]. \n\nOnce the general shape of the statue has been determined, the sculptor uses other tools to refine the figure. A toothed chisel or claw chisel has multiple gouging surfaces which create parallel lines in the stone. These tools are generally used to add texture to the figure. An artist might mark out specific lines by using calipers to measure an area of stone to be addressed and marking the removal area with pencil, charcoal or chalk. The stone carver generally uses a shallower stroke at this point in the process.\n\nEventually, the sculptor has changed the stone from a rough block into the general shape of the finished statue. Tools called [[rasp]]s and [[riffler]]s are then used to enhance the shape into its final form. A rasp is a flat, steel tool with a coarse surface. The sculptor uses broad, sweeping strokes to remove excess stone as small chips or dust. A riffler is a smaller variation of the rasp, which can be used to create details such as folds of clothing or locks of hair.\n\nPolishing is the last step of the carving process. Sculptors use a variety of fine, abrasive materials such as sandpaper or emery paper to highlight patterns in the stone and to accentuate its natural sheen.<ref>[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/sculpture/marble.htm Marble Sculpture (c.600 BCE - present)], Encyclopedia of Sculpture</ref> Some sculptors may also use [[tin oxide]] to achieve a high-lustre polish. Regardless of the method, however, a glossy marble sculpture will appear more translucent than one that has not been polished.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fleming|display-authors=etal|first1=Roland W. |title=Perceiving Translucent Materials |journal=Journal of Vision |date=2004 |volume=4 |issue=8 |page=133 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221283118_Perceiving_translucent_materials |accessdate=29 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Tools==\n{{external media | width = 150px | align = right | headerimage=[[File:Marble sculpture - Rodin.jpg|150px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWUuGDovHEI Carving Marble with Traditional Tools], (2:47), [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]\n}}\nThe Italian terms for the basic carving tools of stone sculpture are given here, and where possible the English terms have been included.\n\n*La Mazza \u2013 The [[mallet]]. This is used to strike the chisel.\n*Gli Scalpelli \u2013 The [[chisel]]s. These come in various types:\n**La Subbia \u2013 (the Point) a pointed chisel or punch\n**L'Unghietto \u2013 (Round or Rondel Chisel) Literally, \"little fingernail\"\n**La Gradina \u2013 (Toothed Chisel or Claw) a chisel with multiple teeth-\n**Lo Scalpello \u2013 a flat chisel\n*Lo Scapezzatore \u2013 (Pitcher or Pitching Tool) a hefty chisel with a broad blunt edge, for splitting.\n*Il Martello Pneumatico \u2013 [[Jackhammer|Pneumatic hammer]]\n*Il Flessibile \u2013 an angle grinder, fitted with an [[electrolysis]]-applied diamond studded blade\n*Hand Drill\nIn addition to those hand tools listed above, the marble sculptor uses a variety of hammers \u2013 both for the striking of edge tools (chisels and hand drills) and for striking the stone directly (Bocciarda a Martello in Italian, Boucharde in French, Bush Hammer in English).  Following the work of the hammer and chisel, the sculptor will sometimes refine the form further through the use of rasps, files and abrasive rubbing stones and/or sandpaper to smooth the surface contours of the form.\n\n==Tool technique==\n[[Image:Statue of winged Nike (Paris 2002).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Winged Victory of Samothrace]]'', [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] [[marble]] [[sculpture]] of the 3rd century BC]]\n\nHammer and point work is the technique used in working stone, in use at least since [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times, as it is described in the legend of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], and even earlier, the ancient Greek sculptors used it from c. 650 BC. It consists of holding the pointed chisel against the stone and swinging the hammer at it as hard as possible. When the hammer connects with the striking end of the chisel, its energy is transferred down the length and concentrates on a single point on the surface of the block, breaking the stone. This is continued in a line following the desired contour. It may sound simple but many months are required to attain competency. A good stone worker can maintain a rhythm of relatively longer blows (about one per second), swinging the hammer in a wider arc, lifting the chisel between blows to flick out any chips that remain in the way, and repositioning it for the next blow. This way, one can drive the point deeper into the stone and remove more material at a time. Some stoneworkers also spin the subbia in their fingers between hammer blows, thus applying with each blow a different part of the point to the stone. This helps prevent the point from breaking.\n\n[[Image:RecliningHermaphrodite.jpg|thumb|right|The 1st-century BC sculpture 'The Reclining Hermaphroditus', in the [[Museo Nazionale Romano]], Palazzo Massimo Alle Terme in Rome]]\n\n==A few well-known marble sculptures==\n* [[Parthenon Marbles]], in the [[Acropolis Museum]], [[Athens]]\n* [[Venus de Milo|Aphrodite of Milos]], (Venus de Milo) in the [[Louvre]], [[Paris]]\n* ''[[Michelangelo's David|David]]'' by [[Michelangelo]], in [[Florence]]\n* ''[[Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons]]'' by [[Agesander]], in the [[Vatican Museums]], [[Vatican City]]\n* ''[[Michelangelo's Moses|Moses]]'' by Michelangelo, in [[Rome]]\n* ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]'' by Michelangelo, in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]\n* ''[[Discobolus]]'' Lancellotti, the Lancellotti [[discus]] thrower in the [[Museo Nazionale Romano]], [[Rome]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of sculptors]]\n* [[Stone sculpture]]\n* [[Marble]]\n* [[Carrara marble]]\n* [[Sculpture]]\n* [[Topic outline of sculpture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlights_search_results.aspx?searchText=marble+sculpture Marble sculpture at the British Museum]\n*[http://www.vinodmurtimuseum.com/ Marble Sculpture from India] We Craft Sculptures on Marble\n*[http://artofmaking.ac.uk/ The Art of Making in Antiquity: Stoneworking in the Roman World] King's College, London\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marble Sculpture}}\n[[Category:Carving]]\n[[Category:Sculpture techniques]]\n[[Category:Marble sculptures| ]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAdvantages:Journal cites:, templated 1 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_sculpture"}

The remaining Equal, no. 2 (again arranged by Seyfried for male voice choir) was sung at the dedication of Beethoven's gravestone on the first anniversary of his death in March 1828.\n\nA clean manuscript copy, checked by Beethoven, was made of the original manuscript as part of a complete edition of his work ('Gesamtausgabe') by his Vienna publisher [[Tobias Haslinger]].{{sfn|B&H Revisionsbericht|1888|p=vi}} Although Seyfried's arrangements, published in 1827 and 1829, received public performances and were reprinted in 19th-century books about Beethoven, the original score for trombones wasn't published until 1888 as part of [[Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel]]'s 'old' Beethoven Edition.\n\nAll three equals were played at the [[state funeral]]s of [[W.

Equal-voiced music is contrasted with pieces written '''a voce piena'', or for a 'full range of voices'.{{sfn|Carey|1991|p=301}}\n\nThe singular and plural forms in various languages are confusingly similar:\n*Mediaeval Latin: 'aequale' (plural 'tres aequali')\n*English: 'equal' (plural 'three equals')\n*German: 'Equal' (plural 'drei Equale')\n*Italian 'uguale' (plural 'tre uguali')\n\nAlthough the German word 'Posaune' is usually rendered as 'trombone' in English, it has also been used historically to refer to [[slide trumpet]]s, deriving from [[Middle High German]] ''bus\u012bne'', ''bus\u016bne'', '[[trumpet]]', from [[Old French]] ''buisine'', ''busine'', from Latin ''bucina'', Italian [[buccina]].<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/posaune \"posaune\"].
