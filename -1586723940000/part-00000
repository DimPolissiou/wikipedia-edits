Insisting that the children of British monarchs should marry into other reigning [[Protestantism|Protestant]] families, Victoria suggested a meeting with [[Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Princess Helena Friederike]], the daughter of [[George Victor, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Georg Viktor]], reigning Prince of [[Waldeck (state)|Waldeck-Pyrmont]], one of whose daughters had already married [[William III of the Netherlands|King William III of the Netherlands]]. On 27 April 1882, Leopold and Helena were married, at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]], and his income was raised by parliament to \u00a325,000.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Leopold and Helena enjoyed a happy (although brief) marriage. In 1883, Leopold became a father when his wife gave birth to a daughter, [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone|Alice]]. He died shortly before the birth of his son, [[Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Charles Edward]].\n\n==Illness and death==\nPrince Leopold had [[haemophilia]], diagnosed in childhood and in early years had various physicians in permanent attendance, including Arnold Royle<ref>{{cite web|title=Letters to Arnold Royle, Surgeon in Ordinary to HRH Prince Leopold |url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/english-literature-history-l13404/lot.217.html|website=Sothebys|date=2013}}</ref> and [[John Wickham Legg]]. In February 1884, Leopold went to [[Cannes]] on doctor's orders: joint pain is a common symptom of haemophilia and the winter climate in the United Kingdom was always difficult for him. His wife, pregnant at the time, stayed at home but urged him to go. On 27 March, at his Cannes residence, the 'Villa Nevada', he slipped and fell, injuring his knee and hitting his head. He died in the early hours of the next morning, apparently from a cerebral haemorrhage.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hibbert |first1=Christopher |last2=Thomas |first2=Hugh |title=Edward VII: The Last Victorian King |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=9780230610750 |edition=Second, Revised |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AB2Ub-5gvJ4C&lpg=PA148&dq=Prince%20Leopold%20Duke%20of%20Albany&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=22 February 2019}}</ref> He was buried in the Albert Memorial Chapel at [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle|Windsor]].

Insisting that the children of British monarchs should marry into other reigning [[Protestantism|Protestant]] families, Victoria suggested a meeting with [[Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Princess Helena Friederike]], the daughter of [[George Victor, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Georg Viktor]], reigning Prince of [[Waldeck (state)|Waldeck-Pyrmont]], one of whose daughters had already married [[William III of the Netherlands|King William III of the Netherlands]].

In February 1884, Leopold went to [[Cannes]] on doctor's orders: joint pain is a common symptom of haemophilia and the winter climate in the United Kingdom was always difficult for him. His wife, pregnant at the time, stayed at home but urged him to go. On 27 March, at his Cannes residence, the 'Villa Nevada', he slipped and fell, injuring his knee and hitting his head.

This became possible only through the support of the state, which thereby seeks, on one hand, to strengthen the pro-Serbian Jews, and on the other, to weaken Croat national strength. The Jews celebrated the establishment of the so-called Yugoslav state with great joy, because a national Croatia could never be as useful to them as a multi-national Yugoslavia; for in national chaos lies the power of the Jews... In fact, as the Jews had foreseen, Yugoslavia became, in consequence of the corruption of official life in Serbia, a true Eldorado of Jewry.\"<ref>Ante Pavelic: The Croat Question |http://chnm.gmu.edu/history/faculty/kelly/blogs/h312/wp-content/sources/pavelic.pdf</ref></blockquote>\n\nOnce in power, the Usta\u0161e immediately introduced a series of Nazi-style Racial Laws. On April 30, 1941, the Usta\u0161e proclaimed the \"Legal Decree on Racial Origins\" the \"Legal Decree on the Protection of Aryan Blood and the Honor of the Croatian People\", and the \"Legal Provision on Citizenship\".{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=115}} These decrees defined who was a Jew, and took away the citizenship rights of all non-Aryans, i.e. Jews and Roma. By the end of April 1941, months before the Nazis implemented similar measures in Germany, however over a year after being implemented in occupied Poland, the Usta\u0161e required all Jews to wear insignia, typically a yellow Star of David.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=121}} The Usta\u0161e declared the \"Legal Provision on the Nationalization of the Property of Jews and Jewish Companies\", on 10 October 1941, and with it they confiscated all Jewish property.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=170}} \n\nAlready on their first day, 10\u201311 April 1941, [[Usta\u0161e]] arrested a group of prominent Zagreb Jews and held them for ransom.

The previous head of the Memorial Area Simo Brdar estimated at least 365,000 dead at Jasenovac. The analyses of statisticians [[Vladimir \u017derjavi\u0107]] and [[Bogoljub Ko\u010dovi\u0107]] were similar to those of the Memorial Area. In all of Yugoslavia, the estimated number of Serb deaths was 487,000 according to Ko\u010dovi\u0107, and 530,000 according to \u017derjavi\u0107, out of a total of 1,014,000 or 1,027,000 deaths (respectively). \u017derjavi\u0107 further stated there were 197,000 Serb civilians killed in NDH (78,000 as prisoners in Jasenovac and elsewhere) as well as 125,000 Serb combatants.\n\nThe [[Belgrade]] Museum of Holocaust compiled a list of over 77,000 names of Jasenovac victims. It was previously headed by Milan Bulaji\u0107, who supported the claim of a total of 700,000 victims. The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names.

The first mass killing of Serbs was carried out on April 30,1941, when the Usta\u0161e rounded up and killed 196 Serbs at [[Gudovac massacre|Gudovac]]. Many other massacres soon followed, including at [[Blagaj massacre|Blagaj]], [[Glina massacres|Glina]], Korita, Nevesinje, [[Prebilovci massacre|Prebilovci]], Metkovic, Oto\u010dac, Vo\u010din, [[\u0160argovac]], etc. Here is how the Croatian Catholic Bishop of Mostar, [[Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107]], described the mass killings of Serb civilians just in one small area of [[Herzegovina]], just during the first 6 months of the war:<ref>[http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=37130 Mostarski biskup Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107 za vrijeme Drugog svjetskog rata, Tomo Vuku\u0161i\u0107]</ref><blockquote>People were captured like beasts. Slaughtered, killed, thrown live into the abyss. Women, mothers with children, young women, girls and boys were thrown into pits. The vice-mayor of Mostar, Mr. Balji\u0107, a Mohammedan, publicly states, although as an official he should be silent and not talk, that in Ljubinje alone 700 schismatics [i.e. Serb Orthodox Christians] were thrown into one pit. Six full train carriages of women, mothers and girls, children under age 10, were taken from Mostar and \u010capljina to the \u0160urmanci station, where they were unloaded and taken into the hills, with live mothers and their children tossed down the cliffs. Everyone was tossed and killed. In the Klepci parish, from the surrounding villages, 3,700 schismatics were killed. Poor souls, they were calm. I will not enumerate further. I would go too far. In the city of Mostar, hundreds were tied up, taken outside the city and killed like animals.</blockquote>\n\n=== Religious persecution ===\nThe Usta\u0161e not only conducted forcible conversions of Serbs to Catholicism, but on occasion they used the prospect of conversion as a means to gather Serbs together so they could kill them, which is what occurred at [[Glina massacres|Glina]]. On 18 May 1943, [[Aloysius Stepinac|Archbishop Stepinac]] wrote a letter to the pope, in which he estimated 240.000 conversions to date{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=541}}. The Usta\u0161e killed 157 Orthodox priests, among them 3 Serb Orthodox bishops (cutting the throat of the bishop of Banja Luka and killing the archbishop of Sarajevo),{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=528}} while they jailed and tortured [[:sh:Dositej Vasi\u0107|the Orthodox archbishop of Zagreb]]. The Usta\u0161e expelled to Serbia 327 Orthodox priests and one bishop, while 2 other bishops and 12 priests left on their own.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} Thus 85% of the Orthodox priests in the Independent State of Croatia were either killed or expelled by the Usta\u0161e, in order to \"leave the Orthodox population without spiritual leadership so the Usta\u0161as\u2019 policy of forced or fear-induced conversions to Catholicism would be easier to carry out\" {{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}}\n\nThe Usta\u0161e destroyed and desecrated numerous Orthodox Churches,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} forbade the Cyrillic script and Julian calendar (both used in the Orthodox Church), even prohibited the term \"Serbian Orthodox Church\". Orthodox schools were shut down,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} and the Church was prohibited from collecting contributions from believers, robbing it of income.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} Orthodox Church properties were confiscated by the Usta\u0161e,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} some turned over to the Croatian Catholic Church. Finally, to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Usta\u0161e tried to create its own, alternative Croatian Orthodox Church, with an imported Russian priest. but failed to gain adherents.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=545}}\n\nDespite these many actions by the Usta\u0161e to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, Tomasevich found no condemnations of these crimes, public or private, by Catholic Archbishop Stepinac or any other members of the Croatian Catholic Church. On the contrary, he states that this massive Usta\u0161e attack on the Serbian Orthodox Church \"was approved and supported by many Croatian Catholic priests\",{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} and that the Croatian Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and the Vatican \"regarded Usta\u0161e policies against the Serbs and Serbian Orthodox Church as advantageous to Roman Catholicism\".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=565}}\n\n==Connections with the Catholic Church==\n{{main|Catholic clergy involvement with the Usta\u0161e}}\nDuring 23 years of the existance of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918-1941), the Catholic Clergy was deeply dissatisfied with the regime: \"... a massive press campaing was launched to mobilize Croatia's nearly three million Catholics against the central goverment's measures penalizing Saint Peter's apostolate.

The term \"''usta\u0161e''\" is today used as a derogatory term for Croatian [[ultranationalism]]. The term \"Usta\u0161e\" is sometimes used among Serbs to describe [[Serbophobia]] or more generally to defame political opponents.\n\n===Use by Serbian nationalists===\nSince the end of World War II, Serbian historians have used the Usta\u0161e to promote that Serbs resisted the Axis, while Croats and Bosniaks widely supported them. However, the Ustashe never received massive support from ordinary Croats.<ref name=\"Shepherd\" /> The Ustashe regime was backed by parts of the Croatian population that during the interwar period had felt oppressed in the Serbian-led Yugoslavia. Most of the support it had initially gained by creating a Croat national state was lost because of the brutal practices it used.<ref name=\"Sindbaek2002\"/> In the 1980s, Serbian historians produced many works about the forced conversion during World War Two of Serbs to Catholicism in Usta\u0161e Croatia.<ref name=\"Aleksov106\">{{harvnb|Aleksov|2007|p=106.}}</ref> These debates between historians openly became nationalistic and also entered the wider media.<ref name=\"Brunnbauer364\">{{cite book|last=Brunnbauer|first=Ulf|chapter=Historical Writing in the Balkans|editor1-last=Woolf|editor1-first=Daniel|editor2-last=Schneider|editor2-first=Axel|title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 5: Historical Writing Since 1945|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199225996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJ4SDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA364&dq=Serbian+historians+debates&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzpPGK1I7RAhUHUrwKHap4BiYQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&q=Serbian%20historians%20debates&f=false|pages=364|ref=harv}}</ref> Historians in Belgrade during the 1980s who had close government connections often went on television during the evenings to discuss invented or real details about the Usta\u0161e genocide against Serbs during World War Two.<ref name=\"Stojanovic221\"/> Serb clergy and nationalists blamed all Croats for crimes committed by the Usta\u0161e, and for planning a genocide against Serb people.

After that, it was used by [[Edvard Kardelj]] and [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]] in the [[World War II reparations towards Yugoslavia|Yugoslav war reparations claim sent to Germany]]. In its entry on Jasenovac, the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] says:<blockquote>Determining the number of victims is highly problematic, due to the destruction of many relevant documents, the long-term inaccessibility to independent scholars of those documents that survived, and the ideological agendas of postwar partisan scholarship and journalism, which has been and remains influenced by ethnic tension, religious prejudice, and ideological conflict.

The previous head of the Memorial Area Simo Brdar estimated at least 365,000 dead at Jasenovac. The analyses of statisticians [[Vladimir \u017derjavi\u0107]] and [[Bogoljub Ko\u010dovi\u0107]] were similar to those of the Memorial Area.

It was previously headed by Milan Bulaji\u0107, who supported the claim of a total of 700,000 victims. The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names. During World War II various [[Germany|German]] military commanders and civilian authorities gave different figures for the number of Serbs, Jews and others killed inside the territory of the Independent State of Croatia.

The first mass killing of Serbs was carried out on April 30,1941, when the Usta\u0161e rounded up and killed 196 Serbs at [[Gudovac massacre|Gudovac]]. Many other massacres soon followed, including at [[Blagaj massacre|Blagaj]], [[Glina massacres|Glina]], Korita, Nevesinje, [[Prebilovci massacre|Prebilovci]], Metkovic, Oto\u010dac, Vo\u010din, [[\u0160argovac]], etc. Here is how the Croatian Catholic Bishop of Mostar, [[Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107]], described the mass killings of Serb civilians just in one small area of [[Herzegovina]], just during the first 6 months of the war:<ref>[http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=37130 Mostarski biskup Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107 za vrijeme Drugog svjetskog rata, Tomo Vuku\u0161i\u0107]</ref><blockquote>People were captured like beasts. Slaughtered, killed, thrown live into the abyss. Women, mothers with children, young women, girls and boys were thrown into pits. The vice-mayor of Mostar, Mr. Balji\u0107, a Mohammedan, publicly states, although as an official he should be silent and not talk, that in Ljubinje alone 700 schismatics [i.e. Serb Orthodox Christians] were thrown into one pit. Six full train carriages of women, mothers and girls, children under age 10, were taken from Mostar and \u010capljina to the \u0160urmanci station, where they were unloaded and taken into the hills, with live mothers and their children tossed down the cliffs. Everyone was tossed and killed. In the Klepci parish, from the surrounding villages, 3,700 schismatics were killed. Poor souls, they were calm. I will not enumerate further. I would go too far. In the city of Mostar, hundreds were tied up, taken outside the city and killed like animals.</blockquote>\n\n=== Religious persecution ===\nThe Usta\u0161e not only conducted forcible conversions of Serbs to Catholicism, but on occasion they used the prospect of conversion as a means to gather Serbs together so they could kill them, which is what occurred at [[Glina massacres|Glina]]. On 18 May 1943, [[Aloysius Stepinac|Archbishop Stepinac]] wrote a letter to the pope, in which he estimated 240.000 conversions to date{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=541}}. The Usta\u0161e killed 157 Orthodox priests, among them 3 Serb Orthodox bishops (cutting the throat of the bishop of Banja Luka and killing the archbishop of Sarajevo),{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=528}} while they jailed and tortured [[:sh:Dositej Vasi\u0107|the Orthodox archbishop of Zagreb]]. The Usta\u0161e expelled to Serbia 327 Orthodox priests and one bishop, while 2 other bishops and 12 priests left on their own.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} Thus 85% of the Orthodox priests in the Independent State of Croatia were either killed or expelled by the Usta\u0161e, in order to \"leave the Orthodox population without spiritual leadership so the Usta\u0161as\u2019 policy of forced or fear-induced conversions to Catholicism would be easier to carry out\" {{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}}\n\nThe Usta\u0161e destroyed and desecrated numerous Orthodox Churches,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} forbade the Cyrillic script and Julian calendar (both used in the Orthodox Church), even prohibited the term \"Serbian Orthodox Church\". Orthodox schools were shut down,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} and the Church was prohibited from collecting contributions from believers, robbing it of income.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} Orthodox Church properties were confiscated by the Usta\u0161e,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} some turned over to the Croatian Catholic Church. Finally, to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Usta\u0161e tried to create its own, alternative Croatian Orthodox Church, with an imported Russian priest. but failed to gain adherents.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=545}}\n\nDespite these many actions by the Usta\u0161e to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, Tomasevich found no condemnations of these crimes, public or private, by Catholic Archbishop Stepinac or any other members of the Croatian Catholic Church. On the contrary, he states that this massive Usta\u0161e attack on the Serbian Orthodox Church \"was approved and supported by many Croatian Catholic priests\",{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} and that the Croatian Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and the Vatican \"regarded Usta\u0161e policies against the Serbs and Serbian Orthodox Church as advantageous to Roman Catholicism\".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=565}}\n\n==Connections with the Catholic Church==\n{{main|Catholic clergy involvement with the Usta\u0161e}}\nDuring 23 years of the existance of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918-1941), the Catholic Clergy was deeply dissatisfied with the regime: \"... a massive press campaing was launched to mobilize Croatia's nearly three million Catholics against the central goverment's measures penalizing Saint Peter's apostolate.

The journal features in-depth interviews with artists, critics, and curators, as well as critical essays, fiction, poetry, and reviews of art, music, dance, film, books, and theater. The ''Brooklyn Rail'' is distributed in galleries, universities, museums, bookstores, and other organizations. The ''Rail'' operates a small press called Rail Editions, which publishes literary translations, poetry, and art criticism. In addition to its small press, the ''Rail'' has also organized panel discussions, readings, film screenings, music and dance performances, and has curated exhibitions through a program called Rail Curatorial Projects.\n\n== History ==\nOriginally distributed as reading material for commuters on the L train between Manhattan and Brooklyn, the ''Brooklyn Rail'' began as a small broadsheet in 1998, with several founders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/pageoneplus/corrections-november-4th-2015.html?_r=0|title=Corrections: November 4, 2015|publisher=}}</ref>  By 2000, the journal had quickly grown into a full-format publication, with [[Phong Bui]] and then-editor\n[[Theodore Hamm]] sharing oversight duties. Bui comments that it's largely due to support from the arts community, and funding from art foundations, that has made it possible for the journal to maintain its creative autonomy. Hamm notes that the ''Rail's'' non-profit funding, largely provided by private donors, has preserved the magazine's original aspiration to publish \"a crucible of slanted opinions, artfully delivered.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/history|title=The Brooklyn Rail|work=brooklynrail.org|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Mission ==\nThe ''Rail'' aims to \"reflect the complexity and inventiveness of the city\u2019s artistic and cultural landscape.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brooklynrail.org/about/|title=The Brooklyn Rail|website=The Brooklyn Rail|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n[[Robert Storr (art academic)|Robert Storr]] has called it \"the murmur of the city in print.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://brooklynrail.org/about/|title=The Brooklyn Rail|website=The Brooklyn Rail|access-date=2018-05-08}}</ref>\n\nFormer ''[[Nation]]'' publisher [[Victor Navasky]] considered it \"a non-establishment paper that questioned the establishment's assumptions without falling victim to the counterculture's pieties.\"\n\nFor the late [[Nancy Spero]], the paper was \"an eminently readable, informative, and intellectually wide-ranging publication, alert to current trends, controversies, and ideas, and filled with necessary information.\"<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nPoet [[John Ashbery]] has written: \"how wonderful to have a new newspaper that cares about literature and the arts and isn't afraid to say so. The ''Brooklyn Rail'' is a welcome addition to the New York scene.\"<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nAmerican painter [[Alex Katz]] has said that the ''Rail'' \"has the young energy that goes with the young people who come to New York to grow in the arts.

The journal features in-depth interviews with artists, critics, and curators, as well as critical essays, fiction, poetry, and reviews of art, music, dance, film, books, and theater. The ''Brooklyn Rail'' is distributed in galleries, universities, museums, bookstores, and other organizations. The ''Rail'' operates a small press called Rail Editions, which publishes literary translations, poetry, and art criticism. In addition to its small press, the ''Rail'' has also organized panel discussions, readings, film screenings, music and dance performances, and has curated exhibitions through a program called Rail Curatorial Projects.\n\n== History ==\nOriginally distributed as reading material for commuters on the L train between Manhattan and Brooklyn, the ''Brooklyn Rail'' began as a small broadsheet in 1998, with several founders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/pageoneplus/corrections-november-4th-2015.html?_r=0|title=Corrections: November 4, 2015|publisher=}}</ref>  By 2000, the journal had quickly grown into a full-format publication, with [[Phong Bui]] and then-editor\n[[Theodore Hamm]] sharing oversight duties. Bui comments that it's largely due to support from the arts community, and funding from art foundations, that has made it possible for the journal to maintain its creative autonomy. Hamm notes that the ''Rail's'' non-profit funding, largely provided by private donors, has preserved the magazine's original aspiration to publish \"a crucible of slanted opinions, artfully delivered.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/history|title=The Brooklyn Rail|work=brooklynrail.org|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Mission ==\nThe ''Rail'' aims to \"reflect the complexity and inventiveness of the city\u2019s artistic and cultural landscape.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brooklynrail.org/about/|title=The Brooklyn Rail|website=The Brooklyn Rail|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n[[Robert Storr (art academic)|Robert Storr]] has called it \"the murmur of the city in print.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://brooklynrail.org/about/|title=The Brooklyn Rail|website=The Brooklyn Rail|access-date=2018-05-08}}</ref>\n\nFormer ''[[Nation]]'' publisher [[Victor Navasky]] considered it \"a non-establishment paper that questioned the establishment's assumptions without falling victim to the counterculture's pieties.\"\n\nFor the late [[Nancy Spero]], the paper was \"an eminently readable, informative, and intellectually wide-ranging publication, alert to current trends, controversies, and ideas, and filled with necessary information.\"<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nPoet [[John Ashbery]] has written: \"how wonderful to have a new newspaper that cares about literature and the arts and isn't afraid to say so. The ''Brooklyn Rail'' is a welcome addition to the New York scene.\"<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nAmerican painter [[Alex Katz]] has said that the ''Rail'' \"has the young energy that goes with the young people who come to New York to grow in the arts. It would be a bad city without it.
