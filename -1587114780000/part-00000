Kerr dribbled past [[Maren Mjelde]], but shot just wide of [[Ingrid Hjelmseth]]'s goal. At the half-hour mark, [[Karina S\u00e6vik]]'s curling pass played in [[Isabell Herlovsen]], who shot past [[Lydia Williams]] to give Norway the lead. Minutes before halftime, Australia were awarded a penalty after [[Maria Thorisdottir]] was judged to have handled Kerr's cross from the right. A subsequent [[Video assistant referee|VAR]] check revealed that Thorisdottir touched the ball with her shoulder and the penalty call was reversed. Kerr would have a goal ruled out in the 60th minute after she was judged to be offside. [[Elise Kellond-Knight]] equalized for Australia in the 83rd minute after her corner kick evaded all contact and [[Corner kick#Scoring a goal direct from a corner|bounced into the net]] at the far post. [[Caroline Graham Hansen]] almost won the game for Norway in stoppage time, when her curling strike from the edge of the penalty area struck the inside of the post and rolled along the goal line. The first period of extra time saw Williams make two strong saves to deny Norway, as well as [[Alanna Kennedy]] receive a red card after fouling [[Lisa-Marie Karlseng Utland]]. After a relatively tame second period of extra time, the match went to a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Nice |first=Richard Parkin at the Stade de |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/23/norway-break-australias-hearts-in-womens-world-cup-last-16-shootout |title=Norway break Australia's hearts in Women's World Cup last-16 shootout |date=2019-06-22 |work=The Observer|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n\nHansen scored the first penalty for Norway, shooting low to Williams left after she dove the wrong way. Kerr went first for Australia but sent her shot high and wide of the goal. After [[Guro Reiten]] copied Hansen's method, [[Emily Gielnik]] saw her low effort saved by Hjelmseth, who dove to her right to make the stop.

English captain [[Steph Houghton]] scored from the free kick by shooting low into the bottom right corner. England doubled their lead in first half stoppage time, when [[Ellen White (footballer)|Ellen White]] received a pass from [[Lucy Bronze]] just inside the penalty area, and sent a low left-footed shot past Ngo Ndom. Early in the second half, [[Ajara Nchout]] appeared to get a goal back for Cameroon after shooting a [[Gabrielle Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9]] cutback into the top corner, but the goal was disallowed when a [[Video assistant referee|VAR]] check showed Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 was offside in the build up to the goal. [[Alexandra Takounda]] missed a great chance just after being substituted into the game, when she collected [[Alex Greenwood]]'s weak back pass in front of goal, but her effort was saved by [[Karen Bardsley]]. England added another goal in the 58th minute when Greenwood hit [[Toni Duggan]]'s low driven corner into the net at the far post.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hainaut|first=Louise Taylor at Stade du|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/23/england-cameroon-womens-world-cup-last-16-match-report|title=England beat Cameroon to reach quarter-finals amid VAR drama|date=2019-06-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-25|last2=Valenciennes|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThe fixture attracted considerable controversy.

Kerr dribbled past [[Maren Mjelde]], but shot just wide of [[Ingrid Hjelmseth]]'s goal. At the half-hour mark, [[Karina S\u00e6vik]]'s curling pass played in [[Isabell Herlovsen]], who shot past [[Lydia Williams]] to give Norway the lead. Minutes before halftime, Australia were awarded a penalty after [[Maria Thorisdottir]] was judged to have handled Kerr's cross from the right. A subsequent [[Video assistant referee|VAR]] check revealed that Thorisdottir touched the ball with her shoulder and the penalty call was reversed. Kerr would have a goal ruled out in the 60th minute after she was judged to be offside. [[Elise Kellond-Knight]] equalized for Australia in the 83rd minute after her corner kick evaded all contact and [[Corner kick#Scoring a goal direct from a corner|bounced into the net]] at the far post. [[Caroline Graham Hansen]] almost won the game for Norway in stoppage time, when her curling strike from the edge of the penalty area struck the inside of the post and rolled along the goal line. The first period of extra time saw Williams make two strong saves to deny Norway, as well as [[Alanna Kennedy]] receive a red card after fouling [[Lisa-Marie Karlseng Utland]].

English captain [[Steph Houghton]] scored from the free kick by shooting low into the bottom right corner. England doubled their lead in first half stoppage time, when [[Ellen White (footballer)|Ellen White]] received a pass from [[Lucy Bronze]] just inside the penalty area, and sent a low left-footed shot past Ngo Ndom. Early in the second half, [[Ajara Nchout]] appeared to get a goal back for Cameroon after shooting a [[Gabrielle Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9]] cutback into the top corner, but the goal was disallowed when a [[Video assistant referee|VAR]] check showed Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9 was offside in the build up to the goal. [[Alexandra Takounda]] missed a great chance just after being substituted into the game, when she collected [[Alex Greenwood]]'s weak back pass in front of goal, but her effort was saved by [[Karen Bardsley]].

{"title_page": "Online presence management", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=November 2013}}\n\n'''Online presence management''' is the process of presenting and drawing traffic to a personal or professional brand online. This process combines web design and development, [[blogging]], [[search engine optimization]], [[pay per click]] marketing, [[reputation management]], directory listings, [[social media]], link sharing, and other avenues to create a long-term positive presence for a person, organization, or product in search engines and on the web in general.\n\nOnline presence management is distinct from [[web presence management]] in that the former is generally a marketing and messaging discipline while the latter is [[Governance, risk management, and compliance]] (GRC) discipline.\n\n==Theory of online presence management==\nDue to the evolving nature of Internet use, a web site alone is not sufficient to promote most brands. To maintain a [[web presence]] and [[brand recognition]], individuals and companies need to use a combination of social tools such as [[Google Maps]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Flickr]], [[YouTube]], and [[Pinterest]], as well as cultivating a brand presence on [[mobile apps]] and other online databases.\n\nThe online presence management process starts by determining goals that will define an online strategy. Once this strategy is put in place, an ongoing and constant process of evaluating and fine-tuning is necessary to drive online presence towards the identified goals.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nAn online presence management [[strategy]] has several parts.  Generally these will include [[search engine]] placement (making sure the brand appears high in search engine results when the end user has a relevant query), monitoring [[online discussion]] around the brand, and analyzing the brand's overall [[web presence]].once education bday number full YouTube downloader video downloads transfer you send picture upload.\n\n==Elements of online presence management==\nOnline profile or reputation is a sum of multiple activities and platforms. It includes following:\n\n===Web Portfolio Management===\nOnline portfolio helps build visibility of a brand or individual. It works as a centralized hub for all the activities related to the brand and includes, contact info, about the brand (history, vision etc.) and a product showcase. The Web portfolio ranges in type. The most common form of portfolio is the website. A website, usually built on the same domain as the brand's name, represents the business/person throughout the web. \n\nHowever, there are niche-based portfolio websites too that help brands reach out to a more targeted audience through purpose built features and spot on galleries to brag about their work and achievement.\n\n===Blog===\nA [[blog]] provides the brand a way to express. It allows the brand to talk and get their voice/opinion heard on any topic they choose. Blogging can promote a brand through consistent, interesting content generation associated with a particular brand or the market brand caters to. Blogs can be created on the website or on third party platforms such as [[LinkedIn]], [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[Quora]], Wordpress, Blogger.com and Medium, etc. Apart from conventional blogging, social media enabled [[Microblogging]] (through services such as Twitter and Tumblr) is particularly effective in establishing a brand name and build recognition through interaction with masses. It is also a quick way to respond to brand-related complaints and queries.\n\n===Search Engine Optimization (SEO)===\nSearch Engine Optimization is one of the most popular technique to build traction and turn a web page into a revenue generation machine. Search Engine Optimization or [[SEO]] allows companies or individuals to: \n\n# Identify keywords that are likely to bring potential customers or audience to their website\n# Embed those keywords into the web content, naturally and in a value added way\n# Allow search engines to crawl the web page and index all the content\n\nSearch engines use a spider or a [[Web crawler|crawler]] to gather listings by automatically \"crawling\" the web. The spider follows links to web pages, makes copies of the pages, and stores them in the search engine's index. Based on this data, the search engines then index the pages and rank the websites accordingly. Major search engines that index pages using spiders are [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], [[AOL]], and [[Lycos]].\n\nSome methods that help optimize a web page for the search engine include: \n\n* Link Building i.e. creating relevant and natural links for the website.\n* Creating great, keyword-optimized, content. \n\n===Internet Advertising===\nInternet advertising is a form of broadcasting and promotion of products, ideas, or services using the Internet to attract customers. Internet advertising has overtaken other traditional advertising media such as newspapers, magazines, and radio.  [[Internet advertising]] targets users interested in relevant keywords and displays a text or image ad next to search results or within social media.\n\n===Reputation Management===\n{{Main article|Reputation management}}\n\nReputation management is the process of tracking actions and opinions, looking for positive and negative reviews that reflect the opinion of the users about any particular service or product, and removing negative opinions (if any) and converting them into positive ones. It is important, however, not to attack or try to obscure negative opinions through devious means, as this is likely to have an overall negative effect on the brand.  A better strategy is to respond to complaints with information and an apologetic attitude, cultivating later positive reviews.\n\n===Social Media Marketing===\n[[Social media marketing]] uses social media platforms to create and foster communities and relationships. Social media marketing is focused on creating content that attracts attention and encourages readers to share content with their social networks. Social messages are often effective because they usually come from a trusted, third-party source, rather than the brand itself.\n\nUnderstanding what tools are available and how to use them effectively is key to success in social media marketing. Some of these tools include:\n# Social media content management\n# Social media publishing and scheduling\n# [[Social media measurement|Social media monitoring]]\n# Social aggregation\n# Social bookmarking and tagging\n# Social analytics and reporting\n# Automation\n# Validation\n\n===Social media management===\n\nMany of the tools listed above are often found in a social media management system. This is a collection of procedures used to manage [[workflow]] in a disparate [[social media]] environment. These procedures can be manual or computer-based and enable the manager (or managing team) to listen, aggregate, publish, and manage multiple social media channels from one tool.<ref name=\"web-strategist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2010/03/19/list-of-social-media-management-systems-smms/|title=List of Social Media Management Systems (SMMS) &#124; Web Strategy by Jeremiah Owyang &#124; Digital Business|publisher=web-strategist.com|accessdate=2015-08-09}}</ref>\n\nThe common features of a social media management system include access control, content libraries, publishing and scheduling, workflow, aggregation, mention listening, sentiment, analytic and archival functionality.
