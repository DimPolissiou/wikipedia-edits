In the second article of the Treaty, the parties agreed on all boundaries of the United States, including, but not limited to, the boundary to the north along then-[[British North America]]. The agreed-upon boundary included the line from the northwest angle of [[Nova Scotia]] to the northwesternmost head of [[Connecticut River]], and proceeded down along the middle of the river to the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel of north latitude]].\n\nThe parallel had been established in the 1760s as the boundary between the provinces of Quebec and New York (including what would later become the [[Vermont|State of Vermont]]). It was [[Collins\u2013Valentine line|surveyed and marked by John Collins and Thomas Valentine]] from 1771 to 1773.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Francis M.

Northwest of [[Lake Superior]], the boundary followed rivers to the [[Lake of the Woods]]. From the [[northwesternmost point of the Lake of the Woods|northwesternmost point]] of the Lake of the Woods, the boundary was agreed to go straight west until it met the [[Mississippi River]]. In fact, that line never meets the river since [[Lake Itasca|the river's source]] is further south.\n\n====Jay Treaty (1794)====\nThe [[Jay Treaty]] of 1794 (effective 1796) created the [[International Boundary Commission]], which would be charged with surveying and mapping the boundary. It would also provide for the removal of British military and administration from [[Detroit]], as well as other frontier outposts on the U.S. side. The Jay Treaty would be superseded by the [[Treaty of Ghent]] (effective 1815) concluding the [[War of 1812]], which included pre-war boundaries.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Signing of Treaty of Ghent (1814).jpg|thumb|left|Signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814, which ended the [[War of 1812]] and returned the border to its pre-war state. Subsequent treaties agreed upon saw the border demilitarized, and most boundary disputes resolved.]]\nSigned in December 1814, the [[Treaty of Ghent]] would end the War of 1812, returning the boundaries of [[British North America]] and the United States to the state they were prior to the war. In the following decades, the United States and the United Kingdom concluded several treaties that would settle the major boundary disputes between the two, enabling the border to be [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarized]]. The [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]] of 1817 would provide a plan for demilitarizing the two combatant sides in the [[War of 1812]] and also laid out preliminary principles for drawing a border between British North America and the United States.\n\n==== London Convention (1818) ====\nThe [[Treaty of 1818]] would see expansion of both [[British North America]] and the US, where the boundary would extend westward along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], from the [[Northwest Angle]] at [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The treaty would extinguish British claims to the south of that line up to the [[Red River Valley]], which was part of [[Rupert's Land]]. The treaty would also extinguish U.S. claims to land north of that line in the watershed of the [[Missouri River]], which was part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. This would amount to three small areas, consisting of the northern part of the drainages of the [[Milk River (Alberta\u2013Montana)|Milk River]] (today in southern [[Alberta]] and southwestern [[Saskatchewan]]), the [[Poplar River (Montana\u2013Saskatchewan)|Poplar River]] (Saskatchewan), and [[Big Muddy Creek (Missouri River tributary)|Big Muddy Creek]] (Saskatchewan).{{citation needed|date = August 2013}} Along the 49th parallel, the border vista is theoretically straight, but in practice follows the 19th-century surveyed border markers and varies by several hundred feet in spots.<ref>{{cite web| title=Canada & The United States (Bizarre Borders Part 2)| url=http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/canada-the-united-states-bizarre-borders-part-2| access-date=June 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty (1842) ====\n[[File:Webster-Ashburton treaty map-es.svg|thumb|upright|Disputed territory between [[British North America]] and [[Maine]] marked in pink.

The teal line on the map marks the final border.]]\nDisputes over the interpretation of the border treaties and mistakes in surveying required additional negotiations, which would result in the [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842. The treaty resolved the [[Aroostook War]], a dispute over the boundary between [[Maine]], [[New Brunswick]], and the [[Province of Canada]]. The treaty redefined the border between [[New Hampshire]], Vermont, and [[New York (state)|New York]] on the one hand, and the Province of Canada on the other, resolving the [[Republic of Indian Stream|Indian Stream]] dispute and the [[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)|Fort Blunder]] dilemma at the outlet to [[Lake Champlain]].\n\nThe part of the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] that separates Quebec from the U.S. states of Vermont and New York had [[Collins\u2013Valentine line|first been surveyed from 1771 to 1773]] after it had been declared the boundary between New York (including what later became Vermont) and Quebec. It would be surveyed again after the [[War of 1812]]. The U.S. federal government began to construct fortifications just south of the border at [[Rouses Point, New York]], on [[Lake Champlain]]. After a significant portion of the construction was completed, measurements revealed that at that point, the actual 45th parallel was three-quarters of a mile (1.2&nbsp;km) south of the surveyed line. The fort, which would become known as \"Fort Blunder,\" was in Canada, which created a dilemma for the US that would not be resolved until a provision of the treaty left the border on the meandering line as surveyed. The border along the [[Boundary Waters]] in present-day Ontario and [[Minnesota]] between [[Lake Superior]] and the [[Northwest Angle]] was also redefined.<ref name = WA>{{cite web |publisher=Yale Law School |year=1842 |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/br-1842.asp|title=British-American Diplomacy The Webster-Ashburton Treaty|access-date=March 1, 2007}}</ref><ref name = Lass>{{cite book |last=Lass |first=William E. |title=Minnesota's Boundary with Canada |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |year=1980 |location=St. Paul, Minnesota |page=2 |isbn=0-87351-153-0}}</ref>\n\n==== Oregon Treaty (1846) ====\n{{Main|Oregon Treaty}}\n[[File:Oregoncountry.png|thumb|upright|Map of the disputed [[Oregon Country]], with the American, and British claims marked.

However, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] wanted a border that followed the [[Columbia River]] to the Pacific Ocean.

These procedures expedite travel by allowing flights originating in Canada to land at a U.S. airport without being processed as an international arrival. Canada does not maintain equivalent personnel at U.S. airports due to the sheer number of Canada-bound flights from U.S. departure locations, as well as because of the limited number of flights compared to that of U.S.-bound flights that depart major Canadian airports.\n\n==== Cross-border airports ====\nOne curiosity on the Canada\u2013U.S. border is the presence of six airports that straddle the borderline. Such airports were built prior to the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|U.S. entry into World War II]] as a way to legally transfer U.S.-built aircraft, such as the [[Lockheed Hudson]], to Canada under the provisions of the [[Lend-Lease|''Lend-Lease Act'']]. In the interest of maintaining neutrality, U.S. military pilots were forbidden to deliver combat aircraft to Canada. As result, the aircraft were flown to the border, where they would land, then be towed on their wheels over the border by tractors or horses over night. The next day, the planes would be crewed by [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] pilots and flown to other locations, typically airbases in [[Eastern Canada]], from where they were often flown to the [[United Kingdom]] and deployed in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref>[http://archive.copanational.org/PlacesToFly/airport_view.php?pr_id=4&ap_id=1065 Places to Fly \u2013 Dunseith / International Peace Garden] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613024215/http://archive.copanational.org/PlacesToFly/airport_view.php?pr_id=4&ap_id=1065 |date=June 13, 2012 }}.

Those that cross are required to report to customs, which are be stationed further inland.\n\n==== Rail crossings ====\nThere are 39 [[List of Canada\u2013United States border crossings#Rail crossings|railroads]] that cross the U.S.\u2013Canada border, nine of which are no longer in use. Eleven of these railroads cross the border at a bridge or tunnel. \n\nOnly four international rail lines currently carry passengers between the U.S. and Canada. At Vancouver's [[Pacific Central Station]], passengers are required to pass through U.S. pre-clearance facilities and pass their baggage through an [[X-ray machine]] before being allowed to board the [[Seattle]]-bound [[Amtrak Cascades|Amtrak ''Cascades'']] train, which makes no further stops before crossing the border. Pre-clearance facilities are not available for the popular [[Adirondack (train)|''Adirondack'']] (New York City to Montreal) or [[Maple Leaf (train)|''Maple Leaf'']] (New York City to Toronto) trains, since these lines have stops between Montreal or Toronto and the border. Instead, passengers must clear customs at a stop located at the actual border.\n\n=== Seaports ===\n[[File:Cape Vincent Intl Ferry.jpg|thumb|A ferry departing [[Wolfe Island (Ontario)|Wolfe Island]], Ontario for [[Cape Vincent]], [[New York (state)|New York]]]]\nThere are 13 international [[List of Canada\u2013United States border crossings#Ferry crossings|ferry crossings]] operating between the U.S.and Canada. Two of them carry passengers only and one carries only rail cars.  Four of the ferries operate only on a seasonal basis.\n\nSimilar to that of the pre-clearance facilities at Canadian airports, arrangements exist at major Canadian [[Port|seaports]] that handle sealed direct import shipments into the U.S. Along the East coast, ferry services operate between the province of [[New Brunswick]] and the state of [[Maine]], while on the West coast, they operate between British Columbia and the states of Washington and Alaska. There are also several ferry services in the Great Lakes operating between the province of Ontario and the states of Michigan, New York, and [[Ohio]].

In the second article of the Treaty, the parties agreed on all boundaries of the United States, including, but not limited to, the boundary to the north along then-[[British North America]]. The agreed-upon boundary included the line from the northwest angle of [[Nova Scotia]] to the northwesternmost head of [[Connecticut River]], and proceeded down along the middle of the river to the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel of north latitude]].\n\nThe parallel had been established in the 1760s as the boundary between the provinces of Quebec and New York (including what would later become the [[Vermont|State of Vermont]]).

Northwest of [[Lake Superior]], the boundary followed rivers to the [[Lake of the Woods]]. From the [[northwesternmost point of the Lake of the Woods|northwesternmost point]] of the Lake of the Woods, the boundary was agreed to go straight west until it met the [[Mississippi River]]. In fact, that line never meets the river since [[Lake Itasca|the river's source]] is further south.\n\n====Jay Treaty (1794)====\nThe [[Jay Treaty]] of 1794 (effective 1796) created the [[International Boundary Commission]], which would be charged with surveying and mapping the boundary. It would also provide for the removal of British military and administration from [[Detroit]], as well as other frontier outposts on the U.S. side. The Jay Treaty would be superseded by the [[Treaty of Ghent]] (effective 1815) concluding the [[War of 1812]], which included pre-war boundaries.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Signing of Treaty of Ghent (1814).jpg|thumb|left|Signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814, which ended the [[War of 1812]] and returned the border to its pre-war state.

In the following decades, the United States and the United Kingdom concluded several treaties that would settle the major boundary disputes between the two, enabling the border to be [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarized]]. The [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]] of 1817 would provide a plan for demilitarizing the two combatant sides in the [[War of 1812]] and also laid out preliminary principles for drawing a border between British North America and the United States.\n\n==== London Convention (1818) ====\nThe [[Treaty of 1818]] would see expansion of both [[British North America]] and the US, where the boundary would extend westward along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], from the [[Northwest Angle]] at [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The treaty would extinguish British claims to the south of that line up to the [[Red River Valley]], which was part of [[Rupert's Land]]. The treaty would also extinguish U.S. claims to land north of that line in the watershed of the [[Missouri River]], which was part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]].

The treaty resolved the [[Aroostook War]], a dispute over the boundary between [[Maine]], [[New Brunswick]], and the [[Province of Canada]]. The treaty redefined the border between [[New Hampshire]], Vermont, and [[New York (state)|New York]] on the one hand, and the Province of Canada on the other, resolving the [[Republic of Indian Stream|Indian Stream]] dispute and the [[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)|Fort Blunder]] dilemma at the outlet to [[Lake Champlain]].\n\nThe part of the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] that separates Quebec from the U.S. states of Vermont and New York had [[Collins\u2013Valentine line|first been surveyed from 1771 to 1773]] after it had been declared the boundary between New York (including what later became Vermont) and Quebec. It would be surveyed again after the [[War of 1812]]. The U.S. federal government began to construct fortifications just south of the border at [[Rouses Point, New York]], on [[Lake Champlain]]. After a significant portion of the construction was completed, measurements revealed that at that point, the actual 45th parallel was three-quarters of a mile (1.2&nbsp;km) south of the surveyed line. The fort, which would become known as \"Fort Blunder,\" was in Canada, which created a dilemma for the US that would not be resolved until a provision of the treaty left the border on the meandering line as surveyed.

However, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] wanted a border that followed the [[Columbia River]] to the Pacific Ocean.

As result, the aircraft were flown to the border, where they would land, then be towed on their wheels over the border by tractors or horses over night. The next day, the planes would be crewed by [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] pilots and flown to other locations, typically airbases in [[Eastern Canada]], from where they were often flown to the [[United Kingdom]] and deployed in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref>[http://archive.copanational.org/PlacesToFly/airport_view.php?pr_id=4&ap_id=1065 Places to Fly \u2013 Dunseith / International Peace Garden] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613024215/http://archive.copanational.org/PlacesToFly/airport_view.php?pr_id=4&ap_id=1065 |date=June 13, 2012 }}.

The left-hand building and ramp is north of the border in Canada; the right-hand building and ramp is in the United States.]]\n[[Piney Pinecreek Border Airport]] is located in Manitoba and Minnesota. The northwest/southeast-oriented runway straddles the border, and there are two ramps: one in the U.S. and one in Canada. The airport is jointly owned by the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] and the local government of [[Piney, Manitoba]].\n\n[[International Peace Garden Airport]] is located in Manitoba and [[North Dakota]] adjacent to the [[International Peace Garden]]. The runway is entirely within North Dakota, but a ramp extends across the border to allow aircraft to access Canadian customs. While not jointly owned, it is operated as an international facility for customs clearance as part of the International Peace Garden.\n\n[[Coronach/Scobey Border Station Airport]] is located in [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Montana]]. The east-west runway is sited exactly on the border. The airport is jointly owned by the Canadian and U.S. governments.\n\n[[Coutts/Ross International Airport]] is located in Alberta and Montana. Like Coronach/Scobey, the east\u2013west runway is sited exactly on the border. The airport is owned entirely by the Montana Aeronautics Division.\n\n[[Whetstone International Airport|Del Bonita/Whetstone International Airport]] is located in Alberta and Montana, and similarly has an east-west runway sited exactly on the border. It is assigned U.S. identifier.\n\n[[Avey Field State Airport]] is located in Washington and British Columbia. The privately-owned airfield is mostly in the U.S., but several hundred feet of the north-south runway extend into Canada. As such, both Canadian and U.S. customs are available. It is assigned a U.S. identifier, but does not have a Canadian one.\n\n=== Land border crossings ===\n[[File:Ambassadorbridgesailboatunderneath.jpg|thumb|The [[Ambassador Bridge]] between [[Michigan]] and [[Ontario]], is the busiest border crossing on the international boundary]]\nCurrently there are 119 legal land border crossings between the United States and Canada, 26 of which take place at a bridge or tunnel. Only 2 of the 119 crossings are one-way, the [[Churubusco\u2013Franklin Centre Border Crossing]], where travellers may enter only the United States; and the [[Four Falls Border Crossing]], where travellers may enter only Canada.\n\nThere are six roads have [[List of Canada\u2013United States border crossings#Unstaffed road crossings|unstaffed road crossings]], and do not have border inspection services in one or both directions, where travellers are legally allowed to cross the border. Those that cross are required to report to customs, which are be stationed further inland.\n\n==== Rail crossings ====\nThere are 39 [[List of Canada\u2013United States border crossings#Rail crossings|railroads]] that cross the U.S.\u2013Canada border, nine of which are no longer in use. Eleven of these railroads cross the border at a bridge or tunnel. \n\nOnly four international rail lines currently carry passengers between the U.S. and Canada. At Vancouver's [[Pacific Central Station]], passengers are required to pass through U.S. pre-clearance facilities and pass their baggage through an [[X-ray machine]] before being allowed to board the [[Seattle]]-bound [[Amtrak Cascades|Amtrak ''Cascades'']] train, which makes no further stops before crossing the border. Pre-clearance facilities are not available for the popular [[Adirondack (train)|''Adirondack'']] (New York City to Montreal) or [[Maple Leaf (train)|''Maple Leaf'']] (New York City to Toronto) trains, since these lines have stops between Montreal or Toronto and the border. Instead, passengers must clear customs at a stop located at the actual border.\n\n=== Seaports ===\n[[File:Cape Vincent Intl Ferry.jpg|thumb|A ferry departing [[Wolfe Island (Ontario)|Wolfe Island]], Ontario for [[Cape Vincent]], [[New York]]]]\nThere are 13 international [[List of Canada\u2013United States border crossings#Ferry crossings|ferry crossings]] operating between the U.S.and Canada. Two of them carry passengers only and one carries only rail cars.  Four of the ferries operate only on a seasonal basis.\n\nSimilar to that of the pre-clearance facilities at Canadian airports, arrangements exist at major Canadian [[Port|seaports]] that handle sealed direct import shipments into the U.S. Along the East coast, ferry services operate between the province of [[New Brunswick]] and the state of [[Maine]], while on the West coast, they operate between British Columbia and the states of Washington and Alaska. There are also several ferry services in the Great Lakes operating between the province of Ontario and the states of Michigan, New York, and [[Ohio]]. The ferry between Maine and [[Nova Scotia]] ended its operations in 2009, resuming again in 2014.\n\nOn [[Heart Island]] in the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], the [[Boldt Castle]] has a border control point with no specific location on the Canadian side.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} As such, Canadians must present identification to land on the island.\n\n=== Cross-border buildings ===\n[[File:HaskellLibraryBorderLine.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Haskell Free Library and Opera House|Haskell Library]] sits on the international boundary, with the boundary marked by  a black line on the floor of its reading room]]\nA [[line house]] is a building deliberately located so that an international boundary passes through it.<ref>{{Citation|title=Line house|date=2020-02-04|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Line_house&oldid=939187578|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> There are several of such buildings that exist along the U.S.\u2013Canada border:\n\n* The [[Haskell Free Library and Opera House]] straddles the border in [[Derby Line, Vermont]], and [[Stanstead, Quebec]]. \n* Private homes divided by the boundary line between [[Estcourt Station, Maine]], and [[Poh\u00e9n\u00e9gamook]], Quebec.\n* Private homes divided between [[Stanstead, Quebec#Beebe Plain|Beebe Plain, Quebec]] and [[Beebe Plain, Vermont]]; \n* A seasonal home divided at the intersection of Matthias Lane in [[Alburgh (town), Vermont|Alburgh, Vermont]], and Chemin au Bord de l'Eau in [[Noyan, Quebec]]; \n* A house divided between [[Richford, Vermont]], and [[Abercorn, Quebec]].<ref>{{google maps| url=https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&safe=off&psj=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&bpcl=40096503&biw=1366&bih=704&q=1000+Drew+Road+Richford+VT&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x4cb602dddf7cf209:0xe7516fec195a9751,1000+Drew+Rd,+Richford,+VT+05476&gl=us&sa=X&ei=K3TSUOGCE8zK0AHnn4DACQ&ved=0CC8Q8gEwAA |title=1000 Drew Rd \u2013 Richford Vermont |access-date=April 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>Farfan, Matthew (2009).

Like exclaves, practical exclaves are not contiguous with the ''land'' of the home country and have ''land'' access only through another country or countries. Unlike exclaves, they are not ''entirely'' surrounded by foreign territory. Hence, they are exclaves ''for practical purposes'', without meeting the strict definition.\n\nThe term ''pene-exclave,'' also known as a \"functional\" or \"practical\" exclave,<ref name=\"EV\" />{{rp|31}} was defined by G.
