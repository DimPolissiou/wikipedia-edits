A thin tube of paper, bamboo, stainless steel, or plastic (such as [[polypropylene]] and [[polystyrene]]), or other material is used by placing one end in the mouth and the other in the beverage. A combination of muscular action of the [[tongue]] and [[cheek]]s reduces air [[pressure]] in the mouth and above the liquid in the straw, whereupon [[atmospheric pressure]] forces the beverage through the straw. Drinking straws can be straight or have an angle-adjustable [[bellows]] segment. Drinking straws are usually intended as a [[Disposable product|single-use product]] and several countries, regions and municipalities have banned plastic straws to reduce [[plastic pollution]]. Some companies have voluntarily banned or reduced the number of plastic straws distributed from their premises.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early examples ===\nThe first known straws were made by the [[Sumer]]ians, and were used for drinking beer,<ref name=\"thompson2011\" /> probably to avoid the solid byproducts of [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] that sink to the bottom.<ref name=\"maeir1992\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1179/007589192790220793 |title=Bone and Metal Straw-tip Beer-strainers from the Ancient Near East |journal=Levant |volume=24 |pages=218\u2013223 |year=2013 |last1=Maeir |first1=Aren M. |last2=Garfinkel |first2=Yosef }}</ref><ref name=\"homan2004\">{{cite journal |last1=Homan |first1=Michael |title=Beer and Its Drinkers: An Ancient Near Eastern Love Story |journal=Near Eastern Archaeology |date=2004 |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=84\u201395 |url=https://www.academia.edu/17738197 |doi=10.2307/4132364 |jstor=4132364 }}</ref> The oldest drinking straw in existence, found in a Sumerian tomb dated 3,000&nbsp;BCE, was a gold tube inlaid with the precious blue stone [[lapis lazuli]].<ref name=\"thompson2011\" /> [[Argentina|Argentines]] and their neighbors have, for several hundred years, used (for drinking [[yerba mate|mate]] tea) a similar metallic device called a [[bombilla]], that acts as both a straw and a sieve.<ref name=\"thompson2011\" /> \nIn the 1800s, the [[rye grass]] straw came into fashion because it was cheap and soft, but it had an unfortunate tendency to turn to mush when put in liquid.<ref name=\"thompson2011\" />\n\nAmerican [[Marvin Stone|Marvin C.

(The cocktail straw, which is sometimes used in pairs, may be derived from such early straws.) \n\n=== Mass production ===\nThe use of plastic straws became popular following [[World War II]] due to the inexpensiveness of the materials, as well as the cheapness of the drinks and/or meals that were provided with them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5336242/plastic-straws-history/|title=The Backlash Against Plastic Straws Is Spreading.

After one weekend of sales, Woolworth's placed an order for all of its stores and Sip-N-See went national.

A form commonly known as a \"bendy straw\" (known in the industry as an \"articulated straw\") has a [[concertina]]-type hinge near the top for convenience.

A thin tube of paper, bamboo, stainless steel, or plastic (such as [[polypropylene]] and [[polystyrene]]), or other material is used by placing one end in the mouth and the other in the beverage. A combination of muscular action of the [[tongue]] and [[cheek]]s reduces air [[pressure]] in the mouth and above the liquid in the straw, whereupon [[atmospheric pressure]] forces the beverage through the straw. Drinking straws can be straight or have an angle-adjustable [[bellows]] segment. Drinking straws are usually intended as a [[Disposable product|single-use product]] and several countries, regions and municipalities have banned plastic straws to reduce [[plastic pollution]]. Some companies have voluntarily banned or reduced the number of plastic straws distributed from their premises.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early examples ===\nThe first known straws were made by the [[Sumer]]ians, and were used for drinking beer,<ref name=\"thompson2011\" /> probably to avoid the solid byproducts of [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] that sink to the bottom.<ref name=\"maeir1992\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1179/007589192790220793 |title=Bone and Metal Straw-tip Beer-strainers from the Ancient Near East |journal=Levant |volume=24 |pages=218\u2013223 |year=2013 |last1=Maeir |first1=Aren M. |last2=Garfinkel |first2=Yosef }}</ref><ref name=\"homan2004\">{{cite journal |last1=Homan |first1=Michael |title=Beer and Its Drinkers: An Ancient Near Eastern Love Story |journal=Near Eastern Archaeology |date=2004 |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=84\u201395 |url=https://www.academia.edu/17738197 |doi=10.2307/4132364 |jstor=4132364 }}</ref> The oldest drinking straw in existence, found in a Sumerian tomb dated 3,000&nbsp;BCE, was a gold tube inlaid with the precious blue stone [[lapis lazuli]].<ref name=\"thompson2011\" /> [[Argentina|Argentines]] and their neighbors have, for several hundred years, used (for drinking [[yerba mate|mate]] tea) a similar metallic device called a [[bombilla]], that acts as both a straw and a sieve.<ref name=\"thompson2011\" /> \nIn the 1800s, the [[rye grass]] straw came into fashion because it was cheap and soft, but it had an unfortunate tendency to turn to mush when put in liquid.<ref name=\"thompson2011\" />\n\nAmerican [[Marvin Stone|Marvin C.

It lies on the banks of the [[Mandovi River]] [[estuary]] in the [[Tiswadi|Ilhas de Goa]] sub-district (taluka). With a population of 114,759 in the metropolitan area, Panjim is Goa's largest [[urban agglomeration]], ahead of [[Margao|Marg\u00e3o]] and [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]].\n\nPanjim has terraced hills, concrete buildings with balconies and red-tiled roofs, churches, and a riverside promenade. There are avenues lined with [[gulmohar]], [[acacia]] and other trees. The [[baroque]] [[Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church, Goa|Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church]] is located overlooking the main square known as Pra\u00e7a da Igreja. Panjim has been selected as one of hundred Indian cities to be developed as a [[smart city]] under the [[Smart Cities Mission]].\n\nPanjim was built with stepped streets and a seven kilometre long promenade on a planned [[Grid plan|grid]] system after the [[Portuguese Goa|Portuguese]] relocated the capital from [[Old Goa|Velha Goa]] in the 17th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ccpgoa.com/index.php|title=Corporation of The City of Panaji :: Official Site|website=ccpgoa.com|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref> It was elevated from a town to a city on 22 March 1843 making it the oldest civic institution in Asia (175 years).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/panaji-completes-174-years-as-states-capital-city/articleshow/57781746.cms|title=Panaji completes 174 years as state\u2019s capital city - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe city was renamed from ''Panjim'' in [[Indian English|English]] to ''Panaji'', its present official name in the 1960s. The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] name was ''Pangim''. The city is sometimes written as ''Ponnj\u00e9'' in [[Romi Konkani]]. The city had been renamed ''Nova Goa'' (Portuguese for \"New Goa\") when it officially replaced the city of Goa (now [[Old Goa]]) as the capital of [[Portuguese India]], though the Viceroy had already moved there in 1759.\n\nThe justification of the modern word ''Panaji'' is derived from the words ''panjani'' and ''khali'', which mean ''a boat'' and ''a small creek'' respectively, in [[Sanskrit]]. Thus the modern word Panjim is believed to be a corruption of the old word ''Panjanakhani'' as inscribed on the discovered Panjim copper-plates dated 1059 CE, belonging to the rule of Kadamba king Jayakesi I.<ref>Title: Gazetteer of the Union Territory Goa, Daman and Diu: district gazetteer, Volume 1; Publisher: Gazetteer Dept., Govt. of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu, 1979 (Original from the University of Michigan, Digitised: 30 August 2008)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/35652/10/10_chapter%203.pdf|title=EPIGRAPHICAL AND LITERARY SOURCES ON WORSHIP IN GOA'S PAST|website=ShodhGanga}}</ref> According to legend, this northern capital city was mentioned in a stone inscription of [[Kadambas of Goa|Kadamba]] king Jayakesi I dated 1054 CE as 'Panjanakhani', giving him the epithet of ''Padavalendra'' which is [[Kannada]] for  ''lord of the western ocean''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=panjanakhani&source=bl&ots=dYPjE4F1uM&sig=OrXKk3HJ8EbTEi5R99vTyt5yQ0Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIr8yYle3LAhUFcY4KHalbCD4Q6AEIIDAA#v=snippet&q=panjanakhani&f=false|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history, Volume 2|last=De Souza|first=Teotonio R.|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=1990|isbn=9788170222590|pages=129}}</ref>\n\nSome historians state that it was named after a Shia Muslim shrine also called a \"Panja\" on one of the coastal hill tops.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=panjanakhani&source=bl&ots=dYPjE4F1uM&sig=OrXKk3HJ8EbTEi5R99vTyt5yQ0Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIr8yYle3LAhUFcY4KHalbCD4Q6AEIIDAA#v=snippet&q=panjanakhani&f=false|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history, Volume 2|last=De Souza|first=Teotonio R.|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=1990|isbn=9788170222590|pages=129}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPanjim was [[Annexation of Portuguese India|annexed by India]] with the rest of Goa and the former [[Portuguese India|Portuguese territories]] after the [[Indian annexation of Portuguese India|Indian invasion of Portuguese India]] in 1961.{{cn|date=May 2018}} It became a state-capital on Goa's elevation to statehood in 1987.

With a population of 114,759 in the metropolitan area, Panjim is Goa's largest [[urban agglomeration]], ahead of [[Margao|Marg\u00e3o]] and [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]].\n\nPanjim has terraced hills, concrete buildings with balconies and red-tiled roofs, churches, and a riverside promenade. There are avenues lined with [[gulmohar]], [[acacia]] and other trees. The [[baroque]] [[Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church, Goa|Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church]] is located overlooking the main square known as Pra\u00e7a da Igreja. Panjim has been selected as one of hundred Indian cities to be developed as a [[smart city]] under the [[Smart Cities Mission]].\n\nPanjim was built with stepped streets and a seven kilometre long promenade on a planned [[Grid plan|grid]] system after the [[Portuguese Goa|Portuguese]] relocated the capital from [[Old Goa|Velha Goa]] in the 17th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ccpgoa.com/index.php|title=Corporation of The City of Panaji :: Official Site|website=ccpgoa.com|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref> It was elevated from a town to a city on 22 March 1843 making it the oldest civic institution in Asia (175 years).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/panaji-completes-174-years-as-states-capital-city/articleshow/57781746.cms|title=Panaji completes 174 years as state\u2019s capital city - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe city was renamed from ''Panjim'' in [[Indian English|English]] to ''Panaji'', its present official name in the 1960s. The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] name was ''Pangim''. The city is sometimes written as ''Ponnj\u00e9'' in [[Romi Konkani]]. The city had been renamed ''Nova Goa'' (Portuguese for \"New Goa\") when it officially replaced the city of Goa (now [[Old Goa]]) as the capital of [[Portuguese India]], though the Viceroy had already moved there in 1759.\n\nThe justification of the modern word ''Panaji'' is derived from the words ''panjani'' and ''khali'', which mean ''a boat'' and ''a small creek'' respectively, in [[Sanskrit]]. Thus the modern word Panjim is believed to be a corruption of the old word ''Panjanakhani'' as inscribed on the discovered Panjim copper-plates dated 1059 CE, belonging to the rule of Kadamba king Jayakesi I.<ref>Title: Gazetteer of the Union Territory Goa, Daman and Diu: district gazetteer, Volume 1; Publisher: Gazetteer Dept., Govt. of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu, 1979 (Original from the University of Michigan, Digitised: 30 August 2008)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/35652/10/10_chapter%203.pdf|title=EPIGRAPHICAL AND LITERARY SOURCES ON WORSHIP IN GOA'S PAST|website=ShodhGanga}}</ref> According to legend, this northern capital city was mentioned in a stone inscription of [[Kadambas of Goa|Kadamba]] king Jayakesi I dated 1054 CE as 'Panjanakhani', giving him the epithet of ''Padavalendra'' which is [[Kannada]] for  ''lord of the western ocean''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=panjanakhani&source=bl&ots=dYPjE4F1uM&sig=OrXKk3HJ8EbTEi5R99vTyt5yQ0Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIr8yYle3LAhUFcY4KHalbCD4Q6AEIIDAA#v=snippet&q=panjanakhani&f=false|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history, Volume 2|last=De Souza|first=Teotonio R.|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=1990|isbn=9788170222590|pages=129}}</ref>\n\nSome historians state that it was named after a Shia Muslim shrine also called a \"Panja\" on one of the coastal hill tops.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwYDPnEjTb4C&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=panjanakhani&source=bl&ots=dYPjE4F1uM&sig=OrXKk3HJ8EbTEi5R99vTyt5yQ0Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIr8yYle3LAhUFcY4KHalbCD4Q6AEIIDAA#v=snippet&q=panjanakhani&f=false|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history, Volume 2|last=De Souza|first=Teotonio R.|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=1990|isbn=9788170222590|pages=129}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPanjim was [[Annexation of Portuguese India|annexed by India]] with the rest of Goa and the former [[Portuguese India|Portuguese territories]] after the [[Indian annexation of Portuguese India|Indian invasion of Portuguese India]] in 1961.{{cn|date=May 2018}} It became a state-capital on Goa's elevation to statehood in 1987.

Thus, as long as Clift's father was able to pay for it, he and his siblings were privately tutored, travelled extensively in America and Europe, became fluent in German and French, and led a protected life, sheltered from the destitution and communicable diseases which became legion following the First World War.<ref>Bosworth, chapters 1\u20134</ref> The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s ruined Clift's father financially. Unemployed and broke, he was forced to move his family to New York, but Clift's mother still persisted in her plans, and as her husband's situation improved, she was able to enrol Brooks at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and Ethel at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. Clift, however, could not adjust to school, and never went to college. Instead, he took to stage acting, beginning in a summer production, which led to his debut on Broadway by 1935.<ref>Bosworth, chapter 6</ref>\n\nIn the next 10 years, Clift built a successful stage career working with, among others, [[Dame May Whitty]], [[Alla Nazimova]], [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]], [[Fredric March]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Alfred Lunt]], and [[Lynn Fontanne]]. He appeared in plays written by [[Moss Hart]], [[Robert E. Sherwood|Robert Sherwood]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and [[Thornton Wilder]], creating the part of Henry in the original production of ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]''.<ref>Amy Lawrence, The Passion of Montgomery Clift, p. 13</ref>  In 1939, as a member of the cast of the 1939 Broadway production of [[No\u00ebl Coward]]'s ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', Clift participated in one of the very first [[television]] broadcasts in the United States. A performance of ''Hay Fever'' was broadcast by NBC's New York television station W2XBS (the forerunner of [[WNBC]]) and was aired during the [[1939 New York World's Fair|World's Fair]] as part of the introduction of television.<ref>Lawrence, p. 261</ref>\nHe resided in [[Jackson Heights, Queens]], until he got his break on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Clift first acted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at age 15, when he appeared as Prince Peter in the Cole Porter musical ''Jubilee'' at the Imperial Theater. At 20, he appeared in the Broadway production of ''[[There Shall Be No Night]]'', a work which won the 1941 [[Pulitzer Prize]].\n\nClift did not serve during [[World War II]], having been given [[Selective Service System#Classifications|4-F status]] after suffering [[dysentery]] in 1942.\n\n==Career==\n===Rise to stardom===\n[[File:A Place in the sun premiere.JPG|thumb|200px|Clift at the premiere of ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' (1951)]]\nAt the age of 25, Clift moved to [[Hollywood]]. His first movie role was opposite [[John Wayne]] in ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', which was shot in 1946 and released in 1948. His second movie was ''[[The Search]]'', which premiered in the same year. Clift was unhappy with the quality of the script, and reworked it himself. The movie was awarded a screenwriting [[Academy Award]] for the credited writers.<ref>[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1425955884390 Awards Database \u2013 Montgomery Clift] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402164342/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1425955884390 |date=April 2, 2015 }} January 2, 2016</ref> Clift's naturalistic performance led to director [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s being asked, \"Where did you find a soldier who can act so well?\", and he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. Clift signed on for his next movie, ''[[The Heiress]]'' (1949), in order to avoid being typecast. Clift was unhappy with the script, and unable to get along with most of the cast. He criticised co-star [[Olivia de Havilland]], saying that she let the director shape her entire performance and telling friends that he wanted to change de Havilland's lines because \"She isn't giving me enough to respond [to]\". The studio marketed Clift as a sex symbol prior to the movie's release in 1949. Clift had a large female following, and Olivia de Havilland was flooded with angry fan letters because her character rejects Clift's character in the final scene of the movie. Clift ended up unhappy with his performance, and left early during the film's premiere. Clift also starred in ''[[The Big Lift]]'' (1950), which was shot on location in Germany.\n\nClift's performance in ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' (1951) is regarded as one of his signature [[method acting]] performances. He worked extensively on his character, and was again nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. For his character's scenes in jail, Clift spent a night in a real state prison. He also refused to go along with director [[George Stevens]]' suggestion that he do \"something amazing\" on his character's walk to the electric chair. Instead, he walked to his death with a natural, depressed facial expression. His main acting rival (and fellow Omaha, Nebraska, native), Marlon Brando, was so moved by Clift's performance that he voted for Clift to win the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and was sure that he would win. That year, Clift voted for Brando in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' was critically acclaimed; [[Charlie Chaplin]] called it \"the greatest movie made about America\". The film received added media attention due to the rumours that Clift and co-star [[Elizabeth Taylor]] were dating in real life. They were billed as \"the most beautiful couple in Hollywood\". Many critics still call Clift and Taylor \"the most beautiful Hollywood movie couple of all time\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> After a break, Clift committed himself to three more films, all of which premiered during 1953: ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'', to be directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]; Vittorio De Sica's ''[[Terminal Station (film)|Terminal Station]]''; and Fred Zinnemann's ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', which earned Clift his third Oscar nomination.\n\nClift was notoriously picky with his projects.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Bosworth, p. ??</ref> According to Taylor (as quoted in [[Patricia Bosworth]]'s biography of Clift), \"Monty could've been the biggest star in the world if he did more movies.\" Clift reportedly turned down the starring role in ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', just as he had for ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.<ref>Capua, p. 92</ref>\n\n===Car crash===\nOn the evening of May 12, 1956, while filming ''[[Raintree County (film)|Raintree County]]'', Clift was involved in a serious car crash when he apparently fell asleep while driving and smashed his car into a telephone pole, minutes after leaving a dinner party at the [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] home of his close friend and co-star, [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and her husband, [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]]. Alerted by friend [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], who witnessed the collision, Taylor raced to Clift's side, pulling a tooth out of his tongue as he had begun to choke on it. He suffered a broken jaw and nose, a fractured sinus, and several facial lacerations which required plastic surgery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmgww.com/stars/clift/about/biography2.htm |title=Montgomery Clift Official Site |publisher=Cmgww.com |date=July 23, 1966 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528012814/http://www.cmgww.com/stars/clift/about/biography2.htm |archivedate=May 28, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In a filmed interview years later in 1963, he described his injuries in detail, including how his broken nose could be snapped back into place.\n\nAfter a two-month recovery, Clift returned to the set to finish the film. Despite the studio's concerns over profits, Clift correctly predicted the film would do well, if only because moviegoers would flock to see the difference in his facial appearance before and after the crash. Although the results of Clift's plastic surgeries were remarkable for the time, there were noticeable differences in his facial appearance, particularly the left side of his face, which was nearly immobile. The pain led him to rely on alcohol and pills for relief, as he had done after an earlier bout with [[dysentery]] left him with chronic intestinal problems. As a result, Clift's health and physical appearance would deteriorate until his death.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Montgomery clift from young lions trailer.JPG|thumb|Clift in the trailer for ''[[The Young Lions (film)|The Young Lions]]'' (1958)]]\n\nClift never physically or emotionally recovered from his car accident. His post-accident career has been referred to as the \"longest suicide in Hollywood history\" by acting teacher [[Robert Lewis (director)|Robert Lewis]] because of Clift's subsequent abuse of painkillers and alcohol.<ref>Clarke, Gerald. \"Books: Sunny Boy\". ''Time Magazine'' February 20, 1978.</ref> He began to behave erratically in public, which embarrassed his friends. Nevertheless, Clift continued to work over the next 10 years. His next three films were ''[[The Young Lions (film)|The Young Lions]]'' (1958), ''[[Lonelyhearts]]'' (1958), and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959). Clift next starred with [[Lee Remick]] in [[Elia Kazan]]'s ''[[Wild River (film)|Wild River]]'' released in 1960. He played a [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] agent sent to do the impossible task of convincing [[Jo Van Fleet]] to leave her land, and ends up marrying her widowed granddaughter, played by Lee Remick. In 1958, Clift turned down what became [[Dean Martin]]'s role as \"Dude\" in ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'', which would have reunited him with his co-stars from ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', [[John Wayne]] and [[Walter Brennan]], as well as with [[Howard Hawks]], the director of both films.\n\nClift then co-starred in [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961), which was the final film of both [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Clark Gable]]. Monroe, who was also having emotional and substance abuse problems at the time, described Clift in a 1961 interview as \"the only person I know who is in even worse shape than I am\".\n[[File:Judgment at Nuremberg-Montgomery Clift.JPG|thumb|Clift in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961)]]\nClift's last nomination for an Academy Award was for Best Supporting Actor for his role in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961), a 12-minute supporting part. He played a developmentally disabled man who had been a victim of the [[Nazi eugenics|Nazi sterilisation programme]] testifying at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. The film's director, [[Stanley Kramer]], later wrote in his memoirs that Clift \u2013 by this stage a wreck \u2013 struggled to remember his lines even for this one scene:\n\n:Finally, I said to him, \"Just forget the damn lines, Monty. Let's say you're on the witness stand. The prosecutor says something to you, then the defence attorney bitterly attacks you, and you have to reach for a word in the script. That's all right. Go ahead, and reach for it. Whatever the word may be, it doesn't really matter. Just turn to [[Spencer Tracy|[Spencer] Tracy]] on the bench whenever you feel the need, and ad lib something. It will be all right because it will convey the confusion in your character's mind.\" He seemed to calm down after this. He wasn't always close to the script, but whatever he said fitted in perfectly, and he came through with as good a performance as I had hoped.<ref>Kramer, et al., p. 193.</ref>\n\nBy the time Clift was making John Huston's ''[[Freud: The Secret Passion]]'' (1962), his self-destructive lifestyle and behaviour were affecting his health. [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] sued him for his frequent absences that caused the film to go over budget. The case was later settled out of court, but the damage to Clift's reputation as unreliable and troublesome endured. As a consequence, he was unable to find film work for four years. The film's success at the box office brought numerous awards for [[screenwriting]] and directing, but none for Clift himself. On January 13, 1963, a few weeks after the initial release of ''Freud'', Clift appeared on the live TV discussion programme ''The [[Hy Gardner]] Show'', where he spoke at length about the release of his current film, his film career, and treatment by the press. He also talked publicly for the first time about his 1956 car accident, the injuries he received, and its after-effects on his appearance. During the interview, Gardner jokingly mentioned that it is \"the first and last appearance on a television interview programme for Montgomery Clift\".\n\nBarred from feature films, Clift turned to voice work. Early in his career, Clift had participated in [[Old-time radio|radio]] broadcasts, though, according to one critic, he hated the medium.<ref name=\"Kass\">{{cite book|last1=Kass|first1=Judith M.|title=The Films of Montgomery Clift|date=1975|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=0806507179|page=34|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1250102.The_Films_of_Montgomery_Clift|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> On May 24, 1944, he was part of the cast of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' for ''The [[Theatre Guild]] on the Air''.<ref>[http://www.eoneill.com/artifacts/flash/awr0.5/awr0.5.htm Edoneill.com]</ref> In 1949, as part of the promotional campaign for the film ''[[The Heiress]]'', he played Heathcliff in the one-hour version of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' for ''Ford Theatre''.<ref>[https://archive.org/download/FordTheater/FT_49-04-01_ep65-Wuthering_Heights.mp3 Archive.org]</ref> In January 1951, he participated in the episode \"The Metal in the Moon\" for the series ''[[Cavalcade of America]]'', sponsored by the chemical company [[DuPont Company]]. Also in 1951, Clift was for the first time cast as Tom in the radio world premiere of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', with [[Helen Hayes]] (Amanda) and [[Karl Malden]] (the Gentleman Caller), for ''The Theatre Guild on the Air''.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/TheaterGuildontheAir Archive.org]</ref> In 1964, he recorded for Caedmon Records ''The Glass Menagerie'', with [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]], and [[David Wayne]]. In 1965, he gave voice to [[William Faulkner]]'s writings in the TV documentary ''William Faulkner's Mississippi'', which aired on April 1965.<ref>Lawrence, chapter 7</ref>\n\nAfter four years of failed attempts to secure a film part, finally, in 1966, thanks to Elizabeth Taylor's efforts on his behalf, he was signed on to star in ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (film)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]''. In preparation for the shooting of this film, he accepted the role of James Bower in the French [[Cold War]] thriller ''[[The Defector (film)|The Defector]]'', which was filmed in [[West Germany]] from February to April 1966. Clift died on July 23, 1966, before production on ''Reflections in a Golden Eye'' began.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:I Montgomery Clift House, NYC, NY, USA.jpg|thumb|upright|Montgomery Clift's former townhouse where he died (with green painted front door), located at 217 East 61st Street, Manhattan, New York City<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.com/2016/09/montgomery-clifts-pedigreed-upper-east-side-townhouse-could-be-yours/|title=Montgomery Clift's Pedigreed Upper East Side Townhouse Could Be Yours|website=Observer|date=September 9, 2016|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}</ref>]]\nOn July 22, 1966, Clift spent most of the hot summer day in his bedroom in his New York City townhouse, located at 217 East 61st Street. He and his private nurse, Lorenzo James, had not spoken much all day. Shortly before 1:00&nbsp;a.m., James went up to say goodnight to Clift, who was still awake and sitting up in his bed. James asked Clift if he needed anything, and Clift politely refused and then told James that he would stay up for a while, either to read a book or watch some television. James then noted that [[The Misfits (1961 film)|''The Misfits'']] was on television, and he asked Clift if he wanted to watch it with him. \"Absolutely ''not''!\", was the firm reply. This was the last time Montgomery Clift spoke to anyone. James went to his own bedroom to sleep, without saying another word to Clift. At 6:30&nbsp;a.m., James woke up and went to wake Clift, but found the bedroom door closed and locked. James became more concerned when Clift did not respond to his knocking on the door. Unable to break the door down, James ran down to the back garden and climbed up a ladder to enter through the second-floor bedroom window. Inside, he found Clift dead: He was undressed, lying in his half-filled bathtub, with eyeglasses on and both fists clenched by his side. James then used the bedroom telephone to call the police and an ambulance.\n\nClift's body was taken to the city morgue less than two miles away at 520 [[First Avenue (Manhattan)|First Avenue]], and autopsied. The autopsy report cited the cause of death as a heart attack brought on by \"occlusive coronary artery disease\". No evidence was found that suggested foul play or suicide. It is commonly believed that drug addiction was responsible for Clift's many health problems and his death. In addition to lingering effects of [[dysentery]] and chronic [[colitis]], an underactive [[thyroid]] was later revealed during the autopsy. The condition (among other things) lowers blood pressure; it may have caused Clift to appear drunk or drugged when he was sober,<ref>McCann, p. 68</ref> and also raises cholesterol, which may have contributed to his heart disease.\n\nFollowing a 15-minute funeral at [[St. James' Church, New York|St. James' Church]] attended by 150 guests, including [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Nancy Walker]], Clift was buried in the Friends [[Quaker]] Cemetery, [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]], [[Brooklyn]].<ref>Wilson, Scott.

After his car accident, and as his drug addiction became more serious, he was often impotent, and sex became less important to him. His deepest commitments were emotional, rather than sexual, anyway, and reserved for old friends; he was unflinchingly loyal to men like [[William LeMassena]] and women like Elizabeth Taylor, [[Libby Holman]], and Ann Lincoln.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Clift's brother, it was likely that Clift was [[gay]].<ref name=Petersen>{{cite web|last1=Petersen|first1=Anne Helen|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/09/scandals-of-classic-hollywood-montgomery-clift|title=Scandals of Classic Hollywood: The Long Suicide of Montgomery Clift|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=September 23, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref> Elizabeth Taylor was a significant figure in his life. He met her when she was supposed to be his date at the premiere for ''[[The Heiress]]''. They appeared together in ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'', where, in their romantic scenes, they received considerable acclaim for their naturalness and their appearance. Clift and Taylor appeared together again in ''[[Raintree County (film)|Raintree County]]'' and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]''. Clift and Taylor remained good friends until his death. In 2000, at the [[GLAAD Media Awards]], where Taylor was honored for her work for the [[LGBT]] community, she made the first public declaration by anyone of the fact that Clift was gay and called him her closest friend and confidant.<ref name=Kane>{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=Matt |url=http://www.glaad.org/2011/03/25/video-elizabeth-taylor-at-the-11th-annual-glaad-media-awards|title= Elizabeth Taylor at the 11th Annual GLAAD Media Awards|work=[[GLAAD]]|date=March 25, 2011|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBecause Clift was considered unemployable in the mid-1960s, Taylor put her salary for the film on the line as insurance, in order to have Clift cast as her co-star in ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (film)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Still, shooting kept being postponed, until Clift agreed to star in ''The Defector'' so as to prove himself fit for work. He insisted on performing his stunts himself, including swimming in the river [[Elbe]] in March. The schedule for ''Reflections in a Golden Eye'' was then set for August 1966, but Clift died before the movie was set to be shot. He was replaced by [[Marlon Brando]].\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! Title\n! Role\n! Director\n!

The song alludes to his car crash and drug abuse, as well as the movies ''A Place in the Sun'', ''Red River'', ''From Here to Eternity'', and ''The Misfits''. \"[[Monty Got a Raw Deal]]\" by rock band [[R.E.M.]] is also about him. The song \"Montgomery Clift\" by British band [[Random Hold]] concerns the legend that Clift enjoyed hanging from the window ledges of tall buildings.\n\nClift has been portrayed by [[Dave Franco]] in the film ''[[Zeroville (film)|Zeroville]]'', which was shot in 2015, but as of 2019, has not been released.<ref>[http://deadline.com/2015/09/james-franco-zeroville-alchemy-toronto-film-festival-1201522638/ Deadline.com]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of actors with Academy Award nominations]]\n* [[List of actors with two or more Academy Award nominations in acting categories]]\n* [[List of LGBT Academy Award winners and nominees]]\n{{Portal bar|Biography|Los Angeles|California|New York City|Film|Theatre}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bosworth, Patricia (1978).

His father, William Brooks \"Bill\" Clift (1886\u20131964), was the vice-president of Omaha National Trust Company.<ref>LaGuardia, p. 6</ref> His mother was Ethel Fogg \"Sunny\" Clift (''[[Given name|n\u00e9e]]'' Anderson; 1888\u20131988). They had married in 1914.<ref>LaGuardia, p. 5</ref> Clift had a twin sister, Ethel, who survived him by 48 years, and a brother, William Brooks Clift, Jr. (1919\u20131986), who had an illegitimate son with actress [[Kim Stanley]] and was later married to political reporter [[Eleanor Clift]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Krampner |first=Jon |title=Female Brando: The Legend of Kim Stanley |publisher=Back Stage Books |location=New York |year=2006 |page=78 |isbn=9780823088478 }}</ref> Clift had Dutch, English, and Scottish ancestry. His mother was an adopted child who, at the age of 18, had been told that her birth parents were members of prominent American families who were forced to part by the tyrannical will of the girl's mother. She spent the rest of her life trying to gain the recognition of her alleged relations.\n\nPart of Clift's mother's effort was her determination that her children should be brought up in the style of true aristocrats. Thus, as long as Clift's father was able to pay for it, he and his siblings were privately tutored, travelled extensively in America and Europe, became fluent in German and French, and led a protected life, sheltered from the destitution and communicable diseases which became legion following the First World War.<ref>Bosworth, chapters 1\u20134</ref> The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s ruined Clift's father financially. Unemployed and broke, he was forced to move his family to New York, but Clift's mother still persisted in her plans, and as her husband's situation improved, she was able to enrol Brooks at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and Ethel at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. Clift, however, could not adjust to school, and never went to college. Instead, he took to stage acting, beginning in a summer production, which led to his debut on Broadway by 1935.<ref>Bosworth, chapter 6</ref>\n\nIn the next 10 years, Clift built a successful stage career working with, among others, [[Dame May Whitty]], [[Alla Nazimova]], [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]], [[Fredric March]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Alfred Lunt]], and [[Lynn Fontanne]]. He appeared in plays written by [[Moss Hart]], [[Robert E. Sherwood|Robert Sherwood]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and [[Thornton Wilder]], creating the part of Henry in the original production of ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]''.<ref>Amy Lawrence, The Passion of Montgomery Clift, p. 13</ref>  In 1939, as a member of the cast of the 1939 Broadway production of [[No\u00ebl Coward]]'s ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', Clift participated in one of the very first [[television]] broadcasts in the United States. A performance of ''Hay Fever'' was broadcast by NBC's New York television station W2XBS (the forerunner of [[WNBC]]) and was aired during the [[1939 New York World's Fair|World's Fair]] as part of the introduction of television.<ref>Lawrence, p. 261</ref>\nHe resided in [[Jackson Heights, Queens]], until he got his break on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Clift first acted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at age 15, when he appeared as Prince Peter in the Cole Porter musical ''Jubilee'' at the Imperial Theater. At 20, he appeared in the Broadway production of ''[[There Shall Be No Night]]'', a work which won the 1941 [[Pulitzer Prize]].\n\nClift did not serve during [[World War II]], having been given [[Selective Service System#Classifications|4-F status]] after suffering [[dysentery]] in 1942.\n\n==Career==\n===Rise to stardom===\n[[File:A Place in the sun premiere.JPG|thumb|200px|Clift at the premiere of ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' (1951)]]\nAt the age of 25, Clift moved to [[Hollywood]]. His first movie role was opposite [[John Wayne]] in ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', which was shot in 1946 and released in 1948. His second movie was ''[[The Search]]'', which premiered in the same year. Clift was unhappy with the quality of the script, and reworked it himself. The movie was awarded a screenwriting [[Academy Award]] for the credited writers.<ref>[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1425955884390 Awards Database \u2013 Montgomery Clift] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402164342/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1425955884390 |date=April 2, 2015 }} January 2, 2016</ref> Clift's naturalistic performance led to director [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s being asked, \"Where did you find a soldier who can act so well?\", and he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. Clift signed on for his next movie, ''[[The Heiress]]'' (1949), in order to avoid being typecast. Clift was unhappy with the script, and unable to get along with most of the cast. He criticised co-star [[Olivia de Havilland]], saying that she let the director shape her entire performance and telling friends that he wanted to change de Havilland's lines because \"She isn't giving me enough to respond [to]\". The studio marketed Clift as a sex symbol prior to the movie's release in 1949. Clift had a large female following, and Olivia de Havilland was flooded with angry fan letters because her character rejects Clift's character in the final scene of the movie. Clift ended up unhappy with his performance, and left early during the film's premiere. Clift also starred in ''[[The Big Lift]]'' (1950), which was shot on location in Germany.\n\nClift's performance in ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' (1951) is regarded as one of his signature [[method acting]] performances. He worked extensively on his character, and was again nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. For his character's scenes in jail, Clift spent a night in a real state prison. He also refused to go along with director [[George Stevens]]' suggestion that he do \"something amazing\" on his character's walk to the electric chair. Instead, he walked to his death with a natural, depressed facial expression. His main acting rival (and fellow Omaha, Nebraska, native), Marlon Brando, was so moved by Clift's performance that he voted for Clift to win the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and was sure that he would win. That year, Clift voted for Brando in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' was critically acclaimed; [[Charlie Chaplin]] called it \"the greatest movie made about America\". The film received added media attention due to the rumours that Clift and co-star [[Elizabeth Taylor]] were dating in real life. They were billed as \"the most beautiful couple in Hollywood\". Many critics still call Clift and Taylor \"the most beautiful Hollywood movie couple of all time\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> After a break, Clift committed himself to three more films, all of which premiered during 1953: ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'', to be directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]; Vittorio De Sica's ''[[Terminal Station (film)|Terminal Station]]''; and Fred Zinnemann's ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', which earned Clift his third Oscar nomination.\n\nClift was notoriously picky with his projects.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Bosworth, p. ??</ref> According to Taylor (as quoted in [[Patricia Bosworth]]'s biography of Clift), \"Monty could've been the biggest star in the world if he did more movies.\" Clift reportedly turned down the starring role in ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', just as he had for ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.<ref>Capua, p. 92</ref>\n\n===Car crash===\nOn the evening of May 12, 1956, while filming ''[[Raintree County (film)|Raintree County]]'', Clift was involved in a serious car crash when he apparently fell asleep while driving and smashed his car into a telephone pole, minutes after leaving a dinner party at the [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] home of his close friend and co-star, [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and her husband, [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]]. Alerted by friend [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], who witnessed the collision, Taylor raced to Clift's side, pulling a tooth out of his tongue as he had begun to choke on it. He suffered a broken jaw and nose, a fractured sinus, and several facial lacerations which required plastic surgery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmgww.com/stars/clift/about/biography2.htm |title=Montgomery Clift Official Site |publisher=Cmgww.com |date=July 23, 1966 |accessdate=May 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528012814/http://www.cmgww.com/stars/clift/about/biography2.htm |archivedate=May 28, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In a filmed interview years later in 1963, he described his injuries in detail, including how his broken nose could be snapped back into place.\n\nAfter a two-month recovery, Clift returned to the set to finish the film. Despite the studio's concerns over profits, Clift correctly predicted the film would do well, if only because moviegoers would flock to see the difference in his facial appearance before and after the crash. Although the results of Clift's plastic surgeries were remarkable for the time, there were noticeable differences in his facial appearance, particularly the left side of his face, which was nearly immobile. The pain led him to rely on alcohol and pills for relief, as he had done after an earlier bout with [[dysentery]] left him with chronic intestinal problems. As a result, Clift's health and physical appearance would deteriorate until his death.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Montgomery clift from young lions trailer.JPG|thumb|Clift in the trailer for ''[[The Young Lions (film)|The Young Lions]]'' (1958)]]\n\nClift never physically or emotionally recovered from his car accident. His post-accident career has been referred to as the \"longest suicide in Hollywood history\" by acting teacher [[Robert Lewis (director)|Robert Lewis]] because of Clift's subsequent abuse of painkillers and alcohol.<ref>Clarke, Gerald. \"Books: Sunny Boy\". ''Time Magazine'' February 20, 1978.</ref> He began to behave erratically in public, which embarrassed his friends. Nevertheless, Clift continued to work over the next 10 years. His next three films were ''[[The Young Lions (film)|The Young Lions]]'' (1958), ''[[Lonelyhearts]]'' (1958), and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959). Clift next starred with [[Lee Remick]] in [[Elia Kazan]]'s ''[[Wild River (film)|Wild River]]'' released in 1960. He played a [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] agent sent to do the impossible task of convincing [[Jo Van Fleet]] to leave her land, and ends up marrying her widowed granddaughter, played by Lee Remick. In 1958, Clift turned down what became [[Dean Martin]]'s role as \"Dude\" in ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'', which would have reunited him with his co-stars from ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', [[John Wayne]] and [[Walter Brennan]], as well as with [[Howard Hawks]], the director of both films.\n\nClift then co-starred in [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961), which was the final film of both [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Clark Gable]]. Monroe, who was also having emotional and substance abuse problems at the time, described Clift in a 1961 interview as \"the only person I know who is in even worse shape than I am\".\n[[File:Judgment at Nuremberg-Montgomery Clift.JPG|thumb|Clift in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961)]]\nClift's last nomination for an Academy Award was for Best Supporting Actor for his role in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961), a 12-minute supporting part. He played a developmentally disabled man who had been a victim of the [[Nazi eugenics|Nazi sterilisation programme]] testifying at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. The film's director, [[Stanley Kramer]], later wrote in his memoirs that Clift \u2013 by this stage a wreck \u2013 struggled to remember his lines even for this one scene:\n\n:Finally, I said to him, \"Just forget the damn lines, Monty. Let's say you're on the witness stand. The prosecutor says something to you, then the defence attorney bitterly attacks you, and you have to reach for a word in the script. That's all right. Go ahead, and reach for it. Whatever the word may be, it doesn't really matter. Just turn to [[Spencer Tracy|[Spencer] Tracy]] on the bench whenever you feel the need, and ad lib something. It will be all right because it will convey the confusion in your character's mind.\" He seemed to calm down after this. He wasn't always close to the script, but whatever he said fitted in perfectly, and he came through with as good a performance as I had hoped.<ref>Kramer, et al., p. 193.</ref>\n\nBy the time Clift was making John Huston's ''[[Freud: The Secret Passion]]'' (1962), his self-destructive lifestyle and behaviour were affecting his health. [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] sued him for his frequent absences that caused the film to go over budget. The case was later settled out of court, but the damage to Clift's reputation as unreliable and troublesome endured. As a consequence, he was unable to find film work for four years. The film's success at the box office brought numerous awards for [[screenwriting]] and directing, but none for Clift himself. On January 13, 1963, a few weeks after the initial release of ''Freud'', Clift appeared on the live TV discussion programme ''The [[Hy Gardner]] Show'', where he spoke at length about the release of his current film, his film career, and treatment by the press. He also talked publicly for the first time about his 1956 car accident, the injuries he received, and its after-effects on his appearance. During the interview, Gardner jokingly mentioned that it is \"the first and last appearance on a television interview programme for Montgomery Clift\".\n\nBarred from feature films, Clift turned to voice work. Early in his career, Clift had participated in [[Old-time radio|radio]] broadcasts, though, according to one critic, he hated the medium.<ref name=\"Kass\">{{cite book|last1=Kass|first1=Judith M.|title=The Films of Montgomery Clift|date=1975|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=0806507179|page=34|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1250102.The_Films_of_Montgomery_Clift|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> On May 24, 1944, he was part of the cast of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' for ''The [[Theatre Guild]] on the Air''.<ref>[http://www.eoneill.com/artifacts/flash/awr0.5/awr0.5.htm Edoneill.com]</ref> In 1949, as part of the promotional campaign for the film ''[[The Heiress]]'', he played Heathcliff in the one-hour version of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' for ''Ford Theatre''.<ref>[https://archive.org/download/FordTheater/FT_49-04-01_ep65-Wuthering_Heights.mp3 Archive.org]</ref> In January 1951, he participated in the episode \"The Metal in the Moon\" for the series ''[[Cavalcade of America]]'', sponsored by the chemical company [[DuPont Company]]. Also in 1951, Clift was for the first time cast as Tom in the radio world premiere of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', with [[Helen Hayes]] (Amanda) and [[Karl Malden]] (the Gentleman Caller), for ''The Theatre Guild on the Air''.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/TheaterGuildontheAir Archive.org]</ref> In 1964, he recorded for Caedmon Records ''The Glass Menagerie'', with [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]], and [[David Wayne]]. In 1965, he gave voice to [[William Faulkner]]'s writings in the TV documentary ''William Faulkner's Mississippi'', which aired on April 1965.<ref>Lawrence, chapter 7</ref>\n\nAfter four years of failed attempts to secure a film part, finally, in 1966, thanks to Elizabeth Taylor's efforts on his behalf, he was signed on to star in ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (film)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]''. In preparation for the shooting of this film, he accepted the role of James Bower in the French [[Cold War]] thriller ''[[The Defector (film)|The Defector]]'', which was filmed in [[West Germany]] from February to April 1966. Clift died on July 23, 1966, before production on ''Reflections in a Golden Eye'' began.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:I Montgomery Clift House, NYC, NY, USA.jpg|thumb|upright|Montgomery Clift's former townhouse where he died (with green painted front door), located at 217 East 61st Street, Manhattan, New York City<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.com/2016/09/montgomery-clifts-pedigreed-upper-east-side-townhouse-could-be-yours/|title=Montgomery Clift's Pedigreed Upper East Side Townhouse Could Be Yours|website=Observer|date=September 9, 2016|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}</ref>]]\nOn July 22, 1966, Clift spent most of the hot summer day in his bedroom in his New York City townhouse, located at 217 East 61st Street. He and his private nurse, Lorenzo James, had not spoken much all day. Shortly before 1:00&nbsp;a.m., James went up to say goodnight to Clift, who was still awake and sitting up in his bed. James asked Clift if he needed anything, and Clift politely refused and then told James that he would stay up for a while, either to read a book or watch some television. James then noted that [[The Misfits (1961 film)|''The Misfits'']] was on television, and he asked Clift if he wanted to watch it with him. \"Absolutely ''not''!\", was the firm reply. This was the last time Montgomery Clift spoke to anyone. James went to his own bedroom to sleep, without saying another word to Clift. At 6:30&nbsp;a.m., James woke up and went to wake Clift, but found the bedroom door closed and locked. James became more concerned when Clift did not respond to his knocking on the door. Unable to break the door down, James ran down to the back garden and climbed up a ladder to enter through the second-floor bedroom window. Inside, he found Clift dead: He was undressed, lying in his half-filled bathtub, with eyeglasses on and both fists clenched by his side. James then used the bedroom telephone to call the police and an ambulance.\n\nClift's body was taken to the city morgue less than two miles away at 520 [[First Avenue (Manhattan)|First Avenue]], and autopsied. The autopsy report cited the cause of death as a heart attack brought on by \"occlusive coronary artery disease\". No evidence was found that suggested foul play or suicide. It is commonly believed that drug addiction was responsible for Clift's many health problems and his death. In addition to lingering effects of [[dysentery]] and chronic [[colitis]], an underactive [[thyroid]] was later revealed during the autopsy. The condition (among other things) lowers blood pressure; it may have caused Clift to appear drunk or drugged when he was sober,<ref>McCann, p. 68</ref> and also raises cholesterol, which may have contributed to his heart disease.\n\nFollowing a 15-minute funeral at [[St. James' Church, New York|St. James' Church]] attended by 150 guests, including [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Nancy Walker]], Clift was buried in the Friends [[Quaker]] Cemetery, [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]], [[Brooklyn]].<ref>Wilson, Scott.

After his car accident, and as his drug addiction became more serious, he was often impotent, and sex became less important to him. His deepest commitments were emotional, rather than sexual, anyway, and reserved for old friends; he was unflinchingly loyal to men like [[William LeMassena]] and women like Elizabeth Taylor, [[Libby Holman]], and Ann Lincoln.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Clift's brother, it was likely that Clift was [[gay]].<ref name=Petersen>{{cite web|last1=Petersen|first1=Anne Helen|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/09/scandals-of-classic-hollywood-montgomery-clift|title=Scandals of Classic Hollywood: The Long Suicide of Montgomery Clift|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=September 23, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref> Elizabeth Taylor was a significant figure in his life. He met her when she was supposed to be his date at the premiere for ''[[The Heiress]]''. They appeared together in ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'', where, in their romantic scenes, they received considerable acclaim for their naturalness and their appearance. Clift and Taylor appeared together again in ''[[Raintree County (film)|Raintree County]]'' and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]''. Clift and Taylor remained good friends until his death. In 2000, at the [[GLAAD Media Awards]], where Taylor was honored for her work for the [[LGBT]] community, she made the first public declaration by anyone of the fact that Clift was gay and called him her closest friend and confidant.<ref name=Kane>{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=Matt |url=http://www.glaad.org/2011/03/25/video-elizabeth-taylor-at-the-11th-annual-glaad-media-awards|title= Elizabeth Taylor at the 11th Annual GLAAD Media Awards|work=[[GLAAD]]|date=March 25, 2011|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBecause Clift was considered unemployable in the mid-1960s, Taylor put her salary for the film on the line as insurance, in order to have Clift cast as her co-star in ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (film)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Still, shooting kept being postponed, until Clift agreed to star in ''The Defector'' so as to prove himself fit for work. He insisted on performing his stunts himself, including swimming in the river [[Elbe]] in March. The schedule for ''Reflections in a Golden Eye'' was then set for August 1966, but Clift died before the movie was set to be shot. He was replaced by [[Marlon Brando]].\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! Title\n! Role\n! Director\n!

It was serialized in [[Shogakukan]]'s [[sh\u014dnen manga]] magazine ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'' from July 2013 to April 2017. It was collected into eighteen ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. An [[anime]] adaptation ran from October 6 to December 22, 2016. The series centers around the fictional women-only sport of keijo, where players stand on floating platforms and aim to incapacitate or push opponents into the water, using only breasts and buttocks.

Later, Guy Fernau, founder of the Haemochromatosis Society in the United Kingdom, related how, before his own material could be prepared, he only needed to scan the Canadian pamphlet and change the spelling.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nWarder was born Marie van Zyl in [[Ficksburg]], South Africa in 1927.  She married Tom Warder when she was 19 and he 21, upon his return from active service in [[World War II]], and later moved with him to Canada.  Tom was diagnosed with hemochromatosis in 1975, and their daughter was diagnosed with the same disorder in 1979. These two events spurred Warder to become an activist, raising awareness of this disorder within the medical community and the general public.\n\n=== Journalism career ===\nWarder's first editor was once heard to say that his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9e must have been  born with printer's ink in her veins for her journalistic \"career\" began at the age of nine when she won first prize in a province-wide essay competition launched by the administrator of what was then known as \"the Orange Free State\" in South Africa. The subject she  chose was \"The Natural Order of Lepidoptera\" and the prize was a Queen Victoria silver penny of the kind given to deserving poor people as  part of a religious ceremony held on the Thursday before Easter.\n\nIn February 1939, having already written a play, ''The Secret of the Kennels'' for the [[SABC]] children's program ''Young Ideas'' the previous year, Warder began writing stories for local newspapers, selling her first story to the ''[[Cape Argus]]'' at age 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=4441|title=WARDER, Marie|publisher=ABC Bookworld|accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2010}} In 1944, she had had two stories published in the British magazine ''[[Everybody's Weekly|Everybody's]]'' and later wrote for several South African periodicals.\n\nBy 17, she was also the chief reporter for the [[Germiston]] ''Advocate''. In this role, Warder was reportedly the youngest chief reporter in the world.<ref>''The Ficksburg News, 1946''</ref>  Warder had the chance to interview, among others, [[Pat Boone]],<ref>\"My shortest interview ever\", Amalgamated Press (SA) Ltd.

Later, Guy Fernau, founder of the Haemochromatosis Society in the United Kingdom, related how, before his own material could be prepared, he only needed to scan the Canadian pamphlet and change the spelling.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nWarder was born Marie van Zyl in [[Ficksburg]], South Africa in 1927.  She married Tom Warder when she was 19 and he 21, upon his return from active service in [[World War II]], and later moved with him to Canada.  Tom was diagnosed with hemochromatosis in 1975, and their daughter was diagnosed with the same disorder in 1979. These two events spurred Warder to become an activist, raising awareness of this disorder within the medical community and the general public.\n\n=== Journalism career ===\nWarder's first editor was once heard to say that his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9e must have been  born with printer's ink in her veins for her journalistic \"career\" began at the age of nine when she won first prize in a province-wide essay competition launched by the administrator of what was then known as \"the Orange Free State\" in South Africa. The subject she  chose was \"The Natural Order of Lepidoptera\" and the prize was a Queen Victoria silver penny of the kind given to deserving poor people as  part of a religious ceremony held on the Thursday before Easter.\n\nIn February 1939, having already written a play, ''The Secret of the Kennels'' for the [[SABC]] children's program ''Young Ideas'' the previous year, Warder began writing stories for local newspapers, selling her first story to the ''[[Cape Argus]]'' at age 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=4441|title=WARDER, Marie|publisher=ABC Bookworld|accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2010}} In 1944, she had had two stories published in the British magazine ''[[Everybody's Weekly|Everybody's]]'' and later wrote for several South African periodicals.\n\nBy 17, she was also the chief reporter for the [[Germiston]] ''Advocate''. In this role, Warder was reportedly the youngest chief reporter in the world.<ref>''The Ficksburg News, 1946''</ref>  Warder had the chance to interview, among others, [[Pat Boone]],<ref>\"My shortest interview ever\", Amalgamated Press (SA) Ltd.

During the winter of 1942, he played [[semi-professional]] ball. He served in the [[United States Navy]] from 1943 to 1945, and was stationed at [[Norman Naval Air Station]], where he taught physical fitness and played baseball. During that time, he married his high school sweetheart Dorothy and lived in Oklahoma.\n\nUpon his return in 1946, Bauman settled in with the [[Amarillo Gold Sox]] in the [[West Texas\u2013New Mexico League]]. He led the circuit with 48 home runs, 159 [[runs batted in]], and a .301 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]]. The following season, his home run totals went down, but his production went up. He hit just 38 homers, but he batted .350 and drew 151 [[base on balls|walks]], and was signed by the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]].\n\nIn 1948, Bauman played in the Braves organization, going 0 for 1 in [[Triple-A (baseball)|Class AAA]] with the [[Milwaukee Brewers (American Association)|Milwaukee Brewers]], and posting fair stats with the Class AA  [[Hartford Chiefs]] (.275, 55 BB, 10 HR in 276 AB), while splitting time with [[Ray Sanders]] . It was Bauman's only time outside of the low minors, and left it inconclusive as to whether he could play in the majors or not.\n\nThe Braves tried to send him to the [[Atlanta Crackers]] of the [[Southern Association]] but wanted to cut his salary. After four years in the U.S. Navy, Bauman was tired of taking orders and walked away.  \"I told them that I could make more money selling 24-inch shoestrings on any corner in Oklahoma City\", he said.

By 1951, the oil-boom economy and the team had begun to lag, though, and Bauman decided to move on.\n\nAt 30, Bauman joined up with the Class C [[Longhorn League]] for 1952, signing with the [[Artesia Drillers]]. During that year, his [[triple crown (baseball)|triple crown]] stats were .375-50-157, good enough to lead the league in homers, RBI, and walks (148). The next year, he led the league in walks (130), [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] (135), and home runs (53), while maintaining a high average. After the season, he moved to Roswell.\n\nThe [[Roswell Rockets]]' ballpark had a right field wall that was 329 feet from home. It was a prime target for Bauman, who was a left-handed pull hitter with an uppercut swing. In 1954, Bauman won the triple crown and also led the league in runs and walks for Roswell. In 138 games, he had 199 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in 498 at bats for a .400 average. He also drove in 228 runs and walked 150 times.

The following season, he played just 52 games and hit 17 homers. He retired in 1956 at age 34.
