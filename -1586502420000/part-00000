His two best friends are Big Bang and Horace. Big Bang is more of a kid [[scientist]], who is always creating new gadgets for Kid to try out. He is very intelligent for his age. Horace is more naive compared to the other two, and has a very bizarre appetite. He's always very supportive of Kid and looks up to him.

He is a third-grade student at Lakewood Elementary School. Arthur's family includes two home-working parents, his father David (a chef) and his mother Jane (an accountant), his two younger sisters, [[List of Arthur characters#D.W. Read|Dora Winifred (D.W.)]], who is in preschool, and Kate, who is still an infant, and his dog Pal. Arthur also has several friends who come from various ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, and he also occasionally meets with members of his extended family.\n\nElwood City is portrayed as a largely suburban area which bears a strong resemblance to the [[Greater Boston|Boston area]]; the TV series is partially produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]. Furthermore, Elwood City's professional baseball team, the \"Elwood City [[Grebe]]s\", appears to be a fictional representation of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The episode \"The Curse of the Grebes\" in Season 10 clearly references baseball lore such as [[Curse of the Bambino]]. The same episode also refers indirectly to the [[Yankees \u2013 Red Sox rivalry|rivalry between the Red Sox and the New York Yankees]], as the Grebes have a fierce rivalry with the Crown City Kings during the World Championship, the show's version of the [[World Series]]. Crown City, as featured in other episodes, is apparently a fictional representation of New York City. In one episode, it is implied that an ice hockey team wearing the WGBH logo and the [[Boston Bruins]]' team colors on their uniforms are Elwood City's professional (possibly [[National Hockey League|NHL]]) hockey team.\n\nThere are also firm references to Brown's hometown of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]. Most notably, the local shopping mall in the TV series is called \"Mill Creek Mall,\" a reference to [[Millcreek Mall]]. Brown himself stated that the series is influenced by his upbringing as a child in Erie, and specifically noted that Mr. Ratburn is based on a middle-school algebra teacher he had at Westlake Middle School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goerie.com/article/20160417/NEWS02/304179902/millcreek-native-marc-brown-on-aardvarks-and-art|title=Millcreek native Marc Brown on aardvarks and art|author=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827183108/http://www.goerie.com/article/20160417/NEWS02/304179902/millcreek-native-marc-brown-on-aardvarks-and-art|archive-date=27 August 2016|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nIn 1994, [[Marc Brown (author)|Marc Brown]] was approached by WGBH and PBS about the possibility of adapting the ''Arthur'' books into a television series. Brown was reluctant at first to become a part of a medium for which he had little respect, but soon agreed when he learned that the objective of the television series would be to use the powerful medium of television to promote children to reading books.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAlthough the program is primarily written and produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] of [[Boston]], the production of the animation and voice acting are done in [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[South Korea]], and Hong Kong. The animation of the show was done at [[AKOM|AKOM Production Company]] from season 1 to 11, then at Animation Services (HK) Ltd from season 12 to 15. The entire cast of ''Arthur'' lives in Montreal or Toronto, where Cookie Jar Entertainment's studios are located. The only segments of the show that are filmed outside Canada are the \"A Word from Us Kids\" interstitials, filmed at elementary schools or other educational sites in the [[Greater Boston|Boston area]]. Beginning in Season 11, the \"A Word From Us Kids\" segment was replaced by a segment called \"Postcards from You\", where live action videos sent in by young viewers were spotlighted per episode, and then replaced with \"A Word from Us Kids\" in season 12. The segments are omitted from all airings outside the US.\n\nMarc Brown's children, Tolon, Eliza, and Tucker, are referenced in the show many times, just as they are in the ''Arthur'' book series. For example, the town's moving company is called \"Tolon Moving\", and everyday items such as cups or pencil sharpeners have the word \"Eliza\" printed on them. References to Cookie Jar Entertainment and WGBH also appear often on the show. In one episode, Francine and Buster are shown playing a [[table hockey games|table hockey]] game in which one team's players wear shirts in the [[Montreal Canadiens]]' signature colours with Montreal-based Cinar's logo on them (Cinar was the predecessor to today's Cookie Jar Entertainment) and the other team's players wear shirts in the [[Boston Bruins]]' colors with Boston-based WGBH's sting logo on them. Subsequent episodes that involve hockey also depict players wearing these sweater designs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Also, in the episode \"The Big Blow-Up\" in Season 2, a racecar driver wears a jersey with \"Cinar\" written on it and a car with \"WGBH\" written on it. In the episode \"Prove It\" in Season 4, Brain introduces D.W. to science while watching a non-animated episode of ''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]'', a science series also produced by WGBH. Brown's son Tolon, for whom Brown first invented the character of Arthur the Aardvark in a bedtime story, is the executive director of the show.<ref>{{cite news|last=Churnin|first=Nancy|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419133257/http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/columnists/nancy-churnin/20120412-arthur-creator-marc-brown-brings-his-new-work-to-the-dmas-booksmart.ece|title=Arthur creator Marc Brown brings his new work to the DMA's BooksmArt|date=April 12, 2012|work=Dallas News|accessdate=October 30, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1999, [[Cookie Jar Group#Scandal|Cinar was investigated for tax fraud]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilmer|first=David|url=http://www.awn.com/news/business/cinar-investigated-tax-fraud|title=Cinar investigated for tax fraud|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref> It was revealed that both the chairman Micheline Charest and president Ronald Weinberg invested $122 million (US) into Bahamian bank accounts without the board members' approval. Cinar had also paid American screenwriters for work while continuing to accept Canadian federal grants for content. However, ''Arthur'' itself was not involved in the scandal as it was publicly known to be co-produced with an American company. Head writers Joe Fallon and Ken Scarborough left around that time, but not because of the scandal; Fallon left about a year before the investigation began.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elwoodcitycentral.createaforum.com/new-board/joe-fallon/msg746/#msg746|title=Re: Joe Fallon - Reply #8|last1=Bailey|first1=Greg|date=January 13, 2013|website=Elwood City Central Forum|publisher=Create A Forum|access-date=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn season 12, the series began producing and airing episodes in 1080i HD. However, until January 2013 in the U.S., the episodes still aired in 4:3 aspect ratio, with the left and right sides cropped out. They have since begun airing in 16:9 in January 2013. Season 12 also marks the switching of animation studios from ''AKOM'' to ''ASHK''. Starting with season 16, the series was produced by 9 Story Entertainment (now [[9 Story Media Group]]) and airs in 16:9 aspect ratio. Along with this change, 9 Story produced a re-mastered opening theme for the series in 16:9, and animation was moved in-house using [[Adobe Flash]]. Season 19 was the last season to be produced by 9 Story, with Montreal based-Oasis Animation taking over starting in season 20.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/oasis-animation-tapped-new-seasons-arthur|title=Oasis Animation Tapped for New Seasons of 'Arthur'|date=September 29, 2015|website=Animation World Network|publisher=Animation World Network|access-date=January 9, 2016}}</ref> In November 2018, [[Bruce Dinsmore]] revealed that he has finished recording his final episodes in advance.<ref>[https://twitter.com/brucedinsmore/status/1063447470317944833]</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe TV series' reggae-style theme song, \"Believe in Yourself\", was written by Judy Henderson and Jerry de Villiers Jr. and was performed by [[Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers]]. A remixed techno version of the song has been officially released on the [[Arthur TV soundtracks#Arthur's Really Rockin' Music Mix|third album]] and a shortened version has been played during the closing credits for the sixth season. The [[Backstreet Boys]] covered the song with the original instrumentals for the ending credits of television special ''Arthur: It's Only Rock 'n' Roll''.\n\nThe original music [[film score|score]] was produced by Ray Fabi.\n\nIn season 2, the song \"Crazy Bus\", written and performed by then-head writer Joe Fallon, was introduced. It served as the alternate anthem of the television series. Cellist [[Yo-Yo Ma]] and jazz composer [[Joshua Redman]] covered the song on the ending credits of the season 4 finale episode, \"[[Arthur (season 4)#ep75|My Music Rules]]\". When Joe Fallon left Arthur after season 4, the song was officially retired from the show. The show alludes to this on the television special ''Arthur: It's Only Rock 'n' Roll'' when D.W. says, \"Crazy Bus is for babies; I know a million better songs.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Guest stars===\nMany celebrity guest stars have appeared on the show, each providing the voice for their anthropomorphic animal counterpart, excluding [[Joan Rivers]], who played as Francine's maternal grandmother. [[Lance Armstrong]] and Joan Rivers are the only guest stars to make more than one appearance on the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/hnigatu/17-famous-people-who-guest-starred-on-arthur|title=17 Famous People Who Guest Starred on Arthur|work=[[Buzzfeed]]|author=Heben Nigatu|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Characters===\n[[File:Arthur characters on couch.jpg|thumb|225px|(Clockwise from upper left): Brain, Binky, Sue Ellen, Francine, Muffy, Buster, Prunella, George, [[Arthur Read|Arthur]], Baby Kate.]]\n{{Main|List of Arthur characters}}\nArthur's immediate family is the focus of the series, with most episodes involving Arthur, his younger sister D.W., their parents David and Jane, Baby Kate, and their dog, Pal. Arthur's closest friends include Buster, Francine, Muffy, Binky, and Brain, along with Sue Ellen, Fern, and George as frequent supporting characters.\n\nThe adults in ''Arthur'' play important roles: Mr. and Mrs. Read display a significant amount of stress from parenting, Arthur's friends' parents are shown struggling in middle-class jobs, and Mr. Ratburn endures the demands and expectations of teaching elementary school. Even in difficult, adult situations, these grown ups maintain a cheerful attitude. Arthur, D.W., and Kate also visit their paternal grandmother, Thora Read, and maternal grandfather, Grandpa Dave.\n\n===Voice cast===\nUnlike most animated television series, ''Arthur'' showcases a wide range of voice actors. While a majority of characters such as Jane, David, Buster, Francine and Binky have been voiced by certain voice actors that have voiced them since the beginning of the series, Arthur, D.W., Brain, the Tibble Twins, and James have each had several different actors throughout the seasons due to the producers employing [[Puberty#Voice change|young males]] for these parts. The resulting effects of voice changes have been particularly criticized by viewers.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* ''[[Arthur Read|Arthur]]''\n** [[Michael Yarmush]] (Seasons 1\u20135)\n** [[Justin Bradley]] (Season 6)\n** [[Mark Rendall]] (Seasons 7\u20138, [[Arthur (season 6)#Voice Cast|season 6 redub]])\n** [[Cameron Ansell]] (Seasons 9\u201311)\n** [[Dallas Jokic]] (Seasons 12\u201315)\n** Drew Adkins (Seasons 16\u201317)\n** [[William Healy (actor)|William Healy]] (Seasons 18\u201319)\n** Jacob Ursomarzo (Seasons 20-21)\n** Roman Lutterotti (Season 22\u2013present)\n* ''[[List of Arthur characters#D.W.

Episodes usually consist of two completely self-contained 11-minute stories. The episodes usually start off with one of the characters (usually Arthur) speaking towards the audience about a situation within the story followed by the title card. The episodes are separated by a one-to-two-minute live action [[interstitial program|interstitial]] called \"And Now a Word from Us Kids\" (or, in some cases, a variation of that title more specific to its contents). The live action segments almost always feature children from elementary schools (generally in the [[Greater Boston|Boston area]]) presenting subjects they are currently learning about or projects they have been working on in their classes (the subjects covered here relate to the first cartoon segment in the half-hour). This segment is seen exclusively on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] telecasts of the show, filling space otherwise used for commercials, which are generally forbidden on PBS. There is also a segment that sometimes appears at the end of the second 11-minute episode called \"And Now a Word from Marc Brown\" where he shows the viewers how to draw various main characters from the show. In 2007, the show began encouraging viewers to send in \"video postcards\" (similar to those used in the spin-off show ''[[Postcards from Buster]]''), which were shown in the interstitials of episodes until the middle of Season 12. Beginning with Episode 151, the show reverted \"And Now a Word from Us Kids\".\n\nSet in a realistic environment (as opposed to the more fantastical settings prominently featured in children's programming), certain stories (often in the second half of the episode) may not necessarily focus on the titular protagonist's point of view and may instead detail the experiences and viewpoints of surrounding characters, usually Arthur's schoolmates. Often such episodes will depict those characters handling situations often faced by children in actuality as a means of guiding audiences through those situations, including [[bed-wetting]], [[asthma]], or [[dyslexia]], and Arthur's character sometimes may see a reduced role (in some episodes, Arthur himself does not appear in the story at all). Stories in later seasons dealt with more serious issues or subjects, such as cancer, [[autism spectrum disorder]], or [[same-sex marriage]], although numerous episodes simply address topics including childhood fears, trends, or fantasies. Occasionally, some episodes might offer very little educational value at all. In spite of the realistically designed environment, the series may showcase the fantasies or daydreams of a few characters on a number of occasions, and a few episodes feature supernatural elements such as ghosts or secret situations unknown to other characters such as Kate and Pal's friendship.\n\nIn May 2019, [[Alabama Public Television]] withheld the airing of \"Mr. Ratburn and the Special Someone\", where Arthur's teacher, Mr. Ratburn, married another man named Patrick. The station had also declined to broadcast a 2005 episode of the spin-off show, ''Postcards from Buster'', where a friend had two mothers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/watch-banned-arthur-episode-with-gay-rat-wedding.html|title=Watch banned \u2018Arthur\u2019 episode with gay rat wedding|last=Gore|first=Leada|work=[[The Birmingham News]]|date=May 23, 2019|accessdate=May 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Franchise==\n\n===Television===\nIn addition to the television series, the ''Arthur'' franchise has spawned three hour-long movies, which are often run on PBS during [[pledge drive]]s. The latest, ''Arthur's Missing Pal'', was produced by [[Mainframe Entertainment]] and is the first animated ''Arthur'' project to make use of [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060209142912/http://www.mainframe.ca/news/articles/media/150805M0.pdf http://www.mainframe.ca/news/articles/media/150805M0.pdf]</ref> ''Arthur''{{'}}s success has also led to the spin-off series ''[[Postcards from Buster]]''. ''Postcards from Buster'' premiered on October 11, 2004 with several returning characters, and aired its final three episodes in 2012.\n\n===Website===\nThe program's official website has been given a rating of 5/5 stars at website ''Common Sense Media'', and has been advised for viewers 5 and up. The site described the show as being \"one of the Internet's best offerings for kids\". It also advised that \"there are links to PBS sponsors but other than that, there is no commercial marketing to kids.\" The review added, \"The games are actually teaching your kids something for example ''The Music Box'' combines music and learning, so much so that kids won't even realize that they're figuring out space relations, hand\u2013eye coordination, and mousing skills as they jam along to upbeat tunes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/website-reviews/arthur.html|title=Arthur|accessdate=January 2, 2011|publisher=common sense media}}</ref>\n\n===Music albums===\n{{Main|Arthur TV soundtracks}}\n\n''Arthur'' has released three music albums. The first album, ''Arthur and Friends: The First Almost Real Not Live CD'', contained songs that were played throughout the TV series and original songs for the album. The second album, ''Arthur's Perfect Christmas'', contained songs that were played during the television movie of the same title. The third album, ''Arthur's Really Rockin' Music Mix'', contained only original songs, including a remix of the theme song which was played on the credits of season 6 as a promotion for the album.\n\n===ActiMates===\nIn 1998, both Arthur and D.W. were made into [[Microsoft]] [[ActiMates]], sophisticated toy dolls who could interact with children, with each other, with certain computer software and the ''Arthur'' website, and also with the ''Arthur'' television show and videos.\n\nMicrosoft discontinued the ActiMates line shortly before season 5 aired, most possibly due to a lawsuit pertaining to patent infringement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/pbskidvid/message/3056|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715181948/http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/pbskidvid/message/3056|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-15|title=PBS Kids}}</ref> and the fact that sales were dropping. It has been noted{{According to whom|date=April 2016}} that post-season 4 episodes of ''Arthur'' have not included any ActiMates code. Newer videos and DVD releases of the show does not carry ActiMates code either. The enhancements on the website were removed when the site was redesigned in 2002 and thus the ActiMates would no longer interact with the website. Likewise, re-releases of the ActiMates software by Creative Wonders do not interact with the ActiMates because the library that controls the PC Pack has been replaced with a dummy library file.\n\n===Video games===\n{{main|Arthur video games}}\n\n===Home media releases===\nSelected episodes were distributed on VHS and DVD by Random House. Each tape had two or three episodes dealing with similar subjects. WGBH Home Video also released two Region 1 ''Arthur'' season sets; they released Season 10 on March 25, 2008 and Season 11 was released on September 2, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Arthur-Season-11/7857|title=Arthur - Season 11 DVD Information &#124; TVShowsonDVD.com|accessdate=August 27, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827035537/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Arthur-Season-11/7857|archivedate=August 27, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Seasons 10\u201319 are available to download on the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Amazon.com]].

For example, children may be shown excluding and ostracizing friends or peers on the playground as part of the TV show.\" (p.622).<ref>Ostrov, Jamie M., Douglas A. Gentile, and Nicki R. Crick. 2006. \"Media Exposure, Aggression and Prosocial Behavior During Early Childhood: A Longitudinal Study.\" ''Social Development'' 15(4) :612-627.</ref> They go on to theorize that preschoolers, due to their developmental stage, may have a hard time fully understanding conflict resolution, which typically occurs at the very end of a show. Shows like ''Arthur'' typically spend most of their time building up conflicts and this may impact the type of learning that is occurring while watching shows. Moreover, they cite research suggesting that the impacts of modeling relational aggression may be especially strong for girls. This research was elaborated on in the New York Times best-selling book on parenting ''NurtureShock: New Thinking About Children'' by Bronson and Merryman (2009).<ref>Bronson, Po and Ashley Merryman. 2009. ''NurtureShock: New Thinking About Children''. New York: Twelve/ Hachette Book Group. </ref> Their punch line is: \"Essentially, Ostrov had just found that ''Arthur'' is more dangerous for children than ''Power Rangers''\" (p.181).\n\nA review at ''MommyPR'' concluded by saying \"My boys were able to preview \"The Wheel Deal\", \"The Buster Report\", \"Falafelosophy\" and \"The Great Lint Rush\". As soon as my boys were finished with these episodses (sic) they begged to watch them again!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mommypr.com/index.php/2010/10/arthur-premieres-season-14-on-pbs-kids-go-review/|title=ARTHUR Premieres Season 14 on PBS KIDS GO!Review|author=M, Andrea|first=|date=August 4, 2010|website=|publisher=MommyPR|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714111557/http://www.mommypr.com/2010/10/arthur-premieres-season-14-on-pbs-kids-go-review/|archive-date=14 July 2011|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''Dad of Divas' Reviews'' explained that Executive Producer Jacqui Deegan said of the 14th season: <blockquote>This season, we're hoping to empower our young viewers to go after their goals and dreams. Whether that means becoming a wheelchair basketball champion, or expressing yourself through writing, drawing, and making movies, Arthur and his friends show kids that determination and hard work really pay off. Both Lydia and Neil serve as great role models, and we're excited to have them to reinforce these important lessons for our audiences.<ref name=\"DOD\">{{cite web|url=http://dadofdivas-reviews.blogspot.com/2010/09/arthur-premieres-season-14-on-pbs-kids.html|title=ARTHUR Premieres Season 14 on PBS KIDS GO!|accessdate=January 2, 2011|author=Dad of Divas|date=September 15, 2010|publisher=Dad of Divas' Review}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAbout.com gave the show a rating of 4.5 stars. The series described ''Arthur'''s assets: <blockquote>The ''Arthur'' series has won several awards including the George Foster Peabody, and for good reason. ''Arthur'' presents issues and situations kids can relate to, and teaches positive behaviors and responses to these issues in a genuine and comical way. The series is fun and engaging to the target age group. Kids will relate to the storylines and characters, and will therefore give thought to the responses the characters demonstrate and outcome of those responses. Because \"Arthur\" presents real childhood issues, the show contains some imitative behavior such as name calling or bickering, much like children experience in their own lives. Kids might hear words like \"sissy\" or \"stupid\" and see Arthur and D.W. argue. Should children mimic some of these phrases or tactics, the show provides a good springboard for parents to talk about the issues with their children and point out the importance of considering others' feelings.</blockquote> The review continued by citing many ways in which children could extract more from the series, for example by encouraging kids to write stories based on their own families (in much the same way ''Arthur'' was first realised) or by Kim Brown, Marc Brown's sister, teaching kids to draw Arthur while on tour.<ref>{{cite

Accessed October 28, 2017.</ref> created by [[Cookie Jar Group]] (formerly known as Cinar) and [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] for [[PBS]]. The show is set in the fictional American city of Elwood City, and revolves around the lives of eight-year-old [[Arthur Read]], an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[aardvark]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/arthur/parentsteachers/program/prog_summary.html|title=PBS Kids web site}}</ref> his friends and family, and their daily interactions with each other.\n\nThe television series is based on the ''Arthur Adventure'' book series, written and illustrated by [[Marc Brown (author)|Marc Brown]]. [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] along with Cinar (now Cookie Jar Group) began production of the animated series in 1994, and aired its first episode on October 7, 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/arthur/tv.html |title=Arthur on TV|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961225213502/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/arthur/tv.html |archivedate=December 25, 1996|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref> Since its debut, the show has broadcast [[List of Arthur episodes|246 half hour episodes]].\n\nA pilot for the spin-off series ''[[Postcards from Buster]]'' aired in December 2003 as a [[List of Arthur episodes (season 8)#ep111|season 8 episode]] of ''Arthur''. ''Postcards from Buster'' aired from October 11, 2004, to November 21, 2008; the series faced several years of hiatus, until a brief revival in February 2012, only to be cancelled after airing three unseen episodes that had been held over from the show's third season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426774/|title=Postcards from Buster|author=|date=October 11, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=August 12, 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n''Arthur'' often deals with important issues families face such as [[asthma]], [[dyslexia]], [[cancer]], [[diabetes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jdrfdallas.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/diabetes-awareness-on-pbs-show-arthur/|title=Diabetes Awareness on PBS Show ARTHUR|author=|date=May 25, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> and [[autism spectrum disorder]]. It also encourages reading and relationships with family and friends by explaining that people have different personalities and interests.\n\n''Arthur'' became one of the highest-rated shows on PBS Kids for several years since its debut, averaging almost 10 million viewers weekly in the U.S. It is aired in a total of 83 countries, including on: PBS in the United States; [[T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada|Radio-Canada]], [[Knowledge Network]], [[TVOntario]], and [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada; several [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] channels in Australia; and [[BBC One]]/[[CBBC]] in the UK.

He is a third-grade student at Lakewood Elementary School. Arthur's family includes two home-working parents, his father David (a chef) and his mother Jane (an accountant), his two younger sisters, [[List of Arthur characters#D.W. Read|Dora Winifred (D.W.)]], who is in preschool, and Kate, who is still an infant, and his dog Pal. Arthur also has several friends who come from various ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, and he also occasionally meets with members of his extended family.\n\nElwood City is portrayed as a largely suburban area which bears a strong resemblance to the [[Greater Boston|Boston area]]; the TV series is partially produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]. Furthermore, Elwood City's professional baseball team, the \"Elwood City [[Grebe]]s\", appears to be a fictional representation of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The episode \"The Curse of the Grebes\" in Season 10 clearly references baseball lore such as [[Curse of the Bambino]]. The same episode also refers indirectly to the [[Yankees \u2013 Red Sox rivalry|rivalry between the Red Sox and the New York Yankees]], as the Grebes have a fierce rivalry with the Crown City Kings during the World Championship, the show's version of the [[World Series]]. Crown City, as featured in other episodes, is apparently a fictional representation of New York City. In one episode, it is implied that an ice hockey team wearing the WGBH logo and the [[Boston Bruins]]' team colors on their uniforms are Elwood City's professional (possibly [[National Hockey League|NHL]]) hockey team.\n\nThere are also firm references to Brown's hometown of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]. Most notably, the local shopping mall in the TV series is called \"Mill Creek Mall,\" a reference to [[Millcreek Mall]]. Brown himself stated that the series is influenced by his upbringing as a child in Erie, and specifically noted that Mr. Ratburn is based on a middle-school algebra teacher he had at Westlake Middle School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goerie.com/article/20160417/NEWS02/304179902/millcreek-native-marc-brown-on-aardvarks-and-art|title=Millcreek native Marc Brown on aardvarks and art|author=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827183108/http://www.goerie.com/article/20160417/NEWS02/304179902/millcreek-native-marc-brown-on-aardvarks-and-art|archive-date=27 August 2016|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nIn 1994, [[Marc Brown (author)|Marc Brown]] was approached by WGBH and PBS about the possibility of adapting the ''Arthur'' books into a television series. Brown was reluctant at first to become a part of a medium for which he had little respect, but soon agreed when he learned that the objective of the television series would be to use the powerful medium of television to promote children to reading books.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAlthough the program is primarily written and produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] of [[Boston]], the production of the animation and voice acting are done in [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[South Korea]], and Hong Kong. The animation of the show was done at [[AKOM|AKOM Production Company]] from season 1 to 11, then at Animation Services (HK) Ltd from season 12 to 15. The entire cast of ''Arthur'' lives in Montreal or Toronto, where Cookie Jar Entertainment's studios are located. The only segments of the show that are filmed outside Canada are the \"A Word from Us Kids\" interstitials, filmed at elementary schools or other educational sites in the [[Greater Boston|Boston area]]. Beginning in Season 11, the \"A Word From Us Kids\" segment was replaced by a segment called \"Postcards from You\", where live action videos sent in by young viewers were spotlighted per episode, and then replaced with \"A Word from Us Kids\" in season 12. The segments are omitted from all airings outside the US.\n\nMarc Brown's children, Tolon, Eliza, and Tucker, are referenced in the show many times, just as they are in the ''Arthur'' book series. For example, the town's moving company is called \"Tolon Moving\", and everyday items such as cups or pencil sharpeners have the word \"Eliza\" printed on them. References to Cookie Jar Entertainment and WGBH also appear often on the show. In one episode, Francine and Buster are shown playing a [[table hockey games|table hockey]] game in which one team's players wear shirts in the [[Montreal Canadiens]]' signature colours with Montreal-based Cinar's logo on them (Cinar was the predecessor to today's Cookie Jar Entertainment) and the other team's players wear shirts in the [[Boston Bruins]]' colors with Boston-based WGBH's sting logo on them. Subsequent episodes that involve hockey also depict players wearing these sweater designs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Also, in the episode \"The Big Blow-Up\" in Season 2, a racecar driver wears a jersey with \"Cinar\" written on it and a car with \"WGBH\" written on it. In the episode \"Prove It\" in Season 4, Brain introduces D.W. to science while watching a non-animated episode of ''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]'', a science series also produced by WGBH. Brown's son Tolon, for whom Brown first invented the character of Arthur the Aardvark in a bedtime story, is the executive director of the show.<ref>{{cite news|last=Churnin|first=Nancy|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419133257/http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/columnists/nancy-churnin/20120412-arthur-creator-marc-brown-brings-his-new-work-to-the-dmas-booksmart.ece|title=Arthur creator Marc Brown brings his new work to the DMA's BooksmArt|date=April 12, 2012|work=Dallas News|accessdate=October 30, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1999, [[Cookie Jar Group#Scandal|Cinar was investigated for tax fraud]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilmer|first=David|url=http://www.awn.com/news/business/cinar-investigated-tax-fraud|title=Cinar investigated for tax fraud|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref> It was revealed that both the chairman Micheline Charest and president Ronald Weinberg invested $122 million (US) into Bahamian bank accounts without the board members' approval. Cinar had also paid American screenwriters for work while continuing to accept Canadian federal grants for content. However, ''Arthur'' itself was not involved in the scandal as it was publicly known to be co-produced with an American company. Head writers Joe Fallon and Ken Scarborough left around that time, but not because of the scandal; Fallon left about a year before the investigation began.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elwoodcitycentral.createaforum.com/new-board/joe-fallon/msg746/#msg746|title=Re: Joe Fallon - Reply #8|last1=Bailey|first1=Greg|date=January 13, 2013|website=Elwood City Central Forum|publisher=Create A Forum|access-date=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn season 12, the series began producing and airing episodes in 1080i HD. However, until January 2013 in the U.S., the episodes still aired in 4:3 aspect ratio, with the left and right sides cropped out. They have since begun airing in 16:9 in January 2013. Season 12 also marks the switching of animation studios from ''AKOM'' to ''ASHK''. Starting with season 16, the series was produced by 9 Story Entertainment (now [[9 Story Media Group]]) and airs in 16:9 aspect ratio. Along with this change, 9 Story produced a re-mastered opening theme for the series in 16:9, and animation was moved in-house using [[Adobe Flash]]. Season 19 was the last season to be produced by 9 Story, with Montreal based-Oasis Animation taking over starting in season 20.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/oasis-animation-tapped-new-seasons-arthur|title=Oasis Animation Tapped for New Seasons of 'Arthur'|date=September 29, 2015|website=Animation World Network|publisher=Animation World Network|access-date=January 9, 2016}}</ref> In November 2018, [[Bruce Dinsmore]] revealed that he has finished recording his final episodes in advance.<ref>[https://twitter.com/brucedinsmore/status/1063447470317944833]</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe TV series' reggae-style theme song, \"Believe in Yourself\", was written by Judy Henderson and Jerry de Villiers Jr. and was performed by [[Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers]]. A remixed techno version of the song has been officially released on the [[Arthur TV soundtracks#Arthur's Really Rockin' Music Mix|third album]] and a shortened version has been played during the closing credits for the sixth season. The [[Backstreet Boys]] covered the song with the original instrumentals for the ending credits of television special ''Arthur: It's Only Rock 'n' Roll''.\n\nThe original music [[film score|score]] was produced by Ray Fabi.\n\nIn season 2, the song \"Crazy Bus\", written and performed by then-head writer Joe Fallon, was introduced. It served as the alternate anthem of the television series. Cellist [[Yo-Yo Ma]] and jazz composer [[Joshua Redman]] covered the song on the ending credits of the season 4 finale episode, \"[[Arthur (season 4)#ep75|My Music Rules]]\". When Joe Fallon left Arthur after season 4, the song was officially retired from the show. The show alludes to this on the television special ''Arthur: It's Only Rock 'n' Roll'' when D.W. says, \"Crazy Bus is for babies; I know a million better songs.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Guest stars===\nMany celebrity guest stars have appeared on the show, each providing the voice for their anthropomorphic animal counterpart, excluding [[Joan Rivers]], who played as Francine's maternal grandmother. [[Lance Armstrong]] and Joan Rivers are the only guest stars to make more than one appearance on the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/hnigatu/17-famous-people-who-guest-starred-on-arthur|title=17 Famous People Who Guest Starred on Arthur|work=[[Buzzfeed]]|author=Heben Nigatu|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Characters===\n[[File:Arthur characters on couch.jpg|thumb|225px|(Clockwise from upper left): Brain, Binky, Sue Ellen, Francine, Muffy, Buster, Prunella, George, [[Arthur Read|Arthur]], Baby Kate.]]\n{{Main|List of Arthur characters}}\nArthur's immediate family is the focus of the series, with most episodes involving Arthur, his younger sister D.W., their parents David and Jane, Baby Kate, and their dog, Pal. Arthur's closest friends include Buster, Francine, Muffy, Binky, and Brain, along with Sue Ellen, Fern, and George as frequent supporting characters.\n\nThe adults in ''Arthur'' play important roles: Mr. and Mrs. Read display a significant amount of stress from parenting, Arthur's friends' parents are shown struggling in middle-class jobs, and Mr. Ratburn endures the demands and expectations of teaching elementary school. Even in difficult, adult situations, these grown ups maintain a cheerful attitude. Arthur, D.W., and Kate also visit their paternal grandmother, Thora Read, and maternal grandfather, Grandpa Dave.\n\n===Voice cast===\nUnlike most animated television series, ''Arthur'' showcases a wide range of voice actors. While a majority of characters such as Jane, David, Buster, Francine and Binky have been voiced by certain voice actors that have voiced them since the beginning of the series, Arthur, D.W., Brain, the Tibble Twins, and James have each had several different actors throughout the seasons due to the producers employing [[Puberty#Voice change|young males]] for these parts. The resulting effects of voice changes have been particularly criticized by viewers.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* ''[[Arthur Read|Arthur]]''\n** [[Michael Yarmush]] (Seasons 1\u20135)\n** [[Justin Bradley]] (Season 6)\n** [[Mark Rendall]] (Seasons 7\u20138, [[Arthur (season 6)#Voice Cast|season 6 redub]])\n** [[Cameron Ansell]] (Seasons 9\u201311)\n** [[Dallas Jokic]] (Seasons 12\u201315)\n** Drew Adkins (Seasons 16\u201317)\n** [[William Healy (actor)|William Healy]] (Seasons 18\u201319)\n** Jacob Ursomarzo (Seasons 20-21)\n** Roman Lutterotti (Season 22\u2013present)\n* ''[[List of Arthur characters#D.W.

Episodes usually consist of two completely self-contained 11-minute stories. The episodes usually start off with one of the characters (usually Arthur) speaking towards the audience about a situation within the story followed by the title card. The episodes are separated by a one-to-two-minute live action [[interstitial program|interstitial]] called \"And Now a Word from Us Kids\" (or, in some cases, a variation of that title more specific to its contents). The live action segments almost always feature children from elementary schools (generally in the [[Greater Boston|Boston area]]) presenting subjects they are currently learning about or projects they have been working on in their classes (the subjects covered here relate to the first cartoon segment in the half-hour). This segment is seen exclusively on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] telecasts of the show, filling space otherwise used for commercials, which are generally forbidden on PBS. There is also a segment that sometimes appears at the end of the second 11-minute episode called \"And Now a Word from Marc Brown\" where he shows the viewers how to draw various main characters from the show. In 2007, the show began encouraging viewers to send in \"video postcards\" (similar to those used in the spin-off show ''[[Postcards from Buster]]''), which were shown in the interstitials of episodes until the middle of Season 12. Beginning with Episode 151, the show reverted \"And Now a Word from Us Kids\".\n\nSet in a realistic environment (as opposed to the more fantastical settings prominently featured in children's programming), certain stories (often in the second half of the episode) may not necessarily focus on the titular protagonist's point of view and may instead detail the experiences and viewpoints of surrounding characters, usually Arthur's schoolmates. Often such episodes will depict those characters handling situations often faced by children in actuality as a means of guiding audiences through those situations, including [[bed-wetting]], [[asthma]], or [[dyslexia]], and Arthur's character sometimes may see a reduced role (in some episodes, Arthur himself does not appear in the story at all). Stories in later seasons dealt with more serious issues or subjects, such as cancer, [[autism spectrum disorder]], or [[same-sex marriage]], although numerous episodes simply address topics including childhood fears, trends, or fantasies. Occasionally, some episodes might offer very little educational value at all. In spite of the realistically designed environment, the series may showcase the fantasies or daydreams of a few characters on a number of occasions, and a few episodes feature supernatural elements such as ghosts or secret situations unknown to other characters such as Kate and Pal's friendship.\n\nIn May 2019, [[Alabama Public Television]] withheld the airing of \"Mr. Ratburn and the Special Someone\", where Arthur's teacher, Mr. Ratburn, married another man named Patrick. The station had also declined to broadcast a 2005 episode of the spin-off show, ''Postcards from Buster'', where a friend had two mothers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/watch-banned-arthur-episode-with-gay-rat-wedding.html|title=Watch banned \u2018Arthur\u2019 episode with gay rat wedding|last=Gore|first=Leada|work=[[The Birmingham News]]|date=May 23, 2019|accessdate=May 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Franchise==\n\n===Television===\nIn addition to the television series, the ''Arthur'' franchise has spawned three hour-long movies, which are often run on PBS during [[pledge drive]]s. The latest, ''Arthur's Missing Pal'', was produced by [[Mainframe Entertainment]] and is the first animated ''Arthur'' project to make use of [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060209142912/http://www.mainframe.ca/news/articles/media/150805M0.pdf http://www.mainframe.ca/news/articles/media/150805M0.pdf]</ref> ''Arthur''{{'}}s success has also led to the spin-off series ''[[Postcards from Buster]]''. ''Postcards from Buster'' premiered on October 11, 2004 with several returning characters, and aired its final three episodes in 2012.\n\n===Website===\nThe program's official website has been given a rating of 5/5 stars at website ''Common Sense Media'', and has been advised for viewers 5 and up. The site described the show as being \"one of the Internet's best offerings for kids\". It also advised that \"there are links to PBS sponsors but other than that, there is no commercial marketing to kids.\" The review added, \"The games are actually teaching your kids something for example ''The Music Box'' combines music and learning, so much so that kids won't even realize that they're figuring out space relations, hand\u2013eye coordination, and mousing skills as they jam along to upbeat tunes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/website-reviews/arthur.html|title=Arthur|accessdate=January 2, 2011|publisher=common sense media}}</ref>\n\n===Music albums===\n{{Main|Arthur TV soundtracks}}\n\n''Arthur'' has released three music albums. The first album, ''Arthur and Friends: The First Almost Real Not Live CD'', contained songs that were played throughout the TV series and original songs for the album. The second album, ''Arthur's Perfect Christmas'', contained songs that were played during the television movie of the same title. The third album, ''Arthur's Really Rockin' Music Mix'', contained only original songs, including a remix of the theme song which was played on the credits of season 6 as a promotion for the album.\n\n===ActiMates===\nIn 1998, both Arthur and D.W. were made into [[Microsoft]] [[ActiMates]], sophisticated toy dolls who could interact with children, with each other, with certain computer software and the ''Arthur'' website, and also with the ''Arthur'' television show and videos.\n\nMicrosoft discontinued the ActiMates line shortly before season 5 aired, most possibly due to a lawsuit pertaining to patent infringement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/pbskidvid/message/3056|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715181948/http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/pbskidvid/message/3056|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-15|title=PBS Kids}}</ref> and the fact that sales were dropping. It has been noted{{According to whom|date=April 2016}} that post-season 4 episodes of ''Arthur'' have not included any ActiMates code. Newer videos and DVD releases of the show does not carry ActiMates code either. The enhancements on the website were removed when the site was redesigned in 2002 and thus the ActiMates would no longer interact with the website. Likewise, re-releases of the ActiMates software by Creative Wonders do not interact with the ActiMates because the library that controls the PC Pack has been replaced with a dummy library file.\n\n===Video games===\n{{main|Arthur video games}}\n\n===Home media releases===\nSelected episodes were distributed on VHS and DVD by Random House. Each tape had two or three episodes dealing with similar subjects. WGBH Home Video also released two Region 1 ''Arthur'' season sets; they released Season 10 on March 25, 2008 and Season 11 was released on September 2, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Arthur-Season-11/7857|title=Arthur - Season 11 DVD Information &#124; TVShowsonDVD.com|accessdate=August 27, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827035537/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Arthur-Season-11/7857|archivedate=August 27, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Seasons 10\u201319 are available to download on the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Amazon.com]].

For example, children may be shown excluding and ostracizing friends or peers on the playground as part of the TV show.\" (p.622).<ref>Ostrov, Jamie M., Douglas A. Gentile, and Nicki R. Crick. 2006. \"Media Exposure, Aggression and Prosocial Behavior During Early Childhood: A Longitudinal Study.\" ''Social Development'' 15(4) :612-627.</ref> They go on to theorize that preschoolers, due to their developmental stage, may have a hard time fully understanding conflict resolution, which typically occurs at the very end of a show. Shows like ''Arthur'' typically spend most of their time building up conflicts and this may impact the type of learning that is occurring while watching shows. Moreover, they cite research suggesting that the impacts of modeling relational aggression may be especially strong for girls. This research was elaborated on in the New York Times best-selling book on parenting ''NurtureShock: New Thinking About Children'' by Bronson and Merryman (2009).<ref>Bronson, Po and Ashley Merryman. 2009. ''NurtureShock: New Thinking About Children''. New York: Twelve/ Hachette Book Group. </ref> Their punch line is: \"Essentially, Ostrov had just found that ''Arthur'' is more dangerous for children than ''Power Rangers''\" (p.181).\n\nA review at ''MommyPR'' concluded by saying \"My boys were able to preview \"The Wheel Deal\", \"The Buster Report\", \"Falafelosophy\" and \"The Great Lint Rush\". As soon as my boys were finished with these episodses (sic) they begged to watch them again!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mommypr.com/index.php/2010/10/arthur-premieres-season-14-on-pbs-kids-go-review/|title=ARTHUR Premieres Season 14 on PBS KIDS GO!Review|author=M, Andrea|first=|date=August 4, 2010|website=|publisher=MommyPR|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714111557/http://www.mommypr.com/2010/10/arthur-premieres-season-14-on-pbs-kids-go-review/|archive-date=14 July 2011|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''Dad of Divas' Reviews'' explained that Executive Producer Jacqui Deegan said of the 14th season: <blockquote>This season, we're hoping to empower our young viewers to go after their goals and dreams. Whether that means becoming a wheelchair basketball champion, or expressing yourself through writing, drawing, and making movies, Arthur and his friends show kids that determination and hard work really pay off. Both Lydia and Neil serve as great role models, and we're excited to have them to reinforce these important lessons for our audiences.<ref name=\"DOD\">{{cite web|url=http://dadofdivas-reviews.blogspot.com/2010/09/arthur-premieres-season-14-on-pbs-kids.html|title=ARTHUR Premieres Season 14 on PBS KIDS GO!|accessdate=January 2, 2011|author=Dad of Divas|date=September 15, 2010|publisher=Dad of Divas' Review}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAbout.com gave the show a rating of 4.5 stars. The series described ''Arthur'''s assets: <blockquote>The ''Arthur'' series has won several awards including the George Foster Peabody, and for good reason. ''Arthur'' presents issues and situations kids can relate to, and teaches positive behaviors and responses to these issues in a genuine and comical way. The series is fun and engaging to the target age group. Kids will relate to the storylines and characters, and will therefore give thought to the responses the characters demonstrate and outcome of those responses. Because \"Arthur\" presents real childhood issues, the show contains some imitative behavior such as name calling or bickering, much like children experience in their own lives. Kids might hear words like \"sissy\" or \"stupid\" and see Arthur and D.W. argue. Should children mimic some of these phrases or tactics, the show provides a good springboard for parents to talk about the issues with their children and point out the importance of considering others' feelings.</blockquote> The review continued by citing many ways in which children could extract more from the series, for example by encouraging kids to write stories based on their own families (in much the same way ''Arthur'' was first realised) or by Kim Brown, Marc Brown's sister, teaching kids to draw Arthur while on tour.<ref>{{cite

The main character is Andy Larkin, a mischievous youth and the self-proclaimed \"world's greatest prankster\". The show follows him as he tries to perform elaborate [[practical joke]]s, or pranks, on people in the fictional town of East Gackle.\n\nAndy's best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank. His antagonists include his older sister, Jen Larkin, and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech. Andy has a crush on a girl named Lori Mackney and usually tries to impress her. He often breaks the [[fourth wall]] when the [[freeze frame shot|screen freezes]] in [[black and white]] \u2013 a distinctive feature of the show referred to as \"Doodle Vision\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/new-cinegroupe-series-coming-teletoon-and-fox-family-channel|title=New Cinegroupe Series Coming To Teletoon And Fox Family Channel.|website=Animation World Network}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe first season of ''What's with Andy?'' was set in the United States. In the second and third seasons, the show was relocated to [[Alberta]]. It is shown in the episode \"Rhyme Time\" that the characters lived in the U.S. because of the [[History of the United States|American history]] that Andy recited, and the second language they were taught was Spanish rather than French, which is taught as a second language in Canada. In the episode \"Gnome for the Holidays\", a building can be seen saying, \"US Post Office\". Also, an American flag can be seen in the mayor's office in the \"Wag the Kid\" and \"Little Foot\" episodes, and in the episode \"It Came from East Gackle\", FBI agents came to East Gackle.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Andrew \"Andy\" Larkin===\nAndy loves to prank people as well as annoy his friends and family (especially his sister), but often gets into trouble. His best friend is Danny and he has a crush on Lori. His catchphrase is \"Check, please!\".\n\n===Daniel \"Danny\" Tadeus Pickett===\nThe best friend and Andy's right-hand man, helping him out with countless pranks. His last name has always been [[Pickett (disambiguation)|Pickett]]. The name \"Danny Pickett\" is derived from [[Jim Kjelgaard|Jim Kjelgaard's]] ''[[Big Red (film)|Big Red]]''.\n\n===Lori Mackney===\nAndy's crush but she is dismayed by his childishness due to his pranking. It is hinted that she returns Andy's feelings and dislikes Jen because Lori thinks that Jen abuses Andy. She wears a green tank top, blue skirt and sandals. She is known as \"Lisa\" in the books.\n\n===The Larkin family===\n* '''Alfred \"Al\" Larkin''': Andy and Jen's father and Freida's husband and presumably \"The Mystery Prankster\", aka \"The Mystery Prankster of East Gackle\".\n* '''Frieda Larkin''': Andy and Jen's mother and Al's wife.\n* '''Jennifer \"Jen\" Larkin''': Andy's older sister who is always cranky and irritable; she blames her younger brother Andy for almost everything.\n* '''Spank Larkin''': Andy's fat and lazy dog. Spank frequently yawns, especially after going for a walk.\n\n===Recurring/minor characters===\n* '''Teri''': Jen's best friend.\n* '''Jervis Coltrane''': A French snob who has a crush on Lori Mackney and dreams of being the Prime Minister of Canada.\n* '''Peter Lik and Andrew Leech''': Peter and Andrew are Andy's and Danny's nemeses. They are usually referred to as Lik and Leech.\n* '''Craig Bennett''': Jen's crush and one of the best athletes of East Gackle.\n* '''Martin Bonwick''': He is a stereotypically nervous nerd who very often gets bullied.\n* '''Victor \"Vic\" Muskowitz (Mush)''': The pizza delivery man of East Gackle who is a good friend of Andy and Danny and he sometimes helps them with pranks.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Jr.''': A dumb police officer who is the incompetent son of Steve Rowgee Sr.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Sr.''': A police officer who is an old man, who always commands Steve Rowgee Jr. (his son) and is nicknamed the Iron Fisted Maniac.\n* '''Principal DeRosa''': He is the bad-tempered principal of the school in East Gackle and the main antagonist who is obsessed with punishing Andy.\n* '''Mr. Hutchins''': One of the many teachers at East Gackle school, Andy likes to prank him more than the other teachers.\n* '''Mayor Henry K. Roth''': The mayor of East Gackle.\n* '''Mayor Simms''': Mayor of West Gackle and Mayor Henry K. Roth's rival.\n* '''Clyde''': The janitor of the school.\n* '''Hazel Strinner''': She has a crush on Andy and Lori's protecting friend.\n* '''Louella Berman''': Frieda's best friend.\n* '''Mrs. Wibbles''': Principal DeRosa's secretary.\n* '''Norman Larkin''': Andy's grandfather and Al's father who is also a prankster, implying that the male side of the Larkin family comes from a long line of pranksters, apparently with the exception of Al, though several hints have been given that he is also a prankster, even greater than his son or father.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Voice actors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.\n\nIt was originally an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] movie with completely different voice actors and a promotion for [[Fox Kids]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Shortly after, a TV series was developed with new voice actors, and it aired on [[Teletoon]]. The first season was produced by [[Cin\u00e9Groupe]], with the participation of [[Saban Entertainment]] in production<ref name=cmp /> and distribution ([[Saban International]]).\n\nThe main production of the series moved to Canada in season 2, which was co-produced with the French studio [[SIP Animation]] (itself split from Saban Entertainment) and in association with German channel [[Super RTL]]. All the voice cast had to be replaced with this move with the exception of Andy Larkin's voice actor [[Ian James Corlett]], as he was Canadian himself. As Saban Entertainment had by then been acquired by Disney, distribution of this season was handled by Disney subsidiary [[Buena Vista International Television]].\n\nSeason 3 was a collaboration between Cin\u00e9Groupe and Super RTL, and distributed by the production company directly. The whole series was later added to Cin\u00e9Groupe distribution partner HG Distribution's catalogue.<ref name=hgdistribution>{{cite web|url=https://hgagnondistribution.com/en/titles/animation/whats-andy|title=What's With Andy?|date=6 August 2015|website=HG Distribution}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n''What's with Andy?'' originally aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/cinegroupe-shoots-whats-with-andy/|title=Cinegroupe shoots What's With Andy?|publisher=}}</ref> In Australia, where [[Just!

The main character is Andy Larkin, a mischievous youth and the self-proclaimed \"world's greatest prankster\". The show follows him as he tries to perform elaborate [[practical joke]]s, or pranks, on people in the fictional town of East Gackle.\n\nAndy's best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank. His antagonists include his older sister, Jen Larkin, and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech. Andy has a crush on a girl named Lori Mackney and usually tries to impress her. He often breaks the [[fourth wall]] when the [[freeze frame shot|screen freezes]] in [[black and white]] \u2013 a distinctive feature of the show referred to as \"Doodle Vision\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/new-cinegroupe-series-coming-teletoon-and-fox-family-channel|title=New Cinegroupe Series Coming To Teletoon And Fox Family Channel.|website=Animation World Network}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe first season of ''What's with Andy?'' was set in the United States. In the second and third seasons, the show was relocated to [[Alberta]]. It is shown in the episode \"Rhyme Time\" that the characters lived in the U.S. because of the [[History of the United States|American history]] that Andy recited, and the second language they were taught was Spanish rather than French, which is taught as a second language in Canada. In the episode \"Gnome for the Holidays\", a building can be seen saying, \"US Post Office\". Also, an American flag can be seen in the mayor's office in the \"Wag the Kid\" and \"Little Foot\" episodes, and in the episode \"It Came from East Gackle\", FBI agents came to East Gackle.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Andrew \"Andy\" Larkin===\nAndy loves to prank people as well as annoy his friends and family (especially his sister), but often gets into trouble. His best friend is Danny and he has a crush on Lori. His catchphrase is \"Check, please!\".\n\n===Daniel \"Danny\" Tadeus Pickett===\nThe best friend and Andy's right-hand man, helping him out with countless pranks. His last name has always been [[Pickett (disambiguation)|Pickett]]. The name \"Danny Pickett\" is derived from [[Jim Kjelgaard|Jim Kjelgaard's]] ''[[Big Red (film)|Big Red]]''.\n\n===Lori Mackney===\nAndy's crush but she is dismayed by his childishness due to his pranking. It is hinted that she returns Andy's feelings and dislikes Jen because Lori thinks that Jen abuses Andy. She wears a green tank top, blue skirt and sandals. She is known as \"Lisa\" in the books.\n\n===The Larkin family===\n* '''Alfred \"Al\" Larkin''': Andy and Jen's father and Freida's husband and presumably \"The Mystery Prankster\", aka \"The Mystery Prankster of East Gackle\".\n* '''Frieda Larkin''': Andy and Jen's mother and Al's wife.\n* '''Jennifer \"Jen\" Larkin''': Andy's older sister who is always cranky and irritable; she blames her younger brother Andy for almost everything.\n* '''Spank Larkin''': Andy's fat and lazy dog. Spank frequently yawns, especially after going for a walk.\n\n===Recurring/minor characters===\n* '''Teri''': Jen's best friend.\n* '''Jervis Coltrane''': A French snob who has a crush on Lori Mackney and dreams of being the Prime Minister of Canada.\n* '''Peter Lik and Andrew Leech''': Peter and Andrew are Andy's and Danny's nemeses. They are usually referred to as Lik and Leech.\n* '''Craig Bennett''': Jen's crush and one of the best athletes of East Gackle.\n* '''Martin Bonwick''': He is a stereotypically nervous nerd who very often gets bullied.\n* '''Victor \"Vic\" Muskowitz (Mush)''': The pizza delivery man of East Gackle who is a good friend of Andy and Danny and he sometimes helps them with pranks.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Jr.''': A dumb police officer who is the incompetent son of Steve Rowgee Sr.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Sr.''': A police officer who is an old man, who always commands Steve Rowgee Jr. (his son) and is nicknamed the Iron Fisted Maniac.\n* '''Principal DeRosa''': He is the bad-tempered principal of the school in East Gackle and the main antagonist who is obsessed with punishing Andy.\n* '''Mr. Hutchins''': One of the many teachers at East Gackle school, Andy likes to prank him more than the other teachers.\n* '''Mayor Henry K. Roth''': The mayor of East Gackle.\n* '''Mayor Simms''': Mayor of West Gackle and Mayor Henry K. Roth's rival.\n* '''Clyde''': The janitor of the school.\n* '''Hazel Strinner''': She has a crush on Andy and Lori's protecting friend.\n* '''Louella Berman''': Frieda's best friend.\n* '''Mrs. Wibbles''': Principal DeRosa's secretary.\n* '''Norman Larkin''': Andy's grandfather and Al's father who is also a prankster, implying that the male side of the Larkin family comes from a long line of pranksters, apparently with the exception of Al, though several hints have been given that he is also a prankster, even greater than his son or father.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Voice actors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.\n\nIt was originally an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] movie with completely different voice actors and a promotion for [[Fox Kids]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Shortly after, a TV series was developed with new voice actors, and it aired on [[Teletoon]]. The first season was produced by [[Cin\u00e9Groupe]], with the participation of [[Saban Entertainment]] in production<ref name=cmp /> and distribution ([[Saban International]]).\n\nThe main production of the series moved to Canada in season 2, which was co-produced with the French studio [[SIP Animation]] (itself split from Saban Entertainment) and in association with German channel [[Super RTL]]. All the voice cast had to be replaced with this move with the exception of Andy Larkin's voice actor [[Ian James Corlett]], as he was Canadian himself. As Saban Entertainment had by then been acquired by Disney, distribution of this season was handled by Disney subsidiary [[Buena Vista International Television]].\n\nSeason 3 was a collaboration between Cin\u00e9Groupe and Super RTL, and distributed by the production company directly. The whole series was later added to Cin\u00e9Groupe distribution partner HG Distribution's catalogue.<ref name=hgdistribution>{{cite web|url=https://hgagnondistribution.com/en/titles/animation/whats-andy|title=What's With Andy?|date=6 August 2015|website=HG Distribution}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n''What's with Andy?'' originally aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/cinegroupe-shoots-whats-with-andy/|title=Cinegroupe shoots What's With Andy?|publisher=}}</ref> In Australia, where [[Just!

On response cards distributed by  FIAT's sales department, participants were invited to guage exterior and interior appearance and finish, spaciousness, instruments and controls, engine size, price, and the provisional name ''Rustica''.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nBeginning in January 1979, production was delayed by protracted union negotiations, specifically over Fiat's plans to move production in from Fiat's in Cassino, Sulmona and Termini Imerese to Turin and Desio. An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980 with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nJust prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

It was launched in the right-hand drive UK market in May 1981.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 1 h sst.jpg|thumb|left|Rear of pre-facelift Fiat Panda]]\nMechanically the first Pandas shared engines and transmissions with the [[Fiat 127]] and, in certain territories, the air-cooled 652&nbsp;cc two-cylinder powerplant of the [[Fiat 126]]. Rear suspension used a [[solid axle]] suspended on [[leaf spring]]s. Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989_FIAT_Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions &mdash; with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989_Fiat_Panda_4x4_SISLEY_(3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors &mdash;in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox &mdash; with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time. \n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The Active model also received new darker seat fabrics of better quality and the addition of a CD player as standard. The new dark red Fiat badge replaced the blue roundel on the Panda in Summer 2007.\n\n===2009 revisions===\nThe Panda range was mildly rearranged again in 2009, with the addition of Active Eco and Dynamic Eco models. These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n*The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n*The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n*The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n*The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n*The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n*The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n\n*The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n*The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n*The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n*The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n\n*'''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The new architecture is based on the [[Fiat Mini platform]]. The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda.

Due to the cylinders being both located under the [[floorpan]], the boot's volume is reduced only by 25 liters - 200 L instead of the monofuel's 225. On the other hand this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.

On response cards distributed by  FIAT's sales department, participants were invited to guage exterior and interior appearance and finish, spaciousness, instruments and controls, engine size, price, and the provisional name ''Rustica''.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nBeginning in January 1979, production was delayed by protracted union negotiations, specifically over Fiat's plans to move production in from Fiat's in Cassino, Sulmona and Termini Imerese to Turin and Desio. An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980 with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nJust prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Its flexible interior included a seven-position adjustable rear seat which could be folded flat into make a provisional bed,<ref>http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_CjtWge34hfs/SmCt9sI1B6I/AAAAAAAAASA/7AF8tRJCZUs/s1600/Fiat+Panda+45+1984+Interior+Usage.jpg</ref> folded into a V shape to support awkward loads, or easily and quickly removed altogether to increase the overall load space.

It was launched in the right-hand drive UK market in May 1981.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 1 h sst.jpg|thumb|left|Rear of pre-facelift Fiat Panda]]\nMechanically the first Pandas shared engines and transmissions with the [[Fiat 127]] and, in certain territories, the air-cooled 652&nbsp;cc two-cylinder powerplant of the [[Fiat 126]]. Rear suspension used a [[solid axle]] suspended on [[leaf spring]]s. Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989_FIAT_Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions &mdash; with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989_Fiat_Panda_4x4_SISLEY_(3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors &mdash;in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox &mdash; with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time. \n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n*The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n*The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n*The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n*The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n*The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n*The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n\n*The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n*The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n*The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n*The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n\n*'''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

Rather than taking the time to adapt one of these existing frameworks, with DAD all of the effort of combining relevant pieces of each technique has already been done.\n\n=== Full delivery lifecycle ===\nUnlike first generation agile methods that typically focus on the construction aspects of the lifecycle, DAD addresses the full delivery lifecycle, from team initiation all the way to delivering a solution to your end users.\n\n=== Support for multiple lifecycles. ===\nDAD supports six lifecycles to choose from: agile, lean, continuous delivery, exploratory, and large-team versions of the lifecycle. DAD does not prescribe a single lifecycle because it recognizes that one approach does not fit all.\n\n=== Complete ===\nDAD shows how development, modeling, architecture, management, requirements/outcomes, documentation, governance and other strategies fit together in a streamlined whole. DAD does the \"process heavy lifting\" that other methods leave up to you.\u00a0\n\n=== Context-sensitive ===\nThe approach is goal-driven or outcome-driven rather than prescriptive. In doing so, DAD provides contextual advice regarding viable alternatives - what works, what doesn't and more importantly why - and their trade-offs, enabling you to tailor your way of working to address the situation in which you find yourself and do so in a streamlined manner.\n\n=== Consumable solutions over working software ===\nDAD matures focus from simply producing software to providing consumable solutions that provide real business value to stakeholders. While software is clearly an important part of the deliverable, being solution focused means taking a holistic view of the overall problem. This can lead to suggested updates in hardware, business and organizational processes, and overall organizational structures.\n\n=== Self-organization with appropriate governance ===\nAgile and lean teams are self-organizing, which means that the people who do the work are the ones who plan and estimate it. They must still work in an enterprise aware manner that reflects the priorities of their organization, and to do that they will need to be governed appropriately by senior leadership.\n\n== Lifecycles ==\nDisciplined originally supported an agile (scrum-based) project lifecycle and a Lean (Kanban-based) project lifecycle. It has since been extended to support six lifecycles:\n# '''Agile'''. A three-phase project lifecycle based on Scrum. The phases are Inception (what is sometimes called \"Sprint 0\"), Construction, and Transition (what is sometimes called a Release sprint).\n# '''Lean'''. A three-phase project lifecycle based on Kanban.\n# '''Continuous Delivery: Agile'''. An Agile-based product lifecycle that supports a continuous flow of work resulting in incremental releases (typically once a week).\n# '''Continuous Delivery: Lean'''. A lean-based product lifecycle that supports a continuous flow of work.\n# '''Exploratory'''. An experimentation-based lifecycle based on [[lean startup]] that has been extended to address the parallel development of [[minimum viable product]]s as per the advice of [[cynefin]].\n# '''Program'''. A lifecycle for coordinating a team of teams.\n\n== Process goals ==\nDAD is described as a collection of twenty-one '''process goals''', or process outcomes.<ref>{{cite web\n  |authors=Ambler & Lines\n  |year=2019\n  |title=Choose Your WoW!\n  |page=46\n  |url=http://disciplinedagiledelivery.com/dad-handbook/\n}}</ref> These goals guides teams through a leaner process decisions to address the context of the situation they face. It enables teams to focus on outcomes and not on process compliance and on guesswork of extending agile methods. It enables scaling by providing sophisticated-enough strategies to address the complexities you face. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" valign=\"top\"\n|-\n! Inception Phase !! Construction Phase !!

Someone who is materially impacted by the outcome of the solution. More than just an end-user or customer, this is anyone potentially affected by the development and deployment of a software project.\n* '''Product owner'''. The person on the team who speaks as the \"one voice of the customer\", representing the needs of the stakeholder community to the agile delivery team.\n* '''Team member'''. The team member focuses on producing the actual solution for stakeholders, including but not limited to: testing, analysis, architecture, design, programming, planning, and estimation. They will have a subset of the overall needed skills and they will strive to gain more to become generalizing specialists. \n* '''Team lead'''. The team lead is a host leader and also the agile coach, responsible for facilitating communication, empowering them to choose their way of working, and ensuring the team has the resources it needs and is free of obstacles.\n* '''Architecture owner'''. Owns the architecture decisions for the team and facilitates the creation and evolution of the overall solution design.\n\n=== Potential supporting roles ===\nThese supporting roles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disciplinedagiledelivery.com/roles-on-dad-teams/|title=Roles on DAD Teams|last=Ambler|first=Scott|work=disciplinedagiledelivery.com}}</ref>  are introduced (sometimes on a temporary basis) to address scaling issues.\n\n* '''Specialist'''. Although most agile team members are generalizing specialists,<ref>{{cite web|title=Generalizing Specialists: Improving Your IT Career Skills|url=http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/generalizingSpecialists.htm|publisher=Agile Modeling}}</ref> sometimes other specialists are required depending on the needs of the project.\n* '''Domain expert'''. While the product owner represents a wide range of stakeholders, a domain expert is sometimes required for complex domains where a more nuanced understanding is required.\n* '''Technical expert'''. In cases where a particularly difficult problem is encountered, a technical expert can be brought in as needed. These could be build masters, agile database administrators, user experience (UX) designers, or security experts.\n* '''Independent tester'''. Although the majority of testing is done by the DAD team members, in cases with complex domains or technology an independent testing team can be brought in to work in parallel to validate the work.\n* '''Integrator'''. For complex technical solutions at scale, an integrator (or multiple integrators) can be used to build the entire system from its various subsystems.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Alan |year=2012 |title=Enterprise Software Delivery: Bringing Agility and Efficiency to the Global Software Supply Chain|isbn=978-0321803016}}\n* {{cite web|last1=Royce |first1=Walker |year=2013 |title=Agility at Scale: Economic Governance, Measured Improvement and Disciplined Agile Delivery|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486907}}\n* Supporting Governance in Disciplined Agile Delivery Using Noninvasive Measurement and Process Mining, (November 2013 ''Cutter IT Journal'', Astromiskis, Janes, Sillitti, Succi)\n* 10 Principles for Success in Distributed Agile Delivery (November 2013 ''Cutter IT Journal'', Bavani)\n\n{{Software engineering}}\n\n[[Category:Agile software development]]\n", "text_old": "{{Third-party|date=November 2019}}\n{{Software development process}}\n\n'''Disciplined agile delivery''' ('''DAD''') is the software development portion of the disciplined agile toolkit.

DAD attempts to address these challenges by using a people-first, learning-oriented, hybrid approach to IT solution delivery.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://disciplinedagiledelivery.com/dad-handbook/|title=Choose Your WoW!

Rather than taking the time to adapt one of these existing frameworks, with DAD all of the effort of combining relevant pieces of each technique has already been done.\n\n=== Full delivery lifecycle ===\nUnlike first generation agile methods that typically focus on the construction aspects of the lifecycle, DAD addresses the full delivery lifecycle, from team initiation all the way to delivering a solution to your end users.\n\n=== Support for multiple lifecycles. ===\nDAD supports six lifecycles to choose from: agile, lean, continuous delivery, exploratory, and large-team versions of the lifecycle. DAD does not prescribe a single lifecycle because it recognizes that one approach does not fit all.\n\n=== Complete ===\nDAD shows how development, modeling, architecture, management, requirements/outcomes, documentation, governance and other strategies fit together in a streamlined whole. DAD does the \"process heavy lifting\" that other methods leave up to you.\u00a0\n\n=== Context-sensitive ===\nThe approach is goal-driven or outcome-driven rather than prescriptive. In doing so, DAD provides contextual advice regarding viable alternatives - what works, what doesn't and more importantly why - and their trade-offs, enabling you to tailor your way of working to address the situation in which you find yourself and do so in a streamlined manner.\n\n=== Consumable solutions over working software ===\nDAD matures focus from simply producing software to providing consumable solutions that provide real business value to stakeholders. While software is clearly an important part of the deliverable, being solution focused means taking a holistic view of the overall problem. This can lead to suggested updates in hardware, business and organizational processes, and overall organizational structures.\n\n=== Self-organization with appropriate governance ===\nAgile and lean teams are self-organizing, which means that the people who do the work are the ones who plan and estimate it. They must still work in an enterprise aware manner that reflects the priorities of their organization, and to do that they will need to be governed appropriately by senior leadership.\n\n== Lifecycles ==\nDisciplined originally supported an agile (scrum-based) project lifecycle and a Lean (Kanban-based) project lifecycle. It has since been extended to support six lifecycles:\n# '''Agile'''. A three-phase project lifecycle based on Scrum. The phases are Inception (what is sometimes called \"Sprint 0\"), Construction, and Transition (what is sometimes called a Release sprint).\n# '''Lean'''. A three-phase project lifecycle based on Kanban.\n# '''Continuous Delivery: Agile'''. An Agile-based product lifecycle that supports a continuous flow of work resulting in incremental releases (typically once a week).\n# '''Continuous Delivery: Lean'''. A lean-based product lifecycle that supports a continuous flow of work.\n# '''Exploratory'''. An experimentation-based lifecycle based on [[lean startup]] that has been extended to address the parallel development of [[minimum viable product]]s as per the advice of [[cynefin]].\n# '''Program'''. A lifecycle for coordinating a team of teams.\n\n== Process goals ==\nDAD is described as a collection of twenty-one '''process goals''', or process outcomes.<ref>{{cite web\n  |authors=Ambler & Lines\n  |year=2019\n  |title=Choose Your WoW!\n  |page=46\n  |url=http://disciplinedagiledelivery.com/dad-handbook/\n}}</ref> These goals guides teams through a leaner process decisions to address the context of the situation they face. It enables teams to focus on outcomes and not on process compliance and on guesswork of extending agile methods. It enables scaling by providing sophisticated-enough strategies to address the complexities you face. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" valign=\"top\"\n|-\n! Inception Phase !! Construction Phase !!

Someone who is materially impacted by the outcome of the solution. More than just an end-user or customer, this is anyone potentially affected by the development and deployment of a software project.\n* '''Product owner'''. The person on the team who speaks as the \"one voice of the customer\", representing the needs of the stakeholder community to the agile delivery team.\n* '''Team member'''. The team member focuses on producing the actual solution for stakeholders, including but not limited to: testing, analysis, architecture, design, programming, planning, and estimation. They will have a subset of the overall needed skills and they will strive to gain more to become generalizing specialists. \n* '''Team lead'''. The team lead is a host leader and also the agile coach, responsible for facilitating communication, empowering them to choose their way of working, and ensuring the team has the resources it needs and is free of obstacles.\n* '''Architecture owner'''. Owns the architecture decisions for the team and facilitates the creation and evolution of the overall solution design.\n\n=== Potential supporting roles ===\nThese supporting roles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disciplinedagiledelivery.com/roles-on-dad-teams/|title=Roles on DAD Teams|last=Ambler|first=Scott|work=disciplinedagiledelivery.com}}</ref>  are introduced (sometimes on a temporary basis) to address scaling issues.\n\n* '''Specialist'''. Although most agile team members are generalizing specialists,<ref>{{cite web|title=Generalizing Specialists: Improving Your IT Career Skills|url=http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/generalizingSpecialists.htm|publisher=Agile Modeling}}</ref> sometimes other specialists are required depending on the needs of the project.\n* '''Domain expert'''. While the product owner represents a wide range of stakeholders, a domain expert is sometimes required for complex domains where a more nuanced understanding is required.\n* '''Technical expert'''. In cases where a particularly difficult problem is encountered, a technical expert can be brought in as needed. These could be build masters, agile database administrators, user experience (UX) designers, or security experts.\n* '''Independent tester'''. Although the majority of testing is done by the DAD team members, in cases with complex domains or technology an independent testing team can be brought in to work in parallel to validate the work.\n* '''Integrator'''. For complex technical solutions at scale, an integrator (or multiple integrators) can be used to build the entire system from its various subsystems.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Alan |year=2012 |title=Enterprise Software Delivery: Bringing Agility and Efficiency to the Global Software Supply Chain|isbn=978-0321803016}}\n* {{cite web|last1=Royce |first1=Walker |year=2013 |title=Agility at Scale: Economic Governance, Measured Improvement and Disciplined Agile Delivery|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486907}}\n* Supporting Governance in Disciplined Agile Delivery Using Noninvasive Measurement and Process Mining, (November 2013 ''Cutter IT Journal'', Astromiskis, Janes, Sillitti, Succi)\n* 10 Principles for Success in Distributed Agile Delivery (November 2013 ''Cutter IT Journal'', Bavani)\n\n{{Software engineering}}\n\n[[Category:Agile software development]]\n", "name_user": "Zmiju2", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciplined_agile_delivery"}
