{"title_page": "Relative pronoun", "text_new": " \n\nIn the English language, the following are the most common relative pronouns: which, that, whose, whoever, whomever, who and whom.\n\nIn conjoining a subordinate clause and a main clause, a relative pronoun functions as a subordinating [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]. According to some [[dependency grammar]] theories, a relative pronoun does not simply mark the subordinate (relative) clause but also may be considered to play the role of a noun within that clause. For example, in the relative clause \"that Jack built\" given above, the pronoun \"that\" may be construed to syntactically  function as the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the verb \"built.\" Compare this with \"Jack built the house after he married,\" where the conjunction ''after'' marks the subordinate clause ''after he married'', but does not play the role of any noun within that clause.  \n\nIn relative clauses, relative pronouns take the number (singular or plural) and the person (first, second or third) of its antecedent. \n\nFor more information on the formation and uses of relative clauses\u2014with and without relative pronouns\u2014see [[Relative clause]]. For detailed information about relative clauses and relative pronouns in English, see [[English relative clause]].\n\n==Antecedents==\nThe element in the main clause that the relative pronoun in the relative clause stands for (''house'' in the above example) is the [[Antecedent (grammar)|''antecedent'']] of that pronoun. In most cases the antecedent is a nominal (noun or noun phrase), though the pronoun can also refer to a whole [[proposition]], as in \"The train was late, which annoyed me greatly\", where the antecedent of the relative pronoun ''which'' is the clause \"The train was late\" (the thing that annoyed me was the fact of the train's being late). \n\nIn a [[free relative clause]], a relative pronoun has no antecedent: the relative clause itself plays the role of the co-referring element in the main clause. For example, in \"I like what you did\", ''what'' is a relative pronoun, but without an antecedent. The clause ''what you did'' itself plays the role of a nominal (the object of ''like'') in the main clause. A relative pronoun used this way is sometimes called a '''fused relative pronoun''', since the antecedent appears fused into the pronoun (''what'' in this example can be regarded as a fusion of ''that which'').\n\n==Absence==\nNot all relative clauses contain relative pronouns. Some languages, such as [[Mandarin Chinese]],  do not have relative pronouns at all, and form relative clauses (or their equivalents) [[Relative_clause#Mandarin|by different methods]]. English can also make relative clauses without relative pronouns in some cases. For example, in \"The man you saw yesterday was my uncle\", the relative clause ''you saw yesterday'' contains no relative pronoun. It can be said to have a gap, or [[zero (linguistics)|zero]], in the position of the object of the verb ''saw''.\n\n==Role==\nOther arguments can be relativised using relative pronouns:\n;Subject: ''Hunter is the boy who helped Jessica.''\n;Indirect object: ''Hunter is the boy to whom Jessica gave a gift.''/''Hunter is the boy whom Jessica gave a gift to.''\n;Prepositional complement: ''Jack built the house in which I now live.'' (Similarly with prepositions and prepositional phrases in general, for example, ''These are the walls between which Jack ran.'')\n;Possessor: ''Jack is the boy whose friend built my house.''\n\n==Variant forms==\nIn some languages with [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and noun [[declension]]s\u2014such as [[German language|German]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], and [[Latin]]\u2014the relative pronoun agrees with its antecedent in gender and number, while its [[Grammatical case|case]] indicates its relationship with the verb in the relative or main clause.{{Sfn | Kordi\u0107 | 1999 | pp = 36\u201337}} In some other languages, the relative pronoun is an invariable word.\n\nWords used as relative pronouns often originally had other functions.

This suggests that relative pronouns might be a fairly late development in many languages.{{Sfn | Kordi\u0107 | 1999 | pp = 16\u201319}} Some languages, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]], have no relative pronouns.\n\nIn English, different pronouns are sometimes used if the antecedent is a human being, as opposed to a non-human or an inanimate object (as in ''who'' vs. ''that''). \n:(1)  ''This is a bank.

It is often important that such dispensers operate without biological or chemical contamination, and so must be internally sealed from the environment and designed for easy cleaning and [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] before use. At a minimum, a media dispenser consists of some kind of [[pump]] connected to a length of discharge tubing or a spout.

He previously served as [[Western Cape Provincial Parliament|Leader of the Opposition in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament]] from 2014 to 2016, and [[African National Congress|Chairperson of the Western Cape African National Congress]] from 2011 to 2016. He served as [[Department of International Relations and Cooperation|Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation]] in the cabinet of Jacob Zuma. From 2009 to 2014, he was a [[National Assembly of South Africa|Member of the National Assembly]]. Fransman served as a [[Member of the Western Cape Provincial Parliament]] from 1999 to 2009, and again from 2014 to 2016.\n\n==Early life and career==\nFransman was born in Blackheath on the [[Cape Flats]]. He served as head boy of Bishop Lavis Secondary School. He played a crucial role in creating awareness while he served as the chairperson of the school's student representative council (SRC). He obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Western Cape]]. Later on, he achieved a Higher Diploma in Education from the same university.\n\nAfter completing his studies at university, he worked as a teacher in the town of [[Vredendal]]. In that same period, he joined the African National Congress.\n\n==Political career==\nHe worked as a regional recruiter for the ANC and later took up the position of Farm Dweller Project Manager at Surplus People's Project. He served as Provincial Deputy Secretary of the Western Cape African National Congress branch from 1997 until 2004, while he concurrently worked as head of the fishing desk. He was the party's rural elections co-ordinator from 1995 until he became the party's provincial elections coordinator in 1999.\n\nDespite holding many internal party positions, he served as Deputy Mayor and Mayor of the Vredendal Municipality. He was elected to the Western Cape Provincial Parliament in 1999 and held many positions in the Western Cape provincial government. He was named Provincial Minister of Social Services and Poverty Alleviation in 2001 but was then deployed to the position of Provincial Minister of Local Government and Housing in 2004. In 2005, Rasool reshuffled his executive and designated Fransman as Provincial Minister of Transport and Public Works. He served until 2008 when Premier [[Lynne Brown]] announced that Fransman would become Provincial Minister of Health.\n\nIn May 2009, he was elected to the National Assembly and served as Parliamentary Chairperson of the Higher Education and Training Committee. President [[Jacob Zuma]] reconfigured the national cabinet in October 2010 and named Fransman as Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, succeeding Sue van der Merwe.<ref>[http://www.dirco.gov.za/department/profile_fransman.html Profile: Marius Llewellyn Fransman]</ref>\n\n==Chairperson of the Western Cape African National Congress==\nFransman was a candidate for the post of Chairperson of the Western Cape African National Congress. The incumbent, [[Mcebisi Skwatsha]], decided to stand down. Fransman was unanimously elected chairperson on 12 February 2011 at the party's conference in [[Cape Town]].<ref>[https://mg.co.za/article/2011-02-12-marius-fransman-crowned-cape-anc-chairperson Marius Fransman crowned Cape ANC Chairperson]</ref>\n\nAs Chairperson of the African National Congress in the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]-led Western Cape, Fransman came under fire on several occasions before the [[2014 South African general election|2014 general election]] for his controversial [[canvassing]] methods. The methods included distributing food parcels to potential voters and promising large sums of cash to [[Coloured]] voters before the election. Fransman was the party's premier candidate. The party retained all its seats in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament and he returned to the Western Cape Provincial Parliament as Leader of the Opposition, succeeding [[Lynne Brown]]. He challenged incumbent [[Helen Zille]] of the Democratic Alliance for the position of Premier at the first sitting of the Fifth Provincial Parliament. He subsequently lost to Zille as the Democratic Alliance held a majority in the Provincial Parliament. Fransman received 14 votes compared Zille's 27 votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-30-western-cape-food-for-votes-case-in-court |title=Western Cape food for votes case in court |date=30 April 2014 |website= |publisher=Mail & Guardian |accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2015/02/01/anc-leader-in-votes-for-cash-scandal1 |title=ANC leader in 'votes for cash' scandal |date=1 February 2015 |website= |publisher=Times Live |accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.news24.com/Elections/News/Zille-re-elected-Western-Cape-premier-20140521 |title=Zille re-elected Western Cape premier |access-date=2018-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205124510/https://www.news24.com/Elections/News/Zille-re-elected-Western-Cape-premier-20140521 |archive-date=2018-12-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFransman had also challenged and criticised the Western Cape Government and the Democratic Alliance on its policy positions. Fransman won re-election unopposed to a second term at the party's conference in 2015.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Fransman-re-elected-as-WCape-ANC-chair-20150628 Fransman re-elected as Western Cape ANC Chair]</ref>\n\n===Sexual harassment allegations===\nFransman was accused of [[sexual assault]] by his assistant, Louisa Wynand. Fransman was alleged to have sexually assaulted Wynand while ''en route'' to the African National Congress's 104th birthday celebrations in [[Rustenburg]] in January 2016. Fransman strongly denied these claims. The Democratic Alliance, as well as party officials from the African National Congress, called for him to step down. The party quickly suspended Fransman as chairperson pending an investigation into the alleged assault claims. Deputy Chairperson, Khaya Magaxa, was designated as Fransman's acting successor. On 16 February 2016, it was announced that Magaxa would succeed Fransman as Leader of the Opposition in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament. The ANC said that Magaxa would replace Fransman until all the internal processes had been completed.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/khaya-magaxa-replaces-fransman-in-western-cape-legislature-20160216 Khaya Magaxa replaces Fransman in the Western Cape legislature]</ref>\n\nFransman had received quite a lot of support during this period. In February 2016, a Facebook page was created with the name, ''Friends of Marius Fransman''. On the page, a prayer service was organised for the Fransman family.

He previously served as [[Western Cape Provincial Parliament|Leader of the Opposition in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament]] from 2014 to 2016, and [[African National Congress|Chairperson of the Western Cape African National Congress]] from 2011 to 2016. He served as [[Department of International Relations and Cooperation|Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation]] in the cabinet of Jacob Zuma. From 2009 to 2014, he was a [[National Assembly of South Africa|Member of the National Assembly]]. Fransman served as a [[Member of the Western Cape Provincial Parliament]] from 1999 to 2009, and again from 2014 to 2016.\n\n==Early life and career==\nFransman was born in Blackheath on the [[Cape Flats]]. He served as head boy of Bishop Lavis Secondary School. He played a crucial role in creating awareness while he served as the chairperson of the school's student representative council (SRC). He obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Western Cape]]. Later on, he achieved a Higher Diploma in Education from the same university.\n\nAfter completing his studies at university, he worked as a teacher in the town of [[Vredendal]]. In that same period, he joined the African National Congress.\n\n==Political career==\nHe worked as a regional recruiter for the ANC and later took up the position of Farm Dweller Project Manager at Surplus People's Project. He served as Provincial Deputy Secretary of the Western Cape African National Congress branch from 1997 until 2004, while he concurrently worked as head of the fishing desk. He was the party's rural elections co-ordinator from 1995 until he became the party's provincial elections coordinator in 1999.\n\nDespite holding many internal party positions, he served as Deputy Mayor and Mayor of the Vredendal Municipality. He was elected to the Western Cape Provincial Parliament in 1999 and held many positions in the Western Cape provincial government. He was named Provincial Minister of Social Services and Poverty Alleviation in 2001 but was then deployed to the position of Provincial Minister of Local Government and Housing in 2004. In 2005, Rasool reshuffled his executive and designated Fransman as Provincial Minister of Transport and Public Works. He served until 2008 when Premier [[Lynne Brown]] announced that Fransman would become Provincial Minister of Health.\n\nIn May 2009, he was elected to the National Assembly and served as Parliamentary Chairperson of the Higher Education and Training Committee. President [[Jacob Zuma]] reconfigured the national cabinet in October 2010 and named Fransman as Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, succeeding Sue van der Merwe.<ref>[http://www.dirco.gov.za/department/profile_fransman.html Profile: Marius Llewellyn Fransman]</ref>\n\n==Chairperson of the Western Cape African National Congress==\nFransman was a candidate for the post of Chairperson of the Western Cape African National Congress. The incumbent, [[Mcebisi Skwatsha]], decided to stand down. Fransman was unanimously elected chairperson on 12 February 2011 at the party's conference in [[Cape Town]].<ref>[https://mg.co.za/article/2011-02-12-marius-fransman-crowned-cape-anc-chairperson Marius Fransman crowned Cape ANC Chairperson]</ref>\n\nAs Chairperson of the African National Congress in the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]-led Western Cape, Fransman came under fire on several occasions before the [[2014 South African general election|2014 general election]] for his controversial [[canvassing]] methods. The methods included distributing food parcels to potential voters and promising large sums of cash to [[Coloured]] voters before the election. Fransman was the party's premier candidate. The party retained all its seats in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament and he returned to the Western Cape Provincial Parliament as Leader of the Opposition, succeeding [[Lynne Brown]]. He challenged incumbent [[Helen Zille]] of the Democratic Alliance for the position of Premier at the first sitting of the Fifth Provincial Parliament. He subsequently lost to Zille as the Democratic Alliance held a majority in the Provincial Parliament. Fransman received 14 votes compared Zille's 27 votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-30-western-cape-food-for-votes-case-in-court |title=Western Cape food for votes case in court |date=30 April 2014 |website= |publisher=Mail & Guardian |accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2015/02/01/anc-leader-in-votes-for-cash-scandal1 |title=ANC leader in 'votes for cash' scandal |date=1 February 2015 |website= |publisher=Times Live |accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.news24.com/Elections/News/Zille-re-elected-Western-Cape-premier-20140521 |title=Zille re-elected Western Cape premier |access-date=2018-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205124510/https://www.news24.com/Elections/News/Zille-re-elected-Western-Cape-premier-20140521 |archive-date=2018-12-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFransman had also challenged and criticised the Western Cape Government and the Democratic Alliance on its policy positions. Fransman won re-election unopposed to a second term at the party's conference in 2015.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Fransman-re-elected-as-WCape-ANC-chair-20150628 Fransman re-elected as Western Cape ANC Chair]</ref>\n\n===Sexual harassment allegations===\nFransman was accused of [[sexual assault]] by his assistant, Louisa Wynand. Fransman was alleged to have sexually assaulted Wynand while ''en route'' to the African National Congress's 104th birthday celebrations in [[Rustenburg]] in January 2016. Fransman strongly denied these claims. The Democratic Alliance, as well as party officials from the African National Congress, called for him to step down. The party quickly suspended Fransman as chairperson pending an investigation into the alleged assault claims. Deputy Chairperson, Khaya Magaxa, was designated as Fransman's acting successor. On 16 February 2016, it was announced that Magaxa would succeed Fransman as Leader of the Opposition in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament. The ANC said that Magaxa would replace Fransman until all the internal processes had been completed.<ref>[https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/khaya-magaxa-replaces-fransman-in-western-cape-legislature-20160216 Khaya Magaxa replaces Fransman in the Western Cape legislature]</ref>\n\nFransman had received quite a lot of support during this period. In February 2016, a Facebook page was created with the name, ''Friends of Marius Fransman''. On the page, a prayer service was organised for the Fransman family. The service was later held in Vredendal.
