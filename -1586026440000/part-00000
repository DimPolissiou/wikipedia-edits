Around {{convert|110|e6t|e6ST}} of [[limestone]] rock slid down [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]].<ref name=\"FrankSlideFacts\" /> Witnesses reported that within 100 seconds the rock reached up the opposing hills, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest [[landslide]]s in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the [[rubble]]. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a constant state of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.\n\nThe railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened.  The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in 1911 amid fears that another slide was possible. The town's population nearly doubled its pre-slide population by 1906, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in 1917. The community is now part of the [[Crowsnest Pass, Alberta|Municipality of Crowsnest Pass]] in the Province of [[Alberta]] and has a population around 200. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination.  It has been designated a [[Provincial Historic Sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site of Alberta]] and is home to an [[interpretation centre|interpretive centre]] that receives over 100,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Background==\nThe town of [[Frank, Alberta|Frank]] was founded in the southwestern corner of the [[District of Alberta]], a subdivision of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1901. A location was chosen near the base of [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]] in the [[Crowsnest Pass]], where coal had been discovered one year earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=55}}</ref> It was named after [[Henry Frank]] who, along with [[Samuel Gebo]], owned the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company, which operated the mine that the town was created to support.<ref name=\"Anderson56\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=6}}</ref> The pair celebrated the founding of the town on September 10, 1901, with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders, sporting events, a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community.  The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) ran special trains that brought over 1,400 people from neighbouring communities to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Anderson56\" /> By April 1903, the permanent population had reached 600,<ref name=\"EpochTimes109\">{{citation |last=Reichel |first=Justina |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/canada/frank-slide-remembered-227569.html |title=Frank Slide remembered |work=The Epoch Times |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> and the town featured a two-storey school and four hotels.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=57}}</ref>\n\nTurtle Mountain stands immediately south of Frank.

Three had been outside the mine and were killed by the slide.<ref name=\"Kerr12\">{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=12}}</ref>  The remaining 17 were underground.

Encouraged by their success, the miners cut a new shaft that broke through under an outcropping of rock that protected them from falling debris.  Thirteen hours after they were buried, all 17 men emerged from the mountain.<ref name=\"Anderson86\" />\n\nThe miners found that the row of cottages that served as their homes had been devastated and some of their families killed, seemingly at random.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" /> One found his family alive and safe in a makeshift hospital, but another emerged to discover his wife and four children had died.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=88}}</ref> Fifteen-year-old Lillian Clark, working a late shift that night in the town's boarding house, had been given permission to stay overnight for the first time.<ref name=\"Anderson63\" /> She was the only member of her family to survive.

A. G. Haultain|Frederick Haultain]] arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had investigated the top of Turtle Mountain.  Though new fissures had formed at the peak, they felt there was limited further risk to the town; nevertheless, the CPR's chief engineer felt that Frank was in imminent danger from another slide.  Siding with the latter, Haultain ordered the town evacuated,<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=91}}</ref> and the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC) sent two of its top geologists to investigate further.  They reported that the slide had created two new peaks on the mountain and that the north peak, overlooking the town, was not in imminent danger of collapse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=33}}</ref>  As a result, the evacuation order was lifted on May 10 and Frank's citizens returned.<ref name=\"Anderson93\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=93}}</ref>  The [[North-West Mounted Police]], reinforced by officers who arrived from [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Macleod]] and [[Calgary]], kept tight control of the town and ensured that no cases of [[looting]] occurred during the evacuation.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=92}}</ref>\n\nClearing the Canadian Pacific Railway line was of paramount importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=30}}</ref> Approximately {{convert|2|km|mi}} of the main line had been buried under the slide, along with part of an auxiliary line.<ref name=\"FSICFAQ\" />  The CPR had the line cleared and rebuilt within three weeks.<ref name=\"CBCArchives\" /> Intent on reopening the mine, workers opened passageways to the old mine works by May 30.

A prism connected to cables monitors the mountain for movement.]]\nAn unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, was also a factor. Water in the mountain's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports.<ref name=\"vanHerk385\" /> Heavy snowfall in the region in March was followed by a warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" />  GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide.  The crew of the freight train that arrived at Frank shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter, with overnight temperatures falling below {{convert|\u221218|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. Geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures, causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Anderson96\" />\n\nThough the GSC concluded that mining activities contributed to the slide, the facility's owners disagreed. Their engineers claimed that the mine bore no responsibility.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=38}}</ref>  Later studies suggested that the mountain had been at a point of \"equilibrium\"; even a small deformation such as that caused by the mine's existence would have helped trigger a slide.<ref>{{harvnb|Benko|Stead|1998|p=311}}</ref> The mine was quickly re-opened, even though rock continued to tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" /> Coal production at Frank peaked in 1910,<ref name=\"Kerr36\">{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=36}}</ref> but the mine was permanently closed in 1917 after it became unprofitable.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" />\n\nThe slide created two new peaks on the mountain; the south peak stands {{convert|2200|m|ft}} high and the north peak {{convert|2100|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"FrankSlideFacts\">{{citation |url=https://frankslide.ca/sites/frankslide/files/editor_files/Frank_Slide_Facts%20(1).pdf |title=Frank Slide facts |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=2019-04-29}}</ref> Geologists believe that another slide is inevitable, though not imminent.

It was one of the largest [[landslide]]s in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the [[rubble]]. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a constant state of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.\n\nThe railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened.  The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in 1911 amid fears that another slide was possible. The town's population nearly doubled its pre-slide population by 1906, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in 1917. The community is now part of the [[Crowsnest Pass, Alberta|Municipality of Crowsnest Pass]] in the Province of [[Alberta]] and has a population around 200. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination.  It has been designated a [[Provincial Historic Sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site of Alberta]] and is home to an [[interpretation centre|interpretive centre]] that receives over 100,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Background==\nThe town of [[Frank, Alberta|Frank]] was founded in the southwestern corner of the [[District of Alberta]], a subdivision of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1901. A location was chosen near the base of [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]] in the [[Crowsnest Pass]], where coal had been discovered one year earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=55}}</ref> It was named after [[Henry Frank]] who, along with [[Samuel Gebo]], owned the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company, which operated the mine that the town was created to support.<ref name=\"Anderson56\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=6}}</ref> The pair celebrated the founding of the town on September 10, 1901, with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders, sporting events, a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community.  The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) ran special trains that brought over 1,400 people from neighbouring communities to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Anderson56\" /> By April 1903, the permanent population had reached 600,<ref name=\"EpochTimes109\">{{citation |last=Reichel |first=Justina |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/canada/frank-slide-remembered-227569.html |title=Frank Slide remembered |work=The Epoch Times |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> and the town featured a two-storey school and four hotels.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=57}}</ref>\n\nTurtle Mountain stands immediately south of Frank.

A. G. Haultain|Frederick Haultain]] arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had investigated the top of Turtle Mountain.  Though new fissures had formed at the peak, they felt there was limited further risk to the town; nevertheless, the CPR's chief engineer felt that Frank was in imminent danger from another slide.  Siding with the latter, Haultain ordered the town evacuated,<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=91}}</ref> and the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC) sent two of its top geologists to investigate further.  They reported that the slide had created two new peaks on the mountain and that the north peak, overlooking the town, was not in imminent danger of collapse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=33}}</ref>  As a result, the evacuation order was lifted on May 10 and Frank's citizens returned.<ref name=\"Anderson93\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=93}}</ref>  The [[North-West Mounted Police]], reinforced by officers who arrived from [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Macleod]] and [[Calgary]], kept tight control of the town and ensured that no cases of [[looting]] occurred during the evacuation.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=92}}</ref>\n\nClearing the Canadian Pacific Railway line was of paramount importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=30}}</ref> Approximately {{convert|2|km|mi}} of the main line had been buried under the slide, along with part of an auxiliary line.<ref name=\"FSICFAQ\" />  The CPR had the line cleared and rebuilt within three weeks.<ref name=\"CBCArchives\" /> Intent on reopening the mine, workers opened passageways to the old mine works by May 30.

A prism connected to cables monitors the mountain for movement.]]\nAn unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, was also a factor. Water in the mountain's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports.<ref name=\"vanHerk385\" /> Heavy snowfall in the region in March was followed by a warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" />  GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide.

The work of [[Rosario Castellanos]] was particularly significant; Chicanas began to refer to her as a \"mother\" as they adopted her as symbolism for duality and complex identity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Castellanos |first=Rosario |title=Otra vez Sor Juana\" (\"Once Again Sor Juana\") |date=1963}}</ref> Castellanos's subsequent poem \"La Mallinche\" recast her not as a traitor but as a victim.<ref name=\"Romero2005\">{{cite book |author=Rolando Romero |title=Feminism, Nation and Myth: La Malinche |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfesWiXwkdQC&pg=PA28 |date=2005-01-01 |publisher=Arte Publico Press |isbn=978-1-61192-042-0 |pages=28\u2013 }}</ref> Mexican feminists defended Malinche as a woman caught between cultures, forced to make complex decisions, who ultimately served as a mother of a new race.<ref name=\"CoerverPasztor2004\">{{cite book |author1=Don M.

It is argued, however, that without her help, Cort\u00e9s would not have been successful in conquering the Aztecs as quickly, giving the Aztec people enough time to adapt to new technology and methods of warfare. From that viewpoint, she is seen as one who betrayed the indigenous people by siding with the Spaniards. Recently a number of feminist Latinas have decried such a categorization as [[scapegoating]].{{sfn|Cypess|1991|p=12}}\n\nPresident [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] commissioned a sculpture of Cort\u00e9s, Do\u00f1a Marina, and their son Mart\u00edn, which was placed in front of Cort\u00e9s's house in the [[Coyoacan]] section of Mexico City.

In contrast, she is portrayed as a duplicitous traitor in [[Gary Jennings]]' novel ''[[Aztec (novel)|Aztec]]'' (1980). A novel published in 2006 by [[Laura Esquivel]] portrays the main character as a pawn of history who becomes ''Malinche''.\n*In 1949, choreographer Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n premiered the dance trio \"La Milanche\" to music by Norman Lloyd.

The club was established in 1929 under the name \"Panayot Volov\", and folded its senior team in 2014, before being 'refounded' in July 2018. They play their home games on \"Panayot Volov\", with a capacity of 24,390 people. The team's first kit colors are yellow and blue.\n\nBecause of the city's famous brand of [[Shumensko]] beer, they are often affectionately called '''\u041f\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435''', or ''The Brewers''.\n\n==History==\nFC Shumen (then called Panayot Volov) participated in the State Championship as Shumen region champion in 1934\u201335 and reached the semifinals. The club was again champion of Shumen region in 1935\u201336 and 1936\u201337, but was eliminated during the first matches of the State Championship. The club subsequently went through further name changes, including to DFS Shumen in 1980, Madara Shumen in 1984, and FC Shumen in 1985.\n\nAfter a successful spell in the [[Bulgarian A Professional Football Group]] during the early and late 1990s, which included a 4th-place finish in [[1993\u201394 A PFG|1993/94]] and a [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] participation, the club lost its main sponsors and went bankrupt. A newly formed entity acquired its license and merged with Yunak Shumen in 2001, eventually becoming FC Shumen 2001. The club briefly returned to its original name of Panayot Volov in 2007, before entering financial difficulties once more and being renamed to Shumen 2010 as it was demoted to the V group, the third tier in Bulgarian football.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liblib.cn/UEFa/Bulgaria.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210173956/http://www.liblib.cn/UEFA/Bulgaria.htm |archive-date=2010-02-10 |df= }} Bulgarian Clubs</ref>\n\nThe club [[2012\u201313 B PFG|regained its position]] in professional football after a two-year absence by winning the 2011\u201312 [[Bulgarian North-East V AFG|Northeastern V Amateur Group]], but finished 12th out of 14 teams in its first season back, and was relegated back to the third division for the 2013\u201314 season. Shumen 2010 finished 14th in the 2013/14 V AFG campaign, which meant they were relegated to the regional divisions. However, due to continuing financial difficulties the club folded before the start of the 2014/15 season, and fielded youth teams only in the following four seasons.\n\nOn 26 July 2018, the team was restored under the name ''Volov 1929 Shumen'' and filed a request for participation in the [[2018\u201319 Third Amateur Football League (Bulgaria)|2018\u201319]] season of the [[Third Amateur Football League (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian Third League]].<ref>[https://www.sportal.bg/news.php?news=737291 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 (\u0428\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d) \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0434\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0433\u0430]</ref> On 30 July they were accepted, and faced [[FC Lokomotiv Ruse|Lokomotiv Ruse]] in their return to the 3rd division, losing the game 2-1.<ref>[https://gong.bg/bg-football/drugi/iztegliha-zhrebiia-za-severoiztochnata-treta-liga-499266 \u0418\u0437\u0442\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0445\u0430 \u0436\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0433\u0430]</ref>\n\nPFC Shumen have played in the A Professional Group for a total of seven seasons: 1972\u20131973, 1983\u20131984, 1993\u20131996 and 1998\u20132000.<ref>http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bulghist.html</ref> The club reached the semifinals of the [[Bulgarian Cup]] on two occasions, in 1957 and [[2006 Bulgarian Cup Final|2006]], when they narrowly lost 2:1 to [[Cherno More Varna]] after extra time.\n\n==Honours==\n'''[[Bulgarian A Professional Football Group|A PFG]]'''\n* 4th place: [[1993\u201394 A PFG|1993\u201394]]\n* Semifinalist in the national championship: 1935\n'''[[Bulgarian B Professional Football Group|B PFG]]'''\n* '''Champions (2)''': 1971\u201372, 1982\u201383\n* Runners-up (5): 1953\u201354, 1956\u201357, 1980\u201381, 1981\u201382, 1992\u201393\n'''[[Bulgarian North-East V AFG|North-East V AFG]]'''\n* '''Champions (3)''': 1986\u201387, 1990\u201391, [[2011\u201312 V AFG|2011\u201312]]\n'''[[Bulgarian Cup]]'''\n* Semi-finalists (2): [[1957 Bulgarian Cup|1956\u201357]], [[2005\u201306 Bulgarian Cup|2005\u201306]]\n* Quarter-finalists (2): [[1975\u201376 Bulgarian Cup|1975\u201376]], 1999\u201300\n\n===European record===\n'''[[UEFA Cup]]:'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[[Regional Amateur Football Groups (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian Regional Amateur Football Groups]]. The club was established in 1929 under the name \"Panayot Volov\", and folded its senior team in 2014, before being 'refounded' in July 2018. They play their home games on \"Panayot Volov\", with a capacity of 24,390 people. The team's first kit colors are yellow and blue.\n\nBecause of the city's famous brand of [[Shumensko]] beer, they are often affectionately called '''\u041f\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435''', or ''The Brewers''.\n\n==History==\nFC Shumen (then called Panayot Volov) participated in the State Championship as Shumen region champion in 1934\u201335 and reached the semifinals. The club was again champion of Shumen region in 1935\u201336 and 1936\u201337, but was eliminated during the first matches of the State Championship. The club subsequently went through further name changes, including to DFS Shumen in 1980, Madara Shumen in 1984, and FC Shumen in 1985.\n\nAfter a successful spell in the [[Bulgarian A Professional Football Group]] during the early and late 1990's, which included a 4th-place finish in [[1993\u201394 A PFG|1993/94]] and a [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] participation, the club lost its main sponsors and went bankrupt. A newly formed entity acquired its license and merged with Yunak Shumen in 2001, eventually becoming FC Shumen 2001. The club briefly returned to its original name of Panayot Volov in 2007, before entering financial difficulties once more and being renamed to Shumen 2010 as it was demoted to the V group, the third tier in Bulgarian football.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liblib.cn/UEFa/Bulgaria.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210173956/http://www.liblib.cn/UEFA/Bulgaria.htm |archive-date=2010-02-10 |df= }} Bulgarian Clubs</ref>\n\nThe club [[2012\u201313 B PFG|regained its position]] in professional football after a two-year absence by winning the 2011\u201312 [[Bulgarian North-East V AFG|Northeastern V Amateur Group]], but finished 12th out of 14 teams in its first season back, and was relegated back to the third division for the 2013\u201314 season. Shumen 2010 finished 14th in the 2013/14 V AFG campaign, which meant they were relegated to the regional divisions. However, due to continuing financial difficulties the club folded before the start of the 2014/15 season, and fielded youth teams only in the following four seasons.\n\nOn 26 July 2018, the team was restored under the name ''Volov 1929 Shumen'' and filed a request for participation in the [[2018\u201319 Third Amateur Football League (Bulgaria)|2018\u201319]] season of the [[Third Amateur Football League (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian Third League]].<ref>[https://www.sportal.bg/news.php?news=737291 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 (\u0428\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d) \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0434\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0433\u0430]</ref> On 30 July they were accepted, and faced [[FC Lokomotiv Ruse|Lokomotiv Ruse]] in their return to the 3rd division, losing the game 2-1.<ref>[https://gong.bg/bg-football/drugi/iztegliha-zhrebiia-za-severoiztochnata-treta-liga-499266 \u0418\u0437\u0442\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0445\u0430 \u0436\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0433\u0430]</ref>\n\nPFC Shumen have played in the A Professional Group for a total of seven seasons: 1972\u20131973, 1983\u20131984, 1993\u20131996 and 1998\u20132000.<ref>http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bulghist.html</ref> The club reached the semifinals of the [[Bulgarian Cup]] on two occasions, in 1957 and [[2006 Bulgarian Cup Final|2006]], when they narrowly lost 2:1 to [[Cherno More Varna]] after extra time.\n\n==Honours==\n'''[[Bulgarian A Professional Football Group|A PFG]]'''\n* 4th place: [[1993\u201394 A PFG|1993\u201394]]\n* Semifinalist in the national championship: 1935\n'''[[Bulgarian B Professional Football Group|B PFG]]'''\n* '''Champions (2)''': 1971\u201372, 1982\u201383\n* Runners-up (5): 1953\u201354, 1956\u201357, 1980\u201381, 1981\u201382, 1992\u201393\n'''[[Bulgarian North-East V AFG|North-East V AFG]]'''\n* '''Champions (3)''': 1986\u201387, 1990\u201391, [[2011\u201312 V AFG|2011\u201312]]\n'''[[Bulgarian Cup]]'''\n* Semi-finalists (2): [[1957 Bulgarian Cup|1956\u201357]], [[2005\u201306 Bulgarian Cup|2005\u201306]]\n* Quarter-finalists (2): [[1975\u201376 Bulgarian Cup|1975\u201376]], 1999\u201300\n\n===European record===\n'''[[UEFA Cup]]:'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
