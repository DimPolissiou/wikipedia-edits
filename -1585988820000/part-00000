Settlers cleared land, built houses and outbuildings, and on their own farms. The Southern rich owned large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] that dominated export agriculture and used slaves. Many were involved in the labor-intensive cultivation of tobacco, the first cash crop of Virginia. Tobacco exhausted the soil quickly, requiring that farmers regularly clear new fields.

The British took control of Savannah and Charleston, capturing a large American army in the process, and set up a network of bases inland. There were many more Loyalists in the South than in the North,<ref>The World Book: Organized Knowledge in Story and Picture, Volume 6 edited by Michael Vincent O'Shea, Ellsworth Decatur Foster, George Herbert Locke p. 4989</ref> but they were concentrated in larger coastal cities and were not great enough in number to overcome the revolutionaries. Large numbers of loyalists from South Carolina fought for the British in the [[Battle of Camden]].

Thousands of slaves took advantage of wartime disruption to find their own freedom, catalyzed by the British Governor Dunmore of Virginia's promise of freedom for service. Many others were removed by Loyalist owners and became slaves elsewhere in the Empire. Between 1770 and 1790, there was a sharp decline in the percentage of blacks \u2013 from 61% percent to 44% in South Carolina and from 45% to 36% in Georgia.<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619\u20131877'', (Hill and Wang, 1994), p. 73.</ref>\n\nIn addition, some slaveholders were inspired to free their slaves after the Revolution. They were moved by the principles of the Revolution, and Quaker and Methodist preachers worked to encourage slaveholders to free their slaves. Planters such as [[George Washington]] often freed slaves by their wills. In the upper South, more than 10 percent of all blacks were free by 1810, a significant expansion from pre-war proportions of less than 1 percent free.<ref>Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619\u20131877'', p. 81.</ref>\n\n===Antebellum years===\n[[File:SlaveDanceand Music.jpg|thumb|[[Slavery|Slaves]] on a [[South Carolina]] plantation (''[[The Old Plantation]]'', circa 1790)]]\n[[King Cotton|Cotton]] became dominant in the lower South after 1800.

This led to an explosion of cotton cultivation, especially in the frontier uplands of Georgia, Alabama and other parts of the Deep South, as well as riverfront areas of the Mississippi Delta.  Migrants poured into those areas in the early decades of the 19th century, when county population figures rose and fell as swells of people kept moving west.  The expansion of cotton cultivation required more slave labor, and the institution became even more deeply an integral part of the South's economy.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://home.earthlink.net/~gfeldmeth/lec.slavery.html |title = The Peculiar Institution of American Slavery |accessdate = June 11, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071103122831/http://home.earthlink.net/~gfeldmeth/lec.slavery.html |archive-date = November 3, 2007 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nWith the opening up of frontier lands after the government forced most Native Americans to move west of the Mississippi, there was a major migration of both whites and blacks to those territories.  From the 1820s through the 1850s, more than one million enslaved Africans were transported to the Deep South in forced migration, two-thirds of them by slave traders and the others by masters who moved there. Planters in the Upper South sold slaves excess to their needs as they shifted from tobacco to mixed agriculture. Many enslaved families were broken up, as planters preferred mostly strong males for field work.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, pp. 5, 215.</ref>\n\nTwo major political issues that festered in the first half of the 19th century caused political alignment along sectional lines, strengthened the identities of North and South as distinct regions with certain strongly opposed interests, and fed the arguments over states' rights that culminated in secession and the Civil War.  One of these issues concerned the protective tariffs enacted to assist the growth of the manufacturing sector, primarily in the North.  In 1832, in resistance to federal legislation increasing tariffs, South Carolina passed an ordinance of [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], a procedure in which a state would, in effect, repeal a Federal law. Soon a naval flotilla was sent to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor, and the threat of landing ground troops was used to compel the collection of tariffs. A compromise was reached by which the tariffs would be gradually reduced, but the underlying argument over states' rights continued to escalate in the following decades.\n\n[[File:A Race Meeting at Jacksonville, Alabama by W.S. Hedges - BMA.jpg|thumb|[[Horse racing]] at [[Jacksonville, Alabama]], 1841]]\nThe second issue concerned slavery, primarily the question of whether slavery would be permitted in newly admitted states. The issue was initially finessed by political compromises designed to balance the number of \"free\" and \"slave\" states. The issue resurfaced in more virulent form, however, around the time of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], which raised the stakes by adding new territories primarily on the Southern side of the imaginary geographic divide. Congress opposed allowing slavery in these territories.\n\nBefore the Civil War, the number of immigrants arriving at Southern ports began to increase, although the North continued to receive the most immigrants. [[Hugenots]] were among the first settlers in Charleston, along with the largest number of Orthodox Jews outside of [[New York City]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  Numerous Irish immigrants settled in New Orleans, establishing a distinct [[ethnic enclave]] now known as the [[Irish Channel, New Orleans|Irish Channel]].  Germans also went to New Orleans and its environs, resulting in a large area north of the city (along the Mississippi) becoming known as the German Coast. Still greater numbers immigrated to Texas (especially after 1848), where many bought land and were farmers.  Many more German immigrants arrived in Texas after the Civil War, where they created the brewing industry in Houston and elsewhere, became grocers in numerous cities, and also established wide areas of farming.\n\nBy 1840, [[New Orleans]] was the wealthiest city in the country and the third largest in population. The success of the city was based on the growth of international trade associated with products being shipped to and from the interior of the country down the Mississippi River. New Orleans also had the largest slave market in the country, as traders brought slaves by ship and overland to sell to planters across the Deep South. The city was a cosmopolitan port with a variety of jobs that attracted more immigrants than other areas of the South.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave '', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, pp. 2\u20137</ref> Because of lack of investment, however, construction of railroads to span the region lagged behind the North.

The Republican Party, founded in 1854, pledged to stop the spread of slavery beyond those states where it already existed.  After Abraham Lincoln was elected the first Republican president in 1860, seven cotton states declared their secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America]] before Lincoln was inaugurated.  The United States government, both outgoing and incoming,  refused to recognize the Confederacy, and when the new Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] ordered his troops to open fire on [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in April 1861, there was an overwhelming demand, North and South, for war.  Only the state of [[Kentucky]] attempted to remain neutral, and it could only do so briefly.

Although the Confederacy had large supplies of captured munitions and many volunteers, it was slower than the Union in dealing with the border states.  By March 1862, the Union largely controlled Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, had shut down all commercial traffic from all Confederate ports, had prevented European recognition of the Confederate government, and was poised to seize New Orleans.\n[[File:EwellsDeadSpotsylvania1864crop01.jpg|thumb|Confederate dead of General Ewell's Corps who attacked the Union lines at the Battle of Spotsylvania, May 19, 1864.]]\n\nIn the four years of war 1861\u201365 the South was the primary battleground, with all but two of the major battles taking place on Southern soil. Union forces relentlessly squeezed the Confederacy, controlling the border states in 1861, the Tennessee River, the Cumberland River and New Orleans in 1862, and the Mississippi River in 1863.  In the East, however, the Confederate Army under [[Robert E. Lee]] beat off attack after attack in its defense of their capital at Richmond. But when Lee tried to move north, he was repulsed (and nearly captured) at Sharpsburg (1862) and Gettysburg (1863).\n\nThe Confederacy had the resources for a short war, but was unable to finance or supply a longer war. It reversed the traditional low-tariff policy of the South by imposing a new 15% tax on all imports from the Union. The [[Union Army|Union]] blockade stopped most commerce from entering the South, and smugglers avoided the tax, so the Confederate tariff produced too little revenue to finance the war. Inflated currency was the solution, but that created distrust of the Richmond government. Because of low investment in railroads, the Southern transportation system depended primarily on river and coastal traffic by boat; both were shut down by the [[Union Navy]]. The small railroad system virtually collapsed, so that by 1864 internal travel was so difficult that the Confederate economy was crippled.\n\nThe Confederate cause was hopeless by the time Atlanta fell and [[William T. Sherman]] marched through Georgia in late 1864, but the rebels fought on, refusing to give up their independence until Lee's army surrendered in April 1865. All the Confederate forces surrendered, and the region moved into the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\nThe South suffered much more than the North overall, as the Union strategy of attrition warfare meant that Lee could not replace his casualties, and the total war waged by Sherman, Sheridan and other Union armies devastated the infrastructure and caused widespread poverty and distress.

Because of states' reluctance to grant voting rights to freedmen, Congress instituted Reconstruction governments. It established military districts and governors to rule over the South until new governments could be established. Many white Southerners who had actively supported the Confederacy were temporarily disenfranchised. Rebuilding was difficult as people grappled with the effects of a new labor economy of a free market in the midst of a widespread agricultural depression. In addition, what limited infrastructure the South had was mostly destroyed by the war. At the same time, the North was rapidly industrializing. To avoid the social effects of the war, most of the Southern states initially passed [[Black Codes (United States)|black codes]]. Eventually, these were mostly legally nullified by federal law and anti-Confederate legislatures, which existed for a short time during Reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04102005-230201/unrestricted/J_ThesisChapter3.pdf |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060910091017/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04102005-230201/unrestricted/J_ThesisChapter3.pdf |url-status = dead |archive-date = September 10, 2006 |title = Chapter 3: An Easy Adjustment to the Post War Nation: Pensacola Between 1865 and 1870 |date = December 4, 2010 |publisher = fsu.edu }}</ref>\n\nThere were thousands of people on the move, as African Americans tried to reunite families separated by slaves sales, and sometimes migrated for better opportunities in towns or other states. Other freed people moved from plantation areas to cities or towns for a chance to get different jobs. At the same time, whites returned from refuges to reclaim plantations or town dwellings. In some areas, many whites returned to the land to farm for a while. Some freedpeople left the South altogether for states such as Ohio and Indiana, and later, Kansas. Thousands of others joined the migration to new opportunities in the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta bottomlands and Texas.\n\nWith passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States]] (which outlawed slavery), the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] (which granted full U.S. citizenship to [[African American]]s) and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]] (which extended the right to vote to [[African American]] males), African Americans in the South were made free citizens and were given the right to vote.

The warm sunny weather of the South proved ideal for building 60 percent of the Army's new training camps and nearly half the new airfields, In all 40 percent of spending on new military installations went to the South. For example it, and sleepy [[Starke, Florida]] a town of 1500 people in 1940, became the base of [[Camp Blanding]]. By March 1941, 20,000 men were constructing a permanent camp for 60,000 soldiers.  Money flowed freely for the war effort, as over $4 billion went into military facilities in the South, and another $5 billion into defense plants. Major shipyards were built In Virginia, Charleston, and Along the Gulf Coast. Huge warplane plants were opened in Dallas-Fort Worth and Georgia.

The region had finally reached the take off stage into industrial and commercial growth, although its income and wage levels lagged well behind the national average. Nevertheless, as [[George B.

Rapid expansion in industries such as autos, telecommunications, textiles, technology, banking, and aviation gave some states in the South an industrial strength to rival large states elsewhere in the country.  By the 2000 census, the South (along with the West) was leading the nation in population growth.

Hodges]] in North Carolina, and [[Estes Kefauver]] in Tennessee. They promoted subsidies for small farmers, and supported the nascent labor union movement. An essential condition for this North-South coalition was for northern liberals to ignore southern racism. After 1945, however, northern liberals -- led especially by young [[Hubert Humphrey]] of Minnesota --increasingly made civil rights a central issue. They convinced Truman to join them in 1948. The conservative Southern Democrats \u2013 the [[Dixiecrat]]s \u2013 took control of the state parties in half the region and ran [[Strom Thurmond]] for president against Truman. Thurmond carried only the deep South, but that threat was enough to guarantee the national Democratic Party in 1952 in 1956 would not make civil rights a major issue. In 1956, 101 of the 128 southern congressmen and senators signed the [[Southern Manifesto]] denouncing forced desegregation.<ref>Brent J.

Southern liberals were in a quandary \u2013 most of them kept quiet or moderated their liberalism, others switched sides, and the rest continued on the liberal path. One by one, the last group was defeated; historian Numan V. Bartley states, \"Indeed, the very word 'liberal' gradually disappeared from the southern political lexicon, except as a term of opprobrium.\"<ref>Numan V.

With a combination of intimidation, fraud and violence by paramilitary groups, they suppressed black voting and turned Republicans out of office. From 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven states ratified new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised most black voters and many poor white voters. This disfranchisement persisted for six decades into the 20th century, depriving blacks and poor whites of all political representation. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries. They had no one to represent their interests, resulting in state legislatures consistently underfunding programs and services, such as schools, for blacks and poor whites.<ref>Michael Perman, ''Pursuit of Unity: A Political History of the American South'' (2009)</ref> Scholars have characterized pockets of the Southern United States as being \"authoritarian enclaves\" from Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Act.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691133386/paths-out-of-dixie|title=Paths Out of Dixie|last=Mickey|first=Robert|date=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13338-6|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo28381225.html|title=How to Save a Constitutional Democracy|last=|first=|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kuo|first=Didi|date=2019|title=Comparing America: Reflections on Democracy across Subfields|journal=Perspectives on Politics|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=788\u2013800|doi=10.1017/S1537592719001014|issn=1537-5927}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/boundary-control/subnational-authoritarianism-in-the-united-states/85765543D8C22FBA874D213C5D73144E|title=Subnational Authoritarianism in the United States|last=Gibson|first=Edward L.|date=2013|website=Boundary Control: Subnational Authoritarianism in Federal Democracies|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref>\n\nWith the collapse of the Republican Party in nearly all parts of the South, the region became known as the \u201c[[Solid South]]\u201d, and the Democratic Party after 1900 moved to a system of primaries to select their candidates. Victory in a primary was [[tantamount to election]]. From the late 1870s to the 1960s, only rarely was a state or national Southern politician a Republican, apart from a few Appalachian mountain districts.<ref>Key; ''Southern Politics State and Nation'' (1984)</ref><ref>Gordon B.

University of North Carolina Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8078-9724-9}}</ref> Republicans, however, continued to control parts of the Appalachian Mountains and compete for power in the Border States. Apart from a few states (such as the [[Byrd Organization|Byrd Machine]] in Virginia, the [[E. H. Crump|Crump]] [[Political machine|Machine]] in Memphis), and a few other local organizations, the Democratic Party itself was very lightly organized. It managed primaries but party officials had little other role. To be successful a politician built his own network of friends, neighbors and allies. Reelection was the norm, and the result from 1910 to the late 20th century was that Southern Democrats in Congress had accumulated seniority, and automatically took the chairmanships of all committees.<ref>The classic study is V.O. Key, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiESAAAAYAAJ ''Southern politics in State and Nation'' (1949)]</ref> By the 1940s the Supreme Court began to find disfranchisement measures like the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d and the white primary unconstitutional. Southern legislatures quickly passed other measures to keep blacks disfranchised, even after suffrage was extended more widely to poor whites. Because white Democrats controlled all the Southern seats in Congress they had outsize power in Congress and could sidetrack or [[filibuster]] efforts by Northerners to pass legislation against lynching, for example.\n\nIncreasing support for civil rights legislation by the national Democratic Party beginning in 1948 caused segregationist Southern Democrats to nominate [[Strom Thurmond]] on a third-party \u201cDixiecrat\u201d ticket in 1948. These Dixiecrats returned to the party by 1950, but Southern Democrats held off Republican inroads in the suburbs by arguing that only they could defend the region from the onslaught of northern liberals and the [[civil rights movement]]. In response to the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling of 1954, 101 Southern congressmen (19 senators, 82 House members of which 99 were Southern Democrats and 2 were Republicans) in 1956 denounced the Brown decisions as a \"clear abuse of judicial power [that] climaxes a trend in the federal judiciary undertaking to legislate in derogation of the authority of Congress and to encroach upon the reserved rights of the states and the people.\" The manifesto lauded, \u201c...those states which have declared the intention to resist enforced integration by any lawful means\u201d.

Democratic governors [[Orval Faubus]] of Arkansas, [[Ross Barnett]] of Mississippi, [[John Connally]] of Texas, [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia, and, especially, [[George Wallace]] of Alabama resisted integration and appealed to a rural and [[blue-collar]] electorate.<ref>Numan V.

The transition to a Republican stronghold in the South took decades. First, the states started voting Republican in presidential elections, except for native sons [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976 and [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 and 1996. Then the states began electing Republican senators and finally governors.

A13].</ref>\n\n===Presidents from the South===\nThe South produced nine of the first twelve Presidents prior to the Civil War. For more than a century after the Civil War, no politician from an antebellum slave state became President unless he either moved North (like [[Woodrow Wilson]]) or was vice president when the president died in office (like [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Harry Truman]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]). In 1976, [[Jimmy Carter]] defied this trend and became the first Southerner to break the pattern since [[Zachary Taylor]] in 1848. The South has produced five of the last nine American Presidents: [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1963\u201369), [[Jimmy Carter]] (1977\u201381), [[George H. W. Bush]] (1989\u201393), [[Bill Clinton]] (1993\u20132001) and [[George W. Bush]] (2001\u20132009). Johnson was a native of Texas, while Carter is from Georgia, and Clinton from Arkansas. While George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush began their political careers in Texas, they were both born in [[New England]] and have their ancestral roots in that region.\n\n===Other politicians and political movements===\n[[File:Bill Clinton 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton]], newly-elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] speaking with [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1978. Carter and Clinton were both [[Southern Democrats]] and elected to the presidencies in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] and [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].]]\nThe South has produced various nationally known politicians and political movements. In 1948, a group of Democratic congressmen, led by Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] of South Carolina, split from the Democrats in reaction to an anti-segregation speech given by [[Minneapolis]] mayor and future senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]]. They founded the States Rights Democratic or [[Dixiecrat]] Party. During that year's Presidential election, the party ran Thurmond as its candidate and he carried four Deep South states.\n\nIn the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 Presidential election]], Alabama Governor [[George C. Wallace]] ran for President on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket. Wallace ran a \u201claw and order\u201d campaign similar to that of Republican candidate, [[Richard Nixon]]. Nixon's [[Southern Strategy]] of gaining electoral votes downplayed race issues and focused on culturally conservative values, such as family issues, patriotism, and cultural issues that appealed to [[Southern Baptists]].\n\nIn [[United States elections, 1994|the 1994 mid-term elections]], another Southern politician, [[Newt Gingrich]], led the [[Republican Revolution]], ushering in twelve years of GOP control of the House. Gingrich became [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] in 1995 and served until his resignation in 1999. [[Tom DeLay]] was the most powerful Republican leader in Congress{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} until he was indicted under criminal charges in 2005 and was forced to step aside by Republican rules.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Apart from [[Bob Dole]] from Kansas (1985\u201396), the recent Republican Senate Leaders have been Southerners: [[Howard Baker]] (1981\u20131985) of Tennessee, [[Trent Lott]] (1996\u20132003) of Mississippi, [[Bill Frist]] (2003\u20132006) of Tennessee, and [[Mitch McConnell]] (2007\u2013present) of Kentucky.\n\nThe Republicans candidates for President have won the South in elections since [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], except for [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]]. The region is not, however, entirely monolithic, and every successful Democratic candidate since 1976 has claimed at least three Southern states. [[Barack Obama]] won Florida, Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina, and Virginia in 2008 but did not repeat his victory in North Carolina during his 2012 reelection campaign.<ref>\u201c[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-10/romney-bus-tour-charts-course-for-battlegrounds-obama-won Romney Bus Tour Charts Course for Battlegrounds Obama Won]\u201d.

They were defeated by settlers in a series of wars ending in the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Seminole Wars]], and most were removed west to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma and Kansas), but large numbers of Native Americans managed to stay behind by blending into the surrounding society.  This was especially true of the wives of Euro-American merchants and miners.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Civil rights movement===\n{{Main|Civil rights movement|Montgomery bus boycott|Martin Luther King Jr.}}\n\nThe South witnessed two major events in the lives of 20th century African Americans: the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and the [[American Civil Rights Movement]].\n\nThe Great Migration began during World War I, hitting its high point during World War II. During this migration, blacks left the South to find work in Northern factories and other sectors of the economy.<ref>Katzman, 1996</ref>\n\nThe migration also empowered the growing Civil Rights Movement. While the movement existed in all parts of the United States, its focus was against disfranchisement and the Jim Crow laws in the South. Most of the major events in the movement occurred in the South, including the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], the Mississippi [[Freedom Summer]], the March on [[Selma, Alabama]], and the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] In addition, some of the most important writings to come out of the movement were written in the South, such as King's \"[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]\".  Most of the civil rights landmarks can be found around the South. The [[Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument]] in Birmingham includes the [[Birmingham Civil Rights Institute]] which details Birmingham's role as the center of the Civil Rights Movement. The [[16th Street Baptist Church]] served as a rallying point for coordinating and carrying out the [[Birmingham campaign]]as well as the adjacent [[Kelly Ingram Park]] that served as ground zero for the infamous children's protest that eventually led to the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] has been rededicated as a place of \"Revolution and Reconciliation\" and is now the setting of moving sculptures related to the battle for Civil Rights in the city, both are center pieces of the [[Birmingham Civil Rights District]]. The [[Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site]] in Atlanta includes a museum that chronicles the American Civil Rights Movement as well as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s boyhood home on Auburn Avenue. Additionally, [[Ebenezer Baptist Church (Atlanta, Georgia)|Ebenezer Baptist Church]] is located in the Sweet Auburn district as is the King Center, location of Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King's gravesites.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement ended Jim Crow laws across the South.

A complex interaction of factors came together unexpectedly in the period 1954-1965 to make the momentous changes possible. The Supreme Court had taken the first initiative in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (1954) making segregation of public schools unconstitutional. Enforcement was rapid in the North and border states, but  was deliberately stopped in the South by the movement called [[Massive Resistance]], sponsored by rural segregationists who largely controlled the state legislatures. Southern liberals, who counseled moderation, where shouted down by both sides and have limited impact. Much more significant was the [[Civil Rights Movement]], especially the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) headed by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. It largely displaced the old, much more moderate NAACP in taking leadership roles. King organize massive demonstrations, that seiozed massive media attention in an era when network television news was an innovative and universally watched phenomenon.<ref>Graham Allison, [https://www.amazon.com/Framing-South-Hollywood-Television-Struggle/dp/0801866154/   ''Framing the South: Hollywood, television, and race during the Civil Rights Struggle''  (2001).]</ref>  SCLC, student activists and smaller local organizations staged demonstrations across the South.  National  attention focused on Birmingham, Alabama, where protesters deliberately provoked [[Bull Connor]] and his police forces by using young teenagers as demonstrators \u2013 and Connor arrested 900 on one day alone. The next day Connor unleashed billy clubs, police dogs, and high-pressure water hoses to disperse and punish the young demonstrators with a brutality that horrified the nation. It was very bad for business, and for the image of a modernizing progressive urban South. President John F. Kennedy, who had been calling for moderation, threatened to use federal troops to restore order in Birmingham. The result in Birmingham was  compromise by which the new mayor opened the library, golf courses, and other city facilities to both races, against the backdrop of church bombings and assassinations.<ref>Diane McWhorter, ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama: The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution'' (2001)</ref><ref> Dewey W.

Doctor King launched a massive march on Washington in August, 1963, bringing out 200,000 demonstrators  in front of the Lincoln Memorial, the largest political assembly in the nation's history.

Johnson formed a coalition with Northern Republicans that led to passage in the House, and with the help of Republican Senate leader [[Everett Dirksen]] with passage in the Senate early in 1964. For the first time in history, the southern filibuster was broken and The Senate finally passed its version on June 19 by vote of 73 to 27.<ref>Garth E. Pauley, \"Presidential rhetoric and interest group politics: Lyndon B. Johnson and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" ''Southern Journal of Communication'' 63.1 (1997): 1-19.</ref> The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the most powerful affirmation of equal rights ever made by Congress. It guaranteed access to public accommodations such as restaurants and places of amusement, authorized the Justice Department to bring suits does desegregate facilities in schools, gave new powers to the [[Civil Rights Commission]]; and allowed federal funds to be cut off in cases of discrimination. Furthermore racial, religious and gender discrimination was outlawed for businesses with 25 or more employees, as well as apartment houses. The South resisted until the very last moment, but as soon as the new law was signed by President Johnson on July 2, 1963, it was widely accepted across the nation. There was only a scattering of diehard opposition, typified by restaurant owner [[Lester Maddox]] in Georgia-- he became governor, but the great majority of restaurants and hotels in Georgia follow the new law as the business community realized That peaceful integration was the only way forward.<ref>Grantham, ''The South in Modern America '' (1994) 234-245. </ref><ref>  David Garrow,  ''Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference'' (1989).</ref><ref>Jeanne Theoharis, ''A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History'' (2018).</ref><ref> For primary sources see   John A.

Settlers cleared land, built houses and outbuildings, and on their own farms. The Southern rich owned large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] that dominated export agriculture and used slaves. Many were involved in the labor-intensive cultivation of tobacco, the first cash crop of Virginia. Tobacco exhausted the soil quickly, requiring that farmers regularly clear new fields.

The British took control of Savannah and Charleston, capturing a large American army in the process, and set up a network of bases inland. There were many more Loyalists in the South than in the North,<ref>The World Book: Organized Knowledge in Story and Picture, Volume 6 edited by Michael Vincent O'Shea, Ellsworth Decatur Foster, George Herbert Locke p. 4989</ref> but they were concentrated in larger coastal cities and were not great enough in number to overcome the revolutionaries. Large numbers of loyalists from South Carolina fought for the British in the [[Battle of Camden]].  The British forces at the [[Battle of Monck's Corner]] and the [[Battle of Lenud's Ferry]] consisted entirely of Loyalists with the exception of the commanding officer ([[Banastre Tarleton]]).<ref>Wilson, David.

The British Navy did arrive, but so did a stronger French fleet, and Cornwallis was trapped.

Thousands of slaves took advantage of wartime disruption to find their own freedom, catalyzed by the British Governor Dunmore of Virginia's promise of freedom for service. Many others were removed by Loyalist owners and became slaves elsewhere in the Empire. Between 1770 and 1790, there was a sharp decline in the percentage of blacks \u2013 from 61% percent to 44% in South Carolina and from 45% to 36% in Georgia.<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619\u20131877'', (Hill and Wang, 1994), p. 73.</ref>\n\nIn addition, some slaveholders were inspired to free their slaves after the Revolution. They were moved by the principles of the Revolution, and Quaker and Methodist preachers worked to encourage slaveholders to free their slaves. Planters such as [[George Washington]] often freed slaves by their wills. In the upper South, more than 10 percent of all blacks were free by 1810, a significant expansion from pre-war proportions of less than 1 percent free.<ref>Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619\u20131877'', p. 81.</ref>\n\n===Antebellum years===\n[[File:SlaveDanceand Music.jpg|thumb|[[Slavery|Slaves]] on a [[South Carolina]] plantation (''[[The Old Plantation]]'', circa 1790)]]\n[[King Cotton|Cotton]] became dominant in the lower South after 1800. After the invention of the cotton gin, short staple cotton could be grown more widely.  This led to an explosion of cotton cultivation, especially in the frontier uplands of Georgia, Alabama and other parts of the Deep South, as well as riverfront areas of the Mississippi Delta.  Migrants poured into those areas in the early decades of the 19th century, when county population figures rose and fell as swells of people kept moving west.  The expansion of cotton cultivation required more slave labor, and the institution became even more deeply an integral part of the South's economy.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://home.earthlink.net/~gfeldmeth/lec.slavery.html |title = The Peculiar Institution of American Slavery |accessdate = June 11, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071103122831/http://home.earthlink.net/~gfeldmeth/lec.slavery.html |archive-date = November 3, 2007 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nWith the opening up of frontier lands after the government forced most Native Americans to move west of the Mississippi, there was a major migration of both whites and blacks to those territories.  From the 1820s through the 1850s, more than one million enslaved Africans were transported to the Deep South in forced migration, two-thirds of them by slave traders and the others by masters who moved there. Planters in the Upper South sold slaves excess to their needs as they shifted from tobacco to mixed agriculture. Many enslaved families were broken up, as planters preferred mostly strong males for field work.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, pp. 5, 215.</ref>\n\nTwo major political issues that festered in the first half of the 19th century caused political alignment along sectional lines, strengthened the identities of North and South as distinct regions with certain strongly opposed interests, and fed the arguments over states' rights that culminated in secession and the Civil War.  One of these issues concerned the protective tariffs enacted to assist the growth of the manufacturing sector, primarily in the North.  In 1832, in resistance to federal legislation increasing tariffs, South Carolina passed an ordinance of [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], a procedure in which a state would, in effect, repeal a Federal law. Soon a naval flotilla was sent to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor, and the threat of landing ground troops was used to compel the collection of tariffs. A compromise was reached by which the tariffs would be gradually reduced, but the underlying argument over states' rights continued to escalate in the following decades.\n\n[[File:A Race Meeting at Jacksonville, Alabama by W.S. Hedges - BMA.jpg|thumb|[[Horse racing]] at [[Jacksonville, Alabama]], 1841]]\nThe second issue concerned slavery, primarily the question of whether slavery would be permitted in newly admitted states. The issue was initially finessed by political compromises designed to balance the number of \"free\" and \"slave\" states. The issue resurfaced in more virulent form, however, around the time of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], which raised the stakes by adding new territories primarily on the Southern side of the imaginary geographic divide. Congress opposed allowing slavery in these territories.\n\nBefore the Civil War, the number of immigrants arriving at Southern ports began to increase, although the North continued to receive the most immigrants. [[Hugenots]] were among the first settlers in Charleston, along with the largest number of Orthodox Jews outside of [[New York City]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  Numerous Irish immigrants settled in New Orleans, establishing a distinct [[ethnic enclave]] now known as the [[Irish Channel, New Orleans|Irish Channel]].  Germans also went to New Orleans and its environs, resulting in a large area north of the city (along the Mississippi) becoming known as the German Coast. Still greater numbers immigrated to Texas (especially after 1848), where many bought land and were farmers.  Many more German immigrants arrived in Texas after the Civil War, where they created the brewing industry in Houston and elsewhere, became grocers in numerous cities, and also established wide areas of farming.\n\nBy 1840, [[New Orleans]] was the wealthiest city in the country and the third largest in population. The success of the city was based on the growth of international trade associated with products being shipped to and from the interior of the country down the Mississippi River. New Orleans also had the largest slave market in the country, as traders brought slaves by ship and overland to sell to planters across the Deep South. The city was a cosmopolitan port with a variety of jobs that attracted more immigrants than other areas of the South.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave '', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, pp. 2\u20137</ref> Because of lack of investment, however, construction of railroads to span the region lagged behind the North. People relied most heavily on river traffic for getting their crops to market and for transportation.\n\n===Civil War===\n{{Main|American Civil War|Confederate States of America}}\n[[File:Southern_United_States_Civil_War_Map.svg|thumb|left|alt=map of United States with southeastern states highlighted in shades of red|Historic Southern United States.

The Republican Party, founded in 1854, pledged to stop the spread of slavery beyond those states where it already existed.  After Abraham Lincoln was elected the first Republican president in 1860, seven cotton states declared their secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America]] before Lincoln was inaugurated.  The United States government, both outgoing and incoming,  refused to recognize the Confederacy, and when the new Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] ordered his troops to open fire on [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in April 1861, there was an overwhelming demand, North and South, for war.  Only the state of [[Kentucky]] attempted to remain neutral, and it could only do so briefly.

Although the Confederacy had large supplies of captured munitions and many volunteers, it was slower than the Union in dealing with the border states.  By March 1862, the Union largely controlled Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, had shut down all commercial traffic from all Confederate ports, had prevented European recognition of the Confederate government, and was poised to seize New Orleans.\n[[File:EwellsDeadSpotsylvania1864crop01.jpg|thumb|Confederate dead of General Ewell's Corps who attacked the Union lines at the Battle of Spotsylvania, May 19, 1864.]]\n\nIn the four years of war 1861\u201365 the South was the primary battleground, with all but two of the major battles taking place on Southern soil. Union forces relentlessly squeezed the Confederacy, controlling the border states in 1861, the Tennessee River, the Cumberland River and New Orleans in 1862, and the Mississippi River in 1863.  In the East, however, the Confederate Army under [[Robert E. Lee]] beat off attack after attack in its defense of their capital at Richmond. But when Lee tried to move north, he was repulsed (and nearly captured) at Sharpsburg (1862) and Gettysburg (1863).\n\nThe Confederacy had the resources for a short war, but was unable to finance or supply a longer war. It reversed the traditional low-tariff policy of the South by imposing a new 15% tax on all imports from the Union. The [[Union Army|Union]] blockade stopped most commerce from entering the South, and smugglers avoided the tax, so the Confederate tariff produced too little revenue to finance the war. Inflated currency was the solution, but that created distrust of the Richmond government. Because of low investment in railroads, the Southern transportation system depended primarily on river and coastal traffic by boat; both were shut down by the [[Union Navy]]. The small railroad system virtually collapsed, so that by 1864 internal travel was so difficult that the Confederate economy was crippled.\n\nThe Confederate cause was hopeless by the time Atlanta fell and [[William T. Sherman]] marched through Georgia in late 1864, but the rebels fought on, refusing to give up their independence until Lee's army surrendered in April 1865. All the Confederate forces surrendered, and the region moved into the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\nThe South suffered much more than the North overall, as the Union strategy of attrition warfare meant that Lee could not replace his casualties, and the total war waged by Sherman, Sheridan and other Union armies devastated the infrastructure and caused widespread poverty and distress. The Confederacy suffered military losses of 95,000 men killed in action and 165,000 who died of disease, for a total of 260,000,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/wars19c.htm#ACW |title = Nineteenth Century Death Tolls: American Civil War |accessdate = August 22, 2006 }}</ref> out of a total white Southern population at the time of around 5.5 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americancivilwar.org.uk/news_those-confederate-states_42.htm |title=American Civil War, Those Confederate States |accessdate=2007-07-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928050453/http://www.americancivilwar.org.uk/news_those-confederate-states_42.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2006 }}</ref> Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and about 18% in the South.<ref>\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gySktxKYPGoC&pg=PA7&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Toward a social history of the American Civil War: exploratory essays]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106175459/https://books.google.com/books?id=gySktxKYPGoC&pg=PA7&dq&hl=en |date=November 6, 2011 }}''\".

Because of states' reluctance to grant voting rights to freedmen, Congress instituted Reconstruction governments. It established military districts and governors to rule over the South until new governments could be established. Many white Southerners who had actively supported the Confederacy were temporarily disenfranchised. Rebuilding was difficult as people grappled with the effects of a new labor economy of a free market in the midst of a widespread agricultural depression. In addition, what limited infrastructure the South had was mostly destroyed by the war. At the same time, the North was rapidly industrializing. To avoid the social effects of the war, most of the Southern states initially passed [[Black Codes (United States)|black codes]]. Eventually, these were mostly legally nullified by federal law and anti-Confederate legislatures, which existed for a short time during Reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04102005-230201/unrestricted/J_ThesisChapter3.pdf |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060910091017/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04102005-230201/unrestricted/J_ThesisChapter3.pdf |url-status = dead |archive-date = September 10, 2006 |title = Chapter 3: An Easy Adjustment to the Post War Nation: Pensacola Between 1865 and 1870 |date = December 4, 2010 |publisher = fsu.edu }}</ref>\n\nThere were thousands of people on the move, as African Americans tried to reunite families separated by slaves sales, and sometimes migrated for better opportunities in towns or other states. Other freed people moved from plantation areas to cities or towns for a chance to get different jobs. At the same time, whites returned from refuges to reclaim plantations or town dwellings. In some areas, many whites returned to the land to farm for a while. Some freedpeople left the South altogether for states such as Ohio and Indiana, and later, Kansas. Thousands of others joined the migration to new opportunities in the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta bottomlands and Texas.\n\nWith passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States]] (which outlawed slavery), the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] (which granted full U.S. citizenship to [[African American]]s) and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]] (which extended the right to vote to [[African American]] males), African Americans in the South were made free citizens and were given the right to vote.

The warm sunny weather of the South proved ideal for building 60 percent of the Army's new training camps and nearly half the new airfields, In all 40 percent of spending on new military installations went to the South. For example it, and sleepy [[Starke, Florida]] a town of 1500 people in 1940, became the base of [[Camp Blanding]]. By March 1941, 20,000 men were constructing a permanent camp for 60,000 soldiers.  Money flowed freely for the war effort, as over $4 billion went into military facilities in the South, and another $5 billion into defense plants. Major shipyards were built In Virginia, Charleston, and Along the Gulf Coast. Huge warplane plants were opened in Dallas-Fort Worth and Georgia.

The region had finally reached the take off stage into industrial and commercial growth, although its income and wage levels lagged well behind the national average. Nevertheless, as [[George B.

Rapid expansion in industries such as autos, telecommunications, textiles, technology, banking, and aviation gave some states in the South an industrial strength to rival large states elsewhere in the country.  By the 2000 census, the South (along with the West) was leading the nation in population growth.

Hodges]] in North Carolina, and [[Estes Kefauver]] in Tennessee. They promoted subsidies for small farmers, and supported the nascent labor union movement. An essential condition for this North-South coalition was for northern liberals to ignore southern racism. After 1945, however, northern liberals -- led especially by young [[Hubert Humphrey]] of Minnesota --increasingly made civil rights a central issue. They convinced Truman to join them in 1948. The conservative Southern Democrats \u2013 the [[Dixiecrat]]s \u2013 took control of the state parties in half the region and ran [[Strom Thurmond]] for president against Truman. Thurmond carried only the deep South, but that threat was enough to guarantee the national Democratic Party in 1952 in 1956 would not make civil rights a major issue. In 1956, 101 of the 128 southern congressmen and senators signed the [[Southern Manifesto]] denouncing forced desegregation.<ref>Brent J.

Southern liberals were in a quandary \u2013 most of them kept quiet or moderated their liberalism, others switched sides, and the rest continued on the liberal path. One by one, the last group was defeated; historian Numan V. Bartley states, \"Indeed, the very word 'liberal' gradually disappeared from the southern political lexicon, except as a term of opprobrium.\"<ref>Numan V.

The sport was developed in the Deep South in the early 20th century, with stock car racing's historic mecca being [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], where cars initially raced on the wide, flat beachfront before the construction of [[Daytona International Speedway]]. Though the sport has attained a following throughout the United States, a majority of NASCAR races continue to take place at Southern tracks.\n\n===Basketball===\n[[Basketball]] is very popular throughout the Southern United States as both a recreational and spectator sport, particularly in the states of [[Kentucky]] and [[North Carolina]] which are home to several historically prominent [[college basketball]] programs, the most prominent of which are the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]], [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]], [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke Blue Devils]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]]. \n\n[[National Basketball Association|NBA]] teams based in the South include the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Houston Rockets]], [[Oklahoma City Thunder]], [[Dallas Mavericks]], [[Washington Wizards]], [[Charlotte Hornets]], [[Atlanta Hawks]], [[Orlando Magic]], [[Memphis Grizzlies]], [[New Orleans Pelicans]], and [[Miami Heat]].\n\n===Golf===\n[[Golf]] is a popular recreational sport in most areas of the South, with the region's warm climate allowing it to host many professional tournaments and numerous destination golf resorts, particularly in the state of [[Florida]].

With a combination of intimidation, fraud and violence by paramilitary groups, they suppressed black voting and turned Republicans out of office. From 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven states ratified new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised most black voters and many poor white voters. This disfranchisement persisted for six decades into the 20th century, depriving blacks and poor whites of all political representation. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries. They had no one to represent their interests, resulting in state legislatures consistently underfunding programs and services, such as schools, for blacks and poor whites.<ref>Michael Perman, ''Pursuit of Unity: A Political History of the American South'' (2009)</ref> Scholars have characterized pockets of the Southern United States as being \"authoritarian enclaves\" from Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Act.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691133386/paths-out-of-dixie|title=Paths Out of Dixie|last=Mickey|first=Robert|date=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13338-6|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo28381225.html|title=How to Save a Constitutional Democracy|last=|first=|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kuo|first=Didi|date=2019|title=Comparing America: Reflections on Democracy across Subfields|journal=Perspectives on Politics|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=788\u2013800|doi=10.1017/S1537592719001014|issn=1537-5927}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/boundary-control/subnational-authoritarianism-in-the-united-states/85765543D8C22FBA874D213C5D73144E|title=Subnational Authoritarianism in the United States|last=Gibson|first=Edward L.|date=2013|website=Boundary Control: Subnational Authoritarianism in Federal Democracies|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref>\n\nWith the collapse of the Republican Party in nearly all parts of the South, the region became known as the \u201c[[Solid South]]\u201d, and the Democratic Party after 1900 moved to a system of primaries to select their candidates. Victory in a primary was [[tantamount to election]]. From the late 1870s to the 1960s, only rarely was a state or national Southern politician a Republican, apart from a few Appalachian mountain districts.<ref>Key; ''Southern Politics State and Nation'' (1984)</ref><ref>Gordon B. McKinney (2010); ''Southern Mountain Republicans 1865\u20131900''. University of North Carolina Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8078-9724-9}}</ref> Republicans, however, continued to control parts of the Appalachian Mountains and compete for power in the Border States. Apart from a few states (such as the [[Byrd Organization|Byrd Machine]] in Virginia, the [[E. H. Crump|Crump]] [[Political machine|Machine]] in Memphis), and a few other local organizations, the Democratic Party itself was very lightly organized. It managed primaries but party officials had little other role. To be successful a politician built his own network of friends, neighbors and allies. Reelection was the norm, and the result from 1910 to the late 20th century was that Southern Democrats in Congress had accumulated seniority, and automatically took the chairmanships of all committees.<ref>The classic study is V.O. Key, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiESAAAAYAAJ ''Southern politics in State and Nation'' (1949)]</ref> By the 1940s the Supreme Court began to find disfranchisement measures like the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d and the white primary unconstitutional. Southern legislatures quickly passed other measures to keep blacks disfranchised, even after suffrage was extended more widely to poor whites. Because white Democrats controlled all the Southern seats in Congress they had outsize power in Congress and could sidetrack or [[filibuster]] efforts by Northerners to pass legislation against lynching, for example.\n\nIncreasing support for civil rights legislation by the national Democratic Party beginning in 1948 caused segregationist Southern Democrats to nominate [[Strom Thurmond]] on a third-party \u201cDixiecrat\u201d ticket in 1948. These Dixiecrats returned to the party by 1950, but Southern Democrats held off Republican inroads in the suburbs by arguing that only they could defend the region from the onslaught of northern liberals and the [[civil rights movement]]. In response to the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling of 1954, 101 Southern congressmen (19 senators, 82 House members of which 99 were Southern Democrats and 2 were Republicans) in 1956 denounced the Brown decisions as a \"clear abuse of judicial power [that] climaxes a trend in the federal judiciary undertaking to legislate in derogation of the authority of Congress and to encroach upon the reserved rights of the states and the people.\" The manifesto lauded, \u201c...those states which have declared the intention to resist enforced integration by any lawful means\u201d.

Virginia closed schools in [[Warren County, Virginia|Warren County]], [[Prince Edward County, Virginia|Prince Edward County]], [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], and [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] rather than integrate, but no other state followed suit. Democratic governors [[Orval Faubus]] of Arkansas, [[Ross Barnett]] of Mississippi, [[John Connally]] of Texas, [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia, and, especially, [[George Wallace]] of Alabama resisted integration and appealed to a rural and [[blue-collar]] electorate.<ref>Numan V.

The transition to a Republican stronghold in the South took decades. First, the states started voting Republican in presidential elections, except for native sons [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976 and [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 and 1996. Then the states began electing Republican senators and finally governors. Georgia was the last state to do so, with [[Sonny Perdue]] taking the governorship in 2002.<ref>Earl Black and Merle Black, ''The Rise of Southern Republicans'' (2003)</ref> In addition to its middle class and business base, Republicans cultivated the religious right and attracted strong majorities from the evangelical or Fundamentalist vote, mostly Southern Baptists, which had not been a distinct political force prior to 1980.<ref>William C.

A13].</ref>\n\n===Presidents from the South===\nThe South produced nine of the first twelve Presidents prior to the Civil War. For more than a century after the Civil War, no politician from an antebellum slave state became President unless he either moved North (like [[Woodrow Wilson]]) or was vice president when the president died in office (like [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Harry Truman]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]). In 1976, [[Jimmy Carter]] defied this trend and became the first Southerner to break the pattern since [[Zachary Taylor]] in 1848. The South has produced five of the last nine American Presidents: [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1963\u201369), [[Jimmy Carter]] (1977\u201381), [[George H. W. Bush]] (1989\u201393), [[Bill Clinton]] (1993\u20132001) and [[George W. Bush]] (2001\u20132009). Johnson was a native of Texas, while Carter is from Georgia, and Clinton from Arkansas. While George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush began their political careers in Texas, they were both born in [[New England]] and have their ancestral roots in that region.\n\n===Other politicians and political movements===\n[[File:Bill Clinton 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton]], newly-elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] speaking with [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1978. Carter and Clinton were both [[Southern Democrats]] and elected to the presidencies in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] and [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].]]\nThe South has produced various nationally known politicians and political movements. In 1948, a group of Democratic congressmen, led by Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] of South Carolina, split from the Democrats in reaction to an anti-segregation speech given by [[Minneapolis]] mayor and future senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]]. They founded the States Rights Democratic or [[Dixiecrat]] Party. During that year's Presidential election, the party ran Thurmond as its candidate and he carried four Deep South states.\n\nIn the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 Presidential election]], Alabama Governor [[George C. Wallace]] ran for President on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket. Wallace ran a \u201claw and order\u201d campaign similar to that of Republican candidate, [[Richard Nixon]]. Nixon's [[Southern Strategy]] of gaining electoral votes downplayed race issues and focused on culturally conservative values, such as family issues, patriotism, and cultural issues that appealed to [[Southern Baptists]].\n\nIn [[United States elections, 1994|the 1994 mid-term elections]], another Southern politician, [[Newt Gingrich]], led the [[Republican Revolution]], ushering in twelve years of GOP control of the House. Gingrich became [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] in 1995 and served until his resignation in 1999. [[Tom DeLay]] was the most powerful Republican leader in Congress{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} until he was indicted under criminal charges in 2005 and was forced to step aside by Republican rules.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Apart from [[Bob Dole]] from Kansas (1985\u201396), the recent Republican Senate Leaders have been Southerners: [[Howard Baker]] (1981\u20131985) of Tennessee, [[Trent Lott]] (1996\u20132003) of Mississippi, [[Bill Frist]] (2003\u20132006) of Tennessee, and [[Mitch McConnell]] (2007\u2013present) of Kentucky.\n\nThe Republicans candidates for President have won the South in elections since [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], except for [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]]. The region is not, however, entirely monolithic, and every successful Democratic candidate since 1976 has claimed at least three Southern states. [[Barack Obama]] won Florida, Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina, and Virginia in 2008 but did not repeat his victory in North Carolina during his 2012 reelection campaign.<ref>\u201c[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-10/romney-bus-tour-charts-course-for-battlegrounds-obama-won Romney Bus Tour Charts Course for Battlegrounds Obama Won]\u201d.

They were defeated by settlers in a series of wars ending in the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Seminole Wars]], and most were removed west to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma and Kansas), but large numbers of Native Americans managed to stay behind by blending into the surrounding society.  This was especially true of the wives of Euro-American merchants and miners.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Civil rights movement===\n{{Main|Civil rights movement|Montgomery bus boycott|Martin Luther King Jr.}}\n\nThe South witnessed two major events in the lives of 20th century African Americans: the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and the [[American Civil Rights Movement]].\n\nThe Great Migration began during World War I, hitting its high point during World War II. During this migration, blacks left the South to find work in Northern factories and other sectors of the economy.<ref>Katzman, 1996</ref>\n\nThe migration also empowered the growing Civil Rights Movement. While the movement existed in all parts of the United States, its focus was against disfranchisement and the Jim Crow laws in the South. Most of the major events in the movement occurred in the South, including the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], the Mississippi [[Freedom Summer]], the March on [[Selma, Alabama]], and the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] In addition, some of the most important writings to come out of the movement were written in the South, such as King's \"[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]\".  Most of the civil rights landmarks can be found around the South. The [[Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument]] in Birmingham includes the [[Birmingham Civil Rights Institute]] which details Birmingham's role as the center of the Civil Rights Movement. The [[16th Street Baptist Church]] served as a rallying point for coordinating and carrying out the [[Birmingham campaign]]as well as the adjacent [[Kelly Ingram Park]] that served as ground zero for the infamous children's protest that eventually led to the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] has been rededicated as a place of \"Revolution and Reconciliation\" and is now the setting of moving sculptures related to the battle for Civil Rights in the city, both are center pieces of the [[Birmingham Civil Rights District]]. The [[Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site]] in Atlanta includes a museum that chronicles the American Civil Rights Movement as well as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s boyhood home on Auburn Avenue.

A complex interaction of factors came together unexpectedly in the period 1954-1965 to make the momentous changes possible. The Supreme Court had taken the first initiative in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (1954) making segregation of public schools unconstitutional. Enforcement was rapid in the North and border states, but  was deliberately stopped in the South by the movement called [[Massive Resistance]], sponsored by rural segregationists who largely controlled the state legislatures. Southern liberals, who counseled moderation, where shouted down by both sides and have limited impact. Much more significant was the [[Civil Rights Movement]], especially the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) headed by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. It largely displaced the old, much more moderate NAACP in taking leadership roles. King organize massive demonstrations, that seiozed massive media attention in an era when network television news was an innovative and universally watched phenomenon.<ref>Graham Allison, [https://www.amazon.com/Framing-South-Hollywood-Television-Struggle/dp/0801866154/   ''Framing the South: Hollywood, television, and race during the Civil Rights Struggle''  (2001).]</ref>  SCLC, student activists and smaller local organizations staged demonstrations across the South.  National  attention focused on Birmingham, Alabama, where protesters deliberately provoked [[Bull Connor]] and his police forces by using young teenagers as demonstrators \u2013 and Connor arrested 900 on one day alone. The next day Connor unleashed billy clubs, police dogs, and high-pressure water hoses to disperse and punish the young demonstrators with a brutality that horrified the nation. It was very bad for business, and for the image of a modernizing progressive urban South. President John F. Kennedy, who had been calling for moderation, threatened to use federal troops to restore order in Birmingham. The result in Birmingham was  compromise by which the new mayor opened the library, golf courses, and other city facilities to both races, against the backdrop of church bombings and assassinations.<ref>Diane McWhorter, ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama: The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution'' (2001)</ref><ref> Dewey W. Grantham, ''The South in Modern America'' (1994) 228-234.</ref>\n\nConfrontations continued to escalate,  In summer 1963, there were 800 demonstrations in 200 southern cities and towns, with over 100,000 participants, and 15,000 arrests. In Alabama  in June 1963 Governor [[George Wallace]] escalated the crisis by defying  court orders to admit the first two  black students to the University of Alabama.<ref>Dan T. Carter,''The politics of rage: George Wallace, the origins of the new conservatism, and the transformation of American politics'' (LSU Press, 2000).</ref> Kennedy responded by sending Congress a comprehensive civil rights bill, and ordered Attorney General Robert Kennedy to file federal lawsuits against segregated schools, and to deny funds for discriminatory programs. Doctor King launched a massive march on Washington in August, 1963, bringing out 200,000 demonstrators  in front of the Lincoln Memorial, the largest political assembly in the nation's history. The Kennedy administration now gave full-fledged support to the civil rights movement, but powerful southern congressman blocked any legislation.<ref>Robert E. Gilbert, \"John F. Kennedy and civil rights for black Americans.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 12.3 (1982): 386-399. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27547837 Online] </ref> After Kennedy was assassinated President Lyndon Johnson called for immediate passage of Kennedy civil rights legislation as a memorial to the martyred president. Johnson formed a coalition with Northern Republicans that led to passage in the House, and with the help of Republican Senate leader [[Everett Dirksen]] with passage in the Senate early in 1964. For the first time in history, the southern filibuster was broken and The Senate finally passed its version on June 19 by vote of 73 to 27.<ref>Garth E. Pauley, \"Presidential rhetoric and interest group politics: Lyndon B. Johnson and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" ''Southern Journal of Communication'' 63.1 (1997): 1-19.</ref> The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the most powerful affirmation of equal rights ever made by Congress. It guaranteed access to public accommodations such as restaurants and places of amusement, authorized the Justice Department to bring suits does desegregate facilities in schools, gave new powers to the [[Civil Rights Commission]]; and allowed federal funds to be cut off in cases of discrimination. Furthermore racial, religious and gender discrimination was outlawed for businesses with 25 or more employees, as well as apartment houses. The South resisted until the very last moment, but as soon as the new law was signed by President Johnson on July 2, 1963, it was widely accepted across the nation. There was only a scattering of diehard opposition, typified by restaurant owner [[Lester Maddox]] in Georgia-- he became governor, but the great majority of restaurants and hotels in Georgia follow the new law as the business community realized That peaceful integration was the only way forward.<ref>Grantham, ''The South in Modern America '' (1994) 234-245. </ref><ref>  David Garrow,  ''Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference'' (1989).</ref><ref>Jeanne Theoharis, ''A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History'' (2018).</ref><ref> For primary sources see   John A.

He serves as chancellor and CEO of [[Regent University]] and chairman of the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN). He appears daily on [[The 700 Club]], CBN's flagship television program.\n\nOn Robertson's own account, he was not a serious Christian until he underwent personal difficulty. He graduated near the top of his class at [[Yale Law School]] in 1955, but failed the New York bar exam. Failing the bar cost Robertson opportunities at post-graduate employment, and in the ensuing months of what he later described as disappointment, embarrassment, and unemployment, he became a born-again Christian and began a career as a minister.\n\nSpanning over five decades, Robertson has had a career as the founder of several major organizations and corporations as well as a university: The [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN), the [[ABC Family Worldwide Inc.|International Family Entertainment Inc.]] ([[ABC Family|ABC Family Channel]]), [[Regent University]], the [[American Center for Law & Justice]] (ACLJ), the Founders Inn and Conference Center, the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], an [[L-1011]] Flying Hospital, [[Operation Blessing International|Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation]], and [[CBN Asia]].<ref name=\"officialbio\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.org/about.cfm |title=About Us |publisher=[[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] |access-date=2007-03-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070308053058/http://www.cc.org/about.cfm |archivedate = March 8, 2007}}</ref> He is a best-selling author and the host of ''[[The 700 Club]],'' a Christian News and TV program broadcast live weekdays on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] (formerly ABC Family) via satellite from CBN studios, as well as on channels throughout the United States, and on CBN network [[affiliates]] worldwide.<ref name=\"officialbio\" />\n\nThe son of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Absalom Willis Robertson|A.

His parents were [[Absalom Willis Robertson]] (1887\u20131971), a [[conservative Democrat]]ic [[United States Senate|Senator]], and his wife Gladys Churchill ([[n\u00e9e]] Willis; 1897\u20131968), was a housewife and a musician.

His family includes four children, among them [[Gordon P. Robertson]] and Tim Robertson and, as of mid-2016, 14 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.\n\nAt a young age, Robertson was nicknamed ''Pat'' by his six-year-old brother, Willis Robertson, Jr., who enjoyed patting him on the cheeks when he was a baby while saying \"pat, pat, pat\". As he got older, Robertson thought about which first name he would like people to use. He considered \"Marion\" to be effeminate, and \"M. Gordon\" to be affected, so he opted for his childhood nickname \"Pat\".<ref name=\"davidjohnmarley\" /> His strong awareness for the importance of names in the creation of a public image showed itself again during his presidential run when he threatened to sue [[NBC]] news for calling him a \"television evangelist\", which later became \"televangelist\", at a time when [[Jimmy Swaggart]] and [[Jim Bakker]] were objects of scandal.\n\n===Education and military service===\nWhen he was eleven, Robertson was enrolled in the preparatory [[McDonogh School]] outside [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. From 1940 until 1946 he attended [[The McCallie School]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where he graduated with honors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regent.edu/about-regent/leadership/m-g-pat-robertson|title=M.G. \"Pat\" Robertson|website=Regent University|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Freemasons in America: Inside the Secret Society|last=Jeffers|first=H.

Former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Pete McCloskey|Paul \"Pete\" McCloskey, Jr.]], who served with Robertson in Korea, wrote a public letter that said that Robertson was actually spared combat duty when his powerful father, a U.S. Senator, intervened on his behalf, and that Robertson spent most of his time in an office in [[Japan]]. According to McCloskey, his time in the service was not in combat, but as the \"liquor officer\" responsible for keeping the officers' clubs supplied with alcohol. Robertson filed a $35 million [[libel]] suit against McCloskey in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title=Evangelist sues over combat story|work=The Globe and Mail. |location=Toronto, Ont.|date=October 23, 1986|page=A.16}}</ref> He dropped the case in 1988, before it came to trial and paid McCloskey's court costs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Robertson's Libel Suit by Judge Ex-Congressman Ruled the Legal Victor|work=Philadelphia Daily News|date=March 7, 1988|page=14}}</ref> According to a newspaper report from 1986, Robertson confirmed elements of McCloskey's allegations and said that he never saw front-line duty.<ref name=anderson-1986>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jack|title=Marine questions Pat Roberson's war record|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sjFTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aIMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3086%2C1635685|access-date=September 5, 2013|newspaper=United Feature Syndicate, appearing in Mohave Daily Miner|date=September 17, 1986|quote=He confirmed the bare bones of McCloskey's letter&nbsp;\u2014 that he had been pulled off the ''Breckenridge'' in Japan and was later assigned to division headquarters in Korea&nbsp;\u2014 but said he was aghast at his fellow Marine's charges&nbsp;...

He then went on to receive a law degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1955, near the top of his class. However, he failed his first and only attempt at the New York bar exam necessary for admission to the [[New York State Bar Association]].<ref>[http://www.patrobertson.com/SpiritualJourney/SomethingMissing.asp \"Spiritual Journey\"], The Official Site of Pat Robertson.</ref> Shortly thereafter he underwent a religious conversion, and decided against pursuing a career in law. Instead, Robertson attended [[New York Theological Seminary|The Biblical Seminary in New York]], where he received a [[Master of Divinity]] degree in 1959.\n\n===Christian broadcasting and higher education career===\n[[File:Regent University Robertson Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Regent University]] - Robertson Hall, home to the School of Law and Robertson School of Government]]\nIn 1956 Robertson met Dutch missionary Cornelius Vanderbreggen, who impressed Robertson both by his lifestyle and his message. Vanderbreggen quoted [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (3:5, 6), \"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths\", which Robertson considers to be the \"guiding principle\" of his life. He was ordained as a minister of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] in 1961.\n\nIn 1960, Robertson established the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. He started it by buying a small [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] station in nearby [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]]. Later in 1977 he purchased a local [[Leased access]] [[Cable television|cable TV]] channel in the Hampton Roads area and called it CBN. Originally he went door-to-door in Virginia Beach, Hampton Roads, and other surrounding areas asking Christians to buy cable boxes so that they could receive his new channel. He also canvassed local churches in the Virginia Beach area to do the same, and solicited donations through public speaking engagements at local churches and on CBN. One of his friends, John Giminez, the pastor of Rock Church Virginia Beach, was influential in helping Robertson establish CBN with donations, as well as offering the services of volunteers from his church.\n\nCBN is now seen in 180 countries and broadcast in 71 languages. He founded the CBN Cable Network, which was renamed the CBN Family Channel in 1988 and later simply the Family Channel. When the Family Channel became too profitable for Robertson to keep it under the CBN umbrella without endangering CBN's [[non-profit]] status, he formed [[International Family Entertainment Inc.]] in 1990 with the Family Channel as its main subsidiary. Robertson sold the Family Channel to the [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] in 1997, which renamed it Fox Family. A condition of the sale was that the station would continue airing Robertson's television program, ''[[The 700 Club]]'', twice a day in perpetuity, regardless of any changes of ownership. The channel is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and run as [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]. On December 3, 2007, Robertson resigned as chief executive of CBN; he was succeeded by his son, [[Gordon P. Robertson|Gordon]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Web Site Design and Hosting by LogicalSolutions.net \u2013 An Internet Marketing Company |url=http://www.splc.org/newsflash.asp?id=1655&year |title=Student Press Law Center \u2013 News Flashes |publisher=Splc.org |date=October 18, 2007 |access-date=2009-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212011926/http://www.splc.org/newsflash.asp?id=1655&year |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nRobertson founded CBN University in 1977 on CBN's Virginia Beach campus. It was renamed [[Regent University]] in 1989. Robertson serves as its [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]]. He is also founder and president of the [[American Center for Law & Justice]], a major public interest law firm headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]] and associated with [[Regent University School of Law]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], that defends Constitutional freedoms and [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] ideals.

Robertson said he would pursue the nomination only if three million people signed up to volunteer for his campaign by September 1987. Three million responded, and by the time Robertson announced he would be running in September 1987, he also had raised millions of dollars for his campaign fund. He surrendered his ministerial credentials and turned leadership of CBN over to his son, Tim. His campaign, however, against incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H. W. Bush]], was seen as a long shot.\n\nRobertson ran on a standard [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] platform. Among his policies, he wanted to ban [[pornography]], reform the education system,<!--eliminate [[Conrail]] and [[Amtrak]], and --> and eliminate departments such as the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. He also supported a [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] requiring a [[Balanced budget amendment|balanced federal budget]].\n\nRobertson's campaign got off to a strong second-place finish in the [[Iowa caucuses]], ahead of Bush.<ref>[http://iowapresidentialpolitics.com/caucus_info/bergenaswinebrenner.html \"About the caucuses: Meaningful test\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215102651/http://iowapresidentialpolitics.com/caucus_info/bergenaswinebrenner.html |date=December 15, 2005 }}, Johan Bergenas, Iowa Presidential Politics.com.</ref> He did poorly in the subsequent [[New Hampshire primary]], however, and was unable to be competitive once the multiple-state primaries began.

Robertson was the founder and co-chairman of [[International Family Entertainment Inc.]] (IFE).\n\nFormed in 1990, IFE produced and distributed family entertainment and information programming worldwide. IFE's principal business was The Family Channel, a satellite delivered cable-television network with 63 million U.S. subscribers. IFE, a publicly held company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], was sold in 1997 to [[Fox Kids]] Worldwide, Inc. for $1.9 billion, whereupon it was renamed [[Fox Family Channel]]. [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] acquired FFC in 2001 and its name was changed again, to ABC Family. The network was renamed to [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] on January 12, 2016, though Robertson's sale of the channel continues to require Freeform to carry four hours of CBN/''700 Club'' programming per weekday, along with CBN's yearly [[telethon]].\n\nRobertson is a global businessman with media holdings in [[Asia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Africa]]. He struck a deal with [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]-based [[General Nutrition Center]] to produce and market a weight-loss shake he created and promoted on ''The 700 Club''.\n\nIn 1999, Robertson entered into a joint venture with the [[Bank of Scotland]] to provide financial services in the United States.

Failing the bar cost Robertson opportunities at post-graduate employment, and in the ensuing months of what he later described as disappointment, embarrassment, and unemployment, he became a born-again Christian and began a career as a minister.\n\nSpanning over five decades, Robertson has had a career as the founder of several major organizations and corporations as well as a university: The [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN), the [[ABC Family Worldwide Inc.|International Family Entertainment Inc.]] ([[ABC Family|ABC Family Channel]]), [[Regent University]], the [[American Center for Law & Justice]] (ACLJ), the Founders Inn and Conference Center, the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], an [[L-1011]] Flying Hospital, [[Operation Blessing International|Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation]], and [[CBN Asia]].<ref name=\"officialbio\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.org/about.cfm |title=About Us |publisher=[[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] |access-date=2007-03-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070308053058/http://www.cc.org/about.cfm |archivedate = March 8, 2007}}</ref> He is a best-selling author and the host of ''[[The 700 Club]],'' a Christian News and TV program broadcast live weekdays on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] (formerly ABC Family) via satellite from CBN studios, as well as on channels throughout the United States, and on CBN network [[affiliates]] worldwide.<ref name=\"officialbio\" />\n\nThe son of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Absalom Willis Robertson|A.

His family includes four children, among them [[Gordon P. Robertson]] and Tim Robertson and, as of mid-2016, 14 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.\n\nAt a young age, Robertson was nicknamed ''Pat'' by his six-year-old brother, Willis Robertson, Jr., who enjoyed patting him on the cheeks when he was a baby while saying \"pat, pat, pat\". As he got older, Robertson thought about which first name he would like people to use. He considered \"Marion\" to be effeminate, and \"M. Gordon\" to be affected, so he opted for his childhood nickname \"Pat\".<ref name=\"davidjohnmarley\" /> His strong awareness for the importance of names in the creation of a public image showed itself again during his presidential run when he threatened to sue [[NBC]] news for calling him a \"television evangelist\", which later became \"televangelist\", at a time when [[Jimmy Swaggart]] and [[Jim Bakker]] were objects of scandal.\n\n===Education and military service===\nWhen he was eleven, Robertson was enrolled in the preparatory [[McDonogh School]] outside [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. From 1940 until 1946 he attended [[The McCallie School]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where he graduated with honors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regent.edu/about-regent/leadership/m-g-pat-robertson|title=M.G. \"Pat\" Robertson|website=Regent University|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Freemasons in America: Inside the Secret Society|last=Jeffers|first=H.

According to McCloskey, his time in the service was not in combat, but as the \"liquor officer\" responsible for keeping the officers' clubs supplied with alcohol. Robertson filed a $35 million [[libel]] suit against McCloskey in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title=Evangelist sues over combat story|work=The Globe and Mail. |location=Toronto, Ont.|date=October 23, 1986|page=A.16}}</ref> He dropped the case in 1988, before it came to trial and paid McCloskey's court costs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Robertson's Libel Suit by Judge Ex-Congressman Ruled the Legal Victor|work=Philadelphia Daily News|date=March 7, 1988|page=14}}</ref> According to a newspaper report from 1986, Robertson confirmed elements of McCloskey's allegations and said that he never saw front-line duty.<ref name=anderson-1986>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jack|title=Marine questions Pat Roberson's war record|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sjFTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aIMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3086%2C1635685|access-date=September 5, 2013|newspaper=United Feature Syndicate, appearing in Mohave Daily Miner|date=September 17, 1986|quote=He confirmed the bare bones of McCloskey's letter&nbsp;\u2014 that he had been pulled off the ''Breckenridge'' in Japan and was later assigned to division headquarters in Korea&nbsp;\u2014 but said he was aghast at his fellow Marine's charges&nbsp;...

He then went on to receive a law degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1955, near the top of his class. However, he failed his first and only attempt at the New York bar exam necessary for admission to the [[New York State Bar Association]].<ref>[http://www.patrobertson.com/SpiritualJourney/SomethingMissing.asp \"Spiritual Journey\"], The Official Site of Pat Robertson.</ref> Shortly thereafter he underwent a religious conversion, and decided against pursuing a career in law. Instead, Robertson attended [[New York Theological Seminary|The Biblical Seminary in New York]], where he received a [[Master of Divinity]] degree in 1959.\n\n===Christian broadcasting and higher education career===\n[[File:Regent University Robertson Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Regent University]] - Robertson Hall, home to the School of Law and Robertson School of Government]]\nIn 1956 Robertson met Dutch missionary Cornelius Vanderbreggen, who impressed Robertson both by his lifestyle and his message. Vanderbreggen quoted [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (3:5, 6), \"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths\", which Robertson considers to be the \"guiding principle\" of his life. He was ordained as a minister of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] in 1961.\n\nIn 1960, Robertson established the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. He started it by buying a small [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] station in nearby [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]]. Later in 1977 he purchased a local [[Leased access]] [[Cable television|cable TV]] channel in the Hampton Roads area and called it CBN. Originally he went door-to-door in Virginia Beach, Hampton Roads, and other surrounding areas asking Christians to buy cable boxes so that they could receive his new channel. He also canvassed local churches in the Virginia Beach area to do the same, and solicited donations through public speaking engagements at local churches and on CBN. One of his friends, John Giminez, the pastor of Rock Church Virginia Beach, was influential in helping Robertson establish CBN with donations, as well as offering the services of volunteers from his church.\n\nCBN is now seen in 180 countries and broadcast in 71 languages. He founded the CBN Cable Network, which was renamed the CBN Family Channel in 1988 and later simply the Family Channel. When the Family Channel became too profitable for Robertson to keep it under the CBN umbrella without endangering CBN's [[non-profit]] status, he formed [[International Family Entertainment Inc.]] in 1990 with the Family Channel as its main subsidiary. Robertson sold the Family Channel to the [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] in 1997, which renamed it Fox Family. A condition of the sale was that the station would continue airing Robertson's television program, ''[[The 700 Club]]'', twice a day in perpetuity, regardless of any changes of ownership. The channel is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and run as [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]. On December 3, 2007, Robertson resigned as chief executive of CBN; he was succeeded by his son, [[Gordon P. Robertson|Gordon]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Web Site Design and Hosting by LogicalSolutions.net \u2013 An Internet Marketing Company |url=http://www.splc.org/newsflash.asp?id=1655&year |title=Student Press Law Center \u2013 News Flashes |publisher=Splc.org |date=October 18, 2007 |access-date=2009-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212011926/http://www.splc.org/newsflash.asp?id=1655&year |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nRobertson founded CBN University in 1977 on CBN's Virginia Beach campus.

Robertson said he would pursue the nomination only if three million people signed up to volunteer for his campaign by September 1987. Three million responded, and by the time Robertson announced he would be running in September 1987, he also had raised millions of dollars for his campaign fund. He surrendered his ministerial credentials and turned leadership of CBN over to his son, Tim. His campaign, however, against incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H. W. Bush]], was seen as a long shot.\n\nRobertson ran on a standard [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] platform. Among his policies, he wanted to ban [[pornography]], reform the education system,<!--eliminate [[Conrail]] and [[Amtrak]], and --> and eliminate departments such as the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. He also supported a [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] requiring a [[Balanced budget amendment|balanced federal budget]].\n\nRobertson's campaign got off to a strong second-place finish in the [[Iowa caucuses]], ahead of Bush.<ref>[http://iowapresidentialpolitics.com/caucus_info/bergenaswinebrenner.html \"About the caucuses: Meaningful test\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215102651/http://iowapresidentialpolitics.com/caucus_info/bergenaswinebrenner.html |date=December 15, 2005 }}, Johan Bergenas, Iowa Presidential Politics.com.</ref> He did poorly in the subsequent [[New Hampshire primary]], however, and was unable to be competitive once the multiple-state primaries began.

Robertson was the founder and co-chairman of [[International Family Entertainment Inc.]] (IFE).\n\nFormed in 1990, IFE produced and distributed family entertainment and information programming worldwide. IFE's principal business was The Family Channel, a satellite delivered cable-television network with 63 million U.S. subscribers. IFE, a publicly held company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], was sold in 1997 to [[Fox Kids]] Worldwide, Inc. for $1.9 billion, whereupon it was renamed [[Fox Family Channel]]. [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] acquired FFC in 2001 and its name was changed again, to ABC Family. The network was renamed to [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] on January 12, 2016, though Robertson's sale of the channel continues to require Freeform to carry four hours of CBN/''700 Club'' programming per weekday, along with CBN's yearly [[telethon]].\n\nRobertson is a global businessman with media holdings in [[Asia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Africa]]. He struck a deal with [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]-based [[General Nutrition Center]] to produce and market a weight-loss shake he created and promoted on ''The 700 Club''.\n\nIn 1999, Robertson entered into a joint venture with the [[Bank of Scotland]] to provide financial services in the United States. However, the move was met with criticism in the UK due to Robertson's views on [[homosexuality]]. Robertson commented that \"In Europe, the big word is tolerance. You tolerate everything. Homosexuals are riding high in the media ... And in Scotland, you can't believe how strong the homosexuals are.\" Shortly afterward, the Bank of Scotland canceled the venture.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/361736.stm |title=The Company File &#124; Bank drops evangelist |work=BBC News |date=June 5, 1999 |access-date=2009-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/gay-jibe-may-lead-to-bank-boycott-1097726.html |title=Gay jibe may lead to bank boycott |newspaper=The Independent |date=June 3, 1999 |access-date=2010-02-01 | location=London | first=Mary | last=Braid}}</ref>\n\nRobertson's extensive business interests have earned him a net worth estimated between $200 million and $1 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/news/pat_quotes/palst.htm |title=Palast investigates Pat Robertson |publisher=Sullivan-county.com |date= |access-date=2009-07-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, in the aftermath of the [[Rwandan genocide]], Robertson solicited donations for his charity organization [[Operation Blessing International]] to provide medical supplies to refugees in neighboring [[Zaire]] (present-day Congo), where  Robertson had allegedly negotiated a diamond-mining contract with Zairian dictator [[Mobutu Sese Seko]].<ref>Marlow Stern, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/07/doc-mission-congo-alleges-pat-robertson-exploited-post-genocide-rwandans-for-diamonds.html \"\u2018Mission Congo\u2019 Alleges Pat Robertson Exploited Post-Genocide Rwandans For Diamonds\"], Daily Beast, September 7, 2013.</ref> According to two Operation Blessing pilots who reported the incident to the state of [[Virginia]] for investigation, rather than delivering relief supplies to refugees, the organization's planes were primarily used to haul diamond-mining equipment to Robertson's mines in Zaire.<ref>David John Marley, Pat Robertson: An American Life (Rowman & Littlefield, 2007), p. 190.</ref>\n\nAccording to a June 2, 1999, article in ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'',<ref>Sizemore, Bill. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20160224071247/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68443640.html Robertson, Liberian Leader Hope to Strike Gold in Coastal Africa].\" ''The Virginian-Pilot''.
