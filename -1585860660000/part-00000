In April 1918 he was arrested for [[sedition]], and his 75-minute speech from the dock became a celebrated text for Scottish left-wingers. He was sentenced to five years' penal servitude, but was released after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|November armistice]].\n\nMaclean believed that Scottish workers were especially fitted to lead the revolution, and talked of \"[[Celtic communism]]\", inspired by clan spirit. But his launch of a [[Scottish Workers Republican Party]] and a [[Communist Labour Party (Scotland)|Scottish Communist Party]] were largely unsuccessful. Although he had been appointed [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] representative in Scotland, he was not in harmony with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], even though it had absorbed the [[British Socialist Party]], to which he had belonged. In captivity, Maclean had been on hunger strike, and prolonged force-feeding had permanently affected his health. He collapsed during a speech and died of pneumonia, aged forty-four.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nMaclean was born in [[Pollokshaws]], then on the outskirts of [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]].  His father Daniel ({{lang-gd|D\u00f2mhnall MacIllEathain}}; 1843\u20131888) was a potter who hailed from [[Bo'ness]] <ref>1871 and 1881 Census</ref> and his mother Ann (1846\u20131914) came from [[Corpach]].<ref>Knox, William, (1984) ''Scottish Labour Leaders 1918-1939: A Biographical Dictionary'' (Ed. Dr. William Knox), Edinburgh, 1984, p.179. {{ISBN|0-906391-40-7}}</ref><ref>Aldred, Guy A., ''John Maclean'', Glasgow, 1940, p.17</ref><ref>{{Citation\n|publisher = Socialist Reproduction\n|location = London\n|author = John MacLean\n|title = The war after the war\n|date = 1974\n|ol = 25431964M\n}}</ref>  His parents spoke [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]<ref name=hi>https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/scotsmen-stand-by-ireland-john-maclean-and-the-irish-revolution/</ref> and he was raised in a [[Calvinist]] household, Maclean trained as a schoolteacher under the auspices of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church]] and then attended part-time classes at the [[University of Glasgow]], graduating with a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degree in 1904. (Maclean often used the letters M.A. after his name when being published).\n\n===Political development===\nMaclean first came to politics through the Pollokshaws Progressive Union and [[Robert Blatchford]]'s ''[[Merrie England (book)|Merrie England]]''. He became convinced that the living standards of the [[working-classes]] could only be improved by social revolution and it was as a [[Marxist]] that he joined the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF), and remained in the organisation as it formed the [[British Socialist Party]].\n\nIn 1906, Maclean gave a series of speeches in Pollokshaws which led to the formation of an SDF branch there, and through these, he met [[James D. MacDougall]], who became his strongest supporter for the remainder of his life.<ref>Brian John Ripley and J. McHugh, ''John Maclean'', p.28</ref>\n\nMaclean was also an active member of the [[Co-operative movement]] and it was his prominent role that led the Renfrewshire Co-operative Societies to pressurise local school boards to provide facilities for adult classes in economics.<ref>Knox, p.181</ref>\n\n===Marxist educator===\nBy the time of [[World War I]], his [[socialism]] was of a revolutionary nature, although he worked with others on the [[Clyde Workers' Committee]] who were more reformist in outlook, such as his friend [[James Maxton]]. He heavily opposed the war, as he felt it was a war of [[imperialism]] which divided workers from one another, as he explained in his [[:Image:Redcly182.jpg|letter to ''Forward'']] ([[s:The attitude of the B.S.P.|transcript]]).<ref>Maclean, Forward</ref><ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redclyindexpeople.html Red Clydeside: Key political figures of the Red Clydeside period<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nHis politics made him well known to the authorities of the day, and on 27 October 1915 he was arrested under the [[Defence of the Realm Act]]<ref>Strathclyde</ref> and Govan School Board sacked him from his teaching post at [[Lorne Street Primary School]].<ref>McGuigan, \"Govan School Board had their excuse to dismiss MacLean from his post as a teacher\"</ref> As a consequence, he became a full-time Marxist [[lecturer]] and organiser, educating other [[Glaswegian]] workers in Marxist theory. He would later found the [[Scottish Labour College]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]], he was active in anti-war circles and was imprisoned in 1916 for breaching the [[Defense of the Realm Act]],<ref name=hi/> but was released in 1917 after demonstrations following the [[February Revolution]] in Russia.\n\n===Relationship with Russia===\nIn January 1918 Maclean was elected to the chair of the Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets and a month later appointed Bolshevik [[consul (representative)|consul]] in Scotland.<ref>Thatcher, Ian D., (1992) \"John Maclean: Soviet Versions\", in ''History'' Vol. 77, Issue 251, p.424</ref><ref>''The Times'', Thursday, 28 November 1918, \"Bolshevist Candidate: Mr. Barnes's Fight at Glasgow\"</ref> He established a Consulate at 12 South Portland Street in Glasgow but was refused recognition by the British Government.<ref>Aldred, p.21</ref>\n\nAs a revolutionary enemy of what he saw as an imperialist war, Maclean was fiercely opposed to the stance adopted by the leadership of the BSP around [[H. M. Hyndman]]. However he was not to be a part of the new leadership which replaced Hyndman in 1916.\n\n===Ireland===\nMaclean was a supporter of Home Rule for Ireland but originally opposed an Independent Ireland because he was afraid that an Independent Catholic Ireland would be disastrous. He later became committed to Irish independence as part of a worldwide anti-imperialist struggle.<ref name=jstor/> He wrote a pamphlet called 'The Irish Tragedy: Scotland's Disgrace' which sold 20,000 copies. Following the [[Easter Rising]] he had contacts with members of the Scottish Divisional Board of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]<ref>http://newsnet.scot/archive/thistle-and-shamrock-entwined/</ref> In the summer of 1907 he went on a speaking tour of Ireland, here he made friends with [[Jim Larkin]].<ref name=jstor>{{Cite journal |jstor = 23197125|title = John Maclean, Socialism, and the Easter Rising|last1 = Young|first1 = James D.|journal = Saothar|volume = 16|pages = 23\u201333|year = 1991}}</ref> When the Easter Rising happened he distanced himself from it because he viewed it to be a [[Trotskyism#Capitalist or bourgeois-democratic revolution|Bourgeois-democratic revolution]] and in contradiction with his [[pacifist]] principles.<ref name=jstor/>\n\nIn July 1919 he visited Dublin for the first time and gave speeches. By the end of his life his attitude to Ireland had been radicalised and he gave up his opposition to [[physical force Irish republicanism]]. He described the [[Irish War of Independence]] as \"The Irish fight for freedom\", defended killings of \"scabs and traitors to their race\", and condoned the assassination of a [[magistrate]], Alan Bell, saying \"What self-respecting man or woman can blame the Irish for ridding the earth of such a foul skunk?\". He saw the war in Ireland as strengthening the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, arguing that \"Irish Sinn F\u00e9iners, who make no profession of socialism or communism, ... are doing more to help Russia and the revolution than all we professed Marxian Bolsheviks in Britain\".<ref name=hi/>\n\nHe saw Irish independence as being a positive thing for Scotland. Maclean believed that the British \"starve [Irish] youths out of their native land\" and that the ending of this British policy in Ireland would decrease Irish emigration to Scotland, thus allowing for more opportunities for Scottish workers.<ref name=hi/>\n\nWhen the [[Government of the Irish Free State]] started executing its opponents during the [[Irish Civil War]] Maclean wrote a letter of protest to [[W. T. Cosgrave]] expressing his \"dismay\".<ref name=hi/>\n\n===Trial and imprisonment for sedition (1918)===\nOn 15 April 1918, Maclean was arrested for sedition.<ref>Milton (1973), p. 164</ref> He was refused bail and his trial fixed for 9 May in [[Edinburgh]]. He conducted his own defence in a defiant manner, refusing to plead and when asked if he objected to any of the jurors replying, \"I object to the whole lot of them.\" The prosecution case was based on the testimony of witnesses who had attended his meetings, who quoted extracts from his speeches using notes they had written up from memory after the meeting. Maclean objected to his words being taken out of context, saying. \"The main parts of my speech, in which my themes are developed are omitted. I want to expose the trickery of the British government and their police and their lawyers.\"<ref>Milton (1973) p. 168</ref>\n\nThis speech from the dock has passed into folklore for the Scottish [[Left-wing politics|left]]. Lasting for some 75 minutes, Maclean's speech began :\n\n[[File:Maclean trial 1918.jpg|thumb|250px|Maclean delivering his famous 'Speech from the Dock'.]]\n<blockquote>It has been said that they cannot fathom my motive. For the full period of my active life I have been a teacher of [[economics]] to the working classes, and my contention has always been that [[capitalism]] is rotten to its foundations, and must give place to a new society. I had a lecture, the principal heading of which was \"Thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not kill\", and I pointed out that as a consequence of the robbery that goes on in all civilised countries today, our respective countries have had to keep armies, and that inevitably our armies must clash together. On that and on other grounds, I consider capitalism the most infamous, bloody and evil system that mankind has ever witnessed. My language is regarded as extravagant language, but the events of the past four years have proved my contention.</blockquote>\n\nHe went on to say:\n\n<blockquote>I wish no harm to any human being, but I, as one man, am going to exercise my [[freedom of speech]]. No human being on the face of the earth, no government is going to take from me my right to speak, my right to protest against wrong, my right to do everything that is for the benefit of mankind. I am not here, then, as the accused; I am here as the accuser of capitalism dripping with blood from head to foot.</blockquote>\n\nHis speech concluded:\n\n<blockquote>I have taken up unconstitutional action at this time because of the abnormal circumstances and because precedent has been given by the British government. I am a [[socialist]], and have been fighting and will fight for an absolute reconstruction of society for the benefit of all. I am proud of my conduct. I have squared my conduct with my intellect, and if everyone had done so this war would not have taken place. I act square and clean for my principles. .... No matter what your accusations against me may be, no matter what reservations you keep at the back of your head, my appeal is to the [[working class]]. I appeal exclusively to them because they and they only can bring about the time when the whole world will be in one brotherhood, on a sound economic foundation. That, and that alone, can be the means of bringing about a re-organisation of society. That can only be obtained when the people of the world get the world, and retain the world.</blockquote>\n\nHe was sentenced to five years' penal servitude, and imprisoned in [[Peterhead prison]] near [[Aberdeen]]. However, a militant campaign was launched for his release:\n\n<blockquote>The call 'Release John Maclean was never silent. Every week the socialist papers kept up the barrage and reminded their readers that in Germany [[Karl Liebknecht]] was already free, while in 'democratic' Britain John Maclean was lying in a prison cell being forcibly fed twice a day by an India rubber tube forced down his gullet or up his nose. 'Is the Scottish Office' asked Forward. 'to be stained with a crime in some respects even more horrible and revolting, more callous and cruel, than that which the Governors of Ireland perpetrated on the shattered body of [[James Connolly]]?' <ref>Milton (1973) p. 179</ref></blockquote>\n\nFollowing the armistice on 11 November, he was released on 3 December 1918, returning to [[Glasgow]] to a tumultuous welcome.\n\nEleven days later, Maclean was the official [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for the constituency of [[Glasgow Gorbals (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Gorbals]]; he won a respectable vote but failed to unseat the sitting MP, a former Labour MP who had defected to support for Lloyd George's coalition government.\n\n===Formation of the Communist Party===\nAs the BSP was the main constituent organisation which merged into the newly formed [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], Maclean was alienated from the new party despite his support for the [[Communist International]]. He developed a belief that workers in Scotland could develop in a revolutionary direction more swiftly than their comrades in England and Wales, and in 1920 he attempted to found a [[Scottish Communist Party]]. This group renamed itself the [[Communist Labour Party (UK)|Communist Labour Party]] and dropped Maclean's distinctive positions, so he left in disgust.  He attempted to found a new Scottish Communist Party, without success. It seems that he may have become a member of the [[Socialist Labour Party (1903-1980)|Socialist Labour Party]] at this time.\n\nIn 1923 Maclean founded the [[Scottish Workers Republican Party]], which combined [[Communism]] with a belief in [[Scottish independence]].\n\nHe opposed the [[British Empire]] saying in November 1922 \"I hold that the British empire is the greatest menace to the human race...the best interest of humanity can therefore be served by the break-up of the British empire.<ref>https://www.marxists.org/archive/maclean/works/1922-irish-scot.htm</ref>\n\nMaclean's call for a Communist Republic of Scotland was based on the belief that traditional Scottish Gaelic society was structured along the lines of \"community\". He argued that \"the communism of [[Scottish clan|the clans]] must be re-established on a modern basis\" and raised the slogan \"back to community and forward to communism\".<ref>Maclean, John (1920) [http://www.marxists.org/archive/maclean/works/1922-swr.htm All Hail, the Scottish Workers Republic!]</ref>\n\n[[File:John Maclean's casket being removed from his Pollokshaws home.jpg|thumb|John Maclean's casket being removed from his Pollokshaws home on Auldhouse Road.]]\n\n===Death, legacy, reputation and in popular culture===\n====Death====\nHis stay in Peterhead Prison in 1918 caused a considerable deterioration in his health, being force fed through hunger strikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caledonian.ac.uk/radicalglasgow/chapters/johnmclean.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006070352/http://www.caledonian.ac.uk/radicalglasgow/chapters/johnmclean.html |archivedate=2006-10-06 }} John Maclean, Radical Glasgow, Glasgow Caledonian University</ref> Milton quotes a letter that Agnes, his wife, wrote to [[Edwin C. Fairchild]] (a leading member of the [[British Socialist Party]]):\n\n<blockquote>Well, John has been on hunger strike since July. He resisted the forcible feeding for a good while, but submitted to the inevitable. Now he is being fed by a stomach tube twice daily. He has aged very much and has the look of a man who is going through torture... Seemingly anything is law in regard to John. I hope you will make the atrocity public. We must get him out of their clutches. It is nothing but slow murder...<ref>Milton (1973) p. 178</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen he died in 1923, aged 44, his reputation was such that many thousands of people lined the streets of Glasgow to see his funeral procession pass. In the intervening time Maclean's funeral has become known as the largest Glasgow ever saw. He left a legacy that has subsequently been claimed by both the Scottish Nationalist and Labour movements, making him rare in this respect amongst Scotland's historical figures. The modern [[Scottish Socialist Party]] lay claim to Maclean's political legacy, particularly the [[Scottish Republican Socialist Party|Scottish Republican Socialist Movement]] previously a faction (or \"platform\") within the SSP.\n\nAccording to a BBC Television documentary aired in January 2015 he collapsed while giving an outdoor speech and died of pneumonia.

In April 1918 he was arrested for [[sedition]], and his 75-minute speech from the dock became a celebrated text for Scottish left-wingers. He was sentenced to five years' penal servitude, but was released after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|November armistice]].\n\nMaclean believed that Scottish workers were especially fitted to lead the revolution, and talked of \"[[Celtic communism]]\", inspired by clan spirit. But his launch of a [[Scottish Workers Republican Party]] and a [[Communist Labour Party (Scotland)|Scottish Communist Party]] were largely unsuccessful. Although he had been appointed [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] representative in Scotland, he was not in harmony with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], even though it had absorbed the [[British Socialist Party]], to which he had belonged. In captivity, Maclean had been on hunger strike, and prolonged force-feeding had permanently affected his health. He collapsed during a speech and died of pneumonia, aged forty-four.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nMaclean was born in [[Pollokshaws]], then on the outskirts of [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]].  His father Daniel ({{lang-gd|D\u00f2mhnall MacIllEathain}}; 1843\u20131888) was a potter who hailed from [[Bo'ness]] <ref>1871 and 1881 Census</ref> and his mother Ann (1846\u20131914) came from [[Corpach]].<ref>Knox, William, (1984) ''Scottish Labour Leaders 1918-1939: A Biographical Dictionary'' (Ed. Dr. William Knox), Edinburgh, 1984, p.179. {{ISBN|0-906391-40-7}}</ref><ref>Aldred, Guy A., ''John Maclean'', Glasgow, 1940, p.17</ref><ref>{{Citation\n|publisher = Socialist Reproduction\n|location = London\n|author = John MacLean\n|title = The war after the war\n|date = 1974\n|ol = 25431964M\n}}</ref>  His parents spoke [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]<ref name=hi>https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/scotsmen-stand-by-ireland-john-maclean-and-the-irish-revolution/</ref> and he was raised in a [[Calvinist]] household, Maclean trained as a schoolteacher under the auspices of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church]] and then attended part-time classes at the [[University of Glasgow]], graduating with a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degree in 1904. (Maclean often used the letters M.A. after his name when being published).\n\n===Political development===\nMaclean first came to politics through the Pollokshaws Progressive Union and [[Robert Blatchford]]'s ''[[Merrie England (book)|Merrie England]]''. He became convinced that the living standards of the [[working-classes]] could only be improved by social revolution and it was as a [[Marxist]] that he joined the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF), and remained in the organisation as it formed the [[British Socialist Party]].\n\nIn 1906, Maclean gave a series of speeches in Pollokshaws which led to the formation of an SDF branch there, and through these, he met [[James D. MacDougall]], who became his strongest supporter for the remainder of his life.<ref>Brian John Ripley and J. McHugh, ''John Maclean'', p.28</ref>\n\nMaclean was also an active member of the [[Co-operative movement]] and it was his prominent role that led the Renfrewshire Co-operative Societies to pressurise local school boards to provide facilities for adult classes in economics.<ref>Knox, p.181</ref>\n\n===Marxist educator===\nBy the time of [[World War I]], his [[socialism]] was of a revolutionary nature, although he worked with others on the [[Clyde Workers' Committee]] who were more reformist in outlook, such as his friend [[James Maxton]]. He heavily opposed the war, as he felt it was a war of [[imperialism]] which divided workers from one another, as he explained in his [[:Image:Redcly182.jpg|letter to ''Forward'']] ([[s:The attitude of the B.S.P.|transcript]]).<ref>Maclean, Forward</ref><ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redclyindexpeople.html Red Clydeside: Key political figures of the Red Clydeside period<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nHis politics made him well known to the authorities of the day, and on 27 October 1915 he was arrested under the [[Defence of the Realm Act]]<ref>Strathclyde</ref> and Govan School Board sacked him from his teaching post at [[Lorne Street Primary School]].<ref>McGuigan, \"Govan School Board had their excuse to dismiss MacLean from his post as a teacher\"</ref> As a consequence, he became a full-time Marxist [[lecturer]] and organiser, educating other [[Glaswegian]] workers in Marxist theory. He would later found the [[Scottish Labour College]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]], he was active in anti-war circles and was imprisoned in 1916 for breaching the [[Defense of the Realm Act]],<ref name=hi/> but was released in 1917 after demonstrations following the [[February Revolution]] in Russia.\n\n===Relationship with Russia===\nIn January 1918 Maclean was elected to the chair of the Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets and a month later appointed Bolshevik [[consul (representative)|consul]] in Scotland.<ref>Thatcher, Ian D., (1992) \"John Maclean: Soviet Versions\", in ''History'' Vol. 77, Issue 251, p.424</ref><ref>''The Times'', Thursday, 28 November 1918, \"Bolshevist Candidate: Mr. Barnes's Fight at Glasgow\"</ref> He established a Consulate at 12 South Portland Street in Glasgow but was refused recognition by the British Government.<ref>Aldred, p.21</ref>\n\nAs a revolutionary enemy of what he saw as an imperialist war, Maclean was fiercely opposed to the stance adopted by the leadership of the BSP around [[H. M. Hyndman]]. However he was not to be a part of the new leadership which replaced Hyndman in 1916.\n\n===Ireland===\nMaclean was a supporter of Home Rule for Ireland but originally opposed an Independent Ireland because he was afraid that an Independent Catholic Ireland would be disastrous. He later became committed to Irish independence as part of a worldwide anti-imperialist struggle.<ref name=jstor/> He wrote a pamphlet called 'The Irish Tragedy: Scotland's Disgrace' which sold 20,000 copies. Following the [[Easter Rising]] he had contacts with members of the Scottish Divisional Board of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]<ref>http://newsnet.scot/archive/thistle-and-shamrock-entwined/</ref> In the summer of 1907 he went on a speaking tour of Ireland, here he made friends with [[Jim Larkin]].<ref name=jstor>{{Cite journal |jstor = 23197125|title = John Maclean, Socialism, and the Easter Rising|last1 = Young|first1 = James D.|journal = Saothar|volume = 16|pages = 23\u201333|year = 1991}}</ref> When the Easter Rising happened he distanced himself from it because he viewed it to be a [[Trotskyism#Capitalist or bourgeois-democratic revolution|Bourgeois-democratic revolution]] and in contradiction with his [[pacifist]] principles.<ref name=jstor/>\n\nIn July 1919 he visited Dublin for the first time and gave speeches. By the end of his life his attitude to Ireland had been radicalised and he gave up his opposition to [[physical force Irish republicanism]]. He described the [[Irish War of Independence]] as \"The Irish fight for freedom\", defended killings of \"scabs and traitors to their race\", and condoned the assassination of a [[magistrate]], Alan Bell, saying \"What self-respecting man or woman can blame the Irish for ridding the earth of such a foul skunk?\". He saw the war in Ireland as strengthening the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, arguing that \"Irish Sinn F\u00e9iners, who make no profession of socialism or communism, ... are doing more to help Russia and the revolution than all we professed Marxian Bolsheviks in Britain\".<ref name=hi/>\n\nHe saw Irish independence as being a positive thing for Scotland. Maclean believed that the British \"starve [Irish] youths out of their native land\" and that the ending of this British policy in Ireland would decrease Irish emigration to Scotland, thus allowing for more opportunities for Scottish workers.<ref name=hi/>\n\nWhen the [[Government of the Irish Free State]] started executing its opponents during the [[Irish Civil War]] Maclean wrote a letter of protest to [[W. T. Cosgrave]] expressing his \"dismay\".<ref name=hi/>\n\n===Trial and imprisonment for sedition (1918)===\nOn 15 April 1918, Maclean was arrested for sedition.<ref>Milton (1973), p. 164</ref> He was refused bail and his trial fixed for 9 May in [[Edinburgh]]. He conducted his own defence in a defiant manner, refusing to plead and when asked if he objected to any of the jurors replying, \"I object to the whole lot of them.\" The prosecution case was based on the testimony of witnesses who had attended his meetings, who quoted extracts from his speeches using notes they had written up from memory after the meeting. Maclean objected to his words being taken out of context, saying. \"The main parts of my speech, in which my themes are developed are omitted. I want to expose the trickery of the British government and their police and their lawyers.\"<ref>Milton (1973) p. 168</ref>\n\nThis speech from the dock has passed into folklore for the Scottish [[Left-wing politics|left]]. Lasting for some 75 minutes, Maclean's speech began :\n\n[[File:Maclean trial 1918.jpg|thumb|250px|Maclean delivering his famous 'Speech from the Dock'.]]\n<blockquote>It has been said that they cannot fathom my motive. For the full period of my active life I have been a teacher of [[economics]] to the working classes, and my contention has always been that [[capitalism]] is rotten to its foundations, and must give place to a new society. I had a lecture, the principal heading of which was \"Thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not kill\", and I pointed out that as a consequence of the robbery that goes on in all civilised countries today, our respective countries have had to keep armies, and that inevitably our armies must clash together. On that and on other grounds, I consider capitalism the most infamous, bloody and evil system that mankind has ever witnessed. My language is regarded as extravagant language, but the events of the past four years have proved my contention.</blockquote>\n\nHe went on to say:\n\n<blockquote>I wish no harm to any human being, but I, as one man, am going to exercise my [[freedom of speech]]. No human being on the face of the earth, no government is going to take from me my right to speak, my right to protest against wrong, my right to do everything that is for the benefit of mankind. I am not here, then, as the accused; I am here as the accuser of capitalism dripping with blood from head to foot.</blockquote>\n\nHis speech concluded:\n\n<blockquote>I have taken up unconstitutional action at this time because of the abnormal circumstances and because precedent has been given by the British government. I am a [[socialist]], and have been fighting and will fight for an absolute reconstruction of society for the benefit of all. I am proud of my conduct. I have squared my conduct with my intellect, and if everyone had done so this war would not have taken place. I act square and clean for my principles. .... No matter what your accusations against me may be, no matter what reservations you keep at the back of your head, my appeal is to the [[working class]]. I appeal exclusively to them because they and they only can bring about the time when the whole world will be in one brotherhood, on a sound economic foundation. That, and that alone, can be the means of bringing about a re-organisation of society. That can only be obtained when the people of the world get the world, and retain the world.</blockquote>\n\nHe was sentenced to five years' penal servitude, and imprisoned in [[Peterhead prison]] near [[Aberdeen]]. However, a militant campaign was launched for his release:\n\n<blockquote>The call 'Release John Maclean was never silent. Every week the socialist papers kept up the barrage and reminded their readers that in Germany [[Karl Liebknecht]] was already free, while in 'democratic' Britain John Maclean was lying in a prison cell being forcibly fed twice a day by an India rubber tube forced down his gullet or up his nose. 'Is the Scottish Office' asked Forward. 'to be stained with a crime in some respects even more horrible and revolting, more callous and cruel, than that which the Governors of Ireland perpetrated on the shattered body of [[James Connolly]]?' <ref>Milton (1973) p. 179</ref></blockquote>\n\nFollowing the armistice on 11 November, he was released on 3 December 1918, returning to [[Glasgow]] to a tumultuous welcome.\n\nEleven days later, Maclean was the official [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for the constituency of [[Glasgow Gorbals (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Gorbals]]; he won a respectable vote but failed to unseat the sitting MP, a former Labour MP who had defected to support for Lloyd George's coalition government.\n\n===Formation of the Communist Party===\nAs the BSP was the main constituent organisation which merged into the newly formed [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], Maclean was alienated from the new party despite his support for the [[Communist International]]. He developed a belief that workers in Scotland could develop in a revolutionary direction more swiftly than their comrades in England and Wales, and in 1920 he attempted to found a [[Scottish Communist Party]]. This group renamed itself the [[Communist Labour Party (UK)|Communist Labour Party]] and dropped Maclean's distinctive positions, so he left in disgust.  He attempted to found a new Scottish Communist Party, without success. It seems that he may have become a member of the [[Socialist Labour Party (1903-1980)|Socialist Labour Party]] at this time.\n\nIn 1923 Maclean founded the [[Scottish Workers Republican Party]], which combined [[Communism]] with a belief in [[Scottish independence]].\n\nHe opposed the [[British Empire]] saying in November 1922 \"I hold that the British empire is the greatest menace to the human race...the best interest of humanity can therefore be served by the break-up of the British empire.<ref>https://www.marxists.org/archive/maclean/works/1922-irish-scot.htm</ref>\n\nMaclean's call for a Communist Republic of Scotland was based on the belief that traditional Scottish Gaelic society was structured along the lines of \"community\". He argued that \"the communism of [[Scottish clan|the clans]] must be re-established on a modern basis\" and raised the slogan \"back to community and forward to communism\".<ref>Maclean, John (1920) [http://www.marxists.org/archive/maclean/works/1922-swr.htm All Hail, the Scottish Workers Republic!]</ref>\n\n[[File:John Maclean's casket being removed from his Pollokshaws home.jpg|thumb|John Maclean's casket being removed from his Pollokshaws home on Auldhouse Road.]]\n\n===Death, legacy, reputation and in popular culture===\n====Death====\nHis stay in Peterhead Prison in 1918 caused a considerable deterioration in his health, being force fed through hunger strikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caledonian.ac.uk/radicalglasgow/chapters/johnmclean.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006070352/http://www.caledonian.ac.uk/radicalglasgow/chapters/johnmclean.html |archivedate=2006-10-06 }} John Maclean, Radical Glasgow, Glasgow Caledonian University</ref> Milton quotes a letter that Agnes, his wife, wrote to [[Edwin C. Fairchild]] (a leading member of the [[British Socialist Party]]):\n\n<blockquote>Well, John has been on hunger strike since July. He resisted the forcible feeding for a good while, but submitted to the inevitable. Now he is being fed by a stomach tube twice daily. He has aged very much and has the look of a man who is going through torture... Seemingly anything is law in regard to John. I hope you will make the atrocity public. We must get him out of their clutches. It is nothing but slow murder...<ref>Milton (1973) p. 178</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen he died in 1923, aged 44, his reputation was such that many thousands of people lined the streets of Glasgow to see his funeral procession pass. In the intervening time Maclean's funeral has become known as the largest Glasgow ever saw. He left a legacy that has subsequently been claimed by both the Scottish Nationalist and Labour movements, making him rare in this respect amongst Scotland's historical figures. The modern [[Scottish Socialist Party]] lay claim to Maclean's political legacy, particularly the [[Scottish Republican Socialist Party|Scottish Republican Socialist Movement]] previously a faction (or \"platform\") within the SSP.\n\nAccording to a BBC Television documentary aired in January 2015 he collapsed while giving an outdoor speech and died of pneumonia.

{"title_page": "List of radio stations in Canterbury", "text_new": "{{use New Zealand English|date=August 2019}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{short description|wikimedia list article}}\n\nThis is a '''list of [[radio stations]] in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]''' in [[New Zealand]].\n\nDuring October 2010, several FM radio stations changed frequencies as spacing was being standardised to 0.8&nbsp;MHz. Frequency changes continue as broadcast licences are renewed. Most frequencies are now spaced 0.8&nbsp;MHz apart, with the first station at a frequency of 88.9&nbsp;MHz. Infill stations are allocated to the 0.4&nbsp;MHz frequency in the buffer between two other stations.\n\nThe Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 have allowed community stations to play a greater role in the Canterbury community. Compass FM 104.9 FM has existed as a not-for-profit community radio station in the [[North Canterbury]] area since June 2011. Several radio stations have also ceased operation as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes. In [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], for instance, Volcano Radio 88.5FM was broadcasting 80 shows commercial-free from February 2008, but the quakes damaged equipment and forced the building to be demolished. Shows on the station included Project Lyttelton, Monday Report, children's programme Lyttelease, classical music show Vienna Volcano, and [[old school metal]] and [[hard rock]] show The Molten Metal.<ref>[http://www.volcanoradio.co.nz/index.php Volcano Radio 88.5 FM website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321220850/http://www.volcanoradio.co.nz/index.php |date=21 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://molten-metal-show.podomatic.com Molten Metal Show]</ref>\n\n==Christchurch and North Canterbury stations==\n===FM and AM===\nThe following stations broadcast in the [[Christchurch]] area including [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] and the [[Hurunui District]].\n\nMost high-power FM radio stations serving Christchurch broadcast from the [[Sugarloaf (Christchurch)|Sugarloaf]] transmitter, located on the [[Port Hills]] due south of the central city. Stations broadcasting from this transmitter also serve the majority of the [[Canterbury Plains]], as far south as the [[Rangitata River]]. The suburb of Sumner is served by infill FM transmitters located at [[Southshore, New Zealand|Southshore]] and Sumner Head, as hills block the signal from Sugarloaf.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"

Zealand|Canterbury]]''' in [[New Zealand]].\n\nDuring October 2010, several FM radio stations changed frequencies as spacing was being standardised to 0.8&nbsp;MHz. Frequency changes continue as broadcast licences are renewed. Most frequencies are now spaced 0.8&nbsp;MHz apart, with the first station at a frequency of 88.9&nbsp;MHz. Infill stations are allocated to the 0.4&nbsp;MHz frequency in the buffer between two other stations.\n\nThe Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 have allowed community stations to play a greater role in the Canterbury community. Compass FM 104.9 FM has existed as a not-for-profit community radio station in the [[North Canterbury]] area since June 2011. Several radio stations have also ceased operation as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes. In [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], for instance, Volcano Radio 88.5FM was broadcasting 80 shows commercial-free from February 2008, but the quakes damaged equipment and forced the building to be demolished. Shows on the station included Project Lyttelton, Monday Report, children's programme Lyttelease, classical music show Vienna Volcano, and [[old school metal]] and [[hard rock]] show The Molten Metal.<ref>[http://www.volcanoradio.co.nz/index.php Volcano Radio 88.5 FM website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321220850/http://www.volcanoradio.co.nz/index.php |date=21 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://molten-metal-show.podomatic.com Molten Metal Show]</ref>\n\n==Christchurch and North Canterbury stations==\n===FM and AM===\nThe following stations broadcast in the [[Christchurch]] area including [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] and the [[Hurunui District]].\n\nMost high-power FM radio stations serving Christchurch broadcast from the [[Sugarloaf (Christchurch)|Sugarloaf]] transmitter, located on the [[Port Hills]] due south of the central city. Stations broadcasting from this transmitter also serve the majority of the [[Canterbury Plains]], as far south as the [[Rangitata River]]. The suburb of Sumner is served by infill FM transmitters located at [[Southshore, New Zealand|Southshore]] and Sumner Head, as hills block the signal from Sugarloaf.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"

Going through several printings, it was followed by sequels, including ''Hell's Angels of the Deep'' (1932).\n\n==Conspiracy theorist==\nIn 1931, he started giving conferences in different Canadian clubs on the topic of \"International conspiracy,\" which was subdivided in two main subjects: \"International communism\" and \"International capitalism,\" both being controlled by the Illuminati and what he called the \"international bankers.\" The last, according to Carr, are represented mainly by the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] and the [[Rockefeller]] families.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff, ''La Foire aux illumin\u00e9s : \u00c9sot\u00e9risme, th\u00e9orie du complot, extr\u00e9misme'' (\"The Illuminati fair: Esotericism, Plot Theory, Extremism\"), Paris, Mille et une nuits, 2005, p. 431</ref> \n \nAfter working for the [[Intelligence Branch (Canadian Forces)|Canadian Intelligence Service]] during World War II, Carr wrote ''Checkmate in the North'' (1944), a book in which he wrote that an invasion of the [[Axis forces]] was supposed to take place in the area of the CFB Goose Bay. In 1944 and 1945, he gave other conferences on world conspiracies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn the 1950s, after he retired from the Navy, Carr's writings turned essentially to [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] themes from a firmly l-[[Christians|Christian]] standpoint. With his ''Pawns in the Game'' (1955) and ''Red Fog over America'' (1955), he became one of the most famous postwar conspiracy theorists (500,000 copies of ''Pawns in the Game'' were sold before his death).<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff, ''op. cit''., p. 25</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Political Research Associates]], a group studying right-wing extremism:\n\n<blockquote>Carr promoted the [[anti-Semitic]] variant on conspiracism with books such as ''Pawns in the Game'' and ''Red Fog over America''. Carr believes that an age-old Jewish ''Illuminati'' banking conspiracy used radio-transmitted mind control on behalf of Lucifer to construct a one world government. The secret nexus of the plot was supposedly the international [[Bilderberger]] meetings on banking policy. The anti-Semitic Noontide Press distributed ''Pawns in the Game'' for many years.<ref>[http://www.publiceye.org/apocalyptic/Dances_with_Devils_1-01.html] \"Dances with Devils: Satan, the Devil, and the Antichrist, Freemasons Jews and the Forged Protocols Variations on Conspiracist Themes,\" The Website of the Political Associates, same opinion in Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff, ''op. cit.''</ref></blockquote>\n\nCarr's works were notably influenced by the writings of [[Nesta Webster]] and the well known French [[hoaxer]] [[L\u00e9o Taxil]] (see [[Taxil hoax]]). He also referred to the theories of [[Augustin Barruel]] and [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]], who both explained the [[French Revolution]] as a plot by [[Freemasonry]] and linked to the German [[Illuminati]] of [[Adam Weishaupt]], who is frequently associated to the conspiracy theory of the [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]].<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/carr.html] \"William Guy Carr repeats the lies,\" ''Pawns in the Game'' reviewed by the Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon Ancient Free and Accepted Masons and History of Conspiracy Theory 101.</ref>\n\nOne of Carr's books published after his death, ''The Conspiracy to Destroy All Existing Governments and Religions'', clearly refers to Robison's main work: ''Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe Carried on in the Secret Meetings of Freemasons, Illuminati and Reading Societies'' (1798).\n\nAccording to the French philosopher and historian [[Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff]], Carr's works, especially ''Pawns in the Game'', \"largely contributed to popularise the themes of anti-Masonic conspiracism in the United States and in Canada; first, it reached the Christian fundamentalist milieu (mainly concerned with his 'Luciferian' conspiracies), then the whole far-right movement and the new generations of conspiracy theorists.\"<ref>Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Tagieff, ''op. cit.'', p. 71.

He directed the monthly antimasonic newsletter of the association: ''News Behind the News'' ([[Willowdale, Toronto]], Vol. 1, # 1, 1956-) in which he published numerous articles discussing the power of the Illuminati in US and world affairs.<ref>William Guy Carr (dir.), ''News Behind The News'', Vol. 1, #8, June\u2013July 1957, p. 6.</ref> In that paper, Carr defended the strong [[anticommunist]] of [[Joseph McCarthy]], a Wisconsin senator.\n\nThe political ideas of the Christian association were close to those of [[John Horne Blackmore]], the first leader of the [[Social Credit Party of Canada]],<ref>[http://www.glenbow.org/collections/search/findingAids/archhtm/blackmore.cfm] See \"John Horn Blackmore fonds\", on the Genbow Museum site</ref> and [[Ron Gostick]], another important member of that party. Carr's Federation was closely linked with the Californian Council of Christian Laymen (1949\u20131964), especially with [[Alfred Kohlberg]], [[Edward Geary Lansdale]], and [[Stan Steiner]].<ref>[http://oac.cdlib.org] see Online archive of California</ref> The council also distributed Carr's ''News Behind the News'', and its president was [[Verne Paul Kaub]], also known for being an anticommunist author of conspiracy theories.\n\nIn the 1950s, both organisations fought communism and were involved in a campaign against [[Water fluoridation controversy|water fluoridation]] (brochure, 1956; articles about the topic were also published in ''News Behind the News'' in 1958).<ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf8b69n9nn&chunk.id=dsc-1.8.5&query=fluoridation&brand=oac] Online archive of California, documents on the Anti-Fluoridation Campaign; also studied in Daniel Pipes's, ''Conspiracy'', 1997 (bibliography)</ref> The historian [[Daniel Pipes]] studied that particular case and mentioned that \"in the 1950s, the National Federation of Christian Laymen portrayed fluorine as the 'devil's poison{{'\"}} and considered its addition to drinking water to prevent tooth decay to be \"one of the most dastardly plots ever attempted against the human race.\"<ref>Daniel Pipes, ''Conspiracy'', 1997 (he refers to Carr's brochure ''The Devil's poison'', 1956) quoted from [http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=9205]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nCarr died in [[Ontario]] in circumstances that are still mysterious.{{To whom?|date=January 2018}}\n\n== Main theories ==\n=== Three world wars===\nOne of Carr's most-lasting contributions to modern conspiracy theories was his discussion of an alleged plan for three world wars, often referred as the 3WW, which he believed was developed by a Confederate general and [[Masonic]] scholar, [[Albert Pike]].\n\nIn ''Pawns in the Game,'' Carr claimed that [[World War I]] had been fought to enable the [[Illuminati]] to overthrow the powers of the [[Russian tsar]] and to turn [[Russia]] into the stronghold of [[atheistic]] [[communism]]. The differences stirred up by the agents of the Illuminati between the British and the German Empires were used to foment the war. After the war ended, communism was bolstered to destroy other governments and weaken religions.\n\nLater, he claimed that [[World War II]] had been fomented by using the differences between [[fascism]] and political [[Zionism]] and fought so that [[Nazism]] would be destroyed, the power of [[political Zionism]] increased, and the sovereign state of [[Israel]] could then be established in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. During the war, international communism was built up until its strength equaled that of united [[Christendom]]. Then, it was contained and kept in check until required for the final social cataclysm.\n\nMoving into the future, Carr claimed that a report came into his possession through the Canadian Intelligence Service of an alleged speech in 1952 by Rabbi Emanuel Rabinovich in which it was made known that the Secret Powers wished to precipitate [[World War III]] within five years. Small nations would ally with either Russia or the United States, with Israel remaining neutral. Rabinovich was quoted as saying that there would be no more white race and no more religions.<ref>William Guy Carr, ''Pawns in the Game'', Emissary Publications, Clackamas, OR, p. 104-106</ref> Toward the end of the book, Carr states that \"people who wish to remain free can follow only one plan of action. They must support Christianity against all forms of atheism and secularism.\"<ref>William Guy Carr, ''Pawns in the Game'', Emissary Publications, Clackamas, OR, p. 178</ref>\n\nConfusion has arisen as to the precise source of Carr's three world wars scenario. As is the case with many of his claims, Carr did not provide a source for that scenario, but he mentions a letter written by Pike and addressed to Italian revolutionary leader [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], which outlined a plan for unleashing \"Nihilists and Atheists\" after the end of World War III. The confusion increased when Michael Haupt launched his website threeworldwars.com, which mistakenly assumed that Carr also attributed the World War Three scenario to the Pike letter. In fact, the authenticity of that letter is disputed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/pike_mazzini.html |title=Albert Pike's correspondence with Giusseppe Mazzini: a fraud |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |date=2007-05-17 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>\n\nCarr stated that he learned about the letter from the [[anti-Masonry|anti-Mason]], Cardinal [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Caro Rodr\u00edguez]] of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]], the author of ''The Mystery of Freemasonry Unveiled'' ([[Hawthorne, California]], Christian Book Club of America, 1971). However, Carr's later book, ''[[Satan, Prince of This World]]'' (written in 1959), included the following footnote: \"The Keeper of manuscripts recently informed the author that this letter is NOT cataloged in the [[British Museum]] Library. It seems strange that a man of Cardinal Rodriguez's knowledge should have said that it WAS in 1925.\"<ref>William Guy Carr, ''Satan, Prince of This World'', Emissary Publications, Clackamas, Oreg., p. 39</ref> More recently, the British Museum confirmed in writing to researcher [[Michael Haupt]]<ref>[http://www.threeworldwars.com/admin/about.htm Michael Haupt]</ref> that such a document has never been in their possession. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff states that Carr gave an ultimate and synthetic account{{Clarify|date=December 2008}} of the \"legend,\" which links together the Illuminati, Mazzini and Pike in a satanic plot for world domination.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Tagieff, ''op. cit.'', p. 341, note 71</ref>\n\n=== Conspiracy of Synagogue of Satan ===\nCarr's books often discuss a Luciferian conspiracy by what he called the \"World Revolutionary Movement,\" but he later attributed the conspiracy more specifically to the \"Synagogue of Satan.\" The term was not a reference to [[Judaism]], Carr wrote: \"I wish to make it clearly and emphatically known that I do not believe the Synagogue of Satan (S.O.S.) is Jewish, but, as [[Christ]] told us for a definite purpose, it is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} 'I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.' (Rev. 2:9 and 3:9)\"<ref>William Guy Carr, ''Satan, Prince of This World'', Emissary Publications, Clackamas, Oreg., p. 6</ref>\n\nThe quote is taken from ''Satan, Prince of this World'', the book Carr was working on at the time of his death, was edited by his elder son, W.J. Carr, Jr., and presented as the \"last manuscript [of the author] exposing the Luciferian Conspiracy, Satanism, secret societies and the Synagogue of Satan as driving forces behind the World Revolutionary Movement.\"<ref>William Guy Carr, ''Satan, prince of this World'', Palmdale, CA, Omni Publications, 1997, Editorial review, back cover</ref> Carr's son also mentioned he did not publish some parts of the manuscript because many references were missing.\n\nOne of the most interesting things to note about Carr's Luciferian conspiracies is that he believed that they were already at work during Christ's time. As Taguieff points out, there is a transhistorical scheme in Carr's idea of world conspiracy. In that kind of [[philosophy of history]] anticipating a final \"World Government,\" the ''Illuminati'' are part of a satanic historical force that contributes to the evil original plot. According to that point of view, Carr believed that there are \"natural born\" conspiracists, which is nothing more for Taguieff than [[myth]] and [[paranoia]] that was invented from a delirious worldview.<ref>Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Tagieff, ''op. cit.'', p. 99-101</ref>\n\nIt was indeed an original aspect of Carr's theories, as most conspiracy theorists usually start their \"genealogy\" with the modern age, especially the [[French Revolution]]. As a Christian traditionalist, Carr believed that the world conspiracy is based on a [[Manichaean]] way of thinking, a view that is common to many antimasonic and anticommunist conspiracy theorists since [[Nesta Webster]]. There is another common variant in seeing the world conspiracy being based on the Sabbatean/Frankist teachings, but it also acknowledges Manichaean influences.\n\n== Influence ==\nWhatever the source of the alleged plan for three world wars, it has become a topic for discussion among fringe conspiracy believers, and it is cited in seminal conspiracy books such as [[Des Griffin]]'s ''Fourth Reich of the Rich'' (1976), who published the fourth edition of ''Pawns in the Game'' and a cassette tape of one of Carr's speeches in [[Chicago]] in his own publishing house, Emissary Publications ([[Colton, Oregon]]).\n\nCarr also inspired [[Dan Smoot]] (''The Invisible Government'', 1962), [[Gary Allen]] (''The Rockefeller File'', 1976), [[Phoebe Courtney]], (''Beware Metro and Regional Government'', 1973), [[Richard T. Osborne]] (''The Great International Conspiracy'', 1974; and lately ''The Coming of World War III'', 2006), [[Myron C. Fagan]], (Audio Document (LP): ''The Illuminati and The Council on Foreign Relations'', recorded in 1967-1968, ed. by a group calling themselves the Sons of Liberty. Fagan outlines the ''Illuminati'' world elite plans of global [[cabal|conspiracy]] for the [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]] and world domination), [[David Icke]] (''The Biggest Secret'', 1999), [[Jan van Helsing]], and the French-Canadian [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit Party]] member [[Serge Monast]] (1945\u20131996), who pretended to be Carr's disciple.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/alt.illuminati_FAQ.html] Trevor W.

The French philosopher and historian [[Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff]] recently wrote ''La Foire aux illumin\u00e9s: \u00c9sot\u00e9risme, th\u00e9orie du complot, extr\u00e9misme'' (2005) (The Illuminati fair: esotericism, plot theory, extremism) where he makes an analysis of ''Pawns in the Game''. He shows that Carr belongs to a tradition of conspiracy theorists that goes far back to [[Augustin Barruel]] and is represented by the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', which frequently quoted in Carr's work, in the 20th century. Taguieff also studied Carr's theories in ''L'imaginaire du complot mondial: Aspects d'un mythe moderne'' (The world plot imaginary: about a modern myth), 2006.\n\nSince 1998, Carr's most famous books (''Pawns in the Game'', ''The Conspiracy to Destroy All Existing Governments and Religions'', and ''Satan, Prince of this World'') were translated into French.<ref>\u00c9ditions Delacroix and \u00c9ditions Saint-R\u00e9mi, Cadillac, France</ref>\n\nHis French editor, Jacques Delacroix, is also a conspiracy theorist who counts himself as one of Carr's successors.<ref>[http://www.editions-delacroix.com/librairie/index.html?c24.html] {{in lang|fr}} \u00c9ditions Delacroix, books by Jacques Delacroix on satanic conspiracies and the Three World Wars</ref>\n\n==Works==\n*''By Guess and By God: The Story of the British Submarines in the War'', with a preface by Admiral S.S.

He was described as \"the most influential source in creating the American ''[[Illuminati]]'' [[demonology]]\", according to the American folklorist Bill Ellis.<ref>Bill Ellis, ''Raising the Devil: Satanism, New Religions, and the Media''.

As an officer on the staff of Commodore [[Reginald W.

Hall]], of the Submarine Service. Going through several printings, it was followed by sequels, including ''Hell's Angels of the Deep'' (1932).\n\n==Conspiracy theorist==\nIn 1931, he started giving conferences in different Canadian clubs on the topic of \"International conspiracy,\" which was subdivided in two main subjects: \"International communism\" and \"International capitalism,\" both being controlled by the Illuminati and what he called the \"international bankers.\" The last, according to Carr, are represented mainly by the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] and the [[Rockefeller]] families.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff, ''La Foire aux illumin\u00e9s : \u00c9sot\u00e9risme, th\u00e9orie du complot, extr\u00e9misme'' (\"The Illuminati fair: Esotericism, Plot Theory, Extremism\"), Paris, Mille et une nuits, 2005, p. 431</ref> \n \nAfter working for the [[Intelligence Branch (Canadian Forces)|Canadian Intelligence Service]] during World War II, Carr wrote ''Checkmate in the North'' (1944), a book in which he wrote that an invasion of the [[Axis forces]] was supposed to take place in the area of the CFB Goose Bay. In 1944 and 1945, he gave other conferences on world conspiracies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn the 1950s, after he retired from the Navy, Carr's writings turned essentially to [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] themes from a firmly l-[[Christians|Christian]] standpoint. With his ''Pawns in the Game'' (1955) and ''Red Fog over America'' (1955), he became one of the most famous postwar conspiracy theorists (500,000 copies of ''Pawns in the Game'' were sold before his death).<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff, ''op. cit''., p. 25</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Political Research Associates]], a group studying right-wing extremism:\n\n<blockquote>Carr promoted the [[anti-Semitic]] variant on conspiracism with books such as ''Pawns in the Game'' and ''Red Fog over America''. Carr believes that an age-old Jewish ''Illuminati'' banking conspiracy used radio-transmitted mind control on behalf of Lucifer to construct a one world government. The secret nexus of the plot was supposedly the international [[Bilderberger]] meetings on banking policy. The anti-Semitic Noontide Press distributed ''Pawns in the Game'' for many years.<ref>[http://www.publiceye.org/apocalyptic/Dances_with_Devils_1-01.html] \"Dances with Devils: Satan, the Devil, and the Antichrist, Freemasons Jews and the Forged Protocols Variations on Conspiracist Themes,\" The Website of the Political Associates, same opinion in Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff, ''op. cit.''</ref></blockquote>\n\nCarr's works were notably influenced by the writings of [[Nesta Webster]] and the well known French [[hoaxer]] [[L\u00e9o Taxil]] (see [[Taxil hoax]]). He also referred to the theories of [[Augustin Barruel]] and [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]], who both explained the [[French Revolution]] as a plot by [[Freemasonry]] and linked to the German [[Illuminati]] of [[Adam Weishaupt]], who is frequently associated to the conspiracy theory of the [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]].<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/carr.html] \"William Guy Carr repeats the lies,\" ''Pawns in the Game'' reviewed by the Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon Ancient Free and Accepted Masons and History of Conspiracy Theory 101.</ref>\n\nOne of Carr's books published after his death, ''The Conspiracy to Destroy All Existing Governments and Religions'', clearly refers to Robison's main work: ''Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe Carried on in the Secret Meetings of Freemasons, Illuminati and Reading Societies'' (1798).\n\nAccording to the French philosopher and historian [[Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff]], Carr's works, especially ''Pawns in the Game'', \"largely contributed to popularise the themes of anti-Masonic conspiracism in the United States and in Canada; first, it reached the Christian fundamentalist milieu (mainly concerned with his 'Luciferian' conspiracies), then the whole far-right movement and the new generations of conspiracy theorists.\"<ref>Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Tagieff, ''op. cit.'', p. 71.

He directed the monthly antimasonic newsletter of the association: ''News Behind the News'' ([[Willowdale, Toronto]], Vol. 1, # 1, 1956-) in which he published numerous articles discussing the power of the Illuminati in US and world affairs.<ref>William Guy Carr (dir.), ''News Behind The News'', Vol. 1, #8, June\u2013July 1957, p. 6.</ref> In that paper, Carr defended the strong [[anticommunist]] of [[Joseph McCarthy]], a Wisconsin senator.\n\nThe political ideas of the Christian association were close to those of [[John Horne Blackmore]], the first leader of the [[Social Credit Party of Canada]],<ref>[http://www.glenbow.org/collections/search/findingAids/archhtm/blackmore.cfm] See \"John Horn Blackmore fonds\", on the Genbow Museum site</ref> and [[Ron Gostick]], another important member of that party. Carr's Federation was closely linked with the Californian Council of Christian Laymen (1949\u20131964), especially with [[Alfred Kohlberg]], [[Edward Geary Lansdale]], and [[Stan Steiner]].<ref>[http://oac.cdlib.org] see Online archive of California</ref> The council also distributed Carr's ''News Behind the News'', and its president was [[Verne Paul Kaub]], also known for being an anticommunist author of conspiracy theories.\n\nIn the 1950s, both organisations fought communism and were involved in a campaign against [[Water fluoridation controversy|water fluoridation]] (brochure, 1956; articles about the topic were also published in ''News Behind the News'' in 1958).<ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf8b69n9nn&chunk.id=dsc-1.8.5&query=fluoridation&brand=oac] Online archive of California, documents on the Anti-Fluoridation Campaign; also studied in Daniel Pipes's, ''Conspiracy'', 1997 (bibliography)</ref> The historian [[Daniel Pipes]] studied that particular case and mentioned that \"in the 1950s, the National Federation of Christian Laymen portrayed fluorine as the 'devil's poison{{'\"}} and considered its addition to drinking water to prevent tooth decay to be \"one of the most dastardly plots ever attempted against the human race.\"<ref>Daniel Pipes, ''Conspiracy'', 1997 (he refers to Carr's brochure ''The Devil's poison'', 1956) quoted from [http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=9205]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nCarr died in [[Ontario]] in circumstances that are still mysterious.{{To whom?|date=January 2018}}\n\n== Main theories ==\n=== Three world wars===\nOne of Carr's most-lasting contributions to modern conspiracy theories was his discussion of an alleged plan for three world wars, often referred as the 3WW, which he believed was developed by a Confederate general and [[Masonic]] scholar, [[Albert Pike]].\n\nIn ''Pawns in the Game,'' Carr claimed that [[World War I]] had been fought to enable the [[Illuminati]] to overthrow the powers of the [[Russian tsar]] and to turn [[Russia]] into the stronghold of [[atheistic]] [[communism]]. The differences stirred up by the agents of the Illuminati between the British and the German Empires were used to foment the war. After the war ended, communism was bolstered to destroy other governments and weaken religions.\n\nLater, he claimed that [[World War II]] had been fomented by using the differences between [[fascism]] and political [[Zionism]] and fought so that [[Nazism]] would be destroyed, the power of [[political Zionism]] increased, and the sovereign state of [[Israel]] could then be established in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. During the war, international communism was built up until its strength equaled that of united [[Christendom]]. Then, it was contained and kept in check until required for the final social cataclysm.\n\nMoving into the future, Carr claimed that a report came into his possession through the Canadian Intelligence Service of an alleged speech in 1952 by Rabbi Emanuel Rabinovich in which it was made known that the Secret Powers wished to precipitate [[World War III]] within five years. Small nations would ally with either Russia or the United States, with Israel remaining neutral. Rabinovich was quoted as saying that there would be no more white race and no more religions.<ref>William Guy Carr, ''Pawns in the Game'', Emissary Publications, Clackamas, OR, p. 104-106</ref> Toward the end of the book, Carr states that \"people who wish to remain free can follow only one plan of action. They must support Christianity against all forms of atheism and secularism.\"<ref>William Guy Carr, ''Pawns in the Game'', Emissary Publications, Clackamas, OR, p. 178</ref>\n\nConfusion has arisen as to the precise source of Carr's three world wars scenario. As is the case with many of his claims, Carr did not provide a source for that scenario, but he mentions a letter written by Pike and addressed to Italian revolutionary leader [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], which outlined a plan for unleashing \"Nihilists and Atheists\" after the end of World War III. The confusion increased when Michael Haupt launched his website threeworldwars.com, which mistakenly assumed that Carr also attributed the World War Three scenario to the Pike letter. In fact, the authenticity of that letter is disputed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/pike_mazzini.html |title=Albert Pike's correspondence with Giusseppe Mazzini: a fraud |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |date=2007-05-17 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>\n\nCarr stated that he learned about the letter from the [[anti-Masonry|anti-Mason]], Cardinal [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Caro Rodr\u00edguez]] of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]], the author of ''The Mystery of Freemasonry Unveiled'' ([[Hawthorne, California]], Christian Book Club of America, 1971). However, Carr's later book, ''[[Satan, Prince of This World]]'' (written in 1959), included the following footnote: \"The Keeper of manuscripts recently informed the author that this letter is NOT cataloged in the [[British Museum]] Library. It seems strange that a man of Cardinal Rodriguez's knowledge should have said that it WAS in 1925.\"<ref>William Guy Carr, ''Satan, Prince of This World'', Emissary Publications, Clackamas, Oreg., p. 39</ref> More recently, the British Museum confirmed in writing to researcher [[Michael Haupt]]<ref>[http://www.threeworldwars.com/admin/about.htm Michael Haupt]</ref> that such a document has never been in their possession. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff states that Carr gave an ultimate and synthetic account{{Clarify|date=December 2008}} of the \"legend,\" which links together the Illuminati, Mazzini and Pike in a satanic plot for world domination.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Tagieff, ''op. cit.'', p. 341, note 71</ref>\n\n=== Conspiracy of Synagogue of Satan ===\nCarr's books often discuss a Luciferian conspiracy by what he called the \"World Revolutionary Movement,\" but he later attributed the conspiracy more specifically to the \"Synagogue of Satan.\" The term was not a reference to [[Judaism]], Carr wrote: \"I wish to make it clearly and emphatically known that I do not believe the Synagogue of Satan (S.O.S.) is Jewish, but, as [[Christ]] told us for a definite purpose, it is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} 'I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.' (Rev. 2:9 and 3:9)\"<ref>William Guy Carr, ''Satan, Prince of This World'', Emissary Publications, Clackamas, Oreg., p. 6</ref>\n\nThe quote is taken from ''Satan, Prince of this World'', the book Carr was working on at the time of his death, was edited by his elder son, W.J. Carr, Jr., and presented as the \"last manuscript [of the author] exposing the Luciferian Conspiracy, Satanism, secret societies and the Synagogue of Satan as driving forces behind the World Revolutionary Movement.\"<ref>William Guy Carr, ''Satan, prince of this World'', Palmdale, CA, Omni Publications, 1997, Editorial review, back cover</ref> Carr's son also mentioned he did not publish some parts of the manuscript because many references were missing.\n\nOne of the most interesting things to note about Carr's Luciferian conspiracies is that he believed that they were already at work during Christ's time. As Taguieff points out, there is a transhistorical scheme in Carr's idea of world conspiracy. In that kind of [[philosophy of history]] anticipating a final \"World Government,\" the ''Illuminati'' are part of a satanic historical force that contributes to the evil original plot. According to that point of view, Carr believed that there are \"natural born\" conspiracists, which is nothing more for Taguieff than [[myth]] and [[paranoia]] that was invented from a delirious worldview.<ref>Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Tagieff, ''op. cit.'', p. 99-101</ref>\n\nIt was indeed an original aspect of Carr's theories, as most conspiracy theorists usually start their \"genealogy\" with the modern age, especially the [[French Revolution]]. As a Christian traditionalist, Carr believed that the world conspiracy is based on a [[Manichaean]] way of thinking, a view that is common to many antimasonic and anticommunist conspiracy theorists since [[Nesta Webster]]. There is another common variant in seeing the world conspiracy being based on the Sabbatean/Frankist teachings, but it also acknowledges Manichaean influences.\n\n== Influence ==\nWhatever the source of the alleged plan for three world wars, it has become a topic for discussion among fringe conspiracy believers, and it is cited in seminal conspiracy books such as [[Des Griffin]]'s ''Fourth Reich of the Rich'' (1976), who published the fourth edition of ''Pawns in the Game'' and a cassette tape of one of Carr's speeches in [[Chicago]] in his own publishing house, Emissary Publications ([[Colton, Oregon]]).\n\nCarr also inspired [[Dan Smoot]] (''The Invisible Government'', 1962), [[Gary Allen]] (''The Rockefeller File'', 1976), [[Phoebe Courtney]], (''Beware Metro and Regional Government'', 1973), [[Richard T. Osborne]] (''The Great International Conspiracy'', 1974; and lately ''The Coming of World War III'', 2006), [[Myron C. Fagan]], (Audio Document (LP): ''The Illuminati and The Council on Foreign Relations'', recorded in 1967-1968, ed. by a group calling themselves the Sons of Liberty. Fagan outlines the ''Illuminati'' world elite plans of global [[cabal|conspiracy]] for the [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]] and world domination), [[David Icke]] (''The Biggest Secret'', 1999), [[Jan van Helsing]], and the French-Canadian [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit Party]] member [[Serge Monast]] (1945\u20131996), who pretended to be Carr's disciple.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/alt.illuminati_FAQ.html] Trevor W.

The French philosopher and historian [[Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff]] recently wrote ''La Foire aux illumin\u00e9s: \u00c9sot\u00e9risme, th\u00e9orie du complot, extr\u00e9misme'' (2005) (The Illuminati fair: esotericism, plot theory, extremism) where he makes an analysis of ''Pawns in the Game''. He shows that Carr belongs to a tradition of conspiracy theorists that goes far back to [[Augustin Barruel]] and is represented by the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', which frequently quoted in Carr's work, in the 20th century. Taguieff also studied Carr's theories in ''L'imaginaire du complot mondial: Aspects d'un mythe moderne'' (The world plot imaginary: about a modern myth), 2006.\n\nSince 1998, Carr's most famous books (''Pawns in the Game'', ''The Conspiracy to Destroy All Existing Governments and Religions'', and ''Satan, Prince of this World'') were translated into French.<ref>\u00c9ditions Delacroix and \u00c9ditions Saint-R\u00e9mi, Cadillac, France</ref>\n\nHis French editor, Jacques Delacroix, is also a conspiracy theorist who counts himself as one of Carr's successors.<ref>[http://www.editions-delacroix.com/librairie/index.html?c24.html] {{in lang|fr}} \u00c9ditions Delacroix, books by Jacques Delacroix on satanic conspiracies and the Three World Wars</ref>\n\n==Works==\n*''By Guess and By God: The Story of the British Submarines in the War'', with a preface by Admiral S.S.

Although in name and appearance, Zippy is a [[microcephalic]], he is distinctive not so much for his skull shape, or for any identifiable form of brain damage, but for his enthusiasm for philosophical [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequiturs]] (\"All life is a blur of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and meat!\"), verbal [[Free association (psychology)|free association]], and the pursuit of [[popular culture]] ephemera. His wholehearted devotion to random artifacts [[satire|satirizes]] the excesses of [[consumerism]].\n\nThe character of Zippy the Pinhead initially appeared in [[underground comix|underground]] publications during the 1970s.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Estren |first1=Mark James |title=A History of Underground Comics |year=1993 |publisher=Ronin Publishing |isbn=0-914171-64-X |page=8 |chapter=Foreword: Onward! }}</ref> The ''Zippy'' comic is distributed by [[King Features Syndicate]] to more than 100 newspapers, and Griffith self-syndicates strips to college newspapers and [[Alternative weekly|alternative weeklies]]. The strip is unique among syndicated multi-panel dailies for its characteristics of [[literary nonsense]], including a near-absence of either straightforward gags or continuous narrative, and for its unusually intricate artwork, which is reminiscent of the style of Griffith's 1970s underground comics.\n\n==Origin==\nZippy made his first appearance in ''Real Pulp Comics'' #1 in March 1971, published by [[Print Mint]]. In a 2008 interview with Alex Dueben, Griffith recalled how it all began:\n{{quote|I first saw the 1932 Tod Browning film ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'' in 1963 at a screening at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where I was attending art school. I was fascinated by the pinheads in the introductory scene and asked the projectionist (who I knew) if he could slow down the film so I could hear what they were saying better. He did and I loved the poetic, random dialog. Little did I know that Zippy was being planted in my fevered brain. Later, in San Francisco in 1970, I was asked to contribute a few pages to ''Real Pulp Comics'' #1, edited by cartoonist [[Roger Brand]]. His only guideline was to say \"Maybe do some kind of love story, but with really weird people.\" I never imagined I'd still be putting words into Zippy's fast-moving mouth some 38 years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18342 |title=Dueben, Alex. \"Is Bill Griffith Having Fun Yet?\", CBR, October 6, 2008 |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref>}}\n\nThe strip began in ''[[Berkeley Barb|The Berkeley Barb]]'' in 1976 and was syndicated nationally soon after, originally as a weekly strip. When [[William Randolph Hearst III]] took over the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' in 1985, he offered Griffith an opportunity to do ''Zippy'' as a daily strip. Several months later it was picked up for worldwide [[Daily comic strip|daily distribution]] by [[King Features Syndicate]] in 1986. The [[Sunday strip|Sunday ''Zippy'']] debuted in 1990. When the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' canceled ''Zippy'' briefly in 2002, the newspaper received thousands of letters of protest, including one from [[Robert Crumb]], who called ''Zippy'' \"by far the very best daily comic strip that exists in America.\" The ''Chronicle'' quickly restored the strip but dropped it again in 2004, leading to more protests as well as grateful letters from non-fans.\n\nThe strip has developed a [[cult following]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=A Cult of Comic Proportions|last=Muro|first=Mark|date=March 11, 1988|work=|newspaper=Boston Globe|access-date=|via=EBSCOHost}}</ref> and continues to be syndicated in many newspapers, often ranking at or near the bottom of reader polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/comics/poll98.htm |title=What's So Funny?

T. Barnum]]'s sideshow performer [[Zip the Pinhead]], who may not have been a [[microcephalic]] but was nevertheless billed as one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaishehavingfunyet.html |title=Are We Having Fun Yet? |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> (Coincidentally, the real name of the latter was William Henry Johnson, or Jackson according to some sources, and Griffith's full name is William Henry Jackson Griffith, after [[William Henry Jackson|his great-grandfather]], the noted photographer.)\n\nGriffith has never committed himself to a set origin story for Zippy; no fewer than five have appeared:\n* a strange visitor from another planet{{issue|date=September 2016}}\n* a pinhead who wandered away from the circus{{issue|date=September 2016}}\n* an android whose inventor didn't live to see its imperfections{{issue|date=September 2016}}\n* the secret identity of a jaded heir to a fortune who decided to apply Zen to everyday life{{issue|date=September 2016}}\n* a college student who inexplicably turned into a pinhead{{issue|date=September 2016}}\n\nGriffith also never committed himself to any set time period or home location for Zippy.\n\nZippy's favorite foods are [[taco sauce]] and [[Ding Dongs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aacast.html |title=Cast of Characters |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> He sometimes snacks on [[Polysorbate 80]]. Zippy's unpredictable behavior sometimes causes severe difficulty for others, but never for himself. (For example, drug dealers tried to use him as a drug mule, but lost their stash or were jailed.){{issue|date=September 2016}}\n\nHe is married to a nearly identical pinhead named '''Zerbina''', has two children, '''[[nuclear fuel|Fuelrod]]''' (a boy) and '''[[nuclear meltdown|Meltdown]]''' (a girl), both apparently in their early teens, and owns a cat named '''Dingy'''. His parents, '''Ebb''' and '''Flo''', originally from Kansas, live in Florida. Zippy's angst-ridden twin brother '''Lippy''' also frequently appears. He is portrayed as Zippy's total opposite, often dressed in a conservative suit, thinking sequentially, and avoiding his brother's penchant for non-sequiturs. In a daily strip dated 8 March 2005, he is depicted as being deeply moved by the poetry of [[Leonard Cohen]], the landscape paintings of [[Maxfield Parrish]], and the music of [[John Tesh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zippythepinhead.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=ZTP&Product_Code=8-Mar-05&Category_Code= |title=Lippy's Lite Side |publisher=Zippy the Pinhead |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref>\n\nHe has four close friends:\n* '''Claude Funston''', a hapless working man\n* '''Griffy''', a stand-in for Bill Griffith, who often appears in the strip to complain about various aspects of modern life\n* '''Shelf-Life''', a fast-talking schemer always looking for \"the next big thing\"\n* '''Vizeen Nurney''', a 20-something lounge singer who, despite her rebellious image, has an optimistic and sympathetic nature\n\nA humanoid [[toad]], '''Mr. Toad''' (less commonly \"Mr. the Toad\") who embodies blind greed and selfishness, appears occasionally (along with his wife, '''Mrs. Toad''', and their children, '''Mustang''' and '''Blazer'''), as do '''The Toadettes''', a group of mindless and interchangeable amphibians, who pop up here and there; and the '''Stupidity Patrol''', described by Bill Griffith as \"cruising the streets of [[Los Angeles|L.A.]], correcting the behavior of insensitive louts\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aacast.html |title=Cast of Characters |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>\n[[Image:Doggie Diner 1.jpg|thumb|right|The actual sign for the San Francisco Doggie Diner, commonly portrayed in the comic strip as one of Zippy's conversational foils]]\n\nAnother occasionally occurring character is '''God''', appearing either as a disembodied head or a head superimposed on various peoples' bodies.

For a while the Zippy website encouraged people to send photos of interesting places for Zippy to visit in the strip.\n\nIn 2007, Griffith began to focus his daily strip on the fictional city of Dingburg, [[Maryland]], Zippy's \"birthplace\" which, according to the cartoonist, is located \"17 [[mile]]s [[west]] of [[Baltimore]].\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Cavna |first=Michael |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2008/10/the_morning_line_from_blues_to.html |title=Cavna, Michael. \"The Morning Line: 'Zippy' Creator Draws on Real (Pungent) Maryland,\" ''The Washington Post'', Tuesday, October 21, 2008 |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date=2008-10-21 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> Griffith said, \"Over the years, I began to expand Zippy's circle of friends beyond my usual cast of characters to a wider world of people like Zippy--other pinheads. I kept this up for a few months, happily adding more and more muu-muu-clad men and women until one day the whole thing just reached critical mass. The thought then occurred, 'Where do all these friends of Zippy live? Do they live in the real world which Zippy has been seen escaping for years\u2014or do they live apart, in a pinhead world of their own?' Thus Dingburg, 'The City Inhabited Entirely by Pinheads' was born. It even had a motto: 'Going too far is half the pleasure of not getting anywhere'. The logical next step was to imagine Dingburg streets and neighborhoods\u2014to create a place where Zippy's wacky rules would be the norm and everyone would play 24-hour Skeeball and worship at the feet of the giant [[Muffler Man]]. Zippy had, at last, found his home town.\"\n\nIn regard to Zippy's famous catch phrase, at the 2003 University of Florida Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels, Griffith recalled the phone call from ''Bartlett's'':\n{{quote|When ''Bartlett's'' approached me in\u2014I forget what year, five or six years ago\u2014I got a call from the editor. And he was going to give me credit for the \"Are we having fun yet\" saying, but he wanted to know exactly where Zippy had first said it. I did some research (I had no idea), and I eventually found... the strip \"Back to Pinhead, the Punks and the Monks\" from ''Yow'' #2 in 1979... That's the first time he said, \"Are we having fun yet?\" Certainly not intended by me to be anything more than another non sequitur coming out of Zippy's mind.}}\n\nZippy's signature expression of surprise is \"Yow!\"\n\n==Appearances elsewhere==\nFollowing rumors of a ''Zippy'' movie project that was never consummated, Griffith devoted dozens of strips to his real and imagined dealings with Hollywood. An animated television series, to be produced by [[DPS Film Roman|Film Roman]] and co-written by [[Diane Noomin]], was in negotiations from 1996 to 2001.\n\nOn July 9, 2004, Zippy made his stage debut in San Francisco in ''Fun: The Concept'' at the Dark Room Theatre. Bill Griffith approved of the adaptation, though he did not work on the project. ''Fun: The Concept'' was adapted by Denzil J. Meyers with Jim Fourniadis.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Griffith\n  | first = Bill\n  | title = Zippy\u2014the Play\n  | year = 2004\n  | url = http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/theplay/FrameSet.htm\n  | accessdate = 9 November 2008 }}\n</ref>\n\nA collection of about 1,000 Zippy quotes was formerly packaged and distributed with the [[Emacs]] text editor. Some installations of the \"[[Fortune (Unix)|fortune]]\" command, available on most Unix-type systems, also contain this collection.

Zippy's most famous quotation, \"Are we having fun yet?\", appears in ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'' and became a [[catchphrase]]. He almost always wears a yellow [[muumuu]]/[[clown suit]]<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bktLaSRoG1sC&pg=PA87|title=Marketing Through Minefields|publisher=Harvard Business Press|year=2008|author=Bill Griffith|isbn=978-1-4221-9992-3|page=87}}</ref> with large red polka dots, and puffy, white [[clown]] shoes.<ref name=zip>{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaaunderstanding.html |title=Understanding |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> (Other forms of attire may be seen when appropriate to the context, e.g. a [[toga]].) Although in name and appearance, Zippy is a [[microcephalic]], he is distinctive not so much for his skull shape, or for any identifiable form of brain damage, but for his enthusiasm for philosophical [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequiturs]] (\"All life is a blur of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and meat!\"), verbal [[Free association (psychology)|free association]], and the pursuit of [[popular culture]] ephemera. His wholehearted devotion to random artifacts [[satire|satirizes]] the excesses of [[consumerism]].\n\nThe character of Zippy the Pinhead initially appeared in [[underground comix|underground]] publications during the 1970s.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Estren |first1=Mark James |title=A History of Underground Comics |year=1993 |publisher=Ronin Publishing |isbn=0-914171-64-X |page=8 |chapter=Foreword: Onward! }}</ref> The ''Zippy'' comic is distributed by [[King Features Syndicate]] to more than 100 newspapers, and Griffith self-syndicates strips to college newspapers and [[Alternative weekly|alternative weeklies]]. The strip is unique among syndicated multi-panel dailies for its characteristics of [[literary nonsense]], including a near-absence of either straightforward gags or continuous narrative, and for its unusually intricate artwork, which is reminiscent of the style of Griffith's 1970s underground comics.\n\n==Origin==\nZippy made his first appearance in ''Real Pulp Comics'' #1 in March 1971, published by [[Print Mint]]. In a 2008 interview with Alex Dueben, Griffith recalled how it all began:\n{{quote|I first saw the 1932 Tod Browning film ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'' in 1963 at a screening at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where I was attending art school. I was fascinated by the pinheads in the introductory scene and asked the projectionist (who I knew) if he could slow down the film so I could hear what they were saying better. He did and I loved the poetic, random dialog. Little did I know that Zippy was being planted in my fevered brain. Later, in San Francisco in 1970, I was asked to contribute a few pages to ''Real Pulp Comics'' #1, edited by cartoonist [[Roger Brand]]. His only guideline was to say \"Maybe do some kind of love story, but with really weird people.\" I never imagined I'd still be putting words into Zippy's fast-moving mouth some 38 years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18342 |title=Dueben, Alex. \"Is Bill Griffith Having Fun Yet?\", CBR, October 6, 2008 |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref>}}\n\nThe strip began in ''[[Berkeley Barb|The Berkeley Barb]]'' in 1976 and was syndicated nationally soon after, originally as a weekly strip. When [[William Randolph Hearst III]] took over the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' in 1985, he offered Griffith an opportunity to do ''Zippy'' as a daily strip. Several months later it was picked up for worldwide [[Daily comic strip|daily distribution]] by [[King Features Syndicate]] in 1986. The [[Sunday strip|Sunday ''Zippy'']] debuted in 1990. When the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' canceled ''Zippy'' briefly in 2002, the newspaper received thousands of letters of protest, including one from [[Robert Crumb]], who called ''Zippy'' \"by far the very best daily comic strip that exists in America.\" The ''Chronicle'' quickly restored the strip but dropped it again in 2004, leading to more protests as well as grateful letters from non-fans.\n\nThe strip has developed a [[cult following]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=A Cult of Comic Proportions|last=Muro|first=Mark|date=March 11, 1988|work=|newspaper=Boston Globe|access-date=|via=EBSCOHost}}</ref> and continues to be syndicated in many newspapers, often ranking at or near the bottom of reader polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/comics/poll98.htm |title=What's So Funny? Post Readers Rate the Comics|publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=1998-07-17 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref>\n\n==Characters and story==\nZippy's original appearance was partly inspired by the [[Microcephaly|microcephalic]] [[Schlitzie]], from the film ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'', which was enjoying something of a cult revival at the time, and [[P. T. Barnum]]'s sideshow performer [[Zip the Pinhead]], who may not have been a [[microcephalic]] but was nevertheless billed as one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaishehavingfunyet.html |title=Are We Having Fun Yet? |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> (Coincidentally, the real name of the latter was William Henry Johnson, or Jackson according to some sources, and Griffith's full name is William Henry Jackson Griffith, after [[William Henry Jackson|his great-grandfather]], the noted photographer.)\n\nGriffith has never committed himself to a set origin story for Zippy; no fewer than five have appeared:\n* a strange visitor from another planet{{issue|date=September 2016}}\n* a pinhead who wandered away from the circus{{issue|date=September 2016}}\n* an android whose inventor didn't live to see its imperfections{{issue|date=September 2016}}\n* the secret identity of a jaded heir to a fortune who decided to apply Zen to everyday life{{issue|date=September 2016}}\n* a college student who inexplicably turned into a pinhead{{issue|date=September 2016}}\n\nGriffith also never committed himself to any set time period or home location for Zippy.\n\nZippy's favorite foods are [[taco sauce]] and [[Ding Dongs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aacast.html |title=Cast of Characters |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> He sometimes snacks on [[Polysorbate 80]]. Zippy's unpredictable behavior sometimes causes severe difficulty for others, but never for himself. (For example, drug dealers tried to use him as a drug mule, but lost their stash or were jailed.){{issue|date=September 2016}}\n\nHe is married to a nearly identical pinhead named '''Zerbina''', has two children, '''[[nuclear fuel|Fuelrod]]''' (a boy) and '''[[nuclear meltdown|Meltdown]]''' (a girl), both apparently in their early teens, and owns a cat named '''Dingy'''. His parents, '''Ebb''' and '''Flo''', originally from Kansas, live in Florida. Zippy's angst-ridden twin brother '''Lippy''' also frequently appears. He is portrayed as Zippy's total opposite, often dressed in a conservative suit, thinking sequentially, and avoiding his brother's penchant for non-sequiturs. In a daily strip dated 8 March 2005, he is depicted as being deeply moved by the poetry of [[Leonard Cohen]], the landscape paintings of [[Maxfield Parrish]], and the music of [[John Tesh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zippythepinhead.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=ZTP&Product_Code=8-Mar-05&Category_Code= |title=Lippy's Lite Side |publisher=Zippy the Pinhead |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref>\n\nHe has four close friends:\n* '''Claude Funston''', a hapless working man\n* '''Griffy''', a stand-in for Bill Griffith, who often appears in the strip to complain about various aspects of modern life\n* '''Shelf-Life''', a fast-talking schemer always looking for \"the next big thing\"\n* '''Vizeen Nurney''', a 20-something lounge singer who, despite her rebellious image, has an optimistic and sympathetic nature\n\nA humanoid [[toad]], '''Mr. Toad''' (less commonly \"Mr. the Toad\") who embodies blind greed and selfishness, appears occasionally (along with his wife, '''Mrs. Toad''', and their children, '''Mustang''' and '''Blazer'''), as do '''The Toadettes''', a group of mindless and interchangeable amphibians, who pop up here and there; and the '''Stupidity Patrol''', described by Bill Griffith as \"cruising the streets of [[Los Angeles|L.A.]], correcting the behavior of insensitive louts\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aacast.html |title=Cast of Characters |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>\n[[Image:Doggie Diner 1.jpg|thumb|right|The actual sign for the San Francisco Doggie Diner, commonly portrayed in the comic strip as one of Zippy's conversational foils]]\n\nAnother occasionally occurring character is '''God''', appearing either as a disembodied head or a head superimposed on various peoples' bodies. He is depicted as either conversing with Zippy on various philosophical topics, or commenting on humanity in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zippythepinhead.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=ZTP&Product_Code=19-Jun-13&Category_Code= |title=Stand Back! |publisher=Zippythepinhead.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-07}}</ref>\n\nIn his daily-strip incarnation, Zippy spends much of his time traveling and commenting on interesting places; recent strips focus on his fascination with roadside icons featuring giant beings; Zippy also frequently participates in his long-running conversation with the giant fiberglass doggie mascot of [[San Francisco]]'s [[Doggie Diner]] chain (later, the Carousel diner near the [[San Francisco Zoo]]).  For a while the Zippy website encouraged people to send photos of interesting places for Zippy to visit in the strip.\n\nIn 2007, Griffith began to focus his daily strip on the fictional city of Dingburg, [[Maryland]], Zippy's \"birthplace\" which, according to the cartoonist, is located \"17 [[mile]]s [[west]] of [[Baltimore]].\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Cavna |first=Michael |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2008/10/the_morning_line_from_blues_to.html |title=Cavna, Michael. \"The Morning Line: 'Zippy' Creator Draws on Real (Pungent) Maryland,\" ''The Washington Post'', Tuesday, October 21, 2008 |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date=2008-10-21 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> Griffith said, \"Over the years, I began to expand Zippy's circle of friends beyond my usual cast of characters to a wider world of people like Zippy--other pinheads. I kept this up for a few months, happily adding more and more muu-muu-clad men and women until one day the whole thing just reached critical mass. The thought then occurred, 'Where do all these friends of Zippy live? Do they live in the real world which Zippy has been seen escaping for years\u2014or do they live apart, in a pinhead world of their own?' Thus Dingburg, 'The City Inhabited Entirely by Pinheads' was born. It even had a motto: 'Going too far is half the pleasure of not getting anywhere'. The logical next step was to imagine Dingburg streets and neighborhoods\u2014to create a place where Zippy's wacky rules would be the norm and everyone would play 24-hour Skeeball and worship at the feet of the giant [[Muffler Man]]. Zippy had, at last, found his home town.\"\n\nIn regard to Zippy's famous catch phrase, at the 2003 University of Florida Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels, Griffith recalled the phone call from ''Bartlett's'':\n{{quote|When ''Bartlett's'' approached me in\u2014I forget what year, five or six years ago\u2014I got a call from the editor. And he was going to give me credit for the \"Are we having fun yet\" saying, but he wanted to know exactly where Zippy had first said it. I did some research (I had no idea), and I eventually found... the strip \"Back to Pinhead, the Punks and the Monks\" from ''Yow'' #2 in 1979... That's the first time he said, \"Are we having fun yet?\" Certainly not intended by me to be anything more than another non sequitur coming out of Zippy's mind.}}\n\nZippy's signature expression of surprise is \"Yow!\"\n\n==Appearances elsewhere==\nFollowing rumors of a ''Zippy'' movie project that was never consummated, Griffith devoted dozens of strips to his real and imagined dealings with Hollywood. An animated television series, to be produced by [[DPS Film Roman|Film Roman]] and co-written by [[Diane Noomin]], was in negotiations from 1996 to 2001.\n\nOn July 9, 2004, Zippy made his stage debut in San Francisco in ''Fun: The Concept'' at the Dark Room Theatre. Bill Griffith approved of the adaptation, though he did not work on the project. ''Fun: The Concept'' was adapted by Denzil J. Meyers with Jim Fourniadis.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Griffith\n  | first = Bill\n  | title = Zippy\u2014the Play\n  | year = 2004\n  | url = http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/theplay/FrameSet.htm\n  | accessdate = 9 November 2008 }}\n</ref>\n\nA collection of about 1,000 Zippy quotes was formerly packaged and distributed with the [[Emacs]] text editor. Some installations of the \"[[Fortune (Unix)|fortune]]\" command, available on most Unix-type systems, also contain this collection.

The title was printed in lower-case.\n\n==Origin==\nWhen the illustrator [[Dan Adkins]] began working at the Wood Studio in 1965, he showed Wood pages he had been creating for his planned comics-oriented publication, ''Outlet''. This inspired Wood to become an editor-publisher, and he began assembling art and stories for a magazine he titled ''et cetera''. A front cover paste-up with the ''et cetera'' logo was prepared and even used in advance solicitation print ads, but when Wood learned of another magazine with a similar title, there was a last-minute title change.<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/08adkins.html Thomas, Roy. ''Alter Ego'', Vol. 3, No. 8: \"A Dream Come True!

During this same period, editor [[Bill Spicer]] and critic Richard Kyle began promoting and popularizing the terms \"graphic novel\" and \"graphic story\", and in 1967 Spicer changed the title of his ''Fantasy Illustrated'' to ''[[Graphic Story Magazine]]''. Kyle, Spicer, Wood and Pearson all envisioned an explosion of graphic narratives far afield of the commercial comic book industry.\n[[File:Witzend1976wood.jpg|left|thumb|450px|Wally Wood's cover of ''witzend'' #10 (1976)]]\n\nAdvertisements described ''witzend'' as \"intended for fans and collectors of science fiction, comics, satire, S+S and related fields\" with \"the work of the world's best cartoonists and illustrators\", mentioning [[Al Williamson]], [[Jack Gaughan]], [[Frank Frazetta]], and [[Reed Crandall]].<ref name=\"wood196706\">{{Cite magazine|last=Wood|first=Wallace\n|date=June 1967|title=Witzend|url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v25n05_1967-06_modified#page/n65/mode/2up\n|magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction|pages=102|type=advertisement}}</ref> The magazin's first issue had Wood's \"Animan\" and \"Bucky Ruckus\", and Williamson's science fiction adventure \"Savage World\". Crandall illustrated [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], along with pages by [[Steve Ditko]], Gaughan, [[Gil Kane]], [[Jack Kirby]], [[Ralph Reese]], [[Roy G. Krenkel]] and [[Angelo Torres]]. The issue finished with Frazetta's back cover portrait of [[Buster Crabbe]].\n\nThe second issue displayed a front cover by Wood and a back cover by Reese. [[Gray Morrow]]'s \"Orion\", which began in this issue of ''witzend'', was completed in ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' in 1979. Two pages of \"Hey, Look!\" by [[Harvey Kurtzman]] were followed by \"a feeble fable\" from [[Warren Sattler]], \"If You Can't Join 'em... Beat 'em\" and more ERB illustrations by Crandall and Frazetta. The center spread presented poems by Wood, Reese and Pearson. Following a [[Will Elder|Bill Elder]] cartoon, \"Midnight Special\" by Ditko and \"By the Fountain in the Park\" by [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]], Wood offered another \"Animan\" installment.\n\nIn the third issue, between a Wood front cover and a Williamson back cover, were Ditko's first \"[[Mr. A]]\" by Ditko, \"The Invaders\" by [[Richard Bassford]], Wood's \"Pipsqueak Papers\", more \"Hey, Look!\" pages and \"Last Chance,\" a previously unpublished 1950s EC New Direction story, drawn by Frazetta and rewritten and edited by Bill Pearson. The issue also featured work by [[Roger Brand]], [[Will Eisner]], [[Grass Green|Richard \"Grass\" Green]] and [[Art Spiegelman]].\n\nWith ''witzend'' number four, Wood began a serialization of his epic fantasy, \"The World of the Wizard King.\" These installments of illustrated prose fiction were co-authored with Pearson. Shifting from illustrated text to a comics format, Wood continued the storyline in his later graphic novel, published in two editions (one b/w, one color)&mdash;''The Wizard King'' (1978) and ''The King of the World'' (Les Editions du Triton, 1978).\n\n==Bill Pearson era==\nAfter the fourth issue, Wood sold ''witzend'' to Pearson's Wonderful Publishing Company \"for the sum of $1.00.\" Wood remained listed as founder and Editor Emeritus. After editing and publishing #5 (1968) by himself, Pearson co-published the next five issues with various other individuals/entities: #6 with Ed Glaser, #s 7, 8, and 9 with [[Phil Seuling]] (founder of the [[New York Comic Art Convention]] in 1968), and #10 with the [[CPL Gang]], a group of artists and writers who were publishing other fanzines such as ''[[Charlton Bullseye (fanzine)|Charlton Bullseye]]'', and ''[[CPL (fanzine)|CPL]]'' (''Contemporary Pictorial Literature''); from #11 on, Pearson was sole publisher and editor. These post-Wood issues edited by Pearson continued to explore new avenues with contributions from [[Vaughn Bode]], Eisner, [[Jeff Jones (artist)|Jeff Jones]], Wood, [[Bernie Wrightson]], [[Dr. Kenneth Smith (artist and philosopher)|Kenneth Smith]], [[Alex Toth]], [[Roy G. Krenkel]], [[Mike Hinge]] and many others. Pearson also assembled two theme issues: the final issue #13 (1985) was titled ''Good Girls'' \u2014 without the ''witzend'' logo on the front cover \u2014 containing diverse drawings of women, and #9 (1973) was a non-comics issue profiling [[W.C. Fields]], due to then co-publisher Seuling's extreme interest in the actor and his film works. In 1989\u201390, he also published two digest-sized issues of ''Witzend Catalog'', that were only partly editorial content, including unpublished Krenkel art, the other part being original art pieces for sale.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Invadersbass.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The [[Wally Wood]] influence is evident in this [[Richard Bassford]] illustration from ''witzend'' #3 (1967).]]\nA critical survey of the magazine, \"Wood at His witzend\" by Rick Spanier, appears in Bhob Stewart's biographical anthology, ''Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood'' (TwoMorrows, 2003).
