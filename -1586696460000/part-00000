Her written works include ''Wanted Words'', ''Wanted Words 2'', and (with Ira Basen, [[David Wallechinsky]] and [[Amy Wallace]]) the ''Canadian Book of Lists''. She worked for [[CBC Radio]] from 1998 to 2007, producing segments for programs such as ''[[This Morning (radio program)|This Morning]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Edition (CBC Radio)|The Sunday Edition]]'', including the popular word-game segment ''[[Wanted Words]]'' (from which the books of the same name were derived). Farrow hosted and co-created other short series and shows including ''[[Workology]]'' (all about the modern workplace, cube farmers and clockwatchers) and the [[etymological]] program ''[[And Sometimes Y]]'', ''Home'' (about people's obsession with domesticity) and ''The Omnivore'' (about people's complex relationship to food and eating).  She and her producers won a Silver Medal at the New York Radio Awards for \"The Brain and Language\", an episode of \u2018And Sometimes Y\u2019 on [[CBC Radio One]] in 2009.\n\n==Urban activism and work life==\nIn the 1990s Farrow worked as a program director, manager and DJ in campus/community radio in Halifax (CKDU Program Director) and Toronto (CUIT Station Manager) while also acting as the Vice President of the [[National Campus and Community Radio Association]] (NCRA). While living in Vancouver she organized a conference for the [[National Association of Women and the Law]] in 1994. Returning to Toronto, she made several indie [[Super 8 film]]s becoming the Operations Director and Program Coordinator for the [[Inside Out Film and Video Festival]], where she helped open the door for many LGBT film and video makers.\n\nWhile a resident of Ward 18 in the Queen West Triangle, Farrow helped form and later chaired the residents' association [http://www.active18.net/ Active 18]. This coalition of citizens, residents and business-owners came together in 2005 and continues to advocate for good urban design and positive local development that genuinely contributes to and engages with local community and the city.\n\nFarrow was the first Executive Director of [[Jane's Walk]], the now international movement of free, locally led walking tours inspired by urbanist [[Jane Jacobs]]. The walks invite people to explore their cities, share stories and connect with neighbours. Working under the direction and guidance of  Professor Paul Hess of the University of Toronto's Department of Geography and Planning, Jane co-wrote North America's [http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20110528.NWGEE28GTA/BDAStory/BDA/deaths first studies of the walkability] of inner-suburban high rise neighbourhoods. This research explores segments of Toronto's most densely populated but geographically isolated neighbourhoods and points to simple and inexpensive solutions for improving connectivity and accessibility. Alongside this research, the authors developed a research model and resource toolkit that can be used by communities and individual to assess their own neighbourhoods.\n\nAfter five years with Jane's Walk, Farrow moved to City Hall to become Executive Assistant to [[Toronto City Council]]lor [[Mary-Margaret McMahon]] of Ward 32 Beaches-East York. While there, she helped forge the centrist coalition that reversed Rob Ford's proposed budget cuts to the tune of $19 million ultimately [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/the-mushy-middle-toughens-up-to-fight-ford-cuts/article1360302/ breaking the Mayor's majority hold] in council and restoring funding for ice rinks, pools, community grants, homeless shelters, leaf collection and the TTC.\n\nIn 2013 she worked with the [[Stephen Lewis Foundation]], travelling to Uganda and Tanzania. Later that year she became Policy and Campaigns Advisor to [http://www.parkpeople.ca/ Park People], a Toronto-based non-profit helping mobilize people to work together to make local parks the best they can be.\n\nSince 2013 Farrow has worked as an independent facilitator and community consultant, specializing in engaging neighbourhoods in dialogues about what they want in terms of urban design, planning and public spaces.\n\nIn 2014, she declared her candidacy to be Toronto City Councillor for Ward 30 [[Toronto-Danforth]] challenging undeclared incumbent [[Paula Fletcher]] in the [[2014 Toronto municipal election|October 27 municipal election]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Forget about Toronto's mayoral circus and give council candidates some attention |url=http://metronews.ca/voices/urban-compass-toronto-2/1161907/forget-about-torontos-mayoral-circus-and-give-the-other-44-city-hall-candidates-some-attention/ |accessdate=September 21, 2014 |newspaper=Metro |date=September 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924060256/http://metronews.ca/voices/urban-compass-toronto-2/1161907/forget-about-torontos-mayoral-circus-and-give-the-other-44-city-hall-candidates-some-attention/ |archivedate=September 24, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Ward 30 hopeful Jane Farrow leads urban food walk|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2014/08/28/ward_30_hopeful_jane_farrow_leads_urban_food_walk.html/ |accessdate=August 28, 2014|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=August 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Jane Farrow's Bold Council Bid |url=http://torontoist.com/2014/05/jane-farrows-bold-council-bid |accessdate=May 23, 2014|newspaper=Torontoist|date=May 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Jane Farrow bids for seat on Toronto City Council|url=http://dailyxtra.com/toronto/news/jane-farrow-bids-seat-toronto-city-council |accessdate=May 22, 2014|newspaper=Daily xtra|date=May 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Left-wing candidates in dogfight for Toronto-Danforth council seat|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=198118|accessdate=May 22, 2014|newspaper=NOW Magazine|date=May 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Race heats up in Ward 30 as former radio host Jane Farrow joins crowded field|url=http://www.cp24.com/news/race-heats-up-in-ward-30-as-former-radio-host-jane-farrow-joins-crowded-field-1.1829939|accessdate=May 20, 2014|newspaper=CP24|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Wards To Watch \u2014 Surprise Edition|url= http://afuitbs.com/2014/05/22/wards-to-watch-surprise-edition/|accessdate=May 22, 2014|newspaper= All Fired Up In The Big Smoke|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nFarrow is [[coming out|openly]] [[lesbian]].<ref name=\"sept29show\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/andsometimesy/pastshows.html?s3-ep4 |title=Gay Talk |periodical=And Sometimes Y |publisher=[[CBC Radio]] |date=2007-09-29 |accessdate=2007-10-10 |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023191225/http://www.cbc.ca/andsometimesy/pastshows.html?s3-ep4 |archivedate=October 23, 2007 }} .</ref> She will be receiving a Lifetime Achievement Inspire Award in May 2014 in recognition of her contributions to LGBT visibility and the community.
