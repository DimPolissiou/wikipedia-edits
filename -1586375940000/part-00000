The city serves as the capital of the [[Guriel District]].\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Bilicda qurxoon ee Guriceel.jpg|thumb|a view of some of the famous places in Guriel]]\n\nThe city is located in central Somalia and it is sixty three kilometers South west of Dhusamareb, the capital of Galguduud region of Somalia. On its south west, there is Matabaan, a district in Hiiran region. Because of its proximity to the border between Ethiopia and Somalia, the city has been for a long time been an international crossing line and a hub that facilitated and connected the Somali Ethiopians to other parts of the world and Somalia.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe Greater [[Guriel District]] has a population estimated at around 350,000, Highest Populated district in the central region. The city is the main administrative district, as well as the main economic lifeline for approximately hundred and twenty villages, making it one of the busies cities in central Somalia. The majority of the city's population are from the Ayr sub-clan, with Ayaanle, yabadhaalo and Habaraji well represented.<ref> http://piracyreport.com/index.php/post/1049/ASWJ_Returns_to_the_Frontlines</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nThe city has been under the rule of Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a since 2008 after the group liberated the city from al-shabab who then controlled the city. <ref> https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/127401/170%20Somalia%20The%20Transitional%20Government%20on%20Life%20Support.pdf</ref> <ref>http://piracyreport.com/index.php/subcategory/12/Street_FIGHT/Conflict/052012///4</ref> The religious group has been historically apolitical, non-violent peaceful religious group. Just like most other civil societies, they have been affected by the arrival of the wahibis/ salafist inspired radical groups. Their shrines and tombs have been destroyed by Alshabab and affiliates and many of their religious practices such as the Mowliid (celebrating the birth of the Prophet of Islam) and the use of Misbaha were banned by Alshabab. Feeling under threat and prosecuted, the group have taken up arms and were successful in driving Alshabab from the city and the neighboring districts. <ref> https://ctc.usma.edu/inside-look-at-the-fighting-between-al-shabab-and-ahlu-sunna-wal-jama/</ref> \n\nSince the successful capture of Guriel,  Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a have developed a religious inspired political ideology, which like Alshabab aims to establish a sharia in the area. However, Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a version of Sharia is not as strict as that of Alshabab and they have not carried out some of the capital punishments which Alshabab is famous for.\n\nThere have been many attempts by the Federal Government in Mogadishu to try to bring Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a under its wings and integrate the group's militia into the national army. These attempts have failed because the group claims that the terms of the integration were not suitable, but in 2018 after a successful power sharing deal between [[Galmudug]] state and the group who have had a stand off since 2015 after the group withdrew from a state formation in adado endorsed by the federal government of Somalia then led by [[Hassan Sheikh Mohamud]] after the federal government installed It's  ally [[Abdikarim Hussein Guled]] as the president of the new state. \n\nAs of 2018, the city and the other neighboring cities and towns who were once under the control of Ahlu suna waljama\u2019a are now under the administration of [[Galmudug]] state of Somalia after a power sharing deal between Ahlu suna waljama\u2019a and Galmudug state government in late 2017.<ref> https://igad.int/programs/66-somalia/1789-the-launch-of-preliminary-agreement-between-the-leadership-of-galmudug-and-ahlu-suna-waljamaca-aswj-on-merging-parliaments-and-sharing-power</ref>\n<ref> https://www.garoweonline.com/en/news/somalia/somalia-aswj-merges-with-galmudug-ending-years-of-split</ref>\n==Economy==\n[[File:Guriceel Galmudug Somalia.jpeg|thumb|[[Hormuud Telecom]] Building in Guriel.]]\nGuriel is a major trading center in Somalia and the largest in Galgaduud region. Its economy mostly relies on the trading of livestock and the provision of other services to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in the region. Because of its strategic location, the city acts as a bridge that connects the Southern part of Somalia to the rest of Somalia.\n\nThe city is very young compared to the neighboring cities and districts in the regions, and has only been historically a  resting stop for the nomads to their way to Dhusamareeb and Matabaan. However, because large number of people moved from Mogadishu and other volatile southern cities to the city during the civil war, its population has exploded. With increase in population, the city's economy and importance in the region has grown tremendously.\n\nToday Guriel is one of the largest cities in Galgaduud region and the main trading center in central Somalia, apart from Galkacyo. The city's impressive economic growth is due to mainly the expatriate community's investment as well as increased local level investment which is seen by many to have been encouraged by the relative peace that city has enjoyed throughout the civil war.\n\nThe many business that operate in the city include telecommunications companies, construction companies and livestock trading firms owned both by Somalis and non-Somalis. When you walk in the city you would see big markets selling all type of things, traders negotiating with each other, drivers skillfully navigating the traffic and young enthusiastic children playing on the sides of the city's narrow streets.\n\n==Education==\nIt is estimated that the city has more than twenty different schools, providing both primary level as well as secondary education and universities. The city has three main universities, East African University, Galgaduud University and Savannah University.<ref> http://savannahuni.com/login/</ref>\n\nThese universities provide both graduate as well as post-graduate degrees. Some of the most popular programs in which the majority of the students are enrolled in include Information Technology, Law and Sharia, Medicine, nursing and Veterinary sciences.\n\n==Governance==\n\nThe City is governed by a mayor appointed by the [[Galguduud]] administration. the current mayor of the city is Abdullahi Mohamed Barre who was appointed by then Ahlu suna waljama'a Galguduud administration. after a power sharing deal between Ahlu suna Waljama'a and Galmudug in late 2017, the two administrations merged and are now part of Galmudug. <ref> https://www.garoweonline.com/en/news/somalia/somalia-aswj-merges-with-galmudug-ending-years-of-split</ref>\n\n==Local Cuisine==\nCanjeelo (a light pancake) with gravy or tea and sesame oil is the main breakfast. During lunch and Dinner, the local population eat either Pasta with tomato sauce or rice cooked with goat meat and spices. This was not historically the main food, but due to Italian influence in the South and British influence in  Northern Somalia, the  traditional food, which consisted of sorghum, maize, beans and other locally produced crops were discredit as backward and uncivilized and the European cuisine have taken their place. However, this trend seems to be changed; there is seen a movement in the region that encourages and promoted the eating of the locally produced crops.\n\nThe city is very famous for its fine hotels and restaurants. The most famous meal during the lunch time which you could have in the area is \"Bariis and Hilib arri\"\u2014rice and goat meat, prepared with spices.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe city is well connected to all parts of Somalia, both by road and Air. Guriel Airport is the city's main airport and there are daily flights to Mogadishu, Hargeisa, Bosaaso and Kismaayo.\n\n==Services==\nSeveral health centers exist in the town. Sterlin Hospital is the biggest hospital in the town, the hospital is also used by Patients from all of [[Galguduud]] region. hospital xalimo caruush is also a hospital in the town.<ref>https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sterlin+Hospital,+Guriceel,+Somalia/@5.3131262,45.8872362,17z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x3d6314c26bdfcea9:0x79172f018f25ed1d-Guri'el</ref>\n<ref>http://placesmap.net/SO/Galguduud/hospital/</ref> \nMany International Organizations have offices in Guriel such as [[M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res|MSF]], [[Action contre la Faim|ACF]], [[Save The Children]], [[World Food Programme|WFP]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[UNICEF]] and [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\" caption=\"Guriel in different times\">\nFile:Guriceel 2018.jpg\nFile:Guriceel Galmudug Somalia.jpeg\nFile:Camels in Guriceel District.jpeg\nFile:Beauty of the countryside of Guriceel.jpeg\nFile:Camels in the outskirts of Guriceel.jpeg\nFile:Termite Mound in the outskirts of Guriceel.jpeg\nFile:Landscape of Guriceel.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/somalia/galguduud/dhuusamareeb/guri-ceel/ Guriel, Galgaduud, Somalia]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibhiog_9xlY Guriel:Somalia]\n*[https://www.https://guriceel.net/ Guriel Online News site]\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Galguduud]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Somalia]]\n[[Category:Galmudug]]\n[[Category:Cities in Somalia]]\n[[Category:Towns in Somalia]]\n[[Category:Somalia]]\n[[category:Galguduud]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name          = Guriel\n|other_name             = \u062c\u0631\u0639\u064a\u0644\n|native_name            =<small>''Guriceel''</small>\n|nickname               =\n|settlement_type        = city\n|motto                  = \n|image_skyline          = File:Bilicda qurxoon ee Guriceel.jpg\n|image_caption          = \n|image_flag             = \n|flag_size              = 260px\n|image_seal             = \n|seal_size              = \n|image_map              = \n|mapsize                = \n|map_caption            = \n|pushpin_map            = Somalia\n|pushpin_relief         = Yes\n|pushpin_label_poistion = bottom\n|pushpin_mapsize        = \n|pushpin_map_caption    = Location in Somalia\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = {{flag|Somalia}}\n|subdivision_type1      = State\n|subdivision_name1      = {{flag|Galmudug}}\n|subdivision_type2      = [[Administrative divisions of Somalia|Region]]\n|subdivision_name2      = [[Galguduud]]\n|subdivision_type3      = [[Administrative divisions of Somalia|District]]\n|subdivision_name3      = [[Guriel District|Guriel]]\n|government_footnotes   = \n|government_type        =  [[Mayor\u2013council government|Mayor-Council-Commission]]\n|leader_title           = [[Mayor]]\n|leader_name            = Abdullahi Mohamed Barre\n|established_title      = \n|established_date       = \n|area_magnitude         = \n|unit_pref              = Metric \n|area_footnotes         = \n|area_total_km2         = \n|area_land_km2          = \n|population_as_of       = 2018\n|population_footnotes   = \n|population_note        = \n|population_total       = 350000\n|population_density_km2 = \n|timezone               = [[East Africa Time|EAT]]\n|utc_offset             = +3\n|timezone_DST           = \n|utc_offset_DST         = \n|coordinates            = {{coord|5|18|32|N|45|52|55|E|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation_footnotes    = \n|elevation_m            = \n|postal_code_type       = \n|postal_code            = \n|area_code              = \n|website                = \n|footnotes              = \n}}\n'''Guriel''' ({{lang-so|Guriceel}}, {{lang-ar|\u062c\u0631\u0639\u064a\u0644}}), is a rapidly developing city and one of the largest cities in the [[Galguduud]] region of [[Galmudug]] state in central [[Somalia]].

Their shrines and tombs have been destroyed by Alshabab and affiliates and many of their religious practices such as the Mowliid (celebrating the birth of the Prophet of Islam) and the use of Misbaha were banned by Alshabab. Feeling under threat and prosecuted, the group have taken up arms and were successful in driving Alshabab from the city and the neighboring districts. <ref> https://ctc.usma.edu/inside-look-at-the-fighting-between-al-shabab-and-ahlu-sunna-wal-jama/</ref> \n\nSince the successful capture of Guriel,  Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a have developed a religious inspired political ideology, which like Alshabab aims to establish a sharia in the area. However, Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a version of Sharia is not as strict as that of Alshabab and they have not carried out some of the capital punishments which Alshabab is famous for.\n\nThere have been many attempts by the Federal Government in Mogadishu to try to bring Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a under its wings and integrate the group's militia into the national army. These attempts have failed because the group claims that the terms of the integration were not suitable, but in 2018 after a successful power sharing deal between [[Galmudug]] state and the group who have had a stand off since 2015 after the group withdrew from a state formation in adado endorsed by the federal government of Somalia then led by [[Hassan Sheikh Mohamud]] after the federal government installed It's  ally [[Abdikarim Hussein Guled]] as the president of the new state. \n\nAs of 2018, the city and the other neighboring cities and towns who were once under the control of Ahlu suna waljama\u2019a are now under the administration of [[Galmudug]] state of Somalia after a power sharing deal between Ahlu suna waljama\u2019a and Galmudug state government in late 2017.<ref> https://igad.int/programs/66-somalia/1789-the-launch-of-preliminary-agreement-between-the-leadership-of-galmudug-and-ahlu-suna-waljamaca-aswj-on-merging-parliaments-and-sharing-power</ref>\n<ref> https://www.garoweonline.com/en/news/somalia/somalia-aswj-merges-with-galmudug-ending-years-of-split</ref>\n==Economy==\n[[File:Guriceel Galmudug Somalia.jpeg|thumb|[[Hormuud Telecom]] Building in Guriel.]]\nGuriel is a major trading center in Somalia and the largest in Galgaduud region. Its economy mostly relies on the trading of livestock and the provision of other services to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in the region. Because of its strategic location, the city acts as a bridge that connects the Southern part of Somalia to the rest of Somalia.\n\nThe city is very young compared to the neighboring cities and districts in the regions, and has only been historically a  resting stop for the nomads to their way to Dhusamareeb and Matabaan. However, because large number of people moved from Mogadishu and other volatile southern cities to the city during the civil war, its population has exploded. With increase in population, the city's economy and importance in the region has grown tremendously.\n\nToday Guriel is one of the largest cities in Galgaduud region and the main trading center in central Somalia, apart from Galkacyo. The city's impressive economic growth is due to mainly the expatriate community's investment as well as increased local level investment which is seen by many to have been encouraged by the relative peace that city has enjoyed throughout the civil war.\n\nThe many business that operate in the city include telecommunications companies, construction companies and livestock trading firms owned both by Somalis and non-Somalis. When you walk in the city you would see big markets selling all type of things, traders negotiating with each other, drivers skillfully navigating the traffic and young enthusiastic children playing on the sides of the city's narrow streets.\n\n==Education==\nIt is estimated that the city has more than twenty different schools, providing both primary level as well as secondary education and universities. The city has three main universities, East African University, Galgaduud University and Savannah University.<ref> http://savannahuni.com/login/</ref>\n\nThese universities provide both graduate as well as post-graduate degrees. Some of the most popular programs in which the majority of the students are enrolled in include Information Technology, Law and Sharia, Medicine, nursing and Veterinary sciences.\n\n==Governance==\n\nThe City is governed by a mayor appointed by the [[Galguduud]] administration. the current mayor of the city is Abdullahi Mohamed Barre who was appointed by then Ahlu suna waljama'a Galguduud administration. after a power sharing deal between Ahlu suna Waljama'a and Galmudug in late 2017, the two administrations merged and are now part of Galmudug. <ref> https://www.garoweonline.com/en/news/somalia/somalia-aswj-merges-with-galmudug-ending-years-of-split</ref>\n\n==Local Cuisine==\nCanjeelo (a light pancake) with gravy or tea and sesame oil is the main breakfast. During lunch and Dinner, the local population eat either Pasta with tomato sauce or rice cooked with goat meat and spices. This was not historically the main food, but due to Italian influence in the South and British influence in  Northern Somalia, the  traditional food, which consisted of sorghum, maize, beans and other locally produced crops were discredit as backward and uncivilized and the European cuisine have taken their place. However, this trend seems to be changed; there is seen a movement in the region that encourages and promoted the eating of the locally produced crops.\n\nThe city is very famous for its fine hotels and restaurants. The most famous meal during the lunch time which you could have in the area is \"Bariis and Hilib arri\"\u2014rice and goat meat, prepared with spices.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe city is well connected to all parts of Somalia, both by road and Air. Guriel Airport is the city's main airport and there are daily flights to Mogadishu, Hargeisa, Bosaaso and Kismaayo.\n\n==Services==\nSeveral health centers exist in the town. Sterlin Hospital is the biggest hospital in the town, the hospital is also used by Patients from all of [[Galguduud]] region. hospital xalimo caruush is also a hospital in the town.<ref>https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sterlin+Hospital,+Guriceel,+Somalia/@5.3131262,45.8872362,17z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x3d6314c26bdfcea9:0x79172f018f25ed1d-Guri'el</ref>\n<ref>http://placesmap.net/SO/Galguduud/hospital/</ref> \nMany International Organizations have offices in Guriel such as [[M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res|MSF]], [[Action contre la Faim|ACF]], [[Save The Children]], [[World Food Programme|WFP]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[UNICEF]] and [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\" caption=\"Guriel in different times\">\nFile:Guriceel 2018.jpg\nFile:Guriceel Galmudug Somalia.jpeg\nFile:Camels in Guriceel District.jpeg\nFile:Beauty of the countryside of Guriceel.jpeg\nFile:Camels in the outskirts of Guriceel.jpeg\nFile:Termite Mound in the outskirts of Guriceel.jpeg\nFile:Landscape of Guriceel.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/somalia/galguduud/dhuusamareeb/guri-ceel/ Guriel, Galgaduud, Somalia]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibhiog_9xlY Guriel:Somalia]\n*[https://www.https://guriceel.net/ Guriel Online News site]\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Galguduud]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Somalia]]\n[[Category:Galmudug]]\n[[Category:Cities in Somalia]]\n", "name_user": "Ayanl3", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guriel"}

These countries have a long tradition in comics separate from English-language comics.  Belgium is a bilingual country, and comics originally in the [[Dutch language]] ({{lang|nl|stripverhalen}}, literally \"strip stories\", or simply \"strips\") are part of ''bandes dessin\u00e9es'' culturally; these BDs are translated to French and concurrently sold to the French-reading audience.\n\nAmong the most popular ''bandes dessin\u00e9es'' that have achieved international fame are, among humorous BDs, ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' ([[Herg\u00e9]]), ''[[Gaston Lagaffe]]'' ([[Franquin]]), ''[[Asterix]]'' ([[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny|Goscinny]] & [[Albert Uderzo|Uderzo]]), ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' ([[Morris (cartoonist)|Morris]] & [[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny|Goscinny]]), and ''[[The Smurfs]]'' ([[Peyo]]).  Well-regarded realistically drawn and plotted ''bandes dessin\u00e9es'' include ''[[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]'' ([[Jean Michel Charlier|Charlier]] & [[Jean Giraud|Giraud]], aka \"Moebius\"), ''[[Thorgal]]'' ([[Jean van Hamme|van Hamme]] & [[Grzegorz Rosi\u0144ski|Rosi\u0144ski]]), ''[[XIII (comics)|XIII]]'' (van Hamme & [[William Vance|Vance]]), and the creations of [[Hermann Huppen|Hermann]].\n\n==Reach==\nIn Europe, the [[French language]] is spoken natively not only in France and the [[city state]] of [[Monaco]], but also by about 40% of the population of [[Belgium]], 16% of the population of [[Luxembourg]], and about 20% of the population of [[Switzerland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://official-swiss-national-languages.all-about-switzerland.info/|title=Switzerland's Four National Languages|last=Switzerland|first=Markus G. Jud, Lucerne|website=official-swiss-national-languages.all-about-switzerland.info|access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref> The shared language creates an artistic and commercial market where national identity is often blurred, and one of the main rationales for the conception of the \"Franco-Belgian comics\" expression itself. The potential appeal of the French-language comics extends beyond Francophone Europe, as France in particular has strong historical and cultural ties with several Francophone overseas territories, some of which, like [[French Polynesia]] or [[French Guiana]], still being [[Overseas France]]. Of these territories it is [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], where Franco-Belgian comics are doing best, due &ndash; aside from the obvious fact that it has the largest comic reading Francophone population outside Europe &ndash; to that province's close historical and cultural ties with the motherland and where European comic publishers like [[Le Lombard]] and [[Dargaud]] maintain a strong presence, in the process heavily influencing its own native [[Quebec comics]] scene, particularly from 1960 onwards. This is in stark contrast to the English-speaking part of the country, which is culturally [[American comic book|US comics]] oriented.\n\nWhile [[Flemish people|Flemish]] Belgian comic books (originally written in Dutch) are influenced by Francophone comics, especially in the early years, they evolved into a distinctly different style, both in art and in spirit, which is why they are nowadays sometimes (sub-)categorized as [[Belgian comics|Flemish comics]], as their evolution started to take a different path from the late-1940s onward, due to cultural differences stemming from the increasing cultural self-awareness of the Flemish people. And while French-language publications are habitually translated into Dutch/Flemish, Dutch/Flemish publications are less commonly translated into French, for cultural reasons. Likewise, despite the shared language, Flemish comics do not do that well in the Netherlands and vice versa, save for some notable exceptions, such as the [[Willy Vandersteen]] creation ''Suske en Wiske'' (''[[Spike and Suzy]]'') which is popular across the border. Concurrently, the socio-cultural [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] contained within many Dutch/Flemish comics also means that these comics have seen far less translations into other languages than their French-language counterparts have due to their more universal appeal, and the French language's cultural status..\n\nBelgium is officially a trilingual country as there is also a [[German language|German]]-speaking minority, though Belgian comic home market first print releases, be it in Dutch or in French, are rarely translated into that language with German-speaking Belgians having to wait for internationally released editions for reading in their native tongue, typically those from licensed publishers stemming from neighboring [[Germany]]. Though Dutch and German are Germanic-language cousins, the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]] lies within the territory of the [[Walloon Region]], so that French is the most utilized (second) language in that area and has caused the handful of comic artists originating from there, such as Hermann and [[Didier Com\u00e8s]], to create their comics in French. Born Dieter Hermann Com\u00e8s, Com\u00e8s actually \"Frenchified\" his given name to this end, whereas Hermann has dispensed with his (Germanic) family name \"Huppen\" for his comics credits, though he maintained the Germanic spelling for his first name. Due to its relative modesty, both in size and in scope, and despite the close historical and cultural ties, no German-Belgian artists are as of 2018 known to have created comics specifically for the [[German comics]] world, when discounting commercial translations of their original Francophone creations.\n\nSomething similar applies to France, where there exist [[Languages of France|several regional languages]], of which [[Breton language|Breton]] &ndash; represented by comics artist [[Claude Auclair]] &ndash; and [[Occitan language|Occitan]] are two of the more substantial ones. But while these languages are culturally recognized as regional languages, they are, contrary to Belgium in regard to German, not recognized as official national languages, with similar consequences as in Belgium for comics and their artists; native comics are rarely, if at all, released in these languages by the main comic publishers, whereas artists stemming from these regions, invariably create their comics in French &ndash; like their German-Belgian counterparts forced to do so in order to gain commercial access to the main market. On rare occasions though, small, independent local and regional publishers obtain licenses from the main comic publisher to release comic books, or rather comic albums (see: ''[[Franco-Belgian comics#Formats|below]]''), of the more popular comics in translation into the native tongue &ndash; albeit almost always long after the original French-language release of the album in question. One such known publisher is {{ill|Banno\u00f9-Heol|fr}} (est. 1999), operating out of [[Quimper]], [[Brittany]], who has released several into Breton translated comic albums.<ref>[http://www.b-heol.com/accueil Banno\u00f9-Heol], official site {{in lang|fr}}; The aim of the publisher, and others of its kind, is not primarily a commercial one, but rather a cultural one, intended as a means to keep Breton &ndash; like many other regional languages in danger of becoming extinct &ndash; a living and breathing language.</ref> For the very small [[Catalan language|Catalan]] speaking populace there actually is a round-about alternative though, as several Spanish comic publishers (including the most prominent ones, [[Norma Editorial]] and the Spanish subsidiary of [[Gl\u00e9nat Editions]]) regularly release bilingual editions of their comics for [[Catalonia|their Catalan population]], which include imported Franco-Belgian comics, and of which ''Asterix'' and '' The Adventures of Tintin'' are prime examples. The situation for France's slightly larger German-speaking minority &ndash; represented by comics artist [[Guy Sajer]] ''aka'' Guy Mouminoux &ndash; is identical to its more sizable counterpart in northern neighbor Belgium in regard to comics-related matters.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe term ''bandes dessin\u00e9es'' is derived from the original description of the art form as \"drawn strips\". It was first introduced in the 1930s, but only became popular in the 1960s, by which time the \"BD\" abbreviation was also in use for its book, or album, publications (see [[#Formats|below]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=La (presque) v\u00e9ritable histoire des mots \"bande dessin\u00e9e\"|url=http://www.comixtrip.fr/dossiers/la-presque-veritable-histoire-des-mots-bande-dessinee|work=Comixtrip.fr|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''bandes dessin\u00e9es'' contains no indication of subject matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply a humorous art form. Indeed, the distinction of comics as the \"ninth art\" is prevalent in Francophone scholarship on the form (''le neuvi\u00e8me art''), as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. The \"ninth art\" designation stems from a 1964 article by {{Interlanguage link multi|Claude Beylie|fr}} in the magazine ''Lettres et M\u00e9decins'',<ref>Claude Beylie, \u00ab La bande dessin\u00e9e est-elle un art ? \u00bb, ''Lettres et M\u00e9decins'', literary supplement ''La Vie m\u00e9dicale'', March 1964.</ref> and was subsequently popularized in an article series about the history of comics, which appeared in weekly installments in ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine from 1964 to 1967. Written by Belgian [[Morris (comics)|Morris]] with editorial input from the [[#Conventions and journalistic professionalism|below-mentioned]] Frenchman {{ill|Claude Moliterni|fr}}, the article series was in itself an example of a Franco-Belgian comics project.<ref>[[Morris (comics)|Morris]] and Pierre Vanker, \u00ab Neuvi\u00e8me Art, mus\u00e9e de la bande dessin\u00e9e \u00bb in: ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' no. 1392 (17 December 1964): \"Les bandes dessin\u00e9es sont n\u00e9es avant le cin\u00e9matographe de MM.

In recent decades the English \"graphic novel\" expression has increasingly been adopted in Europe as well in the wake of the works of [[Will Eisner]] and [[Art Spiegelman]], but there with the specific intent to discriminate between comics intended for a more younger and/or general readership, and those which feature more adult, mature and literary themes, not rarely in conjuncture with an innovative and/or experimental comic art style.<ref name =\"grafnov\">{{cite web|title=Stripgeschiedenis: 2000-2010 Graphic novels|url=https://www.lambiek.net/aanvang/2000graphicnovel.htm|work=Lambiek.net|language=nl}}</ref> As a result, European comic scholars have retroactively identified the 1962 ''[[Barbarella (comics)|Barbarella]]'' comic by [[Jean-Claude Forest]] (for its theme) and the first 1967 ''Corto Maltese'' adventure ''Una ballata del mare salato'' (''A Ballad of the Salt Sea'') by [[Hugo Pratt]] (for both art, and story style) in particular, as the comics up for consideration as the first European \"graphic novels\".\n\n==History<!--'History of Franco-Belgian comics' redirects here-->==\n[[File:Pieds Nickeles 5.jpg|right|thumb|The French comic ''Les Pieds Nickel\u00e9s'' (1954 book cover): an early 20th-century forerunner of the modern Franco-Belgian comic]]\nDuring the 19th century, there were many artists in Europe drawing cartoons, occasionally even utilizing sequential multi-panel narration, albeit mostly with clarifying captions and dialogue placed under the panels rather than the [[word balloons]] commonly used today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/1763141/138645_Forceville_El_Refaie_and_Meesters_chapter_for_Stylistics_handbook_ed_Burke_pre_print_distributed_version.pdf|title=Stylistics and comics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These were humorous short works rarely longer than a single page.

It was quite different from future versions of Tintin, the style being very na\u00efve and simple, even childish, compared to the later stories. The early ''Tintin'' stories often featured [[The Adventures of Tintin#Criticisms of the series|racist and political stereotypes]], which caused [[The Adventures of Tintin#Controversy|controversies]] after the war, and which Herg\u00e9 later regretted. At the time however, ''Tintin'' turned out to be so popular right from the start, that the magazine decided to release the stories in hardcover book format as well, directly after they had run their respective courses in the magazine, in the process introducing something new in the Belgian comic world, the speech balloon [[#Formats|comic album]]. The 1930 ''Tintin au pays des Soviets'' title is generally considered the very first of its kind &ndash; even though there are three similar ''Zig et Puce'' titles from French publisher [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]], known to predate the ''Tintin'' title by one to two years, but which failed to find an audience outside France however.<ref>[https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-1086-BD-Zig-et-Puce.html ''Zig et Puce'' (original)], Bedeteque.com {{in lang|fr}}</ref>  The magazine continued to do so for the subsequent three stories until 1934 when the magazine, as such not particularly well-suited as book publisher, turned album publication over to Belgian specialized book publisher [[Casterman]], who has been the ''Tintin'' album publisher ever since.\n\nThe criticisms regarding the early stories notwithstanding and even though the format still had a long way to go, ''Tintin'' is widely considered the starting point and [[archetype]] of the modern Franco-Belgian comic as currently understood, and as amply demonstrated in the vast majority of treatises and reference works written on the subject since the 1960s, and the first to find a readership outside its originating country. As such the ''Tintin'' series went on to become one of the greatest post-war successes of the Franco-Belgian comic world, having seen translations in dozens of languages, including English, as well as becoming one of the relatively few European comics to have seen a major, successful, Hollywood [[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|movie adaptation]] as late as 2011, nearly thirty years after its creator had died.\n\nA further step towards modern comic books happened in 1934 when Hungarian [[Paul Winkler (publisher)|Paul Winkler]], who had previously been distributing comics to the monthly magazines via his [[Opera Mundi]] bureau, made a deal with [[King Features Syndicate]] to create the ''[[Le Journal de Mickey|Journal de Mickey]]'', a weekly 8-page early \"comic-book\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://comicskingdom.com/phantom|title=Phantom Comic Strip for June 19, 2017|website=Comics Kingdom|language=en|access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,766075,00.html|title=The Press: EIGHTH WONDER SYNDICATED|date=1941-09-15|work=Time|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>  The success was immediate, and soon other publishers started publishing periodicals with American series, which enjoyed considerable popularity in both France and Belgium. This continued during the remainder of the decade, with hundreds of magazines publishing mostly imported material. The most important ones in France were ''Robinson'', ''Hurrah'', and the {{ill|Fleurus presse|fr}} (on behalf of the {{ill|Action catholique des enfants|fr}} ''aka'' C\u0153urs Vaillants et \u00c2mes Vaillantes de France) publications ''[[C\u0153urs Vaillants]]'' (\"Valiant Hearts\", 1929, for adolescent boys), ''{{ill|\u00c2mes vaillantes|fr}}'' (\"Valiant Souls\", 1937, for adolescent girls) and ''{{ill|Fripounet et Marisette|fr}}'' (1945, for pre-adolescents), while Belgian examples included ''Wrill'' and ''[[Bravo (comic book)|Bravo]]''.\n\n''Coeurs Vaillants'' started to publish ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in syndication from 1930 onward, constituting one of the earliest known French-Belgian comic world cross-fertilizations, only reinforced when Abbot Courtois, editor-in-chief of ''Coeurs Vaillants'', asked Herg\u00e9 to create a series about real children with a real family as opposed to ''Tintin''{{'}}s ambiguous age and family (and thus more in line with the Catholic norms and values on which the magazine was founded), which resulted in the 1936 comic ''[[The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko]]''. Incidentally, as Herg\u00e9 created his comics in the increasingly popular speech balloon format, it initially led to [[C\u0153urs Vaillants#History|a conflict with ''C\u0153urs Vaillants'']], which utilized the text comic format its editors considered more appropriate from an educational point-of-view. Herg\u00e9 won the argument, and speech balloon comics were henceforth featured ''alongside'' text comics in the magazine (and that of its spin-offs) until the mid-1960s, when speech balloon comics were all but abandoned by the magazine(s), the general trend notwithstanding.\n\nIn 1938, the Belgian ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine was launched. Conceived in response to the immense popularity of ''Journal de Mickey'' and the success of ''Tintin'' in ''Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me'', the black and white/color hybrid magazine featured predominantly comics from an American origin at the time of its launch until the war years, but there were also native comics included. These concerned ''[[Spirou (comics)|Spirou]]'', created by the Frenchman [[Rob-Vel]] (and thus another early cross-fertilization example) and who served as the mascot and namesake for the new magazine,<ref name=\"velter\">{{cite web |url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/rob_vel.htm |title=Rob-Vel: Robert Velter (9 February 1909 - 27 April 1991, France) |work=Lambiek.net}}</ref> and ''[[Tif et Tondu]]'' created by Belgian artist [[Fernand Dineur]].<ref name=\"dineur\">{{cite web |url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/dineur_f.htm |title=Fernand Dineur (17 May 1904 - April 1956, Belgium) |work=Lambiek.net}}</ref> Both series would survive the war and achieve considerable popularity after the war, albeit under the aegis of other artists (see below).

Soon even those homemade versions of American comics had to stop, and the authors had to create their own heroes and stories, giving new talents a chance to be published. Many of the most famous artists of the Franco-Belgian comics started in this period, including the Belgians Andr\u00e9 Franquin, [[Peyo]] (who started together at the small Belgian animation studio Compagnie Belge d'Animation &ndash; CBA), [[Willy Vandersteen]], and the Frenchmen [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]] and [[Albert Uderzo]], who worked for ''Bravo''.\n\n===1944<!--World Press and 'Coq Hardi' were established in 1944 and 'Spirou' modernized-->\u20131959: Post-war era Belgian supremacy===\n[[File:Bob-de-moor-1357174668.jpg |right|thumb|upright|Close Herg\u00e9 collaborator and magazine contributor [[Bob de Moor]]]]\nA lot of the publishers and artists who had managed to continue working during the occupation were accused of being collaborators and were imprisoned after the liberation by the reinstated national authorities on the insistence of the former French resistance, although most were released soon afterwards without charges being pressed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W0Sn-1H3_4wC&pg=PR20&lpg=PR20&dq=publishers+artists,+belgium+occuation+prosecution#v=onepage&q=publishers%20artists,%20belgium%20occuation%20prosecution&f=false|title=Responses: On Paul de Man's Wartime Journalism|last=Hamacher|first=Werner|last2=Hertz|first2=Neil|last3=Keenan|first3=Thomas|date=1989|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=080327243X|language=en}}</ref> For example, this happened to one of the famous magazines, ''Coeurs Vaillants''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eS5v-F04AoQC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=Coeurs+Vaillants+collaborators+occupation+belgium#v=onepage&q=Coeurs%20Vaillants%20collaborators%20occupation%20belgium&f=false|title=Herg\u00e9, Son of Tintin|last=Peeters|first=Benoit|date=2012|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9781421404547|language=en}}</ref> It was founded by Abbot Courtois (under the alias Jacques Coeur) in 1929.

Likewise, Herg\u00e9 was another artist who also found himself on the receiving end of similar accusations of the former Belgian resistance.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eS5v-F04AoQC&pg=PA175&lpg=PA175&dq=Herg%C3%A9+was+another+artist+to+be+prosecuted+by+the+resistance#v=onepage&q=Herg%C3%A9%20was%20another%20artist%20to%20be%20prosecuted%20by%20the%20resistance&f=false|title=Herg\u00e9, Son of Tintin|last=Peeters|first=Benoit|date=2012|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9781421404547|language=en}}</ref> He managed to clear his name and went on to create [[Studio Herg\u00e9]] in 1950, where he acted as a sort of mentor for the assistants that it attracted.

In 1946, Herg\u00e9 also founded the weekly ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine, which quickly gained enormous popularity, like the weekly ''Spirou'' appearing in a Dutch version under the name ''Kuifje'' for the Flemish and Dutch markets.<ref>Very first Dutch price indication already on the cover of [https://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/24809_Kuifje__Weekblad_1946_Jgn_1_9_Nummer_9 ''Kuifje'', issue 9, 21 November 1946].</ref> Notable Belgian comic artists who at a later point in time achieved fame while working for ''Tintin'' magazine included among others [[William Vance]], the aforementioned Greg, [[Tibet (comics)|Tibet]] and [[Hermann Huppen]].\n\n''Tintin'' magazine publisher Les \u00c9ditions du Lombard (as of 1989 simply: [[Le Lombard]]) was especially founded by [[Raymond Leblanc]] for the magazine's launch in conjuncture with Herg\u00e9 as the latter could not find a publisher due to the fact that he was at that time still under investigation for alleged collaboration. Remarkably, album publications of the creations from the early group of artists centered around Herg\u00e9 was, then and now, outsourced to longstanding ''Tintin'' book publisher Casterman, while Lombard itself only started album publications for those artist who joined the magazine at a later point in time. Nonetheless, with Lombard Francophone Europe had received its first specialized comics publisher actually conceived as such. Le Lombard went on to become one of the three great Belgian publishing houses to produce comics in French (and in Dutch as well for that matter due to the bi-lingual nature of the country), alongside Dupuis and Casterman, and like them as of 2017 still in existence.\n\nMany other magazines did not survive the war: ''Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me'' had disappeared, ''Le Journal de Mickey'' only returned in 1952. In the second half of the 1940s many new magazines appeared, although in most cases they only survived for a few weeks or months. The situation stabilized around 1950 with ''Spirou'' and the new ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine (with the team focused around Herg\u00e9) as the most influential and successful magazines for the next decade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/how-tintin-creator-herg%C3%A9-reflected-the-ups-and-downs-of-the-20th-century/a-35900861|title=How Tintin creator Herg\u00e9 reflected the ups and downs of the 20th century |date=2016-09-27|work=Deutsche Welle|language=en|access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref>\n\nYet, 1944 (both [[Liberation of France|France]] and [[Liberation of Belgium|Belgium]] were liberated before war's end) had already seen the start of the industry career of the French-Belgian [[Jean-Michel Charlier]], in the process becoming one of its most towering figures. That year and a lawyer by trade, Charlier joined the newly formed comic syndication agency {{ill|World Press|fr}} of [[Georges Troisfontaines]], Belgium's answer to King Features Syndicate. Originally hired as an editorial draughtsman, Troisfontaines recognized Charlier's talent for writing and persuaded him to switch from drawing to scripting comics, something Charlier did with great success for the remainder of his life, creating close to three dozen series, several of them becoming classics of the Franco-Belgian ''bande dessin\u00e9e''.<ref>[[#References|Ratier, 2013, pp. 312\u2013315]]</ref> ''Spirou'' magazine became the agency's first and foremost client, and the first post-war decade saw the infusion into the magazine with many new series from young, predominantly Belgian talents like [[Eddy Paape]], [[Victor Hubinon]], [[Mitacq]], [[Albert Weinberg]], instituting an era in which Jij\u00e9's career truly took off with his best-known creation, the [[Western (genre)|Western]] comic series ''[[Jerry Spring]]'', that started its run in ''Spirou'' in March 1954. Jij\u00e9 incidentally, had magazine tenure, but closely cooperated with the World Press artists before embarking on his own creation. Successful series Charlier himself created in this period were the educational short series ''[[L'oncle Paul|Les Belles Histoires de l'oncle Paul]]'' (serving as proving ground in order to develop the talents and skills of young aspiring artists like Belgians Mitacq, {{ill|Arthur Piroton|fr}}, Hermann, [[Dino Attanasio]] and the Frenchman [[Jean Graton]] among others, several of whom switching over to industry competitor Lombard at a later point in their careers, most notably Hermann), ''[[Buck Danny]]'' (with Hubinon), ''[[La Patrouille des Castors]]'' (with Mitacq after his apprenticeship on ''L'oncle Paul'') and ''Jean Valhardi'' (with Paape and Jij\u00e9). Aside from being a very prolific comic script writer, becoming his  trademark henceforth, Charlier also became an editorial driving force and spokesperson for the agency, because of his background in law and his assertive personality. As such, he was responsible for introducing the two Frenchmen [[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] (who also starting out ''his'' comics career at the agency) and former ''Bravo'' artist [[Albert Uderzo]] to each other in 1951 at the in that year opened Paris, France, office of World Press, in the process creating one of Franco-Belgium's most successful ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' partnerships.<ref>[[#References|Ratier, 2013, Chapters 2\u20133, pp. 25\u2013140]]</ref> One of the first comics both men created together in the employ of the agency was the in colonial French-Canada era set Western series ''[[Oumpah-pah]]'', which was already conceived as loose gags in 1951, but failed to find a magazine publisher. Reworked into complete stories, the comic became successful in ''Tintin'' magazine in the period 1958\u20131962 (and thus, alongside Martin's ''[[The Adventures of Alix]]'', one of the first purely French comics to appear in the Belgian magazine), effectively becoming the \"spiritual father\" of their later ''Asterix'' creation.\n\n[[File:Morris - Maurice De Bevere.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Morris (cartoonist)|Maurice De Bevere]], also known as \"Morris\"]]\nBut it were not just the artists contracted by World Press who infused ''Spirou'' with its new elan, Dupuis itself had contracted a group of artists who were as much responsible for its success and then some as it was this group that defined the rejuvenated magazine in the post-war era. Upon war's end three artists from the defunct animation studio CBA were hired by Dupuis as staff artists for ''Spirou'', Eddy Paape (before he switched over to World Press), Andr\u00e9 Franquin and Maurice \"Morris\" De Bevere, and it was Morris who created in 1946 the second one of the great Franco-Belgian comic classics, ''Lucky Luke'', which made it first appearance in the ''Almanach'' appendix issue of 7 December 1946. Franquin was passed the comic ''Spirou et Fantasio'' by his mentor Jij\u00e9, who himself had taken over the series from original creator Rob-Vel in the war years, and it was Franquin who provided the series with its popularity, before he embarked for the magazine on his most popular creation ''[[Gaston (comics)|Gaston]]'' in 1957. With the addition of artist [[Will (comics)|Willy \"Will\" Maltaite]], who took over the series ''Tif et Tondu'' from original creator Fernand Dineur, the group that became known as \"''La bande des quatre''\" (Gang of 4), consisting of Jij\u00e9, Franquin, Morris and Will, was complete and constituted the foundation of what was coined the \"Marcinelle school\"-style.<ref>[[#References|de Weyer, 2015, pp. 143\u2013144]]</ref> However, such was the success of these artists, that the work of pre-war artists Rob-Vel and Dineur, was eclipsed by that of the younger generation, causing them to slide into oblivion.<ref name=\"velter\"/><ref name=\"dineur\"/> In 1952, another future great working in the Marcinelle school tradition was added to ''Spirou'', artist Pierre \"Peyo\" Culliford upon introduction by Franquin. Peyo was actually a former colleague of Franquin at CBA, but was at the time of the demise of the animation studio not considered by Dupuis because of his young age. For ''Spirou'' Peyo continued with the series ''[[Johan and Peewit|Johan et Pirlouit]]'', which he had already started in 1947 for the Belgian newspapers ''[[La Derni\u00e8re Heure]]'' and ''[[Le Soir]]''. It was this series that in 1957 spawned another of the great Franco-Belgian comic classics, ''Les Schtroumpfs'' (''[[The Smurfs]]''). With both magazines firmly in place, it was the success of ''Spirou'' and ''Tintin'' that initiated what many fans ''and'' scholars consider the golden age of the (Franco-)Belgian comic.<ref name=\"jobs\"/><ref name=\"dand\">{{Cite web|url=https://theses.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05142008-162029/unrestricted/thesis_final_060308.pdf|title=Producing Popularity: The Success in France of the Comics Series \"Ast\u00e9rix le Gaulois\"|last=Dandridge|first=Eliza Bourque|date=April 30, 2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As a result, the American comics didn't come back in as great a volume as before in both Belgium and France after the war, but in the case of France not for want of popularity, quite the contrary actually.\n\n====The ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' under siege in post-war France====\nIn France, a 1949 law about publications intended for the youth market was partly written by the [[French Communist Party]], a major political force in France directly after the war (because of their highly successful and effective [[French Resistance|resistance in the war years]]), to actually exclude most of the American publications.<ref name=\"dand\"/> The law, called \"{{ill|Loi du 16 juillet 1949 sur les publications destin\u00e9es \u00e0 la jeunesse|fr}}\" (\"Law of July 16th 1949 on Publications Aimed at the Youth\") and passed in response to the post-liberation influx of American comics, was invoked as late as 1969 to prohibit the comic magazine ''{{ill|Fantask|fr}}'' \u2014which featured translated versions of [[Marvel Comics]] stories \u2014 after seven issues. The formal and official justification for the law was the legislative desire to protect the youth of France from the perfidious and corruptive influence perceived to permeate foreign comics, especially in regard to violence and sexuality, the American ones in particular (even though they were not mentioned by name in the law), and in this the French law actually foreshadowed the 1954 publication of the comic condemning treatise ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' by [[Fredric Wertham]] in the United States itself. But there was an equally important, but unofficial, reason for the law as well; American comics were doing so well in post-liberation France, that native comic magazines, particularly the Catholic ones, became threatened in their very existence, and the law therefore became concurrently a veiled [[Protectionism|market protection mechanism]]. An added sense of urgency was, besides the huge popularity the American magazines enjoyed among France's youth, that the native publications had at that time a distinct disadvantage over their American counterparts as the country still experienced a serious post-war paper shortage (reflected as such in the poor paper quality, relatively low page count ''and'' lower circulation numbers of the native magazines of that era), something the higher quality American ones did not suffer from, they receiving preferential treatment under the [[Marshall Plan]]. The very first targeted American comic for example, ''[[Tarzan in comics|Tarzan]]'', enjoyed a weekly circulation of 300,00 copies, twice the one ''Coeurs Vaillants'' had and dwarfing the 76,000 copy circulation of ''Tintin'', and it was but one of the many American comics published in France in the immediate post-war era. It was the very reason for the unlikely French Catholic-Communist alliance in this regard, and a very effective one at that as American comics all but disappeared from the French comic scene for the time being, the [[Le Journal de Mickey]] excepted, which only reappeared three years later in former occupied western Europe.<ref name=\"jobs\"/>\n\nIt was not just American productions which were prohibited under the law, ({{ill|Commission de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le des publications destin\u00e9es \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 l'adolescence#Historique|fr}}) several Belgian French-language comic creations of the era also fell victim to the scrutiny of the oversight committee charged with upholding the law for varying reasons, as stipulated in its rather sweeping article 2 (presently article 3), which allowed for almost at will prohibition of comics for reasons that suited the policies of any French government in power at any given time. A famous example concerned the two [[Korean War]] volumes of the popular aviation comic series ''Buck Danny'', created by Belgians Charlier (who as spokesperson for World Press/''Spirou'' was actually summoned to appear in person for a board of inquiry at the French [[Minister of Information (France)|Ministry of Information]] to account for himself) and Hubinon, which were prohibited in 1954 as article 2 expressly forbade any mentioning of an actual, current armed conflict in a children's publication &ndash; but also because communist members of the commission had issues with the strong anticommunist sentiment expressed in the comic according to writer Charlier. Both volumes remained prohibited in France until 1969, though French fans on holiday in Belgium, Switzerland or Luxembourg could pick up the albums unhindered over there.<ref name=\"loi49\">{{cite book |last=Charlier |first=Jean-Michel |authorlink=Jean-Michel Charlier  |last2=Hubinon |first2=Victor |authorlink2=Victor Hubinon |title=La guerre de Cor\u00e9e |date=October 1984 |publisher=[[Dupuis]]|location=[[Marcinelle]] |pages=160 |isbn=2800110627 | language=French |quote=''Avions sans pilotes'' editorial, p. 100}}</ref> The law also came in handy to somewhat regulate &ndash; though not prohibiting &ndash; the availability in France of Belgian magazines like ''Spirou'' (which actually came close to prohibition  however, as the Korean War stories were serialized in the magazine, but which was narrowly averted at the eleventh hour by Charlier) and ''Tintin'' in favor of the native Catholic magazines, after the conservatives had reasserted their political predominance in the country during the 1950s.<ref>[[#References|de Weyer, 2015, pp. 84\u201389]]</ref>\n\nRigorously enforced by the government oversight committee {{ill|Commission de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le des publications destin\u00e9es \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 l'adolescence|fr}} (Committee in Charge of Surveillance and Control over Publications Aimed at Children and Adolescents), particularly in the 1950s and the first half of the 1960s, the law turned out to be a stifling influence on the post-war development of the French comic world until the advent of ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine and more specifically the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 social upheaval]]. Legally, the Commission had no punitive powers, only advisory ones, but in practice Charlier begged to differ. The all powerful Commission, shielded by the Justice Ministry (which ''was'' the punitive authority, but who took any and all Commission recommendations at face value, no questions asked),<ref name=\"jobs\"/> convened on a weekly basis, sifting through publications and weeding out those they felt subject to prohibition under the law, every decision they took being final, under no obligation to ever provide any formal justification whatsoever and without any possibility for appeal, which amounted to ''de facto'' state [[censorship]] according to Charlier.<ref name=\"loi49\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| image1 = \n| width1 = 135\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Marcel Gotlib 2011 a.jpg\n| width2 = 160\n| caption2=\n| image3 = Mandryka IMG 2751.JPG\n| width3 = 143\n| caption3=\n| footer = Marcel Gotlib (2011) and Nikita Mandryka (2011) on the right, members of an early generation of French artists who created modern comics without Belgian tutelage\n}}\nYet, it were also the communists who provided the comic scene in France with a single bright-spot; Having its origins in the communist wartime underground resistance publications, the comic magazine ''[[Pif gadget|Vaillant]]'' (not to be confused with the two near-similarly named Fleurus publications) was launched in 1945 upon war's end. The [[secular]] magazine provided a platform for predominantly native comic talent born between the 1920s and the 1940s, not able or willing to work for the Catholic magazines, to showcase their work. French names of note who started out their career in the magazine were among others [[Nikita Mandryka]], [[Paul Gillon]], [[Jean-Claude Forest]] and [[Marcel Gotlib]],<ref>[https://www.lambiek.net/magazines/vaillant.htm \"Comics History: Vaillant/Pif (1945 - 1992, 2004 - 2009)\"], Lambiek.net</ref> and were less beholden to what was then still the [[Belgian comics|Belgian ''bande dessin\u00e9e'']] tradition, other native contemporaries were &ndash; in essence ranking among the first native French artists to provide the \"Franco\" element in what later would become the \"Franco-Belgian comics\" expression, with comic artist [[Marijac]] having been a trailblazer. Marijac actually started out for ''Coeurs Vaillants'' in the 1930s, but distanced himself from the magazine directly after the liberation, when he started the secular comics magazine ''{{ill|Coq hardi (p\u00e9riodique)|fr}}'' (1944\u20131963), France's first recognizable modern ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' magazine. Marijac himself became a prolific figure of note in the French comic scene of the 1950s as co-editor and contributor for a series of native comic magazines other than his own ''Coq Hardi'', and conceived in the era under the shadow of the all-present Catholic publications to fill the void left by the banned American comics such as ''Les Grandes S\u00e9ries Internationales'', ''Cricri Journal'', ''Mireille'', ''Ouest-Magazine'', ''Nano et Nanette'', ''H\u00e9ros du Far West'', ''Frimousse'', ''Cocorico'' and ''Allez-France'', all of which filled with work from French artists, now forgotten save Marijac himself (who was honored for his efforts at the 1979 Angoul\u00eame comics festival with its most prestigious award), along with the magazines they created their work for.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/marijac.htm |title= Marijac: Jacques Dumas (7 November 1908 - 21 July 1994, France) |work=Lambiek.net}}</ref>\n\nIt has been observed that, unlike the Belgian publications, these mostly secular native magazines were largely left alone by the Commission de Surveillance,<ref name=\"weyer89\">[[#References|de Weyer, 2015, pp. 89\u201390]]</ref> save for one notable exception; Pierre Mouchot, creator and editor of American inspired comic magazines in the immediate post-war era, was on recommendation of the Commission persecuted for his likewise American (and Italian) inspired comic series ''Big Bill le Casseur'' and ''P\u2019tit Gars'', having to appear in court no less than eight times in the period 1950 - 1954, actually winning most of his cases in the lower courts. While both he and his creations are likewise forgotten, Mouchot became the only French comics artist to be legally persecuted, ''and'' ultimately convicted by the highest court of appeal (though only receiving symbolic punishment) under article 2 of the 1949 law for real. However, the conviction ''did'' serve as an effective deterrent for other native artists &ndash; and thus firmly establishing the Commission as a force to be reckoned with, even though they had a tough time becoming so as Mouchot kept winning his lower court cases &ndash; who continued to create their comics while erring on the side of caution for the next decade.<ref name=\"jobs\"/> It is in this light that some of the other early French contemporary greats, such as Martin, Graton, Uderzo and his writing partner Goscinny opted to start out their careers for Belgian comic publications, neither wanting to submit themselves to the scrutiny of the Commission de Surveillance directly, nor wanting to work for either the Catholic or communist magazines for personal reasons.\n\nThe situation in Belgium, even though the Catholics &ndash; who, contrary to their French counterparts, had not to contend with the negligible influence of the communists &ndash; were the dominant factor in politics in the country as well at the time, was nowhere near as restrictive as it was in France. There was actually no need perceived for regulating measures in Belgium as American productions, contrary to France, were already supplanted in popularity by the native comics (aided by the fact that Belgium had not seen the massive influx of American comics in the same measure France had, as Belgium had been predominantly liberated by British and Canadian forces, whose soldiers did not bring along their comics in the same volume the Americans did), whereas the majority of Belgian comics artists were either Catholics themselves (or at least sympathetic to the faith) such as Jij\u00e9 (whose early realistic works were deeply steeped in the faith), or had, like Herg\u00e9 did, strong ties with the as \"healthy\" considered [[scouting movement]] &ndash; a significant presence in Belgian society at the time, which also explains the contemporary popularity of Charlier's ''La patrouille des Castor'' series in Belgium, which was centered around a scouting chapter &ndash; and were thus, to use the modern expression, already \"[[political correct]]\" in the first place, that is from the Belgian perspective at least.<ref name=\"dand\"/> However, the incident Charlier had experienced with the Commission shook up the editors of ''Spirou'' and ''Tintin'', and as France was a too important market to lose, they too henceforth chose to err on the side of caution by screening the creations of their artists before magazine publication, essentially being forced by the French to exercise self-censorship.<ref>[[#References|de Weyer, 2015, p. 120]]</ref> Having already embarked on their divergent evolutionary path, Flemish comics escaped this kind of scrutiny, as they were at the time rarely, if at all, translated into French.<ref name=\"weyer89\"/>\n\n===1959<!--'Pilote' was established in 1959-->\u20131974: Scale tips to France and the market reaches adolescence===\nIn 1959, the influential French weekly ''[[Pilote]]'' launched, already from the start an attempt to be a more mature alternative to ''Spirou'' and ''Pilote'', aimed at a teenage audience, with the \"[[Asterix]]\" series as an almost instantaneous success.

Nonetheless, it were these publications and their artists which are generally credited with the revolutionizing and emancipation of the Franco-Belgian comic world. As indicated, most of these early adult magazines were established by former ''Pilote'' comic artists, who had left the magazine to break out on their own, after they had staged a revolt in the editorial offices of Dargaud, the publisher of ''Pilote'', during the 1968 upheaval, demanding and ultimately receiving more creative freedom from then editor-in-chief Ren\u00e9 Goscinny (see also: \"''[[Jean Giraud#Notes|Jean \"M\u0153bius\" Giraud on his part in the uprising at Pilote]]''\").<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.causeur.fr/pilote-goscinny-mai-68-31599.html | title= La BD fait sa r\u00e9volution / Comics make their revolution | work= Causeur.fr | first=Thomas|last=Morales|date= February 22, 2015 |accessdate= May 27, 2017|language=french | archivedate= May 9, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170509090656/http://www.causeur.fr/pilote-goscinny-mai-68-31599.html|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nEssentially, these new magazines along with other contemporaries of their kind, were the French counterparts of the slightly earlier American [[underground comix]], also conceived and popularized as a result of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], of which the French May 1968 events were only a part. But unlike their American counterparts, the French magazines were mainstream from the start when they eventually burst onto the scene in the early 1970s, as publications of this kind could not escape the scrutiny of the Commission de Surveillance prior to 1968, as editor [[Fran\u00e7ois Cavanna]] of the satirical magazine ''[[Hara-Kiri (magazine)|Hara-Kiri]]'' (launched in 1960) had experienced several times to his detriment, having had to reinvent his magazine on several occasions. Aside from the creative aspects, the 1960s brought in effect another kind of freedom for French comic artists as well - commercial and financial freedom. Until the revolt in the offices of ''Pilote'', artists worked in a studio system, namely a tenured exclusive working relationship at the magazine or publisher, with artists having little to no control over both commercial and creative aspects of their creations &ndash; except for a few artists who also held editorial offices at publishing houses such as Goscinny, Charlier and Greg, the former of which incidentally, having also been a major element for the revolt at ''Pilote''. That changed as well after 1968, when more and more artists decided to ply their trade as [[free-lancer]]s, the ''L'\u00c9cho des Savanes'' founders having been early pioneers in that respect, and has as of 2017 become the predominant artist-publisher relationship. And while contracts tend to be long-term for specific series at a particular publisher, it no longer prevents artists, like the below-mentioned [[Fran\u00e7ois Bourgeon]] and Hermann Huppen to create other comics for other publishers, sometimes even suspending a series for the one in favor of a series for the other.\n\nThe advent of the new adult magazines had a profound effect on France's hitherto most influential comic magazine ''Pilote''. Editor-in-chief Goscinny had at first refused to implement the changes demanded by its artists during the 1968 revolt in the editorial offices, but he now found himself suddenly confronted with the magazine hemorrhaging its most promising comic talents and diminishing sales. The magazine was eventually turned into a monthly magazine, its artists who had not yet left given more creative freedoms and the Belgian influence terminated definitively with the departure of co-editor Charlier in 1972 and the last Belgian artists Hubinon and Jij\u00e9 following suit a short time thereafter, transforming the magazine into a purely French one. However, while the magazine was now targeted at an older adolescent readership with stories featuring more mature themes, Goscinny stopped short of letting the magazine become a truly adult magazine. Yet, the magazine was unable to regain the dominant position it had held in the previous one-and-a-half decade, due to the flooding of the market with alternatives.<ref name=\"CharlierPilote\">[[#References|Ratier, 2013, pp. 225\u2013227]]</ref>\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1 = Paris - Salon du livre 2013 - Jacques Tardi - 004.jpg\n| width1 = 143\n| caption1 =\n| image2 = Fran\u00e7ois Schuiten 01.jpg\n| width2 = 282\n| caption2=\n| footer = <div style=\"text-align: center;\">Frenchman [[Jacques Tardi]] (2013) on the left, and the Belgian [[Fran\u00e7ois Schuiten]] (2008) on the right: two of the most important contributors to ''[[\u00c0 Suivre]]''</div>\n}}\nLagging behind the French for the first time in regard to the more mature comics, the Belgians made good on their arrear when publisher Casterman launched the magazine ''([[\u00c0 Suivre]])'' (''Wordt Vervolgd'' for its Dutch-language counterpart, both of which translating into English as \"To Be Continued\") in October 1977.<ref>[http://www.bdoubliees.com/asuivre/index.html \"La m\u00e9moire de ''(\u00c0 Suivre)''\"], BDoubli\u00e9s.com {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Until then the old venerable publisher (est. in 1780 as a printing and publishing company) had somewhat limited itself as the album publisher of Herg\u00e9's ''Tintin'' since 1934, slightly expanded upon after the war with a couple of Herg\u00e9 inspired creations by closely affiliated artists such as Jacques Martin, [[Fran\u00e7ois Craenhals]] and the Danish [[C. & V.

French comic artists of note who were nurtured into greatness in the Gl\u00e9nat publications were among others [[Makyo (comics)|Mayko]] and {{ill|Patrick Cothias|fr}}, but most conspicuously Fran\u00e7ois Bourgeon and [[Andr\u00e9 Juillard]]. Exemplary of the different, older target audience Gl\u00e9nat was aiming at, became the two finite, historical series Bourgeon created; ''Les Passagers du vent'' (1979\u20132009, ''The Passengers of the Wind'', seven volumes, set in 18th-century seafaring and [[History of slavery|slave trading]] Europe, becoming one of the first comic series to deal realistically in considerable detail with the dark slavery chapter in human history) and ''Les Compagnons du cr\u00e9puscule'' (1983\u20131989, ''Companions of the Dusk'', three volumes, set in 13th-century Europe and published by Casterman incidentally). Both series made short work of any romantic notion about the two historic eras still lingering in anyone's subconscious because of imagery imbued upon them by 1940s\u20131960s Hollywood movie productions or Franco-Belgian ''bandes dessin\u00e9es'' as published in ''Coeurs Vaillants'', ''Tintin'' or ''Spirou'' in the same era for that matter. Renowned for his meticulous research into the subject matter of the comic series he was creating, not seldom taking as long as it took him to create the series in question, Bourgeon depicted an historical reality devoid of any so-called \"heroes\", only featuring common people who were as often victimized as they were heroic, living in a world which was brutally hard while living a live which was therefore all too often very short for the common man, being habitually subjugated to the will of the powerful without any recourse whatsoever to objective justice, especially the women. Bourgeon however, made his harsh message to his readership palatable by his relatively soft art style and his optimistic view regarding human resilience. No such respite was afforded the reader however with Hermann's 11th-century epos ''Les Tours de Bois-Maury'' (1984\u20131994, ''[[The Towers of Bois-Maury]]''), whose original ten-volume series was serialized in ''V\u00e9cu'' in the same era Bourgeon's ''Passagers'' was in ''Circus''; Not only did Hermann's stark and uncompromising art style served to reinforce the grim atmosphere of his medieval settings, any and all redeeming optimistic commentary on human nature was also lacking in his narrative, quite the contrary actually, making his [[Middle Ages]] truly the Dark Ages where the vast majority of humanity was living short, violent lives in abject squalor, with not a single so-called \"hero\" in sight anywhere in his series. To hammer home the point, both artists had their medieval [[knight]]s, around whom both narratives were centered &ndash; Bourgeon's knight seeking redemption, whereas Hermann's knight sought to reclaim his birthright &ndash; die violent deaths nowhere near the fulfillment of their respective quests, thereby reinforcing the futility of such endeavors. With such series driving home the point that real history is made by mere humans and not \"super-humans\", the Franco-Belgian historical comic had come a long way since their first romanticized and/or idealized appearances in the 1940s\u20131970s, particularly in ''Tintin'' and ''Pilote'' as portrayed by such artists as the {{ill|Fred Funcken|fr}} (''Le Chevalier blanc'', ''Harald le Viking''), William Vance (''Howard Flynn'', ''Rodric'', ''Ramiro''), Fran\u00e7ois Craenhals (''Chevalier Ardent'') or Victor Hubinon (''Barbe Rouge''), to name but a few.\n\n====The ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' becomes cultural heritage====\nIt was not just the comic scene these new publications and their artists changed, the perception of the medium in French society also changed radically in the 1970s\u20131980s, in stark contrast to the one it held in the 1940s\u20131950s. Recognizing that the medium advanced France's cultural status in the world, the cultural authorities of the nation started to aid the advancement of the medium as a bonafide art form, especially under the patronage of [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], who had formulated his long-term ''Quinze mesures nouvelles en faveur de la Bande dessin\u00e9e'' (''15 new measures in favor of the comic'') ministry policy plan in 1982,<ref>[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actual/misfred2.htm \"15 Mesures nouvelles en faveur de la Bande dessin\u00e9e\"], Culture.gouv.fr {{in lang|fr}}; Long-term comics policy plan page on the official Culture Ministry website</ref> which was updated and reaffirmed by a latter-day successor of Lang in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quinze mesures pour la BD.

[[Dupuy and Berberian]], [[Lewis Trondheim]], [[Joann Sfar]], [[Marjane Satrapi]], [[Christophe Blain]], [[St\u00e9phane Blanquet]], [[Edmond Baudoin]], [[David B]], [[Emmanuel Larcenet]] all started their careers with publications at these publishers and would later on gain fame with comics such as [[Donjon (bande dessin\u00e9e)|Donjon]] (Trondheim & Sfar), [[Isaac the Pirate]] (Blain), Professeur Bell (Sfar).\n\n==Formats<!--'Comic album', 'Comic albums', 'Comics album' and 'Comics albums' redirect here-->==\nBefore the [[World War II|Second World War]], comics were almost exclusively published as [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] size [[newspaper]]s. Since 1945, the \"'''comic album'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->\" (or \"'''comics album'''\", in French \"'''album BD'''\" or \"'''BD'''\" for short<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->)<ref>Ann  Miller and Bart Beaty (eds.), ''The French Comics Theory Reader'', Leuven University Press, 2014, pp. 66 and 70.</ref> format gained popularity, a book-like format about half the former size. The albums, usually colored all the way through, are almost always [[hardcover]] for the French editions and [[softcover]] for the Dutch editions &ndash; though the hardcover format has steadily gained ground from the late-1980s onward as customer option alongside the soft cover format, contrary to Francophone Europe where the hardcover format is the norm. When compared to [[American comic book]]s and [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]] (such as the later American graphic novel format), the European albums are rather large (roughly [[A4 paper size|A4]] standard). Comic albums started to receive their own individual [[ISBN]]s from the mid-1970s onward all over Europe (with some countries like Portugal and Italy lagging behind for a decade or so), solidifying their status as books.\n\nConceived as a format as currently understood in Belgium with the first ''Tintin'' albums in the early 1930s &ndash; incidentally the second reason for considering ''Tintin'' the starting point of the modern Franco-Belgian comic, besides the art style and format &ndash; albums were usually published as a collected book ''after'' a story or a convenient number of short stories had finished their run in serialized magazine (pre-)publication, usually with a one to two year lag. Since the inception of the format, it has been common for these albums to contain either 46 (for decades ''the'' standard) or, to a lesser degree, 62 pages (discounting the two disclaimer, and title pages) for print and binding technical reasons as printers traditionally printed eight double-sided pages on one sheet of print paper, though albums with a larger page count &ndash; provided the total page count is a multitude of eight &ndash; are not that uncommon, the graphic novel album publications of ''[[\u00c0 Suivre]]'' publisher [[Casterman]] in particular.\n\nIt is in this field that Jean-Michel Charlier again turned out to be a seminal influence for the cultural phenomenon ''bandes dessin\u00e9e''. As publishing co-editor of ''Pilote'', it was he who initiated a line of comic albums, for Dargaud, collecting the stories as serialized in the magazine until then, becoming in effect Dargaud's very first comic album releases. The first July 1961 title in the series, coined ''La Collection Pilote'',<ref>[https://www.bedetheque.com/search/albums?RechCollection=La+Collection+Pilote&RechEO=1 \"''La Collection Pilote''\"], Bedetheque.com {{in lang|fr}}</ref> was the first adventure of ''Asterix'' from Uderzo and Goscinny, a runaway success right from the bat, followed by sixteen further titles from the magazine, with the first ''Blueberry'' adventure, \"Fort Navajo\", becoming the last to be released in July 1965. After that, the collection was suspended and each comic hero(s) hitherto featured therein, spun off in album series of their own. In order to give these releases a more \"mature\" book-like image, the albums were from the very start executed as hard cover editions for France, while being executed in soft cover by licensee Le Lombard for Charlier's own native Belgium, somewhat reflecting the status comic albums still had in that country, as it had in other European countries. Charlier's initiative was not entirely devoid of a healthy dose of self-interest, as over half the releases in the collection were titles form comic series he had (co-)created. While Charlier did not conceive the format as such &ndash; since Casterman already released such albums since the early 1930s (''Tintin''), as did Dupuis sometime thereafter with some of its releases, but certainly not all as most of its albums like the ''Buck Danny'' series were released in softcover at the time &ndash; \"his\" albums were more than favorably received however, and the collection has attained a mythical status in the world of Franco-Belgian comics, especially in France where such releases had until then been rarities at best<ref>{{cite book |last=Charlier |first=Jean-Michel |authorlink=Jean-Michel Charlier |last2=Hubinon |first2=Victor |authorlink2=Victor Hubinon |last3=Ratier |first3=Gilles |authorlink3=:fr:Gilles ratier |last4=Gaumer |first4=Patrick |authorlink4=:fr:Patrick Gaumer |title=L'Int\u00e9grale Tanguy et Laverdure 2: ''L'escadrille des cigognes'' |date=January 2015 |publisher=[[Dargaud]] |location=[[Paris]] |pages=172 |isbn=9782205073119 | language=French |quote=Ratier/Gaumer editorial ''La collection Pilote'', pp. 6-8}}</ref> &ndash; excepting the \"recuil\" magazine series releases, album-like hard/softcover editions, chronologically collecting several magazine issues into one volume like ''Coeurs Vaillants'', ''Spirou'' etc. and for decades a staple in Francophone Europe (and after the war in Dutch-Europe as well).\n\nIt was only after the runaway success of the ''Collection'' that the hardcover became the norm for album releases in France. Even though the success of the collection prompted Le Lombard to speed up its hitherto lackluster album releases, they did so initially in the predominant soft cover format until the mid-1970s like Dupuis was already doing, while maintaining the softcover format as standard for the Dutch-language editions for decades thereafter, as did Dargaud. Being a relative newcomer in the field Dargaud entered into a joint venture for the album releases with Le Lombard for nearly two decades. This meant that Dargaud album titles were released by Lombard for French-speaking Belgium (initially as soft covers in the first decade) and with a couple of years lag, for Dutch-Belgium as well (for the Netherlands and likewise with a lag, Dargaud sought out cooperation with other, local publishers for their releases), whereas Lombard album titles were released in France by Dargaud, invariably as hardcovers for their own releases, but in softcover for the first five years or so for the Lombard releases before permanently switching to hardcover, even before Lombard did for its Belgian home market. By the late 1970s Dargaud had its own international distribution system in place, and the cooperation with Le Lombard was dissolved, that is until both were merged into a single publisher in 1992 &ndash; though maintaining their respective imprints &ndash; after they were absorbed in 1988 and 1986 respectively into the French holding company [[M\u00e9dia-Participations]]. Incidentally, Dupuis was in June 2004 bought by M\u00e9dia-Participations as well, though it has retained its separate status within the holding group because of its traditional focus on a somewhat younger readership than Dargaud/Le Lombard.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, many comics are published directly as albums and do not appear in the magazines at all, as many comic magazines have disappeared since then for socio-economic reasons, including greats like ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'', ''\u00c0 Suivre'', ''[[M\u00e9tal Hurlant]]'' and ''[[Pilote]]''. The album format has also been adopted for native comics in most other European countries (the United Kingdom having until recently been one of the most manifest exceptions), as well as being maintained in foreign translations, in the process becoming the preeminent publication format of comics on the European continent, including the former [[Eastern Bloc]] after the [[fall of the wall]] in 1989. As with the Dutch-language editions, the soft cover format was initially the predominant format in which the foreign editions were released, but like the Dutch editions, the hard cover format has steadily gained ground in the other European countries as well, with Spain and Portugal having been early adopters as several volumes from ''La Collection Pilote'' were already released as such in the second half of the 1960s by local Dargaud/Lombard affiliated publishers,<ref>[https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?uitgever=1336&sort=jaar \"Editorial Bruguera S.A.\"] and [https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?uitgever=1386&sort=jaar \"Editorial \u00cdbis\"] for Spain and Portugal respectively, stripINFO.be {{in lang|nl}}</ref> albeit as separate series contrary to the ''Collection'' source publication.\n\n===Int\u00e9grales===\nSince the mid-1980s, many of the popular, longer-lasting album series, and also several long out-of-print classic series, also get their own hardcover collected [[Omnibus edition|\"omnibus\"]] album editions, or ''int\u00e9grales'', with each int\u00e9grale book generally containing between two and four original albums, and from the mid-1990s onward increasingly including several ''in\u00e9dits'' habitually &ndash; material that hasn't been published in albums before, such as magazine covers not used for albums &ndash; as well, alongside detailed illustrated editorials providing background information on the series in question and its creator(s), predominantly written by native comics scholars of which {{ill|Jos\u00e9-Louis Bocquet|fr}}, {{ill|Patrick Gaumer|fr}} and {{ill|Gilles Ratier|fr}} are the most prolific ones (see ''[[#Conventions and journalistic professionalism|below]]''). A practical reason for publishers to proceed in this manner, is the more recent fact that these older series have to some extent ran their courses in decades-long reprint runs of the individual volumes, and that it has commercially become more expedient to re-issue sold out volumes in this format, instead of continuing to reprint the individual volumes, aside from tapping into a new replacement market by targeting the nostalgia of now grown-up and more affluent readers who want to upgrade their worn-out individual copies they had bought and read as youths. Initially only released in French and, to a lesser degree, Dutch,<ref>The early 1980s/1990s int\u00e9grales were primarily released in joint ventures with specialist [[direct market]]ing publishers [https://www.bedetheque.com/search/albums?RechCollection=Rombaldi&RechEO=1 \"Rombaldi\"] and [https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?uitgever=253&sort=jaar \"Lecturama\"] for French and Dutch respectively.</ref> these editions have after the late-1990s surged in popularity, becoming increasingly popular in other European countries as well in (hardcover) translation, where the ''int\u00e9grale'' format is in some cases also employed for native comics, particularly in Spain, The Netherlands and Germany, a few of them reciprocally translated into French. All of the great Franco-Belgian comic publishing houses, still in existence, are as of 2017 engaged in releasing ''int\u00e9grales'', either by themselves, or by licensing them out to local publishers for other European countries &ndash; or both, as is the case for Dutch language editions.<ref>Dutch publishers {{ill|Arboris|nl}}, Saga and {{ill|Sherpa (uitgeverij)|nl}} are releasing \"integralen\" of the big three Franco-Belgian publishers Dargaud, Lombard and Dupuis, who are concurrently engaged in releasing such Dutch-language editions of other series not licensed to the Dutch publishers. {{ill|Lecturama|nl}} outlived {{ill|Rombaldi|fr}} by nearly two decades as integrale publisher, though only for Disney and native comics, as well as the Flemish creations of [[Willy Vandersteen]], but went defunct in 2015 as well.</ref>\n\n==Styles==\nWhile more recent comics can no longer be easily categorized into one art style anymore (due to the increasing blurring of the boundaries between the styles in more recent comic creations &ndash; aside from the introduction of new and/or other art styles), and the old artists who pioneered the market are retiring, there were initially three basic, distinct styles within the field prior to the mid-1970s, featured in those comics with Belgian pedigree in particular.\n\nOne of the early greats, Belgian [[Jij\u00e9|Joseph \"Jij\u00e9\" Gilian]], was noted for creating comics in all three styles, the schematic style for his early work, \"comic-dynamic\" style for his later humoristic comics, as well as creating comics in the realistic style. The latter style he acquired during World War II when he had to complete realistic comics such as [[Fred Harman]]'s ''[[Red Ryder]]'' after the occupying Germans prohibited the import of these American comics. At first influenced by the style of such American artists like Harman, Jij\u00e9 developed a realistic style distinctively his own (and thus European), and which became a major source of inspiration for future French/Belgian talents aspiring a career in creating realistic comics, the first and foremost of them having been [[Jean Giraud]]. Another of these Jij\u00e9-inspired youngsters was [[Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]], who actually started out his famed science-fiction creation ''[[Val\u00e9rian and Laureline]]'' in the \"comic-dynamic\" style, but which quickly gravitated towards the realistic style, though traces of the former remain discernible in the depictions of his aliens, which therefore constituted an early example of the mixing of the three basic art styles. Another ambiguous, even earlier, example concerned the creations of [[Victor Hubinon]] (''[[Buck Danny]]'', ''[[Redbeard (comics)|Redbeard]]''), who created comics in his own distinct style that had the characteristics of both the realistic and schematic styles, but which can not be unambiguously be categorized as either, or at the most be categorized as an \"in between\" style.\n\n===Realistic style===\nThe realistic comics are often laboriously detailed. An effort is made to make the comics look as convincing, as natural as possible, while still being drawings. No speed lines or exaggerations are used. This effect is often reinforced by the coloring, which is less even, less primary than schematic or comic-dynamic comics.\nFamous examples are ''[[Jerry Spring]]'' by Jij\u00e9, ''[[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]'' by Giraud, and ''[[Thorgal]]'' by [[Grzegorz Rosi\u0144ski|Rosi\u0144ski]].\n\n===Comic-dynamic style===\nThis is the almost [[Carl Barks|Barksian]] line of Franquin and Uderzo. The humoristic comics in ''Pilote'' were almost exclusively comic-dynamic, and so were the ones in  ''Spirou'' and ''[[l'\u00c9cho des savanes]]''. These comics have very agitated drawings, often using lines of varying thickness to accent the drawings. The artists working in this style for Spirou, including [[Andr\u00e9 Franquin|Franquin]], [[Morris (comics)|Morris]], [[Jean Roba]] and [[Peyo]], are often grouped as the [[Marcinelle school]].\n\n===Schematic style (''ligne claire'' style)===\nThe major factor in schematic drawings is a reduction of reality to easy, clear lines. Typical is the lack of shadows, the geometrical features, and the realistic proportions. Another trait is the often \"slow\" drawings, with little to no speed-lines, and strokes that are almost completely even. It is also known as the Belgian clean line style or ''[[ligne claire]]''. ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' is not only a very good example of this, it is currently also considered as ''the'' original template for the style as used in modern European comics. Other works in this style are the early comics of Jij\u00e9, who not only worked in the style, but also expanded upon it by adding [[Art D\u00e9co]] elements resulting in what several scholars came to consider a separate spin-off style, coined the \"Atom style\".<ref>{{cite book |last=de Grand Ry |first=Michel |authorlink= |author2=Nizette, Andr\u00e9 |author3= Lechat, Jean-Louis  |title=Le livre d'or de la bande dessin\u00e9e 1925-1955|year=1986 |publisher=Centre de la bande dessin\u00e9e Belge |location=[[Brussels]] |language=french |pages=6\u20137 |chapter=Jij\u00e9}}</ref><ref name=Weyer132>[[#References|de Weyer, 2015, pp. 132\u2013134]]</ref> This Jij\u00e9 specific comics style enjoyed a revival in later works from French, Flemish and Dutch artists like [[Yves Chaland]], [[Ever Meulen]] and [[Joost Swarte]] respectively, the latter of whom incidentally, having actually coined the alternative \"''ligne clair''\" designation in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|title=Investigating the Clear Line Style|last=Pleban|first=Dafna|url=http://comicfoundry.com/?p=1526|work=ComicFoundry|date=7 November 2006|access-date=24 October 2019|archivedate=27 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305161452/http://comicfoundry.com/?p=1526|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEven though Jij\u00e9 has somewhat receded in oblivion outside his own native Belgium, he is held in high esteem by many of his peers, both those he tutored like Franquin and Moebius, and others, and his versatility was such that it solicited an accolade of high praise from fellow artist Tibet, author of ''[[Ric Hochet]]'' and ''[[Chick Bill]]'', who has stated that \"If Herg\u00e9 is considered as God the Father, then Jij\u00e9 undoubtedly is the Godfather\".<ref name=Weyer132/> After Jij\u00e9, it were predominantly French (Philippe Druillet, Jean Giraud as \"M\u0153bius\", Jacques Tardi, Annie Goetzinger, [[Fred (cartoonist)|Fred]]) and Italian ([[Guido Crepax]], Hugo Pratt, [[Lorenzo Mattotti]], [[Attilio Micheluzzi]]) comics artists who increasingly introduced alternative art styles &ndash; sometimes extensive innovations/modernizations/expansions of the three existing basic styles, sometimes entirely new &ndash; in the medium from the mid-1970s onward, either by creating them directly for native publications, or by becoming major influences through translations which in Francophone Europe was especially the case for the Italians.\n\n==Foreign comics==\nDespite the large number of local publications, the French and Belgian editors release numerous adaptations of comics from all over the world. In particular these include other European publications, from countries such as, most conspicuously, [[Italy]] with Guido Crepax, Hugo Pratt and [[Milo Manara]] among many others, and to a somewhat lesser degree [[Spain]], with [[Daniel Torres (comics)|Daniel Torres]], and [[Argentina]], with [[Alberto Breccia]], [[H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mu\u00f1oz]]. Some well-known German ([[Andreas (comics)|Andreas]], [[Matthias Schultheiss]]), Swiss ([[Derib]], {{illm|Cosey|fr}} and [[Zep]]) and Polish ([[Grzegorz Rosinski]]) authors work almost exclusively for the Franco-Belgian market and their publishers such as Gl\u00e9nat and, most conspicuously, Le Lombard. Likewise, the French naturalized Yugoslav [[Enki Bilal]] worked exclusively for French publishers Dargaud and subsequently Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9s, whereas Dutch graphic novelist [[Paul Teng]] has, after his career failed to take off in his native country, first worked for Casterman before switching to Le Lombard.\n\nClassic American and British comic books, those of the traditional [[superhero]] genres in particular, are not as well represented in the French and Belgian comics market, for the reasons as explored above, although the graphic novel work of [[Will Eisner]] and [[Art Spiegelman]] (first published in French in ''\u00c0 Suivre'') is respected to such a high extent that it has actually led to the adoption of the English expression in mainland Europe as well, particularly for such mature works as published by Casterman or Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9s.<ref name =\"grafnov\"/> Nonetheless, a few [[comic strip]]s like ''[[Peanuts]]'' and ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' have had considerable success in France and Belgium. Yet, it was in the field of the graphic novels that American and British creations ''did'' attract attention from the Franco-Belgian comic world, the early ones having been [[Richard Corben]] and [[Bernie Wrightson]], the former of which having started out in the American underground comix scene, where artists created comics with the express intent to distance themselves from the classic American comics as produced by the big studios. Both men were published in the ''M\u00e9tal Hurlant'' American spin-off ''Heavy Metal'' and reciprocally translated for the French mother magazine. As mentioned, ''Heavy Metal'' made a [[Jean Giraud#Influence and legacy|deep artistic impact]] on an entire young generation of English-speaking comic creators, such as [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Mike Mignola]], who started to create more modern, more mature comics henceforth. It were these comics that were given attention by publisher Gl\u00e9nat, when they established the subsidiary Comics USA in 1988. Actually starting out with (hardcover!) comic book sized publications in the classic superhero genre, but created by a young generation of artists, the classic American comic failed to make a convincing come-back and the subsidiary folded in 1991 after 48 issues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Super H\u00e9ros (Collection Comics USA)|url=https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-11251-BD-Super-Heros-Collection-Comics-USA.html|work=Bedetheque.com|language=fr}}</ref> Subsequently, Gl\u00e9nat focused solely on its concurrent {{ill|Gl\u00e9nat Comics|fr}} imprint which concentrated on album releases of modern American graphic novels from such publishers as [[Image Comics]], [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]], and [[Oni Press]], and as such still in existence as of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=glenatcomics.com|url=http://www.glenatcomics.com|language=fr}}; Official site</ref> Gl\u00e9nat was actually preceded in 1986 by [[Delcourt (publisher)|Delcourt]], a newcomer presently specialized in American/British graphic novels and Japanese [[manga]]. Of the post-classic superhero era, Mike Mignola has become one of the most in French translated American comic artists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Mignola|url=https://www.bedetheque.com/auteur-3977-BD-Mignola-Mike.html|work=Bedetheque.com|language=fr}}</ref> Recently, Eaglemoss Collections and [[DC Comics]] have embarked on yet another attempt to re-introduce Francophone readership to the classic American superhero genre with their [[DC Comics Graphic Novel Collection|DC Comics: Le Meilleur des Super-H\u00e9ros]] collection, launched in French in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|title=DC Comics - Le Meilleur des Super-H\u00e9ros|url=https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-48656-BD-DC-Comics-Le-Meilleur-des-Super-Heros.html|work=Bedetheque.com|language=fr}}</ref> following in the wake of publisher Hachette who launched their [[The Official Marvel Graphic Novel Collection|Marvel Comics: La collection]] the year previously in an attempt to capitalize on the break-out success of the 21st-century [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|Marvel Comics film adaptions]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Marvel Comics - La collection (Hachette)|url=https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-42152-BD-Marvel-Comics-La-collection-Hachette.html |work=Bedetheque.com|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nJapanese manga started to receive more attention from the early to mid-1990s onward. Recently, more manga has been translated and published, with a particular emphasis on independent authors like [[Jiro Taniguchi]]. Manga now represents more than one fourth of comics sales in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acbd.fr/bilan-2009.html |title=Bilan 2009 |date=December 2009 |publisher=ACBD |accessdate=6 January 2010 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114103127/http://www.acbd.fr/bilan-2009.html |archivedate=January 14, 2010 }}</ref> French comics that draw inspiration from Japanese manga are called ''[[manfra]]'' (or also ''franga'', ''manga fran\u00e7ais'' or ''global manga'').<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.manga-sanctuary.com/news/18959/mangacast-n-20-debat-manga-francais-qu-est-ce-que-c-est-quelle-place-sur-le-marche.html|title= Mangacast N\u00b020 \u2013 D\u00e9bat : Manga Fran\u00e7ais, qu'est-ce que c'est ?

Illustrative of the market share the manga has conquered is that Dargaud has in 1996 spun off their manga French-language publications into a specialized publisher of it own, [[Kana (publisher)|Kana]], currently co-existing alongside the already established specialist Delcourt, and since 2000 joined by specialists [[Pika \u00c9dition]], {{ill|Kurokawa (publisher)|lt=Kurokawa|fr|Kurokawa}}, [[Kaz\u00e9]] and [[Ki-oon]]. In 2014, Delcourt acquired the earliest know such specialist [[Tonkam]], which had already been established in 1993.\n\n==Conventions and journalistic professionalism==\nThere are many comics conventions in Belgium and France. The most famous, prestigious and largest one is the \"Festival international de la bande dessin\u00e9e d'Angoul\u00eame\" (English: \"[[Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival]]\"), an annual festival begun in 1974, in [[Angoul\u00eame]], [[France]], and the format has been adopted in other European countries as well, unsurprisingly perhaps considering the popularity the Franco-Belgian comics enjoy in these countries, though they are typically of a more modest size, the Italian \"[[Lucca Comics & Games]]\" festival (est. 1965) excepted &ndash; though, as the name already suggest, that festival extents beyond comics alone, whereas the Angoul\u00eame festival is comics specific. During his tenure as culture minister, Jack Lang was a frequent guest of honor of the festival as part of his endeavors to advance the cultural status of the ''bande dessin\u00e9e'', and personally awarded the festival's awards to comic artists, which included Jean Giraud in 1985 when he received the festival's [[Former prizes of the Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival#Grand Prix for the graphic arts|most prestigious award]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean Giraud: Bibliographie, Photo, Biographie|url=http://www.bdparadisio.com/scripts/detail.cfm?Id=296|work=BDparadiso.com|language=fr}}</ref> the year after Lang had announced the advent of the national comics museum on the previous edition of the festival.\n\nTypical for conventions are the expositions of original art, the signing sessions with authors, sale of small press and fanzines, an awards ceremony, and other comics related activities. Also, some artists from other counties travel to Angoul\u00eame and other festivals to show their work and meet their fans and editors. The Angoul\u00eame festival draws in over 200.000 visitors annually,<ref>{{cite news|last=Delcroix|first=Olivier|title=Angoul\u00eame : la BD en pleine forme|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/bd/2012/01/29/03014-20120129ARTFIG00159-angouleme-la-bd-en-pleine-forme.php|accessdate=30 January 2012|newspaper=[[Le Figaro]]|date=29 January 2012|language=fr}}</ref> including between 6,000 and 7,000<ref>{{cite web|title=Professionals|url=http://www.bdangoulemepro.com/page-professionnels,marche-des-droits-et-du-licensing,7.html|publisher=Festival International de la bande dessin\u00e9e d'Angoul\u00eame|accessdate=30 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128194207/http://www.bdangoulemepro.com/page-professionnels,marche-des-droits-et-du-licensing,7.html|archive-date=28 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> professionals and 800 journalists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Angoul\u00eame BD|url=http://bdangouleme.com/english/|accessdate=30 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118045840/http://bdangouleme.com/english/|archive-date=18 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Contrary to their US [[Comic book convention|Comic Con]] counterparts, where other pop-culture media manifestations are increasingly taking precedence, movie and television productions in particular, continental European comics conventions remain to this day largely and firmly grounded in its source medium, the printed comics. US-style comic conventions are becoming popular as well though, but are invariably organized separately from the traditional ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' festivals under the English denomination, and where the print materials are concerned focused on the US comic book, and Japanese manga publications.\n\nOne of the oldest Franco-Belgian comics conventions was the \"Convention de la B.D. de Paris\" (1969\u20132003), which was co-founded by the [[#Vocabulary|aforementioned]] Claude Moliterni. Though Moliterni was a ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' writer (usually for artist [[Robert Gigi]]), he became primarily renowned as a tireless champion for the medium, in the process becoming one of France's very first serious comics scholars by launching one of the very first professional and serious [[Trade journal|comics journals]] worldwide, ''{{ill|Ph\u00e9nix (p\u00e9riodique)|fr}}'' (1966\u20131977), and writing numerous articles, reference books and, later on, (co-)launching specialized websites as well, on the subject matter. In doing so Moliterni became the European counterpart of equally renowned American &ndash; but French-born &ndash; comics scholar [[Maurice Horn]], a contemporary with whom Moliterni had actually cooperated in the early years of their careers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Munson|first=Kim|title=How the French Kickstarted the Acceptance of Comics as Art in the US: the Books and Exhibitions of Maurice Horn|date=Fall-Winter 2016|url=https://www.academia.edu/26994403/How_the_French_Kickstarted_the_Acceptance_of_Comics_as_an_Art_Form_in_the_US_the_Books_and_Exhibitions_of_Maurice_Horn|magazine=[[International Journal of Comic Art]] vol. 18, #2}}</ref> Aside from this, Moliterni also became a prolific founder of comics conventions. The very first one he co-founded was actually the Lucca one, experience gained on that experience put to good use for the Parisian one. Moliterni went on to co-found seven more conventions and permanent exhibitions in France and Italy, including Angoul\u00eame for which he is most renowned. His efforts for the medium gained Moliterni no less than three French civilian knighthoods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pasamonik|first=Didier|title=Disparition de Claude Moliterni, fondateur du Festival d\u2019Angoul\u00eame|url=http://www.actuabd.com/Disparition-de-Claude-Moliterni-fondateur-du-Festival-d-Angouleme|work=ActuaBD|date=21 January 2009|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nThe trailblazing journalistic &ndash; and subsequent scholastic &ndash; approach pioneered by Moliterni, which greatly aided in the acceptance of the medium as a mature part of Francophone culture, served as an inspiration for his successors, such as {{ill|Henri Filippini|fr}}, [[Thierry Groensteen]], {{ill|Stan Barets|fr}}, [[Numa Sadoul]], as well as the already mentioned Bocque, Gaumer and Ratier, who have followed in his footsteps. With Gaumer incidentally, Moliterni revisited his 1964-1967 ''Spirou'' article series he had co-edited with Morris, which resulted in the edited and greatly enhanced reference work ''Dictionnaire mondial de la bande dessin\u00e9e'' ({{ISBN|2035235103}}), published in 1994 by [[\u00c9ditions Larousse]] (a renowned French encyclopedia publisher), and a work very similar to Horn's 1976 ''The World Encyclopedia of Comics'' ({{ISBN|0877540306}}) which in turn greatly resembled the older ''Spirou'' article series.\n\nLikewise, his ''Ph\u00e9nix'' trade journal has seen a plethora of successors following suit all over western Europe as well. Actually, the second oldest known professional European comics trade journal was the Dutch ''{{ill|Stripschrift|nl}}'', launched in 1968 and coinciding with the definitive breakthrough of the ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' in the Netherlands, before a second Francophone comics journal (''{{ill|Les Cahiers de la bande dessin\u00e9e|fr}}'', launched in 1969 as ''Schtroumpf'' by {{ill|Jacques Gl\u00e9nat|fr}} and in effect the founding block of his namesake publishing house) had even entered the fray. During its first couple of years of publication, ''Stripschrift'' was in effect very reliant on ''Ph\u00e9nix'' for content, before it managed to shake off its French roots and stand on its own, and is, contrary to its French progenitor, still being published as of 2020 and thus the oldest known professional comics journal still in existence worldwide.\n\n==Impact and popularity==\nFranco-Belgian comics have been translated in most European languages, with some of them enjoying a worldwide success. Some magazines, aside from the Dutch-language editions, have been translated in Greek, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish, while in other cases foreign magazines were filled with the best of the Franco-Belgian comics. In France and Belgium, most magazines have since then disappeared or have a largely reduced circulation for socio-economic reasons (but mostly because modern readership no longer possesses the patience to read their comics in weekly or monthly installments, instead preferring to have a story presented to them wholesale in album format), but the number of published and sold albums stays relatively high &ndash; the majority of new titles being currently directly published as albums without prior magazine serialization &ndash; with the biggest successes still on the juvenile and adolescent markets. This state of affairs has been mirrored in the other European countries as well. As a format, the Franco-Belgian comic has been near-universally adopted by native comic artists all over Europe, especially in the neighboring countries of Belgium and France (and including Italy, despite that country having had a rich and thriving comics culture of its own), solidifying the position of the Franco-Belgian comic as the preeminent force on the [[European comics]] scene, Great Britain excepted.\n\nThe greatest and most enduring success however was mainly for some series started in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s (including ''[[Lucky Luke]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (comics)|The Smurfs]]'', and ''[[Asterix]]''), and the even older ''[[Adventures of Tintin]]'', while many more recent series have not made a significant commercial impact outside mainland Europe and those overseas territories historically beholden to France, despite the critical acclaim for authors like [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]]. One out-of-the-ordinary overseas exception where Franco-Belgian comics are as of 2017 still doing well turned out to be the Indian subcontinent where translations in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] (spoken in the south-eastern part of India, [[Tamil Nadu]], and on the island state of [[Sri Lanka]]) published by Prakash Publishers under their own \"[[Lion comics|Lion/Muthu Comics]]\" imprints, have proven to be very popular, though their appeal remain somewhat limited to the classic series for an adolescent readership as conceived in the 1960s\u20131980s, and that more recent, more mature series have yet to make an impression in those territories.\n\n==Notable comics==\nWhile hundreds of comic series have been produced in the Franco-Belgian group, some are more notable than others. Most of those listed are aimed at the juvenile or adolescent markets:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[XIII (comics)|XIII]]'' by [[William Vance]] and [[Jean Van Hamme]]\n* ''[[Les Aventures extraordinaires d'Ad\u00e8le Blanc-Sec|Ad\u00e8le Blanc-Sec]]'' by [[Jacques Tardi]]\n* ''[[Alix]]'' by [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]]\n* ''[[Asterix]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo]] and others\n* ''[[Barbe Rouge]]'' by [[Jean-Michel Charlier]], [[Victor Hubinon]] and others\n* ''[[B\u00e9cassine]]'' by [[Jacqueline Rivi\u00e8re]] and [[Joseph Pinchon]] and others\n* ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]'' by [[Edgar Pierre Jacobs|E.P.

These countries have a long tradition in comics separate from English-language comics.  Belgium is a bilingual country, and comics originally in the [[Dutch language]] ({{lang|nl|stripverhalen}}, literally \"strip stories\", or simply \"strips\") are part of ''bandes dessin\u00e9es'' culturally; these BDs are translated to French and concurrently sold to the French-reading audience.{{Citation Needed}}\n\nAmong the most popular ''bandes dessin\u00e9es'' that have achieved international fame are, among humorous BDs, ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' ([[Herg\u00e9]]), ''[[Gaston Lagaffe]]'' ([[Franquin]]), ''[[Asterix]]'' ([[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny|Goscinny]] & [[Albert Uderzo|Uderzo]]), ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' ([[Morris (cartoonist)|Morris]] & [[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny|Goscinny]]), and ''[[The Smurfs]]'' ([[Peyo]]).

Jud, Lucerne|website=official-swiss-national-languages.all-about-switzerland.info|access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref> The shared language creates an artistic and commercial market where national identity is often blurred, and one of the main rationales for the conception of the \"Franco-Belgian comics\" expression itself. The potential appeal of the French-language comics extends beyond Francophone Europe, as France in particular has strong historical and cultural ties with several Francophone overseas territories, some of which, like [[French Polynesia]] or [[French Guiana]], still being [[Overseas France]]. Of these territories it is [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], where Franco-Belgian comics are doing best, due &ndash; aside from the obvious fact that it has the largest comic reading Francophone population outside Europe &ndash; to that province's close historical and cultural ties with the motherland and where European comic publishers like [[Le Lombard]] and [[Dargaud]] maintain a strong presence, in the process heavily influencing its own native [[Quebec comics]] scene, particularly from 1960 onwards. This is in stark contrast to the English-speaking part of the country, which is culturally [[American comic book|US comics]] oriented.\n\nWhile [[Flemish people|Flemish]] Belgian comic books (originally written in Dutch) are influenced by Francophone comics, especially in the early years, they evolved into a distinctly different style, both in art and in spirit, which is why they are nowadays sometimes (sub-)categorized as [[Belgian comics|Flemish comics]], as their evolution started to take a different path from the late-1940s onward, due to cultural differences stemming from the increasing cultural self-awareness of the Flemish people. And while French-language publications are habitually translated into Dutch/Flemish, Dutch/Flemish publications are less commonly translated into French, for cultural reasons. Likewise, despite the shared language, Flemish comics do not do that well in the Netherlands and vice versa, save for some notable exceptions, such as the [[Willy Vandersteen]] creation ''Suske en Wiske'' (''[[Spike and Suzy]]'') which is popular across the border. Concurrently, the socio-cultural [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] contained within many Dutch/Flemish comics also means that these comics have seen far less translations into other languages than their French-language counterparts have due to their more universal appeal, and the French language's cultural status..\n\nBelgium is officially a trilingual country as there is also a [[German language|German]]-speaking minority, though Belgian comic home market first print releases, be it in Dutch or in French, are rarely translated into that language with German-speaking Belgians having to wait for internationally released editions for reading in their native tongue, typically those from licensed publishers stemming from neighboring [[Germany]]. Though Dutch and German are Germanic-language cousins, the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]] lies within the territory of the [[Walloon Region]], so that French is the most utilized (second) language in that area and has caused the handful of comic artists originating from there, such as Hermann and [[Didier Com\u00e8s]], to create their comics in French. Born Dieter Hermann Com\u00e8s, Com\u00e8s actually \"Frenchified\" his given name to this end, whereas Hermann has dispensed with his (Germanic) family name \"Huppen\" for his comics credits, though he maintained the Germanic spelling for his first name. Due to its relative modesty, both in size and in scope, and despite the close historical and cultural ties, no German-Belgian artists are as of 2018 known to have created comics specifically for the [[German comics]] world, when discounting commercial translations of their original Francophone creations.\n\nSomething similar applies to France, where there exist [[Languages of France|several regional languages]], of which [[Breton language|Breton]] &ndash; represented by comics artist [[Claude Auclair]] &ndash; and [[Occitan language|Occitan]] are two of the more substantial ones. But while these languages are culturally recognized as regional languages, they are, contrary to Belgium in regard to German, not recognized as official national languages, with similar consequences as in Belgium for comics and their artists; native comics are rarely, if at all, released in these languages by the main comic publishers, whereas artists stemming from these regions, invariably create their comics in French &ndash; like their German-Belgian counterparts forced to do so in order to gain commercial access to the main market. On rare occasions though, small, independent local and regional publishers obtain licenses from the main comic publisher to release comic books, or rather comic albums (see: ''[[Franco-Belgian comics#Formats|below]]''), of the more popular comics in translation into the native tongue &ndash; albeit almost always long after the original French-language release of the album in question. One such known publisher is {{ill|Banno\u00f9-Heol|fr}} (est. 1999), operating out of [[Quimper]], [[Brittany]], who has released several into Breton translated comic albums.<ref>[http://www.b-heol.com/accueil Banno\u00f9-Heol], official site {{in lang|fr}}; The aim of the publisher, and others of its kind, is not primarily a commercial one, but rather a cultural one, intended as a means to keep Breton &ndash; like many other regional languages in danger of becoming extinct &ndash; a living and breathing language.</ref> For the very small [[Catalan language|Catalan]] speaking populace there actually is a round-about alternative though, as several Spanish comic publishers (including the most prominent ones, [[Norma Editorial]] and the Spanish subsidiary of [[Gl\u00e9nat Editions]]) regularly release bilingual editions of their comics for [[Catalonia|their Catalan population]], which include imported Franco-Belgian comics, and of which ''Asterix'' and '' The Adventures of Tintin'' are prime examples. The situation for France's slightly larger German-speaking minority &ndash; represented by comics artist [[Guy Sajer]] ''aka'' Guy Mouminoux &ndash; is identical to its more sizable counterpart in northern neighbor Belgium in regard to comics-related matters.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe term ''bandes dessin\u00e9es'' is derived from the original description of the art form as \"drawn strips\". It was first introduced in the 1930s, but only became popular in the 1960s, by which time the \"BD\" abbreviation was also in use for its book, or album, publications (see [[#Formats|below]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=La (presque) v\u00e9ritable histoire des mots \"bande dessin\u00e9e\"|url=http://www.comixtrip.fr/dossiers/la-presque-veritable-histoire-des-mots-bande-dessinee|work=Comixtrip.fr|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''bandes dessin\u00e9es'' contains no indication of subject matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply a humorous art form. Indeed, the distinction of comics as the \"ninth art\" is prevalent in Francophone scholarship on the form (''le neuvi\u00e8me art''), as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. The \"ninth art\" designation stems from a 1964 article by {{Interlanguage link multi|Claude Beylie|fr}} in the magazine ''Lettres et M\u00e9decins'',<ref>Claude Beylie, \u00ab La bande dessin\u00e9e est-elle un art ? \u00bb, ''Lettres et M\u00e9decins'', literary supplement ''La Vie m\u00e9dicale'', March 1964.</ref> and was subsequently popularized in an article series about the history of comics, which appeared in weekly installments in ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine from 1964 to 1967.

It was quite different from future versions of Tintin, the style being very na\u00efve and simple, even childish, compared to the later stories. The early ''Tintin'' stories often featured [[The Adventures of Tintin#Criticisms of the series|racist and political stereotypes]], which caused [[The Adventures of Tintin#Controversy|controversies]] after the war, and which Herg\u00e9 later regretted. At the time however, ''Tintin'' turned out to be so popular right from the start, that the magazine decided to release the stories in hardcover book format as well, directly after they had run their respective courses in the magazine, in the process introducing something new in the Belgian comic world, the speech balloon [[#Formats|comic album]]. The 1930 ''Tintin au pays des Soviets'' title is generally considered the very first of its kind &ndash; even though there are three similar ''Zig et Puce'' titles from French publisher [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]], known to predate the ''Tintin'' title by one to two years, but which failed to find an audience outside France however.<ref>[https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-1086-BD-Zig-et-Puce.html ''Zig et Puce'' (original)], Bedeteque.com {{in lang|fr}}</ref>  The magazine continued to do so for the subsequent three stories until 1934 when the magazine, as such not particularly well-suited as book publisher, turned album publication over to Belgian specialized book publisher [[Casterman]], who has been the ''Tintin'' album publisher ever since.\n\nThe criticisms regarding the early stories notwithstanding and even though the format still had a long way to go, ''Tintin'' is widely considered the starting point and [[archetype]] of the modern Franco-Belgian comic as currently understood, and as amply demonstrated in the vast majority of treatises and reference works written on the subject since the 1960s, and the first to find a readership outside its originating country. As such the ''Tintin'' series went on to become one of the greatest post-war successes of the Franco-Belgian comic world, having seen translations in dozens of languages, including English, as well as becoming one of the relatively few European comics to have seen a major, successful, Hollywood [[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|movie adaptation]] as late as 2011, nearly thirty years after its creator had died.\n\nA further step towards modern comic books happened in 1934 when Hungarian [[Paul Winkler (publisher)|Paul Winkler]], who had previously been distributing comics to the monthly magazines via his [[Opera Mundi]] bureau, made a deal with [[King Features Syndicate]] to create the ''[[Le Journal de Mickey|Journal de Mickey]]'', a weekly 8-page early \"comic-book\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://comicskingdom.com/phantom|title=Phantom Comic Strip for June 19, 2017|website=Comics Kingdom|language=en|access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,766075,00.html|title=The Press: EIGHTH WONDER SYNDICATED|date=1941-09-15|work=Time|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>  The success was immediate, and soon other publishers started publishing periodicals with American series, which enjoyed considerable popularity in both France and Belgium. This continued during the remainder of the decade, with hundreds of magazines publishing mostly imported material. The most important ones in France were ''Robinson'', ''Hurrah'', and the {{ill|Fleurus presse|fr}} (on behalf of the {{ill|Action catholique des enfants|fr}} ''aka'' C\u0153urs Vaillants et \u00c2mes Vaillantes de France) publications ''[[C\u0153urs Vaillants]]'' (\"Valiant Hearts\", 1929, for adolescent boys), ''{{ill|\u00c2mes vaillantes|fr}}'' (\"Valiant Souls\", 1937, for adolescent girls) and ''{{ill|Fripounet et Marisette|fr}}'' (1945, for pre-adolescents), while Belgian examples included ''Wrill'' and ''[[Bravo (comic book)|Bravo]]''.\n\n''Coeurs Vaillants'' started to publish ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in syndication from 1930 onward, constituting one of the earliest known French-Belgian comic world cross-fertilizations, only reinforced when Abbot Courtois, editor-in-chief of ''Coeurs Vaillants'', asked Herg\u00e9 to create a series about real children with a real family as opposed to ''Tintin''{{'}}s ambiguous age and family (and thus more in line with the Catholic norms and values on which the magazine was founded), which resulted in the 1936 comic ''[[The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko]]''. Incidentally, as Herg\u00e9 created his comics in the increasingly popular speech balloon format, it initially led to [[C\u0153urs Vaillants#History|a conflict with ''C\u0153urs Vaillants'']], which utilized the text comic format its editors considered more appropriate from an educational point-of-view. Herg\u00e9 won the argument, and speech balloon comics were henceforth featured ''alongside'' text comics in the magazine (and that of its spin-offs) until the mid-1960s, when speech balloon comics were all but abandoned by the magazine(s), the general trend notwithstanding.\n\nIn 1938, the Belgian ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' magazine was launched. Conceived in response to the immense popularity of ''Journal de Mickey'' and the success of ''Tintin'' in ''Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me'', the black and white/color hybrid magazine featured predominantly comics from an American origin at the time of its launch until the war years, but there were also native comics included. These concerned ''[[Spirou (comics)|Spirou]]'', created by the Frenchman [[Rob-Vel]] (and thus another early cross-fertilization example) and who served as the mascot and namesake for the new magazine,<ref name=\"velter\">{{cite web |url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/rob_vel.htm |title=Rob-Vel: Robert Velter (9 February 1909 - 27 April 1991, France) |work=Lambiek.net}}</ref> and ''[[Tif et Tondu]]'' created by Belgian artist [[Fernand Dineur]].<ref name=\"dineur\">{{cite web |url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/dineur_f.htm |title=Fernand Dineur (17 May 1904 - April 1956, Belgium) |work=Lambiek.net}}</ref> Both series would survive the war and achieve considerable popularity after the war, albeit under the aegis of other artists (see below).

Since the launch of ''Spirou'' however, Dupuis has increasingly focused on comic productions and is currently, as of 2017, a comics publisher exclusively and one of the two great Belgian Franco-Belgian comic publishing houses still in existence.\n\nAs post-war exports to France (like in the Netherlands, the magazine was not available in France until 1945-46), ''Spirou'' &ndash; featuring the (early) creations of Belgian greats like [[Morris (comics)|Morris]], [[Franquin]] and [[Jij\u00e9]] &ndash; became a significant inspiration for future French ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' greats such as [[Jean Giraud|Jean \"M\u0153bius\" Giraud]] and [[Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]], eventually setting them off on their comic careers, but who were schoolboys at the time they became acquainted with the magazine.<ref>{{ill|Claude Moliterni|fr}}. \"Interview met Giraud, tekenaar van Blueberry\", ''Stripschrift'', [[Zeist]]:Vonk, issue 39/40, March/April 1972, pp. 12-17, 39 {{in lang|nl}}; translated from the French original, published in ''Ph\u00e9nix'', Paris:SRP \u00c9diteur, issue 14, 1970/Q4.</ref>\n\n===1940\u20131944: War and occupation===\nWhen Germany invaded France and Belgium, it became close to impossible to import [[American comic book|American comics]].

In 1946, Herg\u00e9 also founded the weekly ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine, which quickly gained enormous popularity, like the weekly ''Spirou'' appearing in a Dutch version under the name ''Kuifje'' for the Flemish and Dutch markets.<ref>Very first Dutch price indication already on the cover of [https://www.stripinfo.be/reeks/strip/24809_Kuifje__Weekblad_1946_Jgn_1_9_Nummer_9 ''Kuifje'', issue 9, 21 November 1946].</ref> Notable Belgian comic artists who at a later point in time achieved fame while working for ''Tintin'' magazine included among others [[William Vance]], the aforementioned Greg, [[Tibet (comics)|Tibet]] and [[Hermann Huppen]].\n\n''Tintin'' magazine publisher Les \u00c9ditions du Lombard (as of 1989 simply: [[Le Lombard]]) was especially founded by [[Raymond Leblanc]] for the magazine's launch in conjuncture with Herg\u00e9 as the latter could not find a publisher due to the fact that he was at that time still under investigation for alleged collaboration. Remarkably, album publications of the creations from the early group of artists centered around Herg\u00e9 was, then and now, outsourced to longstanding ''Tintin'' book publisher Casterman, while Lombard itself only started album publications for those artist who joined the magazine at a later point in time. Nonetheless, with Lombard Francophone Europe had received its first specialized comics publisher actually conceived as such. Le Lombard went on to become one of the three great Belgian publishing houses to produce comics in French (and in Dutch as well for that matter due to the bi-lingual nature of the country), alongside Dupuis and Casterman, and like them as of 2017 still in existence.\n\nMany other magazines did not survive the war: ''Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me'' had disappeared, ''Le Journal de Mickey'' only returned in 1952. In the second half of the 1940s many new magazines appeared, although in most cases they only survived for a few weeks or months. The situation stabilized around 1950 with ''Spirou'' and the new ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine (with the team focused around Herg\u00e9) as the most influential and successful magazines for the next decade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/how-tintin-creator-herg%C3%A9-reflected-the-ups-and-downs-of-the-20th-century/a-35900861|title=How Tintin creator Herg\u00e9 reflected the ups and downs of the 20th century |date=2016-09-27|work=Deutsche Welle|language=en|access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref>\n\nYet, 1944 (both [[Liberation of France|France]] and [[Liberation of Belgium|Belgium]] were liberated before war's end) had already seen the start of the industry career of the French-Belgian [[Jean-Michel Charlier]], in the process becoming one of its most towering figures. That year and a lawyer by trade, Charlier joined the newly formed comic syndication agency {{ill|World Press|fr}} of [[Georges Troisfontaines]], Belgium's answer to King Features Syndicate. Originally hired as an editorial draughtsman, Troisfontaines recognized Charlier's talent for writing and persuaded him to switch from drawing to scripting comics, something Charlier did with great success for the remainder of his life, creating close to three dozen series, several of them becoming classics of the Franco-Belgian ''bande dessin\u00e9e''.<ref>[[#References|Ratier, 2013, pp. 312\u2013315]]</ref> ''Spirou'' magazine became the agency's first and foremost client, and the first post-war decade saw the infusion into the magazine with many new series from young, predominantly Belgian talents like [[Eddy Paape]], [[Victor Hubinon]], [[Mitacq]], [[Albert Weinberg]], instituting an era in which Jij\u00e9's career truly took off with his best-known creation, the [[Western (genre)|Western]] comic series ''[[Jerry Spring]]'', that started its run in ''Spirou'' in March 1954. Jij\u00e9 incidentally, had magazine tenure, but closely cooperated with the World Press artists before embarking on his own creation. Successful series Charlier himself created in this period were the educational short series ''[[L'oncle Paul|Les Belles Histoires de l'oncle Paul]]'' (serving as proving ground in order to develop the talents and skills of young aspiring artists like Belgians Mitacq, {{ill|Arthur Piroton|fr}}, Hermann, [[Dino Attanasio]] and the Frenchman [[Jean Graton]] among others, several of whom switching over to industry competitor Lombard at a later point in their careers, most notably Hermann), ''[[Buck Danny]]'' (with Hubinon), ''[[La Patrouille des Castors]]'' (with Mitacq after his apprenticeship on ''L'oncle Paul'') and ''Jean Valhardi'' (with Paape and Jij\u00e9). Aside from being a very prolific comic script writer, becoming his  trademark henceforth, Charlier also became an editorial driving force and spokesperson for the agency, because of his background in law and his assertive personality. As such, he was responsible for introducing the two Frenchmen [[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] (who also starting out ''his'' comics career at the agency) and former ''Bravo'' artist [[Albert Uderzo]] to each other in 1951 at the in that year opened Paris, France, office of World Press, in the process creating one of Franco-Belgium's most successful ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' partnerships.<ref>[[#References|Ratier, 2013, Chapters 2\u20133, pp. 25\u2013140]]</ref> One of the first comics both men created together in the employ of the agency was the in colonial French-Canada era set Western series ''[[Oumpah-pah]]'', which was already conceived as loose gags in 1951, but failed to find a magazine publisher. Reworked into complete stories, the comic became successful in ''Tintin'' magazine in the period 1958\u20131962 (and thus, alongside Martin's ''[[The Adventures of Alix]]'', one of the first purely French comics to appear in the Belgian magazine), effectively becoming the \"spiritual father\" of their later ''Asterix'' creation.\n\n[[File:Morris - Maurice De Bevere.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Morris (cartoonist)|Maurice De Bevere]], also known as \"Morris\"]]\nBut it were not just the artists contracted by World Press who infused ''Spirou'' with its new elan, Dupuis itself had contracted a group of artists who were as much responsible for its success and then some as it was this group that defined the rejuvenated magazine in the post-war era. Upon war's end three artists from the defunct animation studio CBA were hired by Dupuis as staff artists for ''Spirou'', Eddy Paape (before he switched over to World Press), Andr\u00e9 Franquin and Maurice \"Morris\" De Bevere, and it was Morris who created in 1946 the second one of the great Franco-Belgian comic classics, ''Lucky Luke'', which made it first appearance in the ''Almanach'' appendix issue of 7 December 1946. Franquin was passed the comic ''Spirou et Fantasio'' by his mentor Jij\u00e9, who himself had taken over the series from original creator Rob-Vel in the war years, and it was Franquin who provided the series with its popularity, before he embarked for the magazine on his most popular creation ''[[Gaston (comics)|Gaston]]'' in 1957. With the addition of artist [[Will (comics)|Willy \"Will\" Maltaite]], who took over the series ''Tif et Tondu'' from original creator Fernand Dineur, the group that became known as \"''La bande des quatre''\" (Gang of 4), consisting of Jij\u00e9, Franquin, Morris and Will, was complete and constituted the foundation of what was coined the \"Marcinelle school\"-style.<ref>[[#References|de Weyer, 2015, pp. 143\u2013144]]</ref> However, such was the success of these artists, that the work of pre-war artists Rob-Vel and Dineur, was eclipsed by that of the younger generation, causing them to slide into oblivion.<ref name=\"velter\"/><ref name=\"dineur\"/> In 1952, another future great working in the Marcinelle school tradition was added to ''Spirou'', artist Pierre \"Peyo\" Culliford upon introduction by Franquin. Peyo was actually a former colleague of Franquin at CBA, but was at the time of the demise of the animation studio not considered by Dupuis because of his young age. For ''Spirou'' Peyo continued with the series ''[[Johan and Peewit|Johan et Pirlouit]]'', which he had already started in 1947 for the Belgian newspapers ''[[La Derni\u00e8re Heure]]'' and ''[[Le Soir]]''. It was this series that in 1957 spawned another of the great Franco-Belgian comic classics, ''Les Schtroumpfs'' (''[[The Smurfs]]''). With both magazines firmly in place, it was the success of ''Spirou'' and ''Tintin'' that initiated what many fans ''and'' scholars consider the golden age of the (Franco-)Belgian comic.<ref name=\"jobs\"/><ref name=\"dand\">{{Cite web|url=https://theses.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05142008-162029/unrestricted/thesis_final_060308.pdf|title=Producing Popularity: The Success in France of the Comics Series \"Ast\u00e9rix le Gaulois\"|last=Dandridge|first=Eliza Bourque|date=April 30, 2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As a result, the American comics didn't come back in as great a volume as before in both Belgium and France after the war, but in the case of France not for want of popularity, quite the contrary actually.\n\n====The ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' under siege in post-war France====\nIn France, a 1949 law about publications intended for the youth market was partly written by the [[French Communist Party]], a major political force in France directly after the war (because of their highly successful and effective [[French Resistance|resistance in the war years]]), to actually exclude most of the American publications.<ref name=\"dand\"/> The law, called \"{{ill|Loi du 16 juillet 1949 sur les publications destin\u00e9es \u00e0 la jeunesse|fr}}\" (\"Law of July 16th 1949 on Publications Aimed at the Youth\") and passed in response to the post-liberation influx of American comics, was invoked as late as 1969 to prohibit the comic magazine ''{{ill|Fantask|fr}}'' \u2014which featured translated versions of [[Marvel Comics]] stories \u2014 after seven issues. The formal and official justification for the law was the legislative desire to protect the youth of France from the perfidious and corruptive influence perceived to permeate foreign comics, especially in regard to violence and sexuality, the American ones in particular (even though they were not mentioned by name in the law), and in this the French law actually foreshadowed the 1954 publication of the comic condemning treatise ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' by [[Fredric Wertham]] in the United States itself. But there was an equally important, but unofficial, reason for the law as well; American comics were doing so well in post-liberation France, that native comic magazines, particularly the Catholic ones, became threatened in their very existence, and the law therefore became concurrently a veiled [[Protectionism|market protection mechanism]]. An added sense of urgency was, besides the huge popularity the American magazines enjoyed among France's youth, that the native publications had at that time a distinct disadvantage over their American counterparts as the country still experienced a serious post-war paper shortage (reflected as such in the poor paper quality, relatively low page count ''and'' lower circulation numbers of the native magazines of that era), something the higher quality American ones did not suffer from, they receiving preferential treatment under the [[Marshall Plan]]. The very first targeted American comic for example, ''[[Tarzan in comics|Tarzan]]'', enjoyed a weekly circulation of 300,00 copies, twice the one ''Coeurs Vaillants'' had and dwarfing the 76,000 copy circulation of ''Tintin'', and it was but one of the many American comics published in France in the immediate post-war era. It was the very reason for the unlikely French Catholic-Communist alliance in this regard, and a very effective one at that as American comics all but disappeared from the French comic scene for the time being, the [[Le Journal de Mickey]] excepted, which only reappeared three years later in former occupied western Europe.<ref name=\"jobs\"/>\n\nIt was not just American productions which were prohibited under the law, ({{ill|Commission de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le des publications destin\u00e9es \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 l'adolescence#Historique|fr}}) several Belgian French-language comic creations of the era also fell victim to the scrutiny of the oversight committee charged with upholding the law for varying reasons, as stipulated in its rather sweeping article 2 (presently article 3), which allowed for almost at will prohibition of comics for reasons that suited the policies of any French government in power at any given time. A famous example concerned the two [[Korean War]] volumes of the popular aviation comic series ''Buck Danny'', created by Belgians Charlier (who as spokesperson for World Press/''Spirou'' was actually summoned to appear in person for a board of inquiry at the French [[Minister of Information (France)|Ministry of Information]] to account for himself) and Hubinon, which were prohibited in 1954 as article 2 expressly forbade any mentioning of an actual, current armed conflict in a children's publication &ndash; but also because communist members of the commission had issues with the strong anticommunist sentiment expressed in the comic according to writer Charlier. Both volumes remained prohibited in France until 1969, though French fans on holiday in Belgium, Switzerland or Luxembourg could pick up the albums unhindered over there.<ref name=\"loi49\">{{cite book |last=Charlier |first=Jean-Michel |authorlink=Jean-Michel Charlier  |last2=Hubinon |first2=Victor |authorlink2=Victor Hubinon |title=La guerre de Cor\u00e9e |date=October 1984 |publisher=[[Dupuis]]|location=[[Marcinelle]] |pages=160 |isbn=2800110627 | language=French |quote=''Avions sans pilotes'' editorial, p. 100}}</ref> The law also came in handy to somewhat regulate &ndash; though not prohibiting &ndash; the availability in France of Belgian magazines like ''Spirou'' (which actually came close to prohibition  however, as the Korean War stories were serialized in the magazine, but which was narrowly averted at the eleventh hour by Charlier) and ''Tintin'' in favor of the native Catholic magazines, after the conservatives had reasserted their political predominance in the country during the 1950s.<ref>[[#References|de Weyer, 2015, pp. 84\u201389]]</ref>\n\nRigorously enforced by the government oversight committee {{ill|Commission de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le des publications destin\u00e9es \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 l'adolescence|fr}} (Committee in Charge of Surveillance and Control over Publications Aimed at Children and Adolescents), particularly in the 1950s and the first half of the 1960s, the law turned out to be a stifling influence on the post-war development of the French comic world until the advent of ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine and more specifically the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 social upheaval]]. Legally, the Commission had no punitive powers, only advisory ones, but in practice Charlier begged to differ. The all powerful Commission, shielded by the Justice Ministry (which ''was'' the punitive authority, but who took any and all Commission recommendations at face value, no questions asked),<ref name=\"jobs\"/> convened on a weekly basis, sifting through publications and weeding out those they felt subject to prohibition under the law, every decision they took being final, under no obligation to ever provide any formal justification whatsoever and without any possibility for appeal, which amounted to ''de facto'' state [[censorship]] according to Charlier.<ref name=\"loi49\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| image1 = \n| width1 = 135\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Marcel Gotlib 2011 a.jpg\n| width2 = 160\n| caption2=\n| image3 = Mandryka IMG 2751.JPG\n| width3 = 143\n| caption3=\n| footer = Marcel Gotlib (2011) and Nikita Mandryka (2011) on the right, members of an early generation of French artists who created modern comics without Belgian tutelage\n}}\nYet, it were also the communists who provided the comic scene in France with a single bright-spot; Having its origins in the communist wartime underground resistance publications, the comic magazine ''[[Pif gadget|Vaillant]]'' (not to be confused with the two near-similarly named Fleurus publications) was launched in 1945 upon war's end. The [[secular]] magazine provided a platform for predominantly native comic talent born between the 1920s and the 1940s, not able or willing to work for the Catholic magazines, to showcase their work. French names of note who started out their career in the magazine were among others [[Nikita Mandryka]], [[Paul Gillon]], [[Jean-Claude Forest]] and [[Marcel Gotlib]],<ref>[https://www.lambiek.net/magazines/vaillant.htm \"Comics History: Vaillant/Pif (1945 - 1992, 2004 - 2009)\"], Lambiek.net</ref> and were less beholden to what was then still the [[Belgian comics|Belgian ''bande dessin\u00e9e'']] tradition, other native contemporaries were &ndash; in essence ranking among the first native French artists to provide the \"Franco\" element in what later would become the \"Franco-Belgian comics\" expression, with comic artist [[Marijac]] having been a trailblazer. Marijac actually started out for ''Coeurs Vaillants'' in the 1930s, but distanced himself from the magazine directly after the liberation, when he started the secular comics magazine ''{{ill|Coq hardi (p\u00e9riodique)|fr}}'' (1944\u20131963), France's first recognizable modern ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' magazine. Marijac himself became a prolific figure of note in the French comic scene of the 1950s as co-editor and contributor for a series of native comic magazines other than his own ''Coq Hardi'', and conceived in the era under the shadow of the all-present Catholic publications to fill the void left by the banned American comics such as ''Les Grandes S\u00e9ries Internationales'', ''Cricri Journal'', ''Mireille'', ''Ouest-Magazine'', ''Nano et Nanette'', ''H\u00e9ros du Far West'', ''Frimousse'', ''Cocorico'' and ''Allez-France'', all of which filled with work from French artists, now forgotten save Marijac himself (who was honored for his efforts at the 1979 Angoul\u00eame comics festival with its most prestigious award), along with the magazines they created their work for.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/marijac.htm |title= Marijac: Jacques Dumas (7 November 1908 - 21 July 1994, France) |work=Lambiek.net}}</ref>\n\nIt has been observed that, unlike the Belgian publications, these mostly secular native magazines were largely left alone by the Commission de Surveillance,<ref name=\"weyer89\">[[#References|de Weyer, 2015, pp. 89\u201390]]</ref> save for one notable exception; Pierre Mouchot, creator and editor of American inspired comic magazines in the immediate post-war era, was on recommendation of the Commission persecuted for his likewise American (and Italian) inspired comic series ''Big Bill le Casseur'' and ''P\u2019tit Gars'', having to appear in court no less than eight times in the period 1950 - 1954, actually winning most of his cases in the lower courts. While both he and his creations are likewise forgotten, Mouchot became the only French comics artist to be legally persecuted, ''and'' ultimately convicted by the highest court of appeal (though only receiving symbolic punishment) under article 2 of the 1949 law for real. However, the conviction ''did'' serve as an effective deterrent for other native artists &ndash; and thus firmly establishing the Commission as a force to be reckoned with, even though they had a tough time becoming so as Mouchot kept winning his lower court cases &ndash; who continued to create their comics while erring on the side of caution for the next decade.<ref name=\"jobs\"/> It is in this light that some of the other early French contemporary greats, such as Martin, Graton, Uderzo and his writing partner Goscinny opted to start out their careers for Belgian comic publications, neither wanting to submit themselves to the scrutiny of the Commission de Surveillance directly, nor wanting to work for either the Catholic or communist magazines for personal reasons.\n\nThe situation in Belgium, even though the Catholics &ndash; who, contrary to their French counterparts, had not to contend with the negligible influence of the communists &ndash; were the dominant factor in politics in the country as well at the time, was nowhere near as restrictive as it was in France. There was actually no need perceived for regulating measures in Belgium as American productions, contrary to France, were already supplanted in popularity by the native comics (aided by the fact that Belgium had not seen the massive influx of American comics in the same measure France had, as Belgium had been predominantly liberated by British and Canadian forces, whose soldiers did not bring along their comics in the same volume the Americans did), whereas the majority of Belgian comics artists were either Catholics themselves (or at least sympathetic to the faith) such as Jij\u00e9 (whose early realistic works were deeply steeped in the faith), or had, like Herg\u00e9 did, strong ties with the as \"healthy\" considered [[scouting movement]] &ndash; a significant presence in Belgian society at the time, which also explains the contemporary popularity of Charlier's ''La patrouille des Castor'' series in Belgium, which was centered around a scouting chapter &ndash; and were thus, to use the modern expression, already \"[[political correct]]\" in the first place, that is from the Belgian perspective at least.<ref name=\"dand\"/> However, the incident Charlier had experienced with the Commission shook up the editors of ''Spirou'' and ''Tintin'', and as France was a too important market to lose, they too henceforth chose to err on the side of caution by screening the creations of their artists before magazine publication, essentially being forced by the French to exercise self-censorship.<ref>[[#References|de Weyer, 2015, p. 120]]</ref> Having already embarked on their divergent evolutionary path, Flemish comics escaped this kind of scrutiny, as they were at the time rarely, if at all, translated into French.<ref name=\"weyer89\"/>\n\n===1959<!--'Pilote' was established in 1959-->\u20131974: Scale tips to France and the market reaches adolescence===\nIn 1959, the influential French weekly ''[[Pilote]]'' launched, already from the start an attempt to be a more mature alternative to ''Spirou'' and ''Pilote'', aimed at a teenage audience, with the \"[[Asterix]]\" series as an almost instantaneous success.

Also, aimed at an adult audience, the French satire magazine ''[[Hara-Kiri (magazine)|Hara-Kiri]]'' was launched.\n\nIn the sixties, most of the French Catholic magazines, such as the Fleurus publications, waned in popularity, as they were \"re-christianized\" and went to a more traditional style with more text and fewer drawings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WYEfAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=style+with+more+text+and+fewer+drawings+catholic+magazine+french|title=The American Magazine|date=1890|publisher=Crowell-Collier Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref> This meant that in France, magazines like ''[[Pilote]]'' and ''Vaillant'' (relaunched as ''Pif gadget'' in 1969), and ''Spirou'' and ''Tintin'' for French-speaking Belgium, gained almost the entire market and became the obvious goal for new artists from their respective countries, who took up the styles prevalent in those magazines to break into the business.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TyptDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=valiant+pilote+dominated+french+market#v=onepage&q=valiant%20pilote%20dominated%20french%20market&f=false|title=Masters of Spanish Comic Book Art|last=Roach|first=David|publisher=[[Dynamite Entertainment]]|year=2017|isbn=978-1524101312|location=|pages=31}}</ref>\n\nWith a number of publishers in place, including [[Dargaud]] (''[[Pilote]]''), [[Le Lombard]] (''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'') and [[Dupuis]] (''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]''), three of the biggest influences for over 50 years, the market for domestic comics had reached (commercial) maturity.

Nonetheless, it were these publications and their artists which are generally credited with the revolutionizing and emancipation of the Franco-Belgian comic world. As indicated, most of these early adult magazines were established by former ''Pilote'' comic artists, who had left the magazine to break out on their own, after they had staged a revolt in the editorial offices of Dargaud, the publisher of ''Pilote'', during the 1968 upheaval, demanding and ultimately receiving more creative freedom from then editor-in-chief Ren\u00e9 Goscinny (see also: \"''[[Jean Giraud#Notes|Jean \"M\u0153bius\" Giraud on his part in the uprising at Pilote]]''\").<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.causeur.fr/pilote-goscinny-mai-68-31599.html | title= La BD fait sa r\u00e9volution / Comics make their revolution | work= Causeur.fr | first=Thomas|last=Morales|date= February 22, 2015 |accessdate= May 27, 2017|language=french | archivedate= May 9, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170509090656/http://www.causeur.fr/pilote-goscinny-mai-68-31599.html|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nEssentially, these new magazines along with other contemporaries of their kind, were the French counterparts of the slightly earlier American [[underground comix]], also conceived and popularized as a result of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], of which the French May 1968 events were only a part. But unlike their American counterparts, the French magazines were mainstream from the start when they eventually burst onto the scene in the early 1970s, as publications of this kind could not escape the scrutiny of the Commission de Surveillance prior to 1968, as editor [[Fran\u00e7ois Cavanna]] of the satirical magazine ''[[Hara-Kiri (magazine)|Hara-Kiri]]'' (launched in 1960) had experienced several times to his detriment, having had to reinvent his magazine on several occasions. Aside from the creative aspects, the 1960s brought in effect another kind of freedom for French comic artists as well - commercial and financial freedom. Until the revolt in the offices of ''Pilote'', artists worked in a studio system, namely a tenured exclusive working relationship at the magazine or publisher, with artists having little to no control over both commercial and creative aspects of their creations &ndash; except for a few artists who also held editorial offices at publishing houses such as Goscinny, Charlier and Greg, the former of which incidentally, having also been a major element for the revolt at ''Pilote''. That changed as well after 1968, when more and more artists decided to ply their trade as [[free-lancer]]s, the ''L'\u00c9cho des Savanes'' founders having been early pioneers in that respect, and has as of 2017 become the predominant artist-publisher relationship. And while contracts tend to be long-term for specific series at a particular publisher, it no longer prevents artists, like the below-mentioned [[Fran\u00e7ois Bourgeon]] and Hermann Huppen to create other comics for other publishers, sometimes even suspending a series for the one in favor of a series for the other.\n\nThe advent of the new adult magazines had a profound effect on France's hitherto most influential comic magazine ''Pilote''. Editor-in-chief Goscinny had at first refused to implement the changes demanded by its artists during the 1968 revolt in the editorial offices, but he now found himself suddenly confronted with the magazine hemorrhaging its most promising comic talents and diminishing sales. The magazine was eventually turned into a monthly magazine, its artists who had not yet left given more creative freedoms and the Belgian influence terminated definitively with the departure of co-editor Charlier in 1972 and the last Belgian artists Hubinon and Jij\u00e9 following suit a short time thereafter, transforming the magazine into a purely French one. However, while the magazine was now targeted at an older adolescent readership with stories featuring more mature themes, Goscinny stopped short of letting the magazine become a truly adult magazine.

French comic artists of note who were nurtured into greatness in the Gl\u00e9nat publications were among others [[Makyo (comics)|Mayko]] and {{ill|Patrick Cothias|fr}}, but most conspicuously Fran\u00e7ois Bourgeon and [[Andr\u00e9 Juillard]]. Exemplary of the different, older target audience Gl\u00e9nat was aiming at, became the two finite, historical series Bourgeon created; ''Les Passagers du vent'' (1979\u20132009, ''The Passengers of the Wind'', seven volumes, set in 18th-century seafaring and [[History of slavery|slave trading]] Europe, becoming one of the first comic series to deal realistically in considerable detail with the dark slavery chapter in human history) and ''Les Compagnons du cr\u00e9puscule'' (1983\u20131989, ''Companions of the Dusk'', three volumes, set in 13th-century Europe and published by Casterman incidentally). Both series made short work of any romantic notion about the two historic eras still lingering in anyone's subconscious because of imagery imbued upon them by 1940s\u20131960s Hollywood movie productions or Franco-Belgian ''bandes dessin\u00e9es'' as published in ''Coeurs Vaillants'', ''Tintin'' or ''Spirou'' in the same era for that matter. Renowned for his meticulous research into the subject matter of the comic series he was creating, not seldom taking as long as it took him to create the series in question, Bourgeon depicted an historical reality devoid of any so-called \"heroes\", only featuring common people who were as often victimized as they were heroic, living in a world which was brutally hard while living a live which was therefore all too often very short for the common man, being habitually subjugated to the will of the powerful without any recourse whatsoever to objective justice, especially the women. Bourgeon however, made his harsh message to his readership palatable by his relatively soft art style and his optimistic view regarding human resilience. No such respite was afforded the reader however with Hermann's 11th-century epos ''Les Tours de Bois-Maury'' (1984\u20131994, ''[[The Towers of Bois-Maury]]''), whose original ten-volume series was serialized in ''V\u00e9cu'' in the same era Bourgeon's ''Passagers'' was in ''Circus''; Not only did Hermann's stark and uncompromising art style served to reinforce the grim atmosphere of his medieval settings, any and all redeeming optimistic commentary on human nature was also lacking in his narrative, quite the contrary actually, making his [[Middle Ages]] truly the Dark Ages where the vast majority of humanity was living short, violent lives in abject squalor, with not a single so-called \"hero\" in sight anywhere in his series. To hammer home the point, both artists had their medieval [[knight]]s, around whom both narratives were centered &ndash; Bourgeon's knight seeking redemption, whereas Hermann's knight sought to reclaim his birthright &ndash; die violent deaths nowhere near the fulfillment of their respective quests, thereby reinforcing the futility of such endeavors. With such series driving home the point that real history is made by mere humans and not \"super-humans\", the Franco-Belgian historical comic had come a long way since their first romanticized and/or idealized appearances in the 1940s\u20131970s, particularly in ''Tintin'' and ''Pilote'' as portrayed by such artists as the {{ill|Fred Funcken|fr}} (''Le Chevalier blanc'', ''Harald le Viking''), William Vance (''Howard Flynn'', ''Rodric'', ''Ramiro''), Fran\u00e7ois Craenhals (''Chevalier Ardent'') or Victor Hubinon (''Barbe Rouge''), to name but a few.\n\n====The ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' becomes cultural heritage====\nIt was not just the comic scene these new publications and their artists changed, the perception of the medium in French society also changed radically in the 1970s\u20131980s, in stark contrast to the one it held in the 1940s\u20131950s. Recognizing that the medium advanced France's cultural status in the world, the cultural authorities of the nation started to aid the advancement of the medium as a bonafide art form, especially under the patronage of [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], who had formulated his long-term ''Quinze mesures nouvelles en faveur de la Bande dessin\u00e9e'' (''15 new measures in favor of the comic'') ministry policy plan in 1982,<ref>[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actual/misfred2.htm \"15 Mesures nouvelles en faveur de la Bande dessin\u00e9e\"], Culture.gouv.fr {{in lang|fr}}; Long-term comics policy plan page on the official Culture Ministry website</ref> which was updated and reaffirmed by a latter-day successor of Lang in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quinze mesures pour la BD.

The albums, usually colored all the way through, are almost always [[hardcover]] for the French editions and [[softcover]] for the Dutch editions &ndash; though the hardcover format has steadily gained ground from the late-1980s onward as customer option alongside the soft cover format, contrary to Francophone Europe where the hardcover format is the norm. When compared to [[American comic book]]s and [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]] (such as the later American graphic novel format), the European albums are rather large (roughly [[A4 paper size|A4]] standard). Comic albums started to receive their own individual [[ISBN]]s from the mid-1970s onward all over Europe (with some countries like Portugal and Italy lagging behind for a decade or so), solidifying their status as books.\n\nConceived as a format as currently understood in Belgium with the first ''Tintin'' albums in the early 1930s &ndash; incidentally the second reason for considering ''Tintin'' the starting point of the modern Franco-Belgian comic, besides the art style and format &ndash; albums were usually published as a collected book ''after'' a story or a convenient number of short stories had finished their run in serialized magazine (pre-)publication, usually with a one to two year lag. Since the inception of the format, it has been common for these albums to contain either 46 (for decades ''the'' standard) or, to a lesser degree, 62 pages (discounting the two disclaimer, and title pages) for print and binding technical reasons as printers traditionally printed eight double-sided pages on one sheet of print paper, though albums with a larger page count &ndash; provided the total page count is a multitude of eight &ndash; are not that uncommon, the graphic novel album publications of ''[[\u00c0 Suivre]]'' publisher [[Casterman]] in particular.\n\nIt is in this field that Jean-Michel Charlier again turned out to be a seminal influence for the cultural phenomenon ''bandes dessin\u00e9e''. As publishing co-editor of ''Pilote'', it was he who initiated a line of comic albums, for Dargaud, collecting the stories as serialized in the magazine until then, becoming in effect Dargaud's very first comic album releases. The first July 1961 title in the series, coined ''La Collection Pilote'',<ref>[https://www.bedetheque.com/search/albums?RechCollection=La+Collection+Pilote&RechEO=1 \"''La Collection Pilote''\"], Bedetheque.com {{in lang|fr}}</ref> was the first adventure of ''Asterix'' from Uderzo and Goscinny, a runaway success right from the bat, followed by sixteen further titles from the magazine, with the first ''Blueberry'' adventure, \"Fort Navajo\", becoming the last to be released in July 1965. After that, the collection was suspended and each comic hero(s) hitherto featured therein, spun off in album series of their own. In order to give these releases a more \"mature\" book-like image, the albums were from the very start executed as hard cover editions for France, while being executed in soft cover by licensee Le Lombard for Charlier's own native Belgium, somewhat reflecting the status comic albums still had in that country, as it had in other European countries. Charlier's initiative was not entirely devoid of a healthy dose of self-interest, as over half the releases in the collection were titles form comic series he had (co-)created. While Charlier did not conceive the format as such &ndash; since Casterman already released such albums since the early 1930s (''Tintin''), as did Dupuis sometime thereafter with some of its releases, but certainly not all as most of its albums like the ''Buck Danny'' series were released in softcover at the time &ndash; \"his\" albums were more than favorably received however, and the collection has attained a mythical status in the world of Franco-Belgian comics, especially in France where such releases had until then been rarities at best<ref>{{cite book |last=Charlier |first=Jean-Michel |authorlink=Jean-Michel Charlier |last2=Hubinon |first2=Victor |authorlink2=Victor Hubinon |last3=Ratier |first3=Gilles |authorlink3=:fr:Gilles ratier |last4=Gaumer |first4=Patrick |authorlink4=:fr:Patrick Gaumer |title=L'Int\u00e9grale Tanguy et Laverdure 2: ''L'escadrille des cigognes'' |date=January 2015 |publisher=[[Dargaud]] |location=[[Paris]] |pages=172 |isbn=9782205073119 | language=French |quote=Ratier/Gaumer editorial ''La collection Pilote'', pp. 6-8}}</ref> &ndash; excepting the \"recuil\" magazine series releases, album-like hard/softcover editions, chronologically collecting several magazine issues into one volume like ''Coeurs Vaillants'', ''Spirou'' etc. and for decades a staple in Francophone Europe (and after the war in Dutch-Europe as well).\n\nIt was only after the runaway success of the ''Collection'' that the hardcover became the norm for album releases in France. Even though the success of the collection prompted Le Lombard to speed up its hitherto lackluster album releases, they did so initially in the predominant soft cover format until the mid-1970s like Dupuis was already doing, while maintaining the softcover format as standard for the Dutch-language editions for decades thereafter, as did Dargaud. Being a relative newcomer in the field Dargaud entered into a joint venture for the album releases with Le Lombard for nearly two decades. This meant that Dargaud album titles were released by Lombard for French-speaking Belgium (initially as soft covers in the first decade) and with a couple of years lag, for Dutch-Belgium as well (for the Netherlands and likewise with a lag, Dargaud sought out cooperation with other, local publishers for their releases), whereas Lombard album titles were released in France by Dargaud, invariably as hardcovers for their own releases, but in softcover for the first five years or so for the Lombard releases before permanently switching to hardcover, even before Lombard did for its Belgian home market. By the late 1970s Dargaud had its own international distribution system in place, and the cooperation with Le Lombard was dissolved, that is until both were merged into a single publisher in 1992 &ndash; though maintaining their respective imprints &ndash; after they were absorbed in 1988 and 1986 respectively into the French holding company [[M\u00e9dia-Participations]]. Incidentally, Dupuis was in June 2004 bought by M\u00e9dia-Participations as well, though it has retained its separate status within the holding group because of its traditional focus on a somewhat younger readership than Dargaud/Le Lombard.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, many comics are published directly as albums and do not appear in the magazines at all, as many comic magazines have disappeared since then for socio-economic reasons, including greats like ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'', ''\u00c0 Suivre'', ''[[M\u00e9tal Hurlant]]'' and ''[[Pilote]]''. The album format has also been adopted for native comics in most other European countries (the United Kingdom having until recently been one of the most manifest exceptions), as well as being maintained in foreign translations, in the process becoming the preeminent publication format of comics on the European continent, including the former [[Eastern Bloc]] after the [[fall of the wall]] in 1989. As with the Dutch-language editions, the soft cover format was initially the predominant format in which the foreign editions were released, but like the Dutch editions, the hard cover format has steadily gained ground in the other European countries as well, with Spain and Portugal having been early adopters as several volumes from ''La Collection Pilote'' were already released as such in the second half of the 1960s by local Dargaud/Lombard affiliated publishers,<ref>[https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?uitgever=1336&sort=jaar \"Editorial Bruguera S.A.\"] and [https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?uitgever=1386&sort=jaar \"Editorial \u00cdbis\"] for Spain and Portugal respectively, stripINFO.be {{in lang|nl}}</ref> albeit as separate series contrary to the ''Collection'' source publication.\n\n===Int\u00e9grales===\nSince the mid-1980s, many of the popular, longer-lasting album series, and also several long out-of-print classic series, also get their own hardcover collected [[Omnibus edition|\"omnibus\"]] album editions, or ''int\u00e9grales'', with each int\u00e9grale book generally containing between two and four original albums, and from the mid-1990s onward increasingly including several ''in\u00e9dits'' habitually &ndash; material that hasn't been published in albums before, such as magazine covers not used for albums &ndash; as well, alongside detailed illustrated editorials providing background information on the series in question and its creator(s), predominantly written by native comics scholars of which {{ill|Jos\u00e9-Louis Bocquet|fr}}, {{ill|Patrick Gaumer|fr}} and {{ill|Gilles Ratier|fr}} are the most prolific ones (see ''[[#Conventions and journalistic professionalism|below]]''). A practical reason for publishers to proceed in this manner, is the more recent fact that these older series have to some extent ran their courses in decades-long reprint runs of the individual volumes, and that it has commercially become more expedient to re-issue sold out volumes in this format, instead of continuing to reprint the individual volumes, aside from tapping into a new replacement market by targeting the nostalgia of now grown-up and more affluent readers who want to upgrade their worn-out individual copies they had bought and read as youths. Initially only released in French and, to a lesser degree, Dutch,<ref>The early 1980s/1990s int\u00e9grales were primarily released in joint ventures with specialist [[direct market]]ing publishers [https://www.bedetheque.com/search/albums?RechCollection=Rombaldi&RechEO=1 \"Rombaldi\"] and [https://www.stripinfo.be/lijst.php?uitgever=253&sort=jaar \"Lecturama\"] for French and Dutch respectively.</ref> these editions have after the late-1990s surged in popularity, becoming increasingly popular in other European countries as well in (hardcover) translation, where the ''int\u00e9grale'' format is in some cases also employed for native comics, particularly in Spain, The Netherlands and Germany, a few of them reciprocally translated into French. All of the great Franco-Belgian comic publishing houses, still in existence, are as of 2017 engaged in releasing ''int\u00e9grales'', either by themselves, or by licensing them out to local publishers for other European countries &ndash; or both, as is the case for Dutch language editions.<ref>Dutch publishers {{ill|Arboris|nl}}, Saga and {{ill|Sherpa (uitgeverij)|nl}} are releasing \"integralen\" of the big three Franco-Belgian publishers Dargaud, Lombard and Dupuis, who are concurrently engaged in releasing such Dutch-language editions of other series not licensed to the Dutch publishers. {{ill|Lecturama|nl}} outlived {{ill|Rombaldi|fr}} by nearly two decades as integrale publisher, though only for Disney and native comics, as well as the Flemish creations of [[Willy Vandersteen]], but went defunct in 2015 as well.</ref>\n\n==Styles==\nWhile more recent comics can no longer be easily categorized into one art style anymore (due to the increasing blurring of the boundaries between the styles in more recent comic creations &ndash; aside from the introduction of new and/or other art styles), and the old artists who pioneered the market are retiring, there were initially three basic, distinct styles within the field prior to the mid-1970s, featured in those comics with Belgian pedigree in particular.\n\nOne of the early greats, Belgian [[Jij\u00e9|Joseph \"Jij\u00e9\" Gilian]], was noted for creating comics in all three styles, the schematic style for his early work, \"comic-dynamic\" style for his later humoristic comics, as well as creating comics in the realistic style. The latter style he acquired during World War II when he had to complete realistic comics such as [[Fred Harman]]'s ''[[Red Ryder]]'' after the occupying Germans prohibited the import of these American comics. At first influenced by the style of such American artists like Harman, Jij\u00e9 developed a realistic style distinctively his own (and thus European), and which became a major source of inspiration for future French/Belgian talents aspiring a career in creating realistic comics, the first and foremost of them having been [[Jean Giraud]]. Another of these Jij\u00e9-inspired youngsters was [[Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]], who actually started out his famed science-fiction creation ''[[Val\u00e9rian and Laureline]]'' in the \"comic-dynamic\" style, but which quickly gravitated towards the realistic style, though traces of the former remain discernible in the depictions of his aliens, which therefore constituted an early example of the mixing of the three basic art styles. Another ambiguous, even earlier, example concerned the creations of [[Victor Hubinon]] (''[[Buck Danny]]'', ''[[Redbeard (comics)|Redbeard]]''), who created comics in his own distinct style that had the characteristics of both the realistic and schematic styles, but which can not be unambiguously be categorized as either, or at the most be categorized as an \"in between\" style.\n\n===Realistic style===\nThe realistic comics are often laboriously detailed. An effort is made to make the comics look as convincing, as natural as possible, while still being drawings. No speed lines or exaggerations are used. This effect is often reinforced by the coloring, which is less even, less primary than schematic or comic-dynamic comics.\nFamous examples are ''[[Jerry Spring]]'' by Jij\u00e9, ''[[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]'' by Giraud, and ''[[Thorgal]]'' by [[Grzegorz Rosi\u0144ski|Rosi\u0144ski]].\n\n===Comic-dynamic style===\nThis is the almost [[Carl Barks|Barksian]] line of Franquin and Uderzo. The humoristic comics in ''Pilote'' were almost exclusively comic-dynamic, and so were the ones in  ''Spirou'' and ''[[l'\u00c9cho des savanes]]''. These comics have very agitated drawings, often using lines of varying thickness to accent the drawings. The artists working in this style for Spirou, including [[Andr\u00e9 Franquin|Franquin]], [[Morris (comics)|Morris]], [[Jean Roba]] and [[Peyo]], are often grouped as the [[Marcinelle school]].\n\n===Schematic style (''ligne claire'' style)===\nThe major factor in schematic drawings is a reduction of reality to easy, clear lines. Typical is the lack of shadows, the geometrical features, and the realistic proportions. Another trait is the often \"slow\" drawings, with little to no speed-lines, and strokes that are almost completely even. It is also known as the Belgian clean line style or ''[[ligne claire]]''. ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' is not only a very good example of this, it is currently also considered as ''the'' original template for the style as used in modern European comics. Other works in this style are the early comics of Jij\u00e9, who not only worked in the style, but also expanded upon it by adding [[Art D\u00e9co]] elements resulting in what several scholars came to consider a separate spin-off style, coined the \"Atom style\".<ref>{{cite book |last=de Grand Ry |first=Michel |authorlink= |author2=Nizette, Andr\u00e9 |author3= Lechat, Jean-Louis  |title=Le livre d'or de la bande dessin\u00e9e 1925-1955|year=1986 |publisher=Centre de la bande dessin\u00e9e Belge |location=[[Brussels]] |language=french |pages=6\u20137 |chapter=Jij\u00e9}}</ref><ref name=Weyer132>[[#References|de Weyer, 2015, pp. 132\u2013134]]</ref> This Jij\u00e9 specific comics style enjoyed a revival in later works from French, Flemish and Dutch artists like [[Yves Chaland]], [[Ever Meulen]] and [[Joost Swarte]] respectively, the latter of whom incidentally, having actually coined the alternative \"''ligne clair''\" designation in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|title=Investigating the Clear Line Style|last=Pleban|first=Dafna|url=http://comicfoundry.com/?p=1526|work=ComicFoundry|date=7 November 2006|access-date=24 October 2019|archivedate=27 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305161452/http://comicfoundry.com/?p=1526|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEven though Jij\u00e9 has somewhat receded in oblivion outside his own native Belgium, he is held in high esteem by many of his peers, both those he tutored like Franquin and Moebius, and others, and his versatility was such that it solicited an accolade of high praise from fellow artist Tibet, author of ''[[Ric Hochet]]'' and ''[[Chick Bill]]'', who has stated that \"If Herg\u00e9 is considered as God the Father, then Jij\u00e9 undoubtedly is the Godfather\".<ref name=Weyer132/> After Jij\u00e9, it were predominantly French (Philippe Druillet, Jean Giraud as \"M\u0153bius\", Jacques Tardi, Annie Goetzinger, [[Fred (cartoonist)|Fred]]) and Italian ([[Guido Crepax]], Hugo Pratt, [[Lorenzo Mattotti]], [[Attilio Micheluzzi]]) comics artists who increasingly introduced alternative art styles &ndash; sometimes extensive innovations/modernizations/expansions of the three existing basic styles, sometimes entirely new &ndash; in the medium from the mid-1970s onward, either by creating them directly for native publications, or by becoming major influences through translations which in Francophone Europe was especially the case for the Italians.\n\n==Foreign comics==\nDespite the large number of local publications, the French and Belgian editors release numerous adaptations of comics from all over the world. In particular these include other European publications, from countries such as, most conspicuously, [[Italy]] with Guido Crepax, Hugo Pratt and [[Milo Manara]] among many others, and to a somewhat lesser degree [[Spain]], with [[Daniel Torres (comics)|Daniel Torres]], and [[Argentina]], with [[Alberto Breccia]], [[H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mu\u00f1oz]]. Some well-known German ([[Andreas (comics)|Andreas]], [[Matthias Schultheiss]]), Swiss ([[Derib]], {{illm|Cosey|fr}} and [[Zep]]) and Polish ([[Grzegorz Rosinski]]) authors work almost exclusively for the Franco-Belgian market and their publishers such as Gl\u00e9nat and, most conspicuously, Le Lombard. Likewise, the French naturalized Yugoslav [[Enki Bilal]] worked exclusively for French publishers Dargaud and subsequently Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9s, whereas Dutch graphic novelist [[Paul Teng]] has, after his career failed to take off in his native country, first worked for Casterman before switching to Le Lombard.\n\nClassic American and British comic books, those of the traditional [[superhero]] genres in particular, are not as well represented in the French and Belgian comics market, for the reasons as explored above, although the graphic novel work of [[Will Eisner]] and [[Art Spiegelman]] (first published in French in ''\u00c0 Suivre'') is respected to such a high extent that it has actually led to the adoption of the English expression in mainland Europe as well, particularly for such mature works as published by Casterman or Les Humano\u00efdes Associ\u00e9s.<ref name =\"grafnov\"/> Nonetheless, a few [[comic strip]]s like ''[[Peanuts]]'' and ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' have had considerable success in France and Belgium. Yet, it was in the field of the graphic novels that American and British creations ''did'' attract attention from the Franco-Belgian comic world, the early ones having been [[Richard Corben]] and [[Bernie Wrightson]], the former of which having started out in the American underground comix scene, where artists created comics with the express intent to distance themselves from the classic American comics as produced by the big studios. Both men were published in the ''M\u00e9tal Hurlant'' American spin-off ''Heavy Metal'' and reciprocally translated for the French mother magazine. As mentioned, ''Heavy Metal'' made a [[Jean Giraud#Influence and legacy|deep artistic impact]] on an entire young generation of English-speaking comic creators, such as [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Mike Mignola]], who started to create more modern, more mature comics henceforth. It were these comics that were given attention by publisher Gl\u00e9nat, when they established the subsidiary Comics USA in 1988. Actually starting out with (hardcover!) comic book sized publications in the classic superhero genre, but created by a young generation of artists, the classic American comic failed to make a convincing come-back and the subsidiary folded in 1991 after 48 issues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Super H\u00e9ros (Collection Comics USA)|url=https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-11251-BD-Super-Heros-Collection-Comics-USA.html|work=Bedetheque.com|language=fr}}</ref> Subsequently, Gl\u00e9nat focused solely on its concurrent {{ill|Gl\u00e9nat Comics|fr}} imprint which concentrated on album releases of modern American graphic novels from such publishers as [[Image Comics]], [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]], and [[Oni Press]], and as such still in existence as of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=glenatcomics.com|url=http://www.glenatcomics.com|language=fr}}; Official site</ref> Gl\u00e9nat was actually preceded in 1986 by [[Delcourt (publisher)|Delcourt]], a newcomer presently specialized in American/British graphic novels and Japanese [[manga]].

Illustrative of the market share the manga has conquered is that Dargaud has in 1996 spun off their manga French-language publications into a specialized publisher of it own, [[Kana (publisher)|Kana]], currently co-existing alongside the already established specialist Delcourt, and since 2000 joined by specialists [[Pika \u00c9dition]], {{ill|Kurokawa (publisher)|lt=Kurokawa|fr|Kurokawa}}, [[Kaz\u00e9]] and [[Ki-oon]]. In 2014, Delcourt acquired the earliest know such specialist [[Tonkam]], which had already been established in 1993.\n\n==Conventions and journalistic professionalism==\nThere are many comics conventions in Belgium and France. The most famous, prestigious and largest one is the \"Festival international de la bande dessin\u00e9e d'Angoul\u00eame\" (English: \"[[Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival]]\"), an annual festival begun in 1974, in [[Angoul\u00eame]], [[France]], and the format has been adopted in other European countries as well, unsurprisingly perhaps considering the popularity the Franco-Belgian comics enjoy in these countries, though they are typically of a more modest size, the Italian \"[[Lucca Comics & Games]]\" festival (est. 1965) excepted &ndash; though, as the name already suggest, that festival extents beyond comics alone, whereas the Angoul\u00eame festival is comics specific. During his tenure as culture minister, Jack Lang was a frequent guest of honor of the festival as part of his endeavors to advance the cultural status of the ''bande dessin\u00e9e'', and personally awarded the festival's awards to comic artists, which included Jean Giraud in 1985 when he received the festival's [[Former prizes of the Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival#Grand Prix for the graphic arts|most prestigious award]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean Giraud: Bibliographie, Photo, Biographie|url=http://www.bdparadisio.com/scripts/detail.cfm?Id=296|work=BDparadiso.com|language=fr}}</ref> the year after Lang had announced the advent of the national comics museum on the previous edition of the festival.\n\nTypical for conventions are the expositions of original art, the signing sessions with authors, sale of small press and fanzines, an awards ceremony, and other comics related activities. Also, some artists from other counties travel to Angoul\u00eame and other festivals to show their work and meet their fans and editors. The Angoul\u00eame festival draws in over 200.000 visitors annually,<ref>{{cite news|last=Delcroix|first=Olivier|title=Angoul\u00eame : la BD en pleine forme|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/bd/2012/01/29/03014-20120129ARTFIG00159-angouleme-la-bd-en-pleine-forme.php|accessdate=30 January 2012|newspaper=[[Le Figaro]]|date=29 January 2012|language=fr}}</ref> including between 6,000 and 7,000<ref>{{cite web|title=Professionals|url=http://www.bdangoulemepro.com/page-professionnels,marche-des-droits-et-du-licensing,7.html|publisher=Festival International de la bande dessin\u00e9e d'Angoul\u00eame|accessdate=30 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128194207/http://www.bdangoulemepro.com/page-professionnels,marche-des-droits-et-du-licensing,7.html|archive-date=28 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> professionals and 800 journalists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Angoul\u00eame BD|url=http://bdangouleme.com/english/|accessdate=30 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118045840/http://bdangouleme.com/english/|archive-date=18 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Contrary to their US [[Comic book convention|Comic Con]] counterparts, where other pop-culture media manifestations are increasingly taking precedence, movie and television productions in particular, continental European comics conventions remain to this day largely and firmly grounded in its source medium, the printed comics. US-style comic conventions are becoming popular as well though, but are invariably organized separately from the traditional ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' festivals under the English denomination, and where the print materials are concerned focused on the US comic book, and Japanese manga publications.\n\nOne of the oldest Franco-Belgian comics conventions was the \"Convention de la B.D. de Paris\" (1969\u20132003), which was co-founded by the [[#Vocabulary|aforementioned]] Claude Moliterni. Though Moliterni was a ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' writer (usually for artist [[Robert Gigi]]), he became primarily renowned as a tireless champion for the medium, in the process becoming one of France's very first serious comics scholars by launching one of the very first professional and serious [[Trade journal|comics journals]] worldwide, ''{{ill|Ph\u00e9nix (p\u00e9riodique)|fr}}'' (1966\u20131977), and writing numerous articles, reference books and, later on, (co-)launching specialized websites as well, on the subject matter. In doing so Moliterni became the European counterpart of equally renowned American &ndash; but French-born &ndash; comics scholar [[Maurice Horn]], a contemporary with whom Moliterni had actually cooperated in the early years of their careers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Munson|first=Kim|title=How the French Kickstarted the Acceptance of Comics as Art in the US: the Books and Exhibitions of Maurice Horn|date=Fall-Winter 2016|url=https://www.academia.edu/26994403/How_the_French_Kickstarted_the_Acceptance_of_Comics_as_an_Art_Form_in_the_US_the_Books_and_Exhibitions_of_Maurice_Horn|magazine=[[International Journal of Comic Art]] vol. 18, #2}}</ref> Aside from this, Moliterni also became a prolific founder of comics conventions. The very first one he co-founded was actually the Lucca one, experience gained on that experience put to good use for the Parisian one. Moliterni went on to co-found seven more conventions and permanent exhibitions in France and Italy, including Angoul\u00eame for which he is most renowned. His efforts for the medium gained Moliterni no less than three French civilian knighthoods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pasamonik|first=Didier|title=Disparition de Claude Moliterni, fondateur du Festival d\u2019Angoul\u00eame|url=http://www.actuabd.com/Disparition-de-Claude-Moliterni-fondateur-du-Festival-d-Angouleme|work=ActuaBD|date=21 January 2009|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nThe trailblazing journalistic &ndash; and subsequent scholastic &ndash; approach pioneered by Moliterni, which greatly aided in the acceptance of the medium as a mature part of Francophone culture, served as an inspiration for his successors, such as {{ill|Henri Filippini|fr}}, [[Thierry Groensteen]], {{ill|Stan Barets|fr}}, [[Numa Sadoul]], as well as the already mentioned Bocque, Gaumer and Ratier, who have followed in his footsteps. With Gaumer incidentally, Moliterni revisited his 1964-1967 ''Spirou'' article series he had co-edited with Morris, which resulted in the edited and greatly enhanced reference work ''Dictionnaire mondial de la bande dessin\u00e9e'' ({{ISBN|2035235103}}), published in 1994 by [[\u00c9ditions Larousse]] (a renowned French encyclopedia publisher), and a work very similar to Horn's 1976 ''The World Encyclopedia of Comics'' ({{ISBN|0877540306}}) which in turn greatly resembled the older ''Spirou'' article series.\n\nLikewise, his ''Ph\u00e9nix'' trade journal has seen a plethora of successors following suit all over western Europe as well. Actually, the second oldest known professional European comics trade journal was the Dutch ''{{ill|Stripschrift|nl}}'', launched in 1968 and coinciding with the definitive breakthrough of the ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' in the Netherlands, before a second Francophone comics journal (''{{ill|Les Cahiers de la bande dessin\u00e9e|fr}}'', launched in 1969 as ''Schtroumpf'' by {{ill|Jacques Gl\u00e9nat|fr}} and in effect the founding block of his namesake publishing house) had even entered the fray. During its first couple of years of publication, ''Stripschrift'' was in effect very reliant on ''Ph\u00e9nix'' for content, before it managed to shake off its French roots and stand on its own, and is, contrary to its French progenitor, still being published as of 2020 and thus the oldest known professional comics journal still in existence worldwide.\n\n==Impact and popularity==\nFranco-Belgian comics have been translated in most European languages, with some of them enjoying a worldwide success. Some magazines, aside from the Dutch-language editions, have been translated in Greek, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish, while in other cases foreign magazines were filled with the best of the Franco-Belgian comics. In France and Belgium, most magazines have since then disappeared or have a largely reduced circulation for socio-economic reasons (but mostly because modern readership no longer possesses the patience to read their comics in weekly or monthly installments, instead preferring to have a story presented to them wholesale in album format), but the number of published and sold albums stays relatively high &ndash; the majority of new titles being currently directly published as albums without prior magazine serialization &ndash; with the biggest successes still on the juvenile and adolescent markets. This state of affairs has been mirrored in the other European countries as well. As a format, the Franco-Belgian comic has been near-universally adopted by native comic artists all over Europe, especially in the neighboring countries of Belgium and France (and including Italy, despite that country having had a rich and thriving comics culture of its own), solidifying the position of the Franco-Belgian comic as the preeminent force on the [[European comics]] scene, Great Britain excepted.\n\nThe greatest and most enduring success however was mainly for some series started in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s (including ''[[Lucky Luke]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (comics)|The Smurfs]]'', and ''[[Asterix]]''), and the even older ''[[Adventures of Tintin]]'', while many more recent series have not made a significant commercial impact outside mainland Europe and those overseas territories historically beholden to France, despite the critical acclaim for authors like [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]]. One out-of-the-ordinary overseas exception where Franco-Belgian comics are as of 2017 still doing well turned out to be the Indian subcontinent where translations in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] (spoken in the south-eastern part of India, [[Tamil Nadu]], and on the island state of [[Sri Lanka]]) published by Prakash Publishers under their own \"[[Lion comics|Lion/Muthu Comics]]\" imprints, have proven to be very popular, though their appeal remain somewhat limited to the classic series for an adolescent readership as conceived in the 1960s\u20131980s, and that more recent, more mature series have yet to make an impression in those territories.\n\n==Notable comics==\nWhile hundreds of comic series have been produced in the Franco-Belgian group, some are more notable than others.
