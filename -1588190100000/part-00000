It sits on [[Ludgate Hill]] at the highest point of the [[City of London]] and is a [[Listed Building|Grade I listed building]]. Its dedication to [[Paul the Apostle]] dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|p=778}} The present cathedral, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the [[English Baroque]] style by [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]]. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the City after the [[Great Fire of London]].{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2004}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The cathedral building largely destroyed in the Great Fire, now often referred to as [[Old St&nbsp;Paul's Cathedral]], was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including [[Paul's walk]] and St&nbsp;Paul's Churchyard being the site of [[St&nbsp;Paul's Cross]].\n\nThe cathedral is one of the most famous and most recognisable sights of London. Its dome, framed by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At {{convert|365|ft}} high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1967. The dome remains among the highest in the world. St Paul's is the [[List of largest church buildings|second-largest church building]] in area in the United Kingdom after [[Liverpool Cathedral]]. Although, it's most famous from it's recent burial in 2019 where two of their workers were caught having intercourse in one of their [[coffins]].\n\nServices held at St Paul's have included the funerals of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]], the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]; jubilee celebrations for [[Queen Victoria]]; peace services marking the end of the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]]; the [[wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer]]; the launch of the [[Festival of Britain]]; and the thanksgiving services for the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver]], [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden]] and [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond]] [[Jubilees]] and the 80th and 90th birthdays of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

S\u00e6berht's uncle and overlord, [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|\u00c6thelberht]], king of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], built a church dedicated to St&nbsp;Paul in London, as the seat of the new bishop.{{sfn|Bede|1969|pages=142\u2013143}} It is assumed, although not proved, that this first Anglo-Saxon cathedral stood on the same site as the later medieval and the present cathedrals. <!-- If anyone wants to debate whether the original cathedral stood on another site, perhaps in Lundenwic, please cite verifiable references or discuss on Talk page-->\n\nOn the death of S\u00e6berht in about 616, his pagan sons expelled Mellitus from London, and the East Saxons reverted to paganism. The fate of the first cathedral building is unknown. Christianity was restored among the East Saxons in the late 7th century and it is presumed that either the Anglo-Saxon cathedral was restored or a new building erected as the seat of bishops such as [[Cedd]], [[Wine (bishop)|Wine]] and [[Earconwald]], the last of whom was buried in the cathedral in 693. This building, or a successor, was destroyed by fire in 962, but rebuilt in the same year.{{sfn|Garmonsway|1953}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nKing [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] was buried in the cathedral on his death in 1016; the tomb is now lost.

London is said to have sent 2 delegates to the Council of Arles in 314 AD.\n\nA list of the 16 [[archbishops of London|\"archbishops\" of London]] was recorded by [[Jocelyn of Furness]] in the 12th century, claiming London's [[Celtic Christianity|Christian]] community was founded in the 2nd century under the legendary [[Lucius of Britain|King&nbsp;Lucius]] and his missionary saints [[Saint Fagan|Fagan]], [[Saint Deruvian|Deruvian]], Elvanus and Medwin. None of that is considered credible by modern historians but, although the surviving text is problematic, either Bishop [[Restitutus]] or Adelphius at the [[Council of Arles (314)|314 Council of Arles]] seems to have come from [[Londinium]].{{efn|\"Nomina Episcoporum, cum Clericis Suis, Quinam, et ex Quibus Provinciis, ad Arelatensem Synodum Convenerint\" [\"The Names of the Bishops with Their Clerics who Came Together at the Synod of Arles and from which Province They Came\"](from {{harvnb|Labb\u00e9|Cossart|1671|loc=col.&nbsp;1429}} included in {{harvnb|Thackery|1843|pp=272&nbsp;ff.}}).}} \n\nThe location of Londinium's original cathedral is unknown.  But legend and medieval tradition claims it was [[St Peter upon Cornhill]]. St Pauls is an unusual attribution for a Cathedral, and suggests there was another one in the Roman period.  Legends of St Lucius link [[St Peter upon Cornhill] as the centre of the Roman Londiumum christian community. It stands upon the highest point in the area of old Londinium, and it was given pre-eminence in medieval procession on account of the legends.  There is, however, no other reliable evidence and the location of the site on the Forum makes it difficult for it to fit the legendary stories.  In 1995,a large 5th-century building on [[Tower Hill]] was excavated, and has been claimed as a Roman Basilica, possibly a Cathedral, although this is speculative.  {{sfn|Denison|1995}}{{sfn|Sankey|1998|pp=78\u201382}}   \n\nThe [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] antiquarian [[William Camden]] argued that a [[Roman temple|temple]] to the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] had stood during Roman times on the site occupied by the medieval St Paul's Cathedral.{{sfn|Camden |1607|pp=306\u2013307}} Wren reported that he had found no trace of any such temple during the works to build the new cathedral after the Great Fire, and Camden's hypothesis is no longer accepted by modern archaeologists.{{sfn|Clark|1996|pages=1\u20139}}\n\n=== Old St Paul's ===\n{{Main|Old St Paul's Cathedral}}\nThe fourth St Paul's, generally referred to as ''Old St Paul's'', was begun by the [[Normans]] after the 1087 fire. A further fire in 1135 disrupted the work, and the new cathedral was not consecrated until 1240. During the period of construction, the style of architecture had changed from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] to [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and this was reflected in the pointed arches and larger windows of the upper parts and East End of the building. The Gothic ribbed vault was constructed, like that of [[York Minster]], of wood rather than stone, which affected the ultimate fate of the building.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:St Paul's old.

This \"New Work\" was consecrated in 1300 but not complete until 1314. During the later Medieval period St Paul's was exceeded in length only by the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey Church of Cluny]] and in the height of its spire only by [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and [[St. Mary's Church, Stralsund]]. Excavations by [[Francis Penrose]] in 1878 showed that it was {{convert|585|ft|m}} long and {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide (290 feet or 87&nbsp;m across the [[transept]]s and [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]]). The spire was about 489 feet (149&nbsp;m) in height.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nBy the 16th century the building was starting to decay. The [[English Reformation]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], and particularly the [[Chantries Acts]] led to the destruction of elements of the interior ornamentation and the chapels, [[shrine]]s, [[chantry|chantries]]. In October 1538, an image of St Erkenwald, probably from the shrine, was delivered to the master of the king\u2019s jewels. Other images may have survived, at least for a time. More systematic iconoclasm happened in the reign of Edward VI; the ''Grey Friar\u2019s Chronicle'' reports that the rood and other images were destroyed in November 1547, and \"Alle the alteres and chappelles in alle Powlles churche\" were taken down in October 1552.<ref>Stanford E. Lehmberg, ''The Reformation of Cathedrals'' (Princeton UP, 1988), p. 114.</ref> Some of the buildings in St Paul's Churchyard were sold as shops and rental properties, especially to printers and booksellers. In 1561 the spire was destroyed by lightning, an event that [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] writers claimed was a sign of God's judgement on England's Protestant rulers. Bishop James Pilkington preached a sermon in response, claiming that the lightning strike was a judgement for the irreverent use of the cathedral building.<ref>[https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199571765.001.0001/acprof-9780199571765 Mary Morrissey, Politics and the Paul's Cross Sermons, 1558\u20131642 (2011), p. 3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190514142353/https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199571765.001.0001/acprof-9780199571765 |date=14 May 2019 }}.</ref> Immediate steps were taken to repair the damage, and the citizens of London and the clergy offering money to support the rebuilding.<ref>Dugdale, ''History of St Paul's Cathedral'', pp. 133-4.</ref> But the cost of the repairing the building properly was too great for a country and city recovering from a trade depression.

He produced a drawing of the proposed dome which shows his idea that it should span nave and aisles at the crossing.{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=204}} After the Fire, it was at first thought possible to retain a substantial part of the old cathedral, but ultimately the entire structure was demolished in the early 1670s.\n\nIn July 1668 Dean [[William Sancroft]] wrote to Wren that he was charged by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in agreement with the Bishops of London and Oxford, to design a new cathedral that was \"Handsome and noble to all the ends of it and to the reputation of the City and the nation\".{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=223}} The design process took several years, but a design was finally settled and attached to a royal warrant, with the proviso that Wren was permitted to make any further changes that he deemed necessary. The result was the present St Paul's Cathedral, still the second largest church in Britain, with a dome proclaimed as the finest in the world.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=913}} The building was financed by a tax on coal, and was completed within its architect's lifetime with many of the major contractors engaged for the duration.\n\nThe \"topping out\" of the cathedral (when the final stone was placed on the lantern) took place on 26 October 1708, performed by Wren's son Christopher Jr and the son of one of the masons.{{sfn|Keene|Burn|Saint|2004|p=219}} The cathedral was declared officially complete by Parliament on 25 December 1711 (Christmas Day).{{sfn|Campbell|2007|p=161}} In fact, construction continued for several years after that, with the statues on the roof added in the 1720s.

He had to create a fitting cathedral to replace ''Old St Paul's'', as a place of worship and as a landmark within the City of London. He had to satisfy the requirements of the church and the tastes of a royal patron, as well as respecting the essentially medieval tradition of English church building which developed to accommodate the liturgy. Wren was familiar with contemporary Renaissance and Baroque trends in Italian architecture and had visited France, where he studied the work of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mansart]].\n\nWren's design developed through five general stages. The first survives only as a single drawing and part of a model. The scheme (usually called the ''First Model Design'') appears to have consisted of a circular domed vestibule (possibly based on the [[Pantheon in Rome]]) and a rectangular church of [[basilica]] form. The plan may have been influenced by the [[Temple Church]]. It was rejected because it was not thought \"stately enough\".{{sfn|Campbell|2007|pp=27\u201328}} Wren's second design was a Greek cross,<ref>\"The City Churches\" Tabor, M. p108:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917</ref> which was thought by the clerics not to fulfil the requirements of Anglican liturgy.{{sfn|Downes|1987|pp=11\u201334}}\n\nWren's third design is embodied in the \"Great Model\" of 1673. The model, made of oak and plaster, cost over \u00a3500 (approximately \u00a332,000 today) and is over {{convert|13|ft|m|0}} tall and {{convert|21|ft|m|0}} long.{{sfn|Saunders|2001|p=60}} This design retained the form of the Greek-Cross design but extended it with a nave. His critics, members of a committee commissioned to rebuild the church, and clergy decried the design as too dissimilar to other English churches to suggest any continuity within the Church of England. Another problem was that the entire design would have to be completed all at once because of the eight central piers that supported the dome, instead of being completed in stages and opened for use before construction finished, as was customary. The Great Model was Wren's favourite design; he thought it a reflection of [[Renaissance]] beauty.{{sfn|Hart|1995|pp=17\u201323}} After the Great Model, Wren resolved not to make further models and not to expose his drawings publicly, which he found did nothing but \"lose time, and subject [his] business many times, to incompetent judges\".{{sfn|Downes|1987|pp=11\u201334}} The Great Model survives and is housed within the Cathedral itself.\n\nWren's fourth design is known as the ''Warrant design'' because it received a Royal warrant for the rebuilding. In this design Wren sought to reconcile Gothic, the predominant style of English churches, to a \"better manner of architecture\". It has the longitudinal Latin Cross plan of a medieval cathedral. It is of {{frac|1|1|2}} storeys and has classical porticos at the west and transept ends, influenced by Inigo Jones\u2019s addition to Old St Paul's.{{sfn|Downes|1987|pp=11\u201334}} It is roofed at the crossing by a wide shallow dome supporting a drum with a second cupola, from which rises a spire of seven diminishing stages. Vaughan Hart has suggested that influence in the design of the spire may have been drawn from the oriental [[pagoda]]. Not used at St Paul's, the concept was applied in the spire of [[St Bride's, Fleet Street]].{{sfn|Hart|2002}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} This plan was rotated slightly on its site so that it aligned, not with true east, but with sunrise on Easter of the year construction began. This small change in configuration was informed by Wren's knowledge of astronomy.{{sfn|Lang|1956|pp=47\u201363}}\n{{multiple image\n|align     = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|header_align = center\n|header    =\n|image1    = St Paul's - the Greek Cross design.jpg\n|width1    = 225\n|alt1      =\n|caption1  = The Greek Cross Design\n|image2    = St Paul's - the warrant design.jpg\n|width2    = 222\n|alt2      =\n|caption2  = The Warrant Design\n|image3    =St Paul's - the final design.jpg\n|width3    = 230\n|alt3      =\n|caption3  = St Paul's, as it was built\n }}\n\n=== Final design ===\nThe final design as built differs substantially from the official Warrant design.{{sfn|Barker|Hyde|1982}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Wren received permission from the king to make \"ornamental changes\" to the submitted design, and Wren took great advantage of this. Many of these changes were made over the course of the thirty years as the church was constructed, and the most significant was to the dome: \"He raised another structure over the first cupola, a cone of brick, so as to support a stone lantern of an elegant figure&nbsp;... And he covered and hid out of sight the brick cone with another cupola of timber and lead; and between this and the cone are easy stairs that ascend to the lantern\" (Christopher Wren, son of Sir Christopher Wren). The final design was strongly rooted in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. The saucer domes over the nave were inspired by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart's [[Church of the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce]], which Wren had seen during a trip to Paris in 1665.{{sfn|Hart|1995|pp=17\u201323}}\n\nThe date of the laying of the first stone of the cathedral is disputed. One contemporary account says it was 21 June 1675, another 25 June and a third on 28 June. There is, however, general agreement that it was laid in June 1675. Edward Strong later claimed it was laid by his elder brother, Thomas Strong, one of the two master stonemasons appointed by Wren at the beginning of the work.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|pp=53\u201354}}\n{{Clear}}<!-- This break improves format on some wide screens. -->\n\n=== Structural engineering ===\n{{multiple image\n|align     = left\n|direction = horizontal\n|header_align =\n|header    =\n|image1    = St Paul's Engraving by Samuel Wale and John Gwynn (1755)..gif\n|width1    = 200\n|alt1      =\n|caption1  =Cross-section showing the brick cone between the inner and outer domes\n|image2    = Dickinson St Paul's.jpg\n|width2    = 170\n|alt2      =\n|caption2  = William Dickinson's plan for the floor paving (1709\u20131710)\n}}\n\nWren's challenge was to construct a large cathedral on the relatively weak clay soil of London. St Paul's is unusual among cathedrals in that there is a crypt, the largest in Europe, under the entire building rather than just under the eastern end.{{sfn|Harris|1988|pp=214\u201315}}  The crypt serves a structural purpose. Although it is extensive, half the space of the crypt is taken up by massive piers which spread the weight of the much slimmer piers of the church above. While the towers and domes of most cathedrals are supported on four piers, Wren designed the dome of St Paul's to be supported on eight, achieving a broader distribution of weight at the level of the foundations.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}}  The foundations settled as the building progressed, and Wren made structural changes in response.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|p=56\u201359}}\n\nOne of the design problems that confronted Wren was to create a landmark dome, tall enough to visually replace the lost tower of St Paul's, while at the same time appearing visually satisfying when viewed from inside the building. Wren planned a double-shelled dome, as at St Peter's Basilica.{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=228}}  His solution to the visual problem was to separate the heights of the inner and outer dome to a much greater extent than had been done by [[Michelangelo]] at St Peter's, drafting both as [[catenary]] curves, rather than as hemispheres. Between the inner and outer domes, Wren inserted a brick cone which supports both the timbers of the outer, lead-covered dome and the weight of the ornate stone lantern that rises above it. Both the cone and the inner dome are 18 inches thick and are supported by wrought iron chains at intervals in the brick cone and around the cornice of the peristyle of the inner dome to prevent spreading and cracking.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}}{{sfn|Campbell|2007|p=137}}\n\nThe Warrant Design showed external buttresses on the ground floor level. These were not a classical feature and were one of the first elements Wren changed. Instead he made the walls of the cathedral particularly thick to avoid the need for external buttresses altogether. The clerestory and vault are reinforced with flying buttresses, which were added at a relatively late stage in the design to give extra strength.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|pp=105\u2013114}} These are concealed behind the screen wall of the upper story, which was added to keep the building's classical style intact, to add sufficient visual mass to balance the appearance of the dome and which, by its weight, counters the thrust of the buttresses on the lower walls.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}}{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=228}}\n\n=== Designers, builders and craftsmen ===\nDuring the extensive period of design and rationalisation Wren employed from 1684 [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] as his principal assistant.{{sfn|Hart|2002}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Between 1696 and 1711 [[William Dickinson (architect)|William Dickinson]] was measuring clerk.{{sfn|Tinniswood|2010|p=203}} Joshua Marshall (until his early death in 1678) and Thomas and his brother Edward Strong were master masons, the latter two working on the construction for its entirety.

It has much emphasis on its facade, which has been designed to define rather than conceal the form of the building behind it. In plan, the towers jut beyond the width of the aisles as they do at [[Wells Cathedral]]. Wren's uncle [[Matthew Wren]] was the [[Bishop of Ely]], and, having worked for his uncle, Wren was familiar with the unique octagonal lantern tower over the crossing of [[Ely Cathedral]], which spans the aisles as well as the central nave, unlike the central towers and domes of most churches. Wren adapted this characteristic in designing the dome of St Paul's.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}} In section St Paul's also maintains a medieval form, having the aisles much lower than the nave, and a defined clerestory.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe most notable exterior feature is the dome, which rises {{convert|365|ft|m}} to the cross at its summit,{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=912}} and dominates views of the City. The height of 365 feet is explained by Wren's interest in astronomy. Until the late 20th century St Paul's was the tallest building on the City skyline, designed  to be seen surrounded by the delicate spires of Wren's other city churches. The dome is described by Sir [[Sir Banister Fletcher|Banister Fletcher]] as \"probably the finest in Europe\", by [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] as \"majestic\", and by Sir [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as \"one of the most perfect in the world\". Sir [[John Summerson]] said that Englishmen and \"even some foreigners\" consider it to be without equal.<ref>{{harvnb|Fletcher|1962|p=913}}; {{harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2004|pp=604\u201305}};{{harvnb|Pevsner|1964|pp=324\u201326}}; {{harvnb|Summerson|1983|p=236}}.</ref>\n\n==== Dome ====\n[[File:St Paul's Cathedral Dome from One New Change - Square Crop.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.13|The dome]]\n\nWren drew inspiration from Michelangelo's dome of St Peter's Basilica, and that of Mansart's Church of the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, which he had visited.{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=236}} Unlike those of St Peter's and Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, the dome of St Paul's rises in two clearly defined storeys of masonry, which, together with a lower unadorned footing, equal a height of about 95 feet. From the time of the ''Greek Cross Design'' it is clear that Wren favoured a continuous colonnade (''[[peristyle]]'') around the drum of the dome, rather than the arrangement of alternating windows and projecting columns that Michelangelo had used and which had also been employed by Mansart.{{sfn|Pevsner|1964|pp=324\u201326}} Summerson suggests that he was influenced by Bramante's \"Tempietto\" in the courtyard of [[San Pietro in Montorio]].{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=234}} In the finished structure, Wren creates a diversity and appearance of strength by placing niches between the columns in every fourth opening.{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=234}}  The peristyle serves to buttress both the inner dome and the brick cone which rises internally to support the lantern.\n\nAbove the peristyle rises the second stage surrounded by a balustraded balcony called the \"Stone Gallery\". This attic stage is ornamented with alternating pilasters and rectangular windows which are set just below the cornice, creating a sense of lightness. Above this attic rises the dome, covered with lead, and ribbed in accordance with the spacing of the pilasters. It is pierced by eight light wells just below the lantern, but these are barely visible. They allow light to penetrate through openings in the brick cone, which illuminates the interior apex of this shell, partly visible from within the cathedral through the ocular opening of the lower dome.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}}\n\nThe lantern, like the visible masonry of the dome, rises in stages. The most unusual characteristic of this structure is that it is of square plan, rather than circular or octagonal. The tallest stage takes the form of a ''tempietto'' with four columned porticos facing the cardinal points. Its lowest level is surrounded by the \"Golden Gallery\" and its upper level supports a small dome from which rises a cross on a golden ball.  The total weight of the lantern is about 850 tons.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=913}}\n\n==== West front ====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--first three paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:St Pauls Cathedral West Front.jpg|thumb|St Pauls Cathedral West Front Dome Street View]]\n[[File:St Pauls Cathedral from West adj.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|West Front]]\nFor the Renaissance architect designing the west front of a large church or cathedral, the universal problem was how to use a facade to unite the high central nave with the lower aisles in a visually harmonious whole. Since [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s additions to [[Santa Maria Novella]] in Florence, this was usually achieved by the simple expedient of linking the sides to the centre with large brackets. This is the solution that Wren saw employed by Mansart at Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce. Another feature employed by Mansart was a boldly projecting Classical portico with paired columns. Wren faced the additional challenge of incorporating towers into the design, as had been planned at St Peter's Basilica. At St Peter's, [[Carlo Maderno]] had solved this problem by constructing a [[narthex]] and stretching a huge screen facade across it, differentiated at the centre by a pediment. The towers at St Peter's were not built above the parapet.\n\nWren's solution was to employ a Classical portico, as at Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, but rising through two storeys, and supported on paired columns. The remarkable feature here is that the lower story of this portico extends to the full width of the aisles, while the upper section defines the nave that lies behind it. The gaps between the upper stage of the portico and the towers on either side are bridged by a narrow section of wall with an arch-topped window.\n\nThe towers stand outside the width of the aisles, but screen two chapels located immediately behind them. The lower parts of the towers continue the theme of the outer walls, but are differentiated from them in order to create an appearance of strength. The windows of the lower story are smaller than those of the side walls and are deeply recessed, a visual indication of the thickness of the wall. The paired pilasters at each corner project boldly.\n\nAbove the main [[cornice]], which unites the towers with the portico and the outer walls, the details are boldly scaled, in order to read well from the street below and from a distance. The towers rise above the cornice from a square block plinth which is plain apart from large oculi, that on the south being filled by the clock, while that on the north is void. The towers are composed of two complementary elements, a central cylinder rising through the tiers in a series of stacked drums, and paired [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]] at the corners, with [[buttress]]es above them, which serve to unify the drum shape with the square plinth on which it stands. The entablature above the columns breaks forward over them to express both elements, tying them together in a single horizontal band. The cap, an ogee-shaped dome, supports a gilded pineapple-shaped finial.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stpauls.co.uk/history-collections/the-collections/architectural-archive/wren-office-drawings/6-the-western-towers-c16851710 |title=6.

Wren was inspired in the design by studying engravings of [[Pietro da Cortona]]'s Baroque facade of [[Santa Maria della Pace]] in Rome.{{sfn|Leapman|1995}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} These projecting arcs echo the shape of the apse at the eastern end of the building.\n\n==== Walls ====\n[[File:St Paul's Cathedral, London, England - Jan 2010 edit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|St Paul's from the south-east, with the tower of the destroyed Church of [[St Augustine Watling Street|St Augustine, Watling Street]] to the right, now part of [[St Paul's Cathedral School]].]]\nThe building is of two storeys of ashlar masonry, above a basement, and surrounded by a balustrade above the upper cornice. The balustrade was added, against Wren's wishes, in 1718.{{sfn|Leapman|1995}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The internal bays are marked externally by paired pilasters with Corinthian capitals at the lower level and Composite at the upper level. Where the building behind is of only one story (at the aisles of both nave and choir) the upper story of the exterior wall is sham.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=913}} It serves a dual purpose of supporting the buttresses of the vault, and providing a satisfying appearance when viewed rising above buildings of the height of the 17th-century city. This appearance may still be seen from across the [[River Thames]].\n\nBetween the pilasters on both levels are windows. Those of the lower storey have semi-circular heads and are surrounded by continuous mouldings of a Roman style, rising to decorative keystones. Beneath each window is a floral swag by Grinling Gibbons, constituting the finest stone carving on the building and some of the greatest architectural sculpture in England. A frieze with similar swags runs in a band below the cornice, tying the arches of the windows and the capitals. The upper windows are of a restrained Classical form, with pediments set on columns, but are blind and contain niches. Beneath these niches, and in the basement level, are small windows with segmental tops, the glazing of which catches the light and visually links them to the large windows of the aisles. The height from ground level to the top of the parapet is approximately 110 feet.\n\n==== Fencing ====\n\nThe original fencing, designed by Wren, was dismantled in the 1870s. The [[John George Howard|surveyor for the government of Toronto]] had it shipped to Toronto, where it has since adorned [[High Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.highparknature.org/wiki/wiki.php?n=History.FenceStory|title=The Story of a Fence}}</ref>\n\n=== Interior ===\n{{multiple image\n|align     = left\n|direction = horizontal\n|header_align =\n|header    =\n|image1    = St Paul's Cathedral Nave, London, UK - Diliff.jpg\n|width1    = 266\n|alt1      =\n|caption1  = The nave, looking towards the choir\n|image2    = St Paul's Cathedral Choir looking west, London, UK - Diliff.jpg\n|width2    = 200\n|alt2      =\n|caption2  = The choir, looking towards the nave\n}}\n\nInternally, St Paul's has a nave and choir in each of its three bays. The entrance from the west portico is through a square domed narthex, flanked by chapels: the Chapel of St Dunstan to the north and the Chapel of the Order of St Michael and St George to the south.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}} The nave is {{convert|91|ft|m}} in height and is separated from the aisles by an arcade of piers with attached Corinthian pilasters rising to an entablature. The bays, and therefore the vault compartments, are rectangular, but Wren roofed these spaces with saucer-shaped domes and surrounded the [[clerestory]] windows with [[lunettes]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}} The vaults of the choir are decorated with mosaics by Sir [[William Blake Richmond]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}}  The dome and the apse of the choir are all approached through wide arches with coffered vaults which contrast with the smooth surface of the domes and punctuate the division between the main spaces. The transepts extend to the north and south of the dome and are called (in this instance) the North Choir and the South Choir.\n\nThe [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] holds the stalls for the clergy, cathedral officers and the choir, and the organ. These wooden fittings, including the pulpit and Bishop's throne, were designed in Wren's office and built by joiners. The carvings are the work of Grinling Gibbons whom Summerson describes as having \"astonishing facility\", suggesting that Gibbons aim was to reproduce popular Dutch flower painting in wood.{{sfn|Summerson|1983|pp=238\u2013240}} Jean Tijou, a French metalworker, provided various wrought iron and gilt grilles, gates and balustrades of elaborate design, of which many pieces have now been combined into the gates near the sanctuary.{{sfn|Summerson|1983|pp=238\u2013240}}\n\nThe cathedral is some {{convert|574|ft|m}} in length (including the portico of the Great West Door), of which {{convert|223|ft|m}} is the nave and {{convert|167|ft|m}} is the choir.\nThe width of the nave is {{convert|121|ft|m}} and across the transepts is {{convert|246|ft|m}}.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/encyclopedia/article_show/St_Pauls_Cathedral/m0016968.html?from=hotlink |title=St. Paul's Cathedral |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] |accessdate=18 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523102550/http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/encyclopedia/article_show/St_Pauls_Cathedral/m0016968.html?from=hotlink |archivedate=23 May 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The cathedral is slightly shorter but somewhat wider than Old St Paul's.\n\n==== Dome ====\n{{multiple image\n|align     = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|header_align =\n|header    =\n|image1    = St Paul's Cathedral Interior Dome 3, London, UK - Diliff.jpg\n|width1    = 223\n|alt1      =\n|caption1  = The interior of the dome showing how [[Sir James Thornhill|Thornhill]]'s painting continues an illusion of the real architectural features\n|image2    = St Paul's Cathedral Interior Dome 2 crop, London, UK - Diliff.jpg\n|width2    = 220\n|alt2      =\n|caption2  = This view of an arch spanning the aisle shows how [[Sir Christopher Wren|Wren]] succeeded in giving an impression of eight equal arches.\n}}\n\nThe main internal space of the cathedral is that under the central dome which extends the full width of the nave and aisles. The dome is supported on pendentives rising between eight arches spanning the nave, choir, transepts, and aisles. The eight piers that carry them are not evenly spaced. Wren has maintained an appearance of eight equal spans by inserting segmental arches to carry galleries across the ends of the aisles, and has extended the mouldings of the upper arch to appear equal to the wider arches.{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=228}}\n\nAbove the keystones of the arches, at {{convert|99|ft|m}} above the floor and {{convert|112|ft|m}} wide, runs a cornice which supports the ''[[Whispering gallery|Whispering Gallery]]'' so called because of its acoustic properties: a whisper or low murmur against its wall at any point is audible to a listener with an ear held to the wall at any other point around the gallery. It is reached by 259 steps from ground level.\n\nThe dome is raised on a tall drum surrounded by pilasters and pierced with windows in groups of three, separated by eight gilded niches containing statues, and repeating the pattern of the peristyle on the exterior. the dome rises above a gilded cornice at {{convert|173|ft|m}} to a height of {{convert|214|ft|m}}.

Oculus was funded by American Express Company in partnership with the [[World Monuments Fund]], J. P. Morgan, the Garfield Weston Trust for St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, the City of London Endowment Trust and AIG.\n\nIn 2010, new touchscreen multimedia guides were also launched. These guides are included in the price of admission. Visitors can discover the cathedral\u2019s history, architecture and daily life of a busy working church with these new multimedia guides. They are available in 12 different languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean and British Sign Language (BSL). The guides have fly-through videos of the dome galleries and zoomable close-ups of the ceiling mosaics, painting and photography. Interviews and commentary from experts include the [[Dean of St Paul\u2019s]], conservation team and the Director of Music. Archive film footage includes major services and events from the cathedral's history.\n\n==== Charges for sightseers ====\nSt Paul's charges for the admission of those people who are sightseers, rather than worshippers; the charge is \u00a320 (\u00a317 when purchased online).<ref name=SPCtimesandprices>{{citation |title=Sightseeing Times & Prices |url=http://www.stpauls.co.uk/Visits-Events/Sightseeing-Times-Prices |publisher=St Paul's Cathedral |accessdate=27 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426214936/http://www.stpauls.co.uk/Visits-Events/Sightseeing-Times-Prices |archive-date=26 April 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> Outside service times, people seeking a quiet place to pray or worship are admitted to St Dunstan's Chapel free of charge. On Sundays people are admitted only for services and concerts and there is no sightseeing. The charge to sightseers is made because St Paul's receives little regular or significant funding from the Crown, the Church of England or the state and relies on the income generated by tourism to allow the building to continue to function as a centre for Christian worship, as well as to cover general maintenance and repair work.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why do we charge? |url=https://www.stpauls.co.uk/visit/why-do-we-charge |website=St Paul's Cathedral |accessdate=16 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117122337/https://www.stpauls.co.uk/visit/why-do-we-charge |archive-date=17 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== St Paul's Cathedral Arts Project ===\n\nThe St Paul\u2019s Cathedral Arts Project explores art and [[faith]].

Two spectacular sculptures consisting of three-dimensional white cruciforms reflect the meticulously maintained war graves of northern France and further afield. Each sculpture is also embellished with miniaturised destroyed residential blocks depicting war zones in the Middle East\u2014Syria, Baghdad, Afghanistan\u2014thus connecting 100 years of warfare.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.stpauls.co.uk/News-Press/Latest-News/Giant-white-crosses-remind-St-Pauls-worshippers-and-visitors-of-the-horrors-of-warfare |title=Giant white crosses remind St Paul's worshippers and visitors of the horrors of warfare |website=Stpauls.co.uk |accessdate=18 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034229/https://www.stpauls.co.uk/news-press/latest-news/giant-white-crosses-remind-st-pauls-worshippers-and-visitors-of-the-horrors-of-warfare |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Bill Viola]] has created two altarpieces for permanent display in St Paul's Cathedral. The project commenced production in mid-2009. Following the extensive programme of cleaning and repair of the interior of St Paul's, completed in 2005, Viola was commissioned to create two altarpieces on the themes of Mary and Martyrs. These two multi-screen video installations are permanently located at the end of the Quire aisles, flanking the High Altar of the cathedral and the American Memorial Chapel. Each work employs an arrangement of multiple plasma screen panels configured in a manner similar to historic altarpieces.\n\nIn summer 2010, St Paul's chose two new works by the British artist Mark Alexander to be hung either side of the nave. Both entitled Red Mannheim, Alexander's large red silkscreens are inspired by the [[Mannheim]] Cathedral altarpiece (1739\u201341), which was damaged by bombing in the Second World War. The original sculpture depicts Christ on the cross, surrounded by a familiar retinue of mourners. Rendered in splendid giltwood, with Christ's wracked body sculpted in relief, and the flourishes of flora and incandescent rays from heaven, this masterpiece of the German Rococo is an object of ravishing beauty and intense piety.\n\nIn March 2010, Flare II, a sculpture by Antony Gormley, was installed in the Geometric Staircase.<ref>{{citation |url=https://medium.com/@carly_hiller/6-unique-staircases-in-the-uk-you-wish-you-could-walk-over-ee4873ee5666 |title=6 Unique Staircases in the UK You Wish You Could Walk Over |website=Medium.com |access-date=24 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728183025/https://medium.com/@carly_hiller/6-unique-staircases-in-the-uk-you-wish-you-could-walk-over-ee4873ee5666 |archive-date=28 July 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Dean and Chapter commissioned Martin Firrell to create a major public artwork to mark the 300th anniversary of the topping-out of Wren's building. The Question Mark Inside consisted of digital text projections to the cathedral dome, West Front and inside onto the Whispering Gallery. The text was based on blog contributions by the general public as well as interviews conducted by the artist and on the artist's own views. The project presented a stream of possible answers to the question: 'What makes life meaningful and purposeful, and what does St Paul's mean in that contemporary context?' The Question Mark Inside opened on 8 November 2008 and ran for eight nights.\n\n=== Depictions of St Paul's ===\nSt Paul's Cathedral has been depicted many times in paintings, prints and drawings.

[[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[cathedral]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], which, as the ''[[cathedra]]'' of the [[Bishop of London]], serves as the [[mother church]] of the [[Diocese of London]]. It sits on [[Ludgate Hill]] at the highest point of the [[City of London]] and is a [[Listed Building|Grade I listed building]]. Its dedication to [[Paul the Apostle]] dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|p=778}} The present cathedral, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the [[English Baroque]] style by [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]]. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the City after the [[Great Fire of London]].{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2004}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The cathedral building largely destroyed in the Great Fire, now often referred to as [[Old St&nbsp;Paul's Cathedral]], was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including [[Paul's walk]] and St&nbsp;Paul's Churchyard being the site of [[St&nbsp;Paul's Cross]].\n\nThe cathedral is one of the most famous and most recognisable sights of London. Its dome, framed by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At {{convert|365|ft}} high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1967. The dome remains among the highest in the world. St Paul's is the [[List of largest church buildings|second-largest church building]] in area in the United Kingdom after [[Liverpool Cathedral]].\n\nServices held at St Paul's have included the funerals of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]], the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]; jubilee celebrations for [[Queen Victoria]]; peace services marking the end of the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]]; the [[wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer]]; the launch of the [[Festival of Britain]]; and the thanksgiving services for the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver]], [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden]] and [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond]] [[Jubilees]] and the 80th and 90th birthdays of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. St Paul's Cathedral is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as of images of the dome surrounded by the smoke and fire of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]].<ref name=\"Pierce\">{{citation |last=Pierce |first=Rebecca |title=National Identity and the British Empire: the Image of Saint Paul's Cathedral |series=Master's Thesis |publisher=Marshall University |year=2004 |url=http://www.marshall.edu/etd/masters/pierce-rebecca-2004-ma.pdf |access-date=12 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111143116/http://www.marshall.edu/etd/masters/pierce-rebecca-2004-ma.pdf |archive-date=11 January 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services.

S\u00e6berht's uncle and overlord, [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|\u00c6thelberht]], king of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], built a church dedicated to St&nbsp;Paul in London, as the seat of the new bishop.{{sfn|Bede|1969|pages=142\u2013143}} It is assumed, although not proved, that this first Anglo-Saxon cathedral stood on the same site as the later medieval and the present cathedrals. <!-- If anyone wants to debate whether the original cathedral stood on another site, perhaps in Lundenwic, please cite verifiable references or discuss on Talk page-->\n\nOn the death of S\u00e6berht in about 616, his pagan sons expelled Mellitus from London, and the East Saxons reverted to paganism. The fate of the first cathedral building is unknown. Christianity was restored among the East Saxons in the late 7th century and it is presumed that either the Anglo-Saxon cathedral was restored or a new building erected as the seat of bishops such as [[Cedd]], [[Wine (bishop)|Wine]] and [[Earconwald]], the last of whom was buried in the cathedral in 693. This building, or a successor, was destroyed by fire in 962, but rebuilt in the same year.{{sfn|Garmonsway|1953}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nKing [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] was buried in the cathedral on his death in 1016; the tomb is now lost. The cathedral was burnt, with much of the city, in a [[Early fires of London|fire in 1087]], as recorded in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.{{sfn|Garmonsway|1953|page=218}}\n\n===Cathedral or Temple before 604 AD?<!--   -->===\n\nThere is evidence for Christianity in London during the Roman period, but no firm evidence for the location of Churches or a Cathedral.  London is said to have sent 2 delegates to the Council of Arles in 314 AD.\n\nA list of the 16 [[archbishops of London|\"archbishops\" of London]] was recorded by [[Jocelyn of Furness]] in the 12th century, claiming London's [[Celtic Christianity|Christian]] community was founded in the 2nd century under the legendary [[Lucius of Britain|King&nbsp;Lucius]] and his missionary saints [[Saint Fagan|Fagan]], [[Saint Deruvian|Deruvian]], Elvanus and Medwin. None of that is considered credible by modern historians but, although the surviving text is problematic, either Bishop [[Restitutus]] or Adelphius at the [[Council of Arles (314)|314 Council of Arles]] seems to have come from [[Londinium]].{{efn|\"Nomina Episcoporum, cum Clericis Suis, Quinam, et ex Quibus Provinciis, ad Arelatensem Synodum Convenerint\" [\"The Names of the Bishops with Their Clerics who Came Together at the Synod of Arles and from which Province They Came\"](from {{harvnb|Labb\u00e9|Cossart|1671|loc=col.&nbsp;1429}} included in {{harvnb|Thackery|1843|pp=272&nbsp;ff.}}).}} \n\nThe location of Londinium's original cathedral is unknown.  But legend and medieval tradition claims it was [[St Peter upon Cornhill]]. St Pauls is an unusual attribution for a Cathedral, and suggests there was another one in the Roman period.  Legends of St Lucius link [[St Peter upon Cornhill] as the centre of the Roman Londiumum christian community. It stands upon the highest point in the area of old Londinium, and it was given pre-eminence in medieval procession on account of the legends.  There is, however, no other reliable evidence and the location of the site on the Forum makes it difficult for it to fit the legendary stories.  In 1995,a large 5th-century building on [[Tower Hill]] was excavated, and has been claimed as a Roman Basilica, possibly a Cathedral, although this is speculative.  {{sfn|Denison|1995}}{{sfn|Sankey|1998|pp=78\u201382}}   \n\nThe [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] antiquarian [[William Camden]] argued that a [[Roman temple|temple]] to the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] had stood during Roman times on the site occupied by the medieval St Paul's Cathedral.{{sfn|Camden |1607|pp=306\u2013307}} Wren reported that he had found no trace of any such temple during the works to build the new cathedral after the Great Fire, and Camden's hypothesis is no longer accepted by modern archaeologists.{{sfn|Clark|1996|pages=1\u20139}}\n\n=== Old St Paul's ===\n{{Main|Old St Paul's Cathedral}}\nThe fourth St Paul's, generally referred to as ''Old St Paul's'', was begun by the [[Normans]] after the 1087 fire. A further fire in 1135 disrupted the work, and the new cathedral was not consecrated until 1240. During the period of construction, the style of architecture had changed from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] to [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and this was reflected in the pointed arches and larger windows of the upper parts and East End of the building. The Gothic ribbed vault was constructed, like that of [[York Minster]], of wood rather than stone, which affected the ultimate fate of the building.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:St Paul's old.

This \"New Work\" was consecrated in 1300 but not complete until 1314. During the later Medieval period St Paul's was exceeded in length only by the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey Church of Cluny]] and in the height of its spire only by [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and [[St. Mary's Church, Stralsund]]. Excavations by [[Francis Penrose]] in 1878 showed that it was {{convert|585|ft|m}} long and {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide (290 feet or 87&nbsp;m across the [[transept]]s and [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]]). The spire was about 489 feet (149&nbsp;m) in height.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nBy the 16th century the building was starting to decay. The [[English Reformation]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], and particularly the [[Chantries Acts]] led to the destruction of elements of the interior ornamentation and the chapels, [[shrine]]s, [[chantry|chantries]]. In October 1538, an image of St Erkenwald, probably from the shrine, was delivered to the master of the king\u2019s jewels. Other images may have survived, at least for a time. More systematic iconoclasm happened in the reign of Edward VI; the ''Grey Friar\u2019s Chronicle'' reports that the rood and other images were destroyed in November 1547, and \"Alle the alteres and chappelles in alle Powlles churche\" were taken down in October 1552.<ref>Stanford E. Lehmberg, ''The Reformation of Cathedrals'' (Princeton UP, 1988), p. 114.</ref> Some of the buildings in St Paul's Churchyard were sold as shops and rental properties, especially to printers and booksellers. In 1561 the spire was destroyed by lightning, an event that [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] writers claimed was a sign of God's judgement on England's Protestant rulers. Bishop James Pilkington preached a sermon in response, claiming that the lightning strike was a judgement for the irreverent use of the cathedral building.<ref>[https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199571765.001.0001/acprof-9780199571765 Mary Morrissey, Politics and the Paul's Cross Sermons, 1558\u20131642 (2011), p. 3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190514142353/https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199571765.001.0001/acprof-9780199571765 |date=14 May 2019 }}.</ref> Immediate steps were taken to repair the damage, and the citizens of London and the clergy offering money to support the rebuilding.<ref>Dugdale, ''History of St Paul's Cathedral'', pp. 133-4.</ref> But the cost of the repairing the building properly was too great for a country and city recovering from a trade depression.

He produced a drawing of the proposed dome which shows his idea that it should span nave and aisles at the crossing.{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=204}} After the Fire, it was at first thought possible to retain a substantial part of the old cathedral, but ultimately the entire structure was demolished in the early 1670s.\n\nIn July 1668 Dean [[William Sancroft]] wrote to Wren that he was charged by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in agreement with the Bishops of London and Oxford, to design a new cathedral that was \"Handsome and noble to all the ends of it and to the reputation of the City and the nation\".{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=223}} The design process took several years, but a design was finally settled and attached to a royal warrant, with the proviso that Wren was permitted to make any further changes that he deemed necessary.

The earliest records of the choir date from 1127. The present choir consist of up to 30 boy choristers, eight probationers and the vicars choral, 12 professional singers. In February 2017 the cathedral announced the appointment of the first female vicar choral, Carris Jones (a mezzo-soprano), to take up the role in September 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/28/st-pauls-cathedral-appoints-first-female-chorister-1000-year/ |title=St Paul's Cathedral appoints first female chorister in 1,000-year history |first=Olivia |last=Rudgard |date=28 February 2017 |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=13 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019233818/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/28/st-pauls-cathedral-appoints-first-female-chorister-1000-year/ |archive-date=19 October 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-39120557 |title=St Paul's Cathedral admits first woman to choir |date=28 February 2017 |website=BBC News |accessdate=13 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516062307/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-39120557 |archive-date=16 May 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/01/st-pauls-appoints-first-full-time-female-chorister-in-1000-year-history |title=St Paul's appoints first full-time female chorister in 1,000-year history |first=Tess |last=de la Ware |date=1 March 2017 |website=The Guardian |accessdate=13 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425111157/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/01/st-pauls-appoints-first-full-time-female-chorister-in-1000-year-history |archive-date=25 April 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring school terms the choir sings at Evensong six times per week, the service on Mondays being sung by a visiting choir (or occasionally said) and that on Thursdays being sung by the vicars choral alone.

He had to create a fitting cathedral to replace ''Old St Paul's'', as a place of worship and as a landmark within the City of London. He had to satisfy the requirements of the church and the tastes of a royal patron, as well as respecting the essentially medieval tradition of English church building which developed to accommodate the liturgy. Wren was familiar with contemporary Renaissance and Baroque trends in Italian architecture and had visited France, where he studied the work of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mansart]].\n\nWren's design developed through five general stages. The first survives only as a single drawing and part of a model. The scheme (usually called the ''First Model Design'') appears to have consisted of a circular domed vestibule (possibly based on the [[Pantheon in Rome]]) and a rectangular church of [[basilica]] form. The plan may have been influenced by the [[Temple Church]]. It was rejected because it was not thought \"stately enough\".{{sfn|Campbell|2007|pp=27\u201328}} Wren's second design was a Greek cross,<ref>\"The City Churches\" Tabor, M. p108:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917</ref> which was thought by the clerics not to fulfil the requirements of Anglican liturgy.{{sfn|Downes|1987|pp=11\u201334}}\n\nWren's third design is embodied in the \"Great Model\" of 1673. The model, made of oak and plaster, cost over \u00a3500 (approximately \u00a332,000 today) and is over {{convert|13|ft|m|0}} tall and {{convert|21|ft|m|0}} long.{{sfn|Saunders|2001|p=60}} This design retained the form of the Greek-Cross design but extended it with a nave. His critics, members of a committee commissioned to rebuild the church, and clergy decried the design as too dissimilar to other English churches to suggest any continuity within the Church of England. Another problem was that the entire design would have to be completed all at once because of the eight central piers that supported the dome, instead of being completed in stages and opened for use before construction finished, as was customary. The Great Model was Wren's favourite design; he thought it a reflection of [[Renaissance]] beauty.{{sfn|Hart|1995|pp=17\u201323}} After the Great Model, Wren resolved not to make further models and not to expose his drawings publicly, which he found did nothing but \"lose time, and subject [his] business many times, to incompetent judges\".{{sfn|Downes|1987|pp=11\u201334}} The Great Model survives and is housed within the Cathedral itself.\n\nWren's fourth design is known as the ''Warrant design'' because it received a Royal warrant for the rebuilding. In this design Wren sought to reconcile Gothic, the predominant style of English churches, to a \"better manner of architecture\". It has the longitudinal Latin Cross plan of a medieval cathedral. It is of {{frac|1|1|2}} storeys and has classical porticos at the west and transept ends, influenced by Inigo Jones\u2019s addition to Old St Paul's.{{sfn|Downes|1987|pp=11\u201334}} It is roofed at the crossing by a wide shallow dome supporting a drum with a second cupola, from which rises a spire of seven diminishing stages. Vaughan Hart has suggested that influence in the design of the spire may have been drawn from the oriental [[pagoda]]. Not used at St Paul's, the concept was applied in the spire of [[St Bride's, Fleet Street]].{{sfn|Hart|2002}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} This plan was rotated slightly on its site so that it aligned, not with true east, but with sunrise on Easter of the year construction began. This small change in configuration was informed by Wren's knowledge of astronomy.{{sfn|Lang|1956|pp=47\u201363}}\n{{multiple image\n|align     = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|header_align = center\n|header    =\n|image1    = St Paul's - the Greek Cross design.jpg\n|width1    = 225\n|alt1      =\n|caption1  = The Greek Cross Design\n|image2    = St Paul's - the warrant design.jpg\n|width2    = 222\n|alt2      =\n|caption2  = The Warrant Design\n|image3    =St Paul's - the final design.jpg\n|width3    = 230\n|alt3      =\n|caption3  = St Paul's, as it was built\n }}\n\n=== Final design ===\nThe final design as built differs substantially from the official Warrant design.{{sfn|Barker|Hyde|1982}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Wren received permission from the king to make \"ornamental changes\" to the submitted design, and Wren took great advantage of this. Many of these changes were made over the course of the thirty years as the church was constructed, and the most significant was to the dome: \"He raised another structure over the first cupola, a cone of brick, so as to support a stone lantern of an elegant figure&nbsp;... And he covered and hid out of sight the brick cone with another cupola of timber and lead; and between this and the cone are easy stairs that ascend to the lantern\" (Christopher Wren, son of Sir Christopher Wren). The final design was strongly rooted in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. The saucer domes over the nave were inspired by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart's [[Church of the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce]], which Wren had seen during a trip to Paris in 1665.{{sfn|Hart|1995|pp=17\u201323}}\n\nThe date of the laying of the first stone of the cathedral is disputed. One contemporary account says it was 21 June 1675, another 25 June and a third on 28 June. There is, however, general agreement that it was laid in June 1675. Edward Strong later claimed it was laid by his elder brother, Thomas Strong, one of the two master stonemasons appointed by Wren at the beginning of the work.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|pp=53\u201354}}\n{{Clear}}<!-- This break improves format on some wide screens. -->\n\n=== Structural engineering ===\n{{multiple image\n|align     = left\n|direction = horizontal\n|header_align =\n|header    =\n|image1    = St Paul's Engraving by Samuel Wale and John Gwynn (1755)..gif\n|width1    = 200\n|alt1      =\n|caption1  =Cross-section showing the brick cone between the inner and outer domes\n|image2    = Dickinson St Paul's.jpg\n|width2    = 170\n|alt2      =\n|caption2  = William Dickinson's plan for the floor paving (1709\u20131710)\n}}\n\nWren's challenge was to construct a large cathedral on the relatively weak clay soil of London. St Paul's is unusual among cathedrals in that there is a crypt, the largest in Europe, under the entire building rather than just under the eastern end.{{sfn|Harris|1988|pp=214\u201315}}  The crypt serves a structural purpose. Although it is extensive, half the space of the crypt is taken up by massive piers which spread the weight of the much slimmer piers of the church above. While the towers and domes of most cathedrals are supported on four piers, Wren designed the dome of St Paul's to be supported on eight, achieving a broader distribution of weight at the level of the foundations.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}}  The foundations settled as the building progressed, and Wren made structural changes in response.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|p=56\u201359}}\n\nOne of the design problems that confronted Wren was to create a landmark dome, tall enough to visually replace the lost tower of St Paul's, while at the same time appearing visually satisfying when viewed from inside the building. Wren planned a double-shelled dome, as at St Peter's Basilica.{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=228}}  His solution to the visual problem was to separate the heights of the inner and outer dome to a much greater extent than had been done by [[Michelangelo]] at St Peter's, drafting both as [[catenary]] curves, rather than as hemispheres. Between the inner and outer domes, Wren inserted a brick cone which supports both the timbers of the outer, lead-covered dome and the weight of the ornate stone lantern that rises above it. Both the cone and the inner dome are 18 inches thick and are supported by wrought iron chains at intervals in the brick cone and around the cornice of the peristyle of the inner dome to prevent spreading and cracking.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}}{{sfn|Campbell|2007|p=137}}\n\nThe Warrant Design showed external buttresses on the ground floor level. These were not a classical feature and were one of the first elements Wren changed. Instead he made the walls of the cathedral particularly thick to avoid the need for external buttresses altogether. The clerestory and vault are reinforced with flying buttresses, which were added at a relatively late stage in the design to give extra strength.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|pp=105\u2013114}} These are concealed behind the screen wall of the upper story, which was added to keep the building's classical style intact, to add sufficient visual mass to balance the appearance of the dome and which, by its weight, counters the thrust of the buttresses on the lower walls.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}}{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=228}}\n\n=== Designers, builders and craftsmen ===\nDuring the extensive period of design and rationalisation Wren employed from 1684 [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] as his principal assistant.{{sfn|Hart|2002}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Between 1696 and 1711 [[William Dickinson (architect)|William Dickinson]] was measuring clerk.{{sfn|Tinniswood|2010|p=203}} Joshua Marshall (until his early death in 1678) and Thomas and his brother Edward Strong were master masons, the latter two working on the construction for its entirety.

It has much emphasis on its facade, which has been designed to define rather than conceal the form of the building behind it. In plan, the towers jut beyond the width of the aisles as they do at [[Wells Cathedral]]. Wren's uncle [[Matthew Wren]] was the [[Bishop of Ely]], and, having worked for his uncle, Wren was familiar with the unique octagonal lantern tower over the crossing of [[Ely Cathedral]], which spans the aisles as well as the central nave, unlike the central towers and domes of most churches. Wren adapted this characteristic in designing the dome of St Paul's.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}} In section St Paul's also maintains a medieval form, having the aisles much lower than the nave, and a defined clerestory.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe most notable exterior feature is the dome, which rises {{convert|365|ft|m}} to the cross at its summit,{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=912}} and dominates views of the City. The height of 365 feet is explained by Wren's interest in astronomy. Until the late 20th century St Paul's was the tallest building on the City skyline, designed  to be seen surrounded by the delicate spires of Wren's other city churches. The dome is described by Sir [[Sir Banister Fletcher|Banister Fletcher]] as \"probably the finest in Europe\", by [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] as \"majestic\", and by Sir [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as \"one of the most perfect in the world\". Sir [[John Summerson]] said that Englishmen and \"even some foreigners\" consider it to be without equal.<ref>{{harvnb|Fletcher|1962|p=913}}; {{harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2004|pp=604\u201305}};{{harvnb|Pevsner|1964|pp=324\u201326}}; {{harvnb|Summerson|1983|p=236}}.</ref>\n\n==== Dome ====\n[[File:St Paul's Cathedral Dome from One New Change - Square Crop.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.13|The dome]]\n\nWren drew inspiration from Michelangelo's dome of St Peter's Basilica, and that of Mansart's Church of the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, which he had visited.{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=236}} Unlike those of St Peter's and Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, the dome of St Paul's rises in two clearly defined storeys of masonry, which, together with a lower unadorned footing, equal a height of about 95 feet. From the time of the ''Greek Cross Design'' it is clear that Wren favoured a continuous colonnade (''[[peristyle]]'') around the drum of the dome, rather than the arrangement of alternating windows and projecting columns that Michelangelo had used and which had also been employed by Mansart.{{sfn|Pevsner|1964|pp=324\u201326}} Summerson suggests that he was influenced by Bramante's \"Tempietto\" in the courtyard of [[San Pietro in Montorio]].{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=234}} In the finished structure, Wren creates a diversity and appearance of strength by placing niches between the columns in every fourth opening.{{sfn|Summerson|1983|p=234}}  The peristyle serves to buttress both the inner dome and the brick cone which rises internally to support the lantern.\n\nAbove the peristyle rises the second stage surrounded by a balustraded balcony called the \"Stone Gallery\". This attic stage is ornamented with alternating pilasters and rectangular windows which are set just below the cornice, creating a sense of lightness. Above this attic rises the dome, covered with lead, and ribbed in accordance with the spacing of the pilasters. It is pierced by eight light wells just below the lantern, but these are barely visible. They allow light to penetrate through openings in the brick cone, which illuminates the interior apex of this shell, partly visible from within the cathedral through the ocular opening of the lower dome.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}}\n\nThe lantern, like the visible masonry of the dome, rises in stages. The most unusual characteristic of this structure is that it is of square plan, rather than circular or octagonal. The tallest stage takes the form of a ''tempietto'' with four columned porticos facing the cardinal points. Its lowest level is surrounded by the \"Golden Gallery\" and its upper level supports a small dome from which rises a cross on a golden ball.  The total weight of the lantern is about 850 tons.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=913}}\n\n==== West front ====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--first three paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:St Pauls Cathedral West Front.jpg|thumb|St Pauls Cathedral West Front Dome Street View]]\n[[File:St Pauls Cathedral from West adj.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|West Front]]\nFor the Renaissance architect designing the west front of a large church or cathedral, the universal problem was how to use a facade to unite the high central nave with the lower aisles in a visually harmonious whole. Since [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s additions to [[Santa Maria Novella]] in Florence, this was usually achieved by the simple expedient of linking the sides to the centre with large brackets. This is the solution that Wren saw employed by Mansart at Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce. Another feature employed by Mansart was a boldly projecting Classical portico with paired columns. Wren faced the additional challenge of incorporating towers into the design, as had been planned at St Peter's Basilica. At St Peter's, [[Carlo Maderno]] had solved this problem by constructing a [[narthex]] and stretching a huge screen facade across it, differentiated at the centre by a pediment. The towers at St Peter's were not built above the parapet.\n\nWren's solution was to employ a Classical portico, as at Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, but rising through two storeys, and supported on paired columns. The remarkable feature here is that the lower story of this portico extends to the full width of the aisles, while the upper section defines the nave that lies behind it. The gaps between the upper stage of the portico and the towers on either side are bridged by a narrow section of wall with an arch-topped window.\n\nThe towers stand outside the width of the aisles, but screen two chapels located immediately behind them. The lower parts of the towers continue the theme of the outer walls, but are differentiated from them in order to create an appearance of strength. The windows of the lower story are smaller than those of the side walls and are deeply recessed, a visual indication of the thickness of the wall. The paired pilasters at each corner project boldly.\n\nAbove the main [[cornice]], which unites the towers with the portico and the outer walls, the details are boldly scaled, in order to read well from the street below and from a distance. The towers rise above the cornice from a square block plinth which is plain apart from large oculi, that on the south being filled by the clock, while that on the north is void. The towers are composed of two complementary elements, a central cylinder rising through the tiers in a series of stacked drums, and paired [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]] at the corners, with [[buttress]]es above them, which serve to unify the drum shape with the square plinth on which it stands. The entablature above the columns breaks forward over them to express both elements, tying them together in a single horizontal band. The cap, an ogee-shaped dome, supports a gilded pineapple-shaped finial.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stpauls.co.uk/history-collections/the-collections/architectural-archive/wren-office-drawings/6-the-western-towers-c16851710 |title=6.

Wren was inspired in the design by studying engravings of [[Pietro da Cortona]]'s Baroque facade of [[Santa Maria della Pace]] in Rome.{{sfn|Leapman|1995}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} These projecting arcs echo the shape of the apse at the eastern end of the building.\n\n==== Walls ====\n[[File:St Paul's Cathedral, London, England - Jan 2010 edit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|St Paul's from the south-east, with the tower of the destroyed Church of [[St Augustine Watling Street|St Augustine, Watling Street]] to the right, now part of [[St Paul's Cathedral School]].]]\nThe building is of two storeys of ashlar masonry, above a basement, and surrounded by a balustrade above the upper cornice. The balustrade was added, against Wren's wishes, in 1718.{{sfn|Leapman|1995}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The internal bays are marked externally by paired pilasters with Corinthian capitals at the lower level and Composite at the upper level. Where the building behind is of only one story (at the aisles of both nave and choir) the upper story of the exterior wall is sham.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=913}} It serves a dual purpose of supporting the buttresses of the vault, and providing a satisfying appearance when viewed rising above buildings of the height of the 17th-century city. This appearance may still be seen from across the [[River Thames]].\n\nBetween the pilasters on both levels are windows. Those of the lower storey have semi-circular heads and are surrounded by continuous mouldings of a Roman style, rising to decorative keystones. Beneath each window is a floral swag by Grinling Gibbons, constituting the finest stone carving on the building and some of the greatest architectural sculpture in England. A frieze with similar swags runs in a band below the cornice, tying the arches of the windows and the capitals. The upper windows are of a restrained Classical form, with pediments set on columns, but are blind and contain niches. Beneath these niches, and in the basement level, are small windows with segmental tops, the glazing of which catches the light and visually links them to the large windows of the aisles. The height from ground level to the top of the parapet is approximately 110 feet.\n\n==== Fencing ====\n\nThe original fencing, designed by Wren, was dismantled in the 1870s. The [[John George Howard|surveyor for the government of Toronto]] had it shipped to Toronto, where it has since adorned [[High Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.highparknature.org/wiki/wiki.php?n=History.FenceStory|title=The Story of a Fence}}</ref>\n\n=== Interior ===\n{{multiple image\n|align     = left\n|direction = horizontal\n|header_align =\n|header    =\n|image1    = St Paul's Cathedral Nave, London, UK - Diliff.jpg\n|width1    = 266\n|alt1      =\n|caption1  = The nave, looking towards the choir\n|image2    = St Paul's Cathedral Choir looking west, London, UK - Diliff.jpg\n|width2    = 200\n|alt2      =\n|caption2  = The choir, looking towards the nave\n}}\n\nInternally, St Paul's has a nave and choir in each of its three bays. The entrance from the west portico is through a square domed narthex, flanked by chapels: the Chapel of St Dunstan to the north and the Chapel of the Order of St Michael and St George to the south.{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}} The nave is {{convert|91|ft|m}} in height and is separated from the aisles by an arcade of piers with attached Corinthian pilasters rising to an entablature. The bays, and therefore the vault compartments, are rectangular, but Wren roofed these spaces with saucer-shaped domes and surrounded the [[clerestory]] windows with [[lunettes]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}} The vaults of the choir are decorated with mosaics by Sir [[William Blake Richmond]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1962|p=906}}  The dome and the apse of the choir are all approached through wide arches with coffered vaults which contrast with the smooth surface of the domes and punctuate the division between the main spaces. The transepts extend to the north and south of the dome and are called (in this instance) the North Choir and the South Choir.\n\nThe [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] holds the stalls for the clergy, cathedral officers and the choir, and the organ. These wooden fittings, including the pulpit and Bishop's throne, were designed in Wren's office and built by joiners.

The dome is supported on pendentives rising between eight arches spanning the nave, choir, transepts, and aisles. The eight piers that carry them are not evenly spaced.

It is reached by 259 steps from ground level.\n\nThe dome is raised on a tall drum surrounded by pilasters and pierced with windows in groups of three, separated by eight gilded niches containing statues, and repeating the pattern of the peristyle on the exterior. the dome rises above a gilded cornice at {{convert|173|ft|m}} to a height of {{convert|214|ft|m}}.

Each sculpture is also embellished with miniaturised destroyed residential blocks depicting war zones in the Middle East\u2014Syria, Baghdad, Afghanistan\u2014thus connecting 100 years of warfare.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.stpauls.co.uk/News-Press/Latest-News/Giant-white-crosses-remind-St-Pauls-worshippers-and-visitors-of-the-horrors-of-warfare |title=Giant white crosses remind St Paul's worshippers and visitors of the horrors of warfare |website=Stpauls.co.uk |accessdate=18 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034229/https://www.stpauls.co.uk/news-press/latest-news/giant-white-crosses-remind-st-pauls-worshippers-and-visitors-of-the-horrors-of-warfare |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Bill Viola]] has created two altarpieces for permanent display in St Paul's Cathedral. The project commenced production in mid-2009. Following the extensive programme of cleaning and repair of the interior of St Paul's, completed in 2005, Viola was commissioned to create two altarpieces on the themes of Mary and Martyrs. These two multi-screen video installations are permanently located at the end of the Quire aisles, flanking the High Altar of the cathedral and the American Memorial Chapel. Each work employs an arrangement of multiple plasma screen panels configured in a manner similar to historic altarpieces.\n\nIn summer 2010, St Paul's chose two new works by the British artist Mark Alexander to be hung either side of the nave. Both entitled Red Mannheim, Alexander's large red silkscreens are inspired by the [[Mannheim]] Cathedral altarpiece (1739\u201341), which was damaged by bombing in the Second World War. The original sculpture depicts Christ on the cross, surrounded by a familiar retinue of mourners. Rendered in splendid giltwood, with Christ's wracked body sculpted in relief, and the flourishes of flora and incandescent rays from heaven, this masterpiece of the German Rococo is an object of ravishing beauty and intense piety.\n\nIn March 2010, Flare II, a sculpture by Antony Gormley, was installed in the Geometric Staircase.<ref>{{citation |url=https://medium.com/@carly_hiller/6-unique-staircases-in-the-uk-you-wish-you-could-walk-over-ee4873ee5666 |title=6 Unique Staircases in the UK You Wish You Could Walk Over |website=Medium.com |access-date=24 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728183025/https://medium.com/@carly_hiller/6-unique-staircases-in-the-uk-you-wish-you-could-walk-over-ee4873ee5666 |archive-date=28 July 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Dean and Chapter commissioned Martin Firrell to create a major public artwork to mark the 300th anniversary of the topping-out of Wren's building. The Question Mark Inside consisted of digital text projections to the cathedral dome, West Front and inside onto the Whispering Gallery. The text was based on blog contributions by the general public as well as interviews conducted by the artist and on the artist's own views. The project presented a stream of possible answers to the question: 'What makes life meaningful and purposeful, and what does St Paul's mean in that contemporary context?' The Question Mark Inside opened on 8 November 2008 and ran for eight nights.\n\n=== Depictions of St Paul's ===\nSt Paul's Cathedral has been depicted many times in paintings, prints and drawings.
