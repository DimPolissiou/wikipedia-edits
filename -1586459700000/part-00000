In 1889 (the centennial of the French Revolution), the [[Second International]] was founded, with 384 delegates from twenty countries representing about 300 labour and socialist organisations.<ref>[http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/secondinternational.html ''The Second (Socialist) International 1889\u20131923'']. Retrieved 12 July 2007.</ref> It was termed the Socialist International and Engels was elected honorary president at the third congress in 1893. Anarchists were banned, mainly due to pressure from Marxists.<ref name=\"Anarchism 1962 pp. 263\">[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962). pp. 263\u201364</ref> It has been argued that at some point the Second International turned \"into a battleground over the issue of [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] versus [[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian]] socialism. Not only did they effectively present themselves as champions of minority rights; they also provoked the German Marxists into demonstrating a dictatorial intolerance which was a factor in preventing the British labour movement from following the Marxist direction indicated by such leaders as [[H. M. Hyndman]]\".<ref name=\"Anarchism 1962 pp. 263\"/>\n\nReformism arose as an alternative to revolution. [[Eduard Bernstein]] was a leading [[social democrat]] in Germany who proposed the concept of [[evolutionary socialism]]. Revolutionary socialists quickly targeted reformism: [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Social Reform or Revolution]]?'' [[Revolutionary socialism]] encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define \"revolution\" differently. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections, it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels emphasised the ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning, as a first step, the \"battle of democracy\".<ref>Marx, Engels, ''Communist Manifesto'', Selected Works, p. 52</ref>\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n{{main|Biennio Rosso|German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|Russian Revolution|Spanish Revolution of 1936|World communism}}\n[[File:Gramsci.png|thumb|upright|[[Antonio Gramsci]], member of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] and later leader and theorist of the [[Communist Party of Italy]]]]\nIn Argentina, the [[Socialist Party of Argentina]] was established in the 1890s led by [[Juan B.

In April of that year, [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|socialists in Russia]] and known for his [[Leninism|profound and controversial expansions]] of [[Marxism]], was allowed to cross Germany to return from exile in Switzerland.\n\nLenin had published [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|essays]] on his analysis of [[Leninism#Imperialism|imperialism]], the monopoly and [[globalisation]] phase of capitalism, as well as analyses on social conditions. He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working to pay their expenses. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in [[Petrograd]], Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers' [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s to take full authority. He issued a [[April Thesis|thesis]] outlining the Bolshevik programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be administered through the soviets. The Bolsheviks became the most influential force. On 7 November, the [[Winter Palace|capitol of the provisional government]] was stormed by [[Red Guards (Russia)|Bolshevik Red Guards]] in what afterwards became known as the [[Great October Socialist Revolution]]. The provisional government ended and the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]]\u2014the world's first constitutionally socialist state\u2014was established.

Its goal is to achieve a peaceful world where these basic values can be enhanced and where each individual can live a meaningful life with the full development of his or her personality and talents, and with the guarantee of human and civil rights in a democratic framework of society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html|url-status=dead|title=Socialist International \u2013 Progressive Politics for a Fairer World|archive-date=22 February 2008}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 1990s, the British Labour Party under [[Tony Blair]] enacted policies based on the free market economy to deliver public services via the [[private finance initiative]]. Influential in these policies was the idea of a \"[[Third Way]]\" which called for a re-evaluation of welfare state policies.<ref>Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 3\u20134, 16.</ref> In 1995, the Labour Party re-defined its stance on socialism by re-wording [[Clause IV]] of its constitution, effectively rejecting socialism by removing all references to public, direct worker or municipal ownership of the means of production. The Labour Party stated: \"The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that, by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create, for each of us, the means to realise our true potential, and, for all of us, a community in which power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |title=Labour Party Clause Four |publisher=Labour.org.uk |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081023/http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |archivedate=11 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary socialist politics ==\n[[File:1989 CPA 6101.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first [[president of Ghana]] and theorist of [[African socialism]], on a [[Soviet Union]] commemorative postage stamp]]\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{main|African socialism}}\nAfrican socialism has been and continues to be a major ideology around the continent.

Essentially he believed Africans were already socialists. Other African socialists include [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. [[Fela Kuti]] was inspired by socialism and called for a democratic African republic. In South Africa the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) abandoned its partial socialist allegiances after taking power and followed a standard neoliberal route. From 2005 through to 2007, the country was wracked by many thousands of protests from poor communities. One of these gave rise to a mass movement of shack dwellers, [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] that despite major police suppression continues to work for popular people's planning and against the creation of a market economy in land and housing.\n\n=== Asia ===\n{{main|Arab socialism|History of the People's Republic of China|Socialist market economy|Socialist-oriented market economy}}\nIn Asia, states with socialist economies\u2014such as the People's Republic of China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam\u2014have largely moved away from centralised economic planning in the 21st century, placing a greater emphasis on markets.

Typically it refers to a form of technocratic management, whereby technical specialists administer or manage economic enterprises on behalf of society (and the public interest) instead of workers' councils or workplace democracy.\n\nA state-directed economy may refer to a type of mixed economy consisting of public ownership over large industries, as promoted by various Social democratic political parties during the 20th century. This ideology influenced the policies of the British Labour Party during Clement Attlee's administration. In the biography of the 1945 United Kingdom Labour Party Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]], [[Francis Beckett]] states: \"[T]he government... wanted what would become known as a mixed economy\".<ref>Beckett, Francis, ''Clem Attlee'', (2007) Politico's.</ref>\n\nNationalisation in the United Kingdom was achieved through compulsory purchase of the industry (i.e. with compensation).

It is a system that uses the market and [[Price system|monetary prices]] for the allocation and accounting of the [[means of production]], thereby retaining the process of [[capital accumulation]]. The profit generated would be used to directly remunerate employees, collectively sustain the enterprise or finance public institutions.<ref>''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. p. 142: \"It is an economic system that combines social ownership of capital with market allocation of capital...The state owns the means of production, and returns accrue to society at large.\"</ref> In state-oriented forms of market socialism, in which state enterprises attempt to maximise profit, the profits can be used to fund government programs and services through a [[social dividend]], eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems. [[Neoclassical economist]] [[L\u00e9on Walras]] believed that a socialist economy based on state ownership of land and natural resources would provide a means of public finance to make income taxes unnecessary.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bockman |first=Johanna |title=Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3 |page=21 |quote=For Walras, socialism would provide the necessary institutions for free competition and social justice. Socialism, in Walras's view, entailed state ownership of land and natural resources and the abolition of income taxes. As owner of land and natural resources, the state could then lease these resources to many individuals and groups, which would eliminate monopolies and thus enable free competition. The leasing of land and natural resources would also provide enough state revenue to make income taxes unnecessary, allowing a worker to invest his savings and become 'an owner or capitalist at the same time that he remains a worker.}}</ref> Yugoslavia implemented a market socialist economy based on cooperatives and worker self-management.\n\n[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], main theorist of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and influential French socialist thinker]]\n[[Mutualism (economy)|Mutualism]] is an [[Economics|economic theory]] and [[anarchist school of thought]] that advocates a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labour in the [[free market]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutualist.org/ |title=Introduction |publisher=Mutualist.org |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.

Some democratic socialists support [[social democracy]] as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences.\n\nThe major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a [[welfare state]] and unemployment insurance as a means to \"humanise\" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to \"humanise\" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |year=2006 |url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance.

De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural.

Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into camps headed by Marx and Bakunin.<ref>\"It is unnecessary to repeat the accounts of the Geneva and Hague Congresses of the International in which the issues between Marx and Bakunin were fought out and the organisation itself split apart into the dying Marxist rump centered around the New York General Council and the anti-authoritarian majority centred around the Bakuninist Jura Federation.

''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962). p. 243.</ref> The clearest differences between the groups emerged over their proposed strategies for achieving their visions. The First International became the first major international forum for the promulgation of socialist ideas.\n\nBakunin's followers were called [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] and sought to collectivise ownership of the means of production while retaining payment proportional to the amount and kind of labour of each individual. Like Proudhonists, they asserted the right of each individual to the product of his labour and to be remunerated for his particular contribution to production. By contrast, [[anarcho-communists]] sought collective ownership of both the means and the products of labour. [[Errico Malatesta]] put it: \"[I]nstead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common. In this way each will give to society all that his strength permits until enough is produced for every one; and each will take all that he needs, limiting his needs only in those things of which there is not yet plenty for every one\".<ref name=\"dwardmac.pitzer.edu\">{{cite web |title=A Talk About Anarchist Communism Between Two Workers |author=Errico Malatesta |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_Archives/malatesta/MalatestaATAC.html |website=Anarchy Archives |accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref> Anarcho-communism as a coherent economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the First International by Malatesta, [[Carlo Cafiero]], [[Emilio Covelli]], [[Andrea Costa]] and other ex-[[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzinian]] republicans.<ref name=\"Nunzio Pernicious pp. 111-113\">Nunzio Pernicone, \"Italian Anarchism 1864\u20131892\", pp. 111\u201313, AK Press 2009.</ref> Out of respect for Bakunin, they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after his death.<ref name=\"marxists.org\">James Guillaume, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/bakunin.htm \"Michael Bakunin \u2013 A Biographical Sketch\"]</ref>\n\n[[Syndicalism]] emerged in France inspired in part by Proudhon and later by Pelloutier and [[Georges Sorel]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551569/socialism \"Socialism\"] at ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]''</ref> It developed at the end of the 19th century out of the French trade-union movement (''syndicat'' is the French word for trade union).

In 1889 (the centennial of the French Revolution), the [[Second International]] was founded, with 384 delegates from twenty countries representing about 300 labour and socialist organisations.<ref>[http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/secondinternational.html ''The Second (Socialist) International 1889\u20131923''].

[[Revolutionary socialism]] encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define \"revolution\" differently. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections, it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels.

Workers, soldiers and peasants established [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] (councils), the monarchy fell and a [[Provisional Government of Russia, 1917|provisional government]] convened pending the election of a [[constituent assembly]]. In April of that year, [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|socialists in Russia]] and known for his [[Leninism|profound and controversial expansions]] of [[Marxism]], was allowed to cross Germany to return from exile in Switzerland.\n\nLenin had published [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|essays]] on his analysis of [[Leninism#Imperialism|imperialism]], the monopoly and [[globalisation]] phase of capitalism, as well as analyses on social conditions. He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working to pay their expenses. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in [[Petrograd]], Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers' [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s to take full authority. He issued a [[April Thesis|thesis]] outlining the Bolshevik programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be administered through the soviets. The Bolsheviks became the most influential force. On 7 November, the [[Winter Palace|capitol of the provisional government]] was stormed by [[Red Guards (Russia)|Bolshevik Red Guards]] in what afterwards became known as the [[Great October Socialist Revolution]]. The provisional government ended and the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]]\u2014the world's first constitutionally socialist state\u2014was established.

By the 1980s, with the rise of conservative neoliberal politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States, [[Margaret Thatcher]] in Britain, [[Brian Mulroney]] in Canada and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile, the Western [[welfare state]] was attacked from within, but state support for the corporate sector was maintained.<ref>Gary Teeple (2000).

In the United Kingdom, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Neil Kinnock]] made a public attack against the [[Entryism|entryist]] group [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] at the 1985 Labour Party conference. The Labour Party ruled that Militant was ineligible for affiliation with the Labour Party, and the party gradually expelled Militant supporters. The Kinnock leadership had refused to support the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u20131985 miner's strike]] over pit closures, a decision that the party's left wing and the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] blamed for the strike's eventual defeat. In 1989 at Stockholm, the 18th Congress of the Socialist International adopted a new Declaration of Principles, saying: <blockquote>Democratic socialism is an international movement for freedom, social justice, and solidarity. Its goal is to achieve a peaceful world where these basic values can be enhanced and where each individual can live a meaningful life with the full development of his or her personality and talents, and with the guarantee of human and civil rights in a democratic framework of society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html|url-status=dead|title=Socialist International \u2013 Progressive Politics for a Fairer World|archive-date=22 February 2008}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 1990s, the British Labour Party under [[Tony Blair]] enacted policies based on the free market economy to deliver public services via the [[private finance initiative]]. Influential in these policies was the idea of a \"[[Third Way]]\" which called for a re-evaluation of welfare state policies.<ref>Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 3\u20134, 16.</ref> In 1995, the Labour Party re-defined its stance on socialism by re-wording [[Clause IV]] of its constitution, effectively rejecting socialism by removing all references to public, direct worker or municipal ownership of the means of production. The Labour Party stated: \"The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that, by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create, for each of us, the means to realise our true potential, and, for all of us, a community in which power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |title=Labour Party Clause Four |publisher=Labour.org.uk |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081023/http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |archivedate=11 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary socialist politics ==\n[[File:1989 CPA 6101.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first [[president of Ghana]] and theorist of [[African socialism]], on a [[Soviet Union]] commemorative postage stamp]]\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{main|African socialism}}\nAfrican socialism has been and continues to be a major ideology around the continent.

Essentially he believed Africans were already socialists. Other African socialists include [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. [[Fela Kuti]] was inspired by socialism and called for a democratic African republic. In South Africa the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) abandoned its partial socialist allegiances after taking power and followed a standard neoliberal route. From 2005 through to 2007, the country was wracked by many thousands of protests from poor communities. One of these gave rise to a mass movement of shack dwellers, [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] that despite major police suppression continues to work for popular people's planning and against the creation of a market economy in land and housing.\n\n=== Asia ===\n{{main|Arab socialism|History of the People's Republic of China|Socialist market economy|Socialist-oriented market economy}}\nIn Asia, states with socialist economies\u2014such as the People's Republic of China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam\u2014have largely moved away from centralised economic planning in the 21st century, placing a greater emphasis on markets.

The policies/goals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm, who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals.<ref name=\"The Political Economy of Socialism, 1982. p. 197\">{{Cite book|last=Horvat|first=Branko|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=https://books.google.com/books?id=09N8GQAACAAJ|page=197}}|title=The Political Economy of Socialism: A Marxist Social Theory|date=1983|publisher=M.E.

I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilised in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child.

In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a [[Soviet-type economic planning|planning agency]].

Typically it refers to a form of technocratic management, whereby technical specialists administer or manage economic enterprises on behalf of society (and the public interest) instead of workers' councils or workplace democracy.\n\nA state-directed economy may refer to a type of mixed economy consisting of public ownership over large industries, as promoted by various Social democratic political parties during the 20th century.

Some democratic socialists support [[social democracy]] as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences.\n\nThe major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a [[welfare state]] and unemployment insurance as a means to \"humanise\" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to \"humanise\" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |year=2006 |url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labour movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanised, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labour discipline breaks down; etc.)\"</ref>\n\nDemocratic socialism generally refers to any political movement that seeks to establish an economy based on [[economic democracy]] by and for the working class. Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, [[Reformism|reformist]] or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one.<ref>This definition is captured in this statement by [[Anthony Crosland]], who \"argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the [[Marxist]]s, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant\". {{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Pierson |title=Lost property: What the Third Way lacks |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201363 |doi=10.1080/13569310500097265}} Other texts which use the terms \"democratic socialism\" in this way include Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'' (St Martin's Press 1989).</ref>\n\n{{quotation|You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums.

Blanquism did not count on the [[direct action]] of the working class. It, therefore, did not need to organise the people for the revolution. The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup.

Bookchin's first book, ''[[Our Synthetic Environment]],'' was published under the pseudonym Lewis Herber in 1962, a few months before [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/bio1.html |title=''A Short Biography of Murray Bookchin'' by Janet Biehl |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> His groundbreaking essay \"Ecology and Revolutionary Thought\" introduced ecology as a concept in radical politics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/ecologyandrev.html |title=Ecology and Revolution |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=16 June 2004 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> In the 1970s, [[Barry Commoner]], suggesting a left-wing response to the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'' model that predicted catastrophic [[resource depletion]] and spurred environmentalism, postulated that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for [[environmental degradation]] as opposed to [[Human overpopulation|population pressures]].<ref name=Commoner>Commoner, B., ''The Closing Circle'', 1972</ref> The 1990s saw the [[Socialist feminism|socialist feminists]] Mary Mellor<ref name=Mellor>Mellor, M., ''Breaking the Boundaries: Towards a Feminist, Green Socialism'', 1992</ref> and [[Ariel Salleh]]<ref name=Salleh>Saller, A., ''Ecofeminism as Politics: Nature, Marx and the Postmodern'', 1997</ref> address environmental issues within an eco-socialist paradigm. With the rising profile of the [[anti-globalisation]] movement in the [[Global South]], an \"environmentalism of the poor\" combining ecological awareness and [[social justice]] has also become prominent.<ref name=Guha>Guha, R. and Martinez-Alier, J., ''Varieties of Environmentalism: Essays North and South'', 1997</ref> In 1994, David Pepper also released his important work, ''Ecosocialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice'', which critiques the current approach of many within [[green politics]], particularly [[Deep ecology|deep ecologists]].<ref name=DPepper>Pepper, D., ''Ecosocialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice'', 1994</ref> Currently, many [[Green party|green parties]] around the world, such as the [[GreenLeft|Dutch Green Left Party]] (GroenLinks), contain strong eco-socialist elements. Radical [[red-green alliance]]s have been formed in many countries by eco-socialists, radical greens and other radical left groups. In [[Denmark]], the [[Red-Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red-Green Alliance]] was formed as a coalition of numerous radical parties. Within the [[European Parliament]], a number of leftist parties from Northern Europe have organised themselves into the [[Nordic Green Left Alliance]].\n\n=== Syndicalism ===\n{{main|Syndicalism}}\nSyndicalism is a social movement that operates through industrial trade unions and rejects [[state socialism]] and the use of establishment politics to establish or promote socialism. They reject using state power to construct a socialist society, favouring strategies such as the [[general strike]]. Syndicalists advocate a socialist economy based on federated unions or syndicates of workers who own and manage the means of production. Some Marxist currents advocate syndicalism, such as [[DeLeonism|De-Leonism]]. [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] is a [[Anarchist schools of thought|theory of anarchism]] which views [[syndicalism]] as a method for workers in [[capitalist society]] to gain control of an economy and with that control influence broader society. The [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] largely orchestrated by the anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] offers an historical example.<ref>[[Sam Dolgoff]].

He spent his entire 13-year baseball career with the [[New York Yankees]] (1941\u20131956), and was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1994.\n\nA popular figure on a team dynasty that captured 10 AL titles and seven World Championships in his 13 seasons, Rizzuto holds numerous World Series records for shortstops. His best statistical season was 1950, when he was named the [[American League]]'s [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]]. Despite this offensive peak, Rizzuto was a classic \"[[small ball (baseball)|small ball]]\" player, noted for his strong defense in the infield.  The slick-fielding Rizzuto is also regarded as one of the best [[bunt (baseball)|bunters]] in baseball history. When he retired, his 1,217 career [[double plays]] ranked second in major league history, trailing only [[Luke Appling]]'s total of 1,424, and his .968 career [[fielding average]] trailed only [[Lou Boudreau]]'s mark of .973 among AL shortstops.\n\nAfter his playing career, Rizzuto enjoyed a 40-year career as a [[Broadcasting of sports events|radio and television]] [[sports announcer]] for the Yankees. His idiosyncratic style and unpredictable digressions charmed listeners, while his lively play-by-play brought a distinct energy to his broadcasts.

Throughout his career, his birth year was reported as 1918 in ''[[The Sporting News]], the [[Baseball Register]]'', and the ''American League Red Book''; later reference sources revised the year to 1917, indicating his age at the time of his death to be 89. After Rizzuto's death, the ''New York Post'' broke a story reporting Rizzuto's actual year of birth as 1916.<ref name=\"Chass\"/> However, it was subsequently reported that the New York City Department of Health said Rizzuto's official birth certificate is, in fact, dated 1917.<ref name=Chass>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/sports/baseball/19chass.html Rizzuto's Secret of Youth Lasted for Years]</ref>\n\nDespite his modest size \u2014 usually listed during his playing career as five feet, six inches tall and either 150 or 160 pounds, though he rarely reached even the lower figure<ref name=Daniel>{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Daniel|authorlink=Dan Daniel (sportswriter)|title=How Good Was Scooter?

His nickname, at times attributed to Yankees broadcaster [[Mel Allen]], was actually bestowed on Rizzuto (according to him) by minor league teammate [[Billy Hitchcock]] because of the way Rizzuto ran the bases.\n\nAfter being named the Minor League Player of the Year by ''[[The Sporting News]]'' in 1940 while playing with the [[Kansas City Blues (American Association)|Kansas City Blues]], he played his first major league game on April 14, 1941. Taking over for the well-liked [[Frank Crosetti]], whose batting average had dropped to .194 after several strong seasons, Rizzuto quickly fit into the Yankees lineup to form an outstanding middle infield with second baseman [[Joe Gordon]]. In his syndicated column on October 1, [[Grantland Rice]] compared the pair favorably to the middle infield of the crosstown [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]: \"[[Billy Herman]] and [[Pee Wee Reese]] around the highly important keystone spot don't measure up, over a season anyway, with Joe Gordon and Phil Rizzuto, a pair of light-footed, quick-handed operatives who can turn seeming base hits into double plays often enough to save many a close scrap.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill James |title=The Politics of Glory: How Baseball's Hall of Fame Really Works |year=1994 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=0-02-510774-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/politicsofgloryh00jame/page/138 138] |title-link=Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame? }}</ref>\n\n[[File:80-G-49324.jpg|thumb|Rizzuto at bat in front of a group of US Navy Sailors in the South Pacific during his time in the US Navy between 1943 and 1945.]]\nRizzuto's rookie season ended in the [[1941 World Series|World Series]], and though he hit poorly, the Yankees beat the Dodgers. The following year, Rizzuto led all hitters, for both the Yankees and the opposing [[St. Louis Cardinals]], with 8 hits and a .381 average in the [[1942 World Series]]; the light-hitting shortstop even added a home run after hitting just  4 in the regular season.\n\nLike many players of the era, he found his career interrupted by a stint in the [[United States Navy]] during World War II. From 1943 through 1945, he played on a Navy baseball team alongside Dodgers shortstop Reese; the team was managed by Yankees catcher [[Bill Dickey]].\n\nShortly after Rizzuto's return to the Yankees for the 1946 season, he attracted the ire of new Yankees general manager, president, and co-owner [[Larry MacPhail]], former president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. MacPhail had served in both World Wars, was hard-drinking, tempestuous, and often paranoid, but as a baseball executive was innovative  and considered a near-genius despite being hobbled by alcohol and a volatile temper.<ref>{{cite web|title=Larry MacPhail Was Wacky Genius|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/June25/larrymacphailwaswackygenius/?/page=all|website=The Washington Times|accessdate=August 15, 2016}}</ref>  In 1946 MacPhail became aware that Mexican millionaire and ball club owner [[Jorge Pasquel]], just named president of the Mexican League and who with his wealthy 2 brothers had poached American players from the Negro League since 1943, was now courting Major League men. Several clubs lost players with others mentioned including the Yankees, and Phil Rizzuto was rumored to be considering a $100,000, 3-year contract. For that matter, a number of players on various teams had begun \"moonlighting\" in winter playing for Cuban teams. The disarray had to end. Baseball Commissioner Albert [[Happy Chandler]], former Kentucky governor, announced on Opening Day that exclusivity clauses still ruled\u2014all contract-jumping players heading to Mexico or Cuba would be suspended from the Major League for 5 years.<ref name=\"McKelvey\">{{cite book|last1=McKelvey|first1=G.

The Trib's Rennie sent several dispatches from Mexico, liking some things about the scene but disliking others.  Rennie, who had covered the Yankees since the Roaring Twenties, was soon astounded when MacPhail sued the Mexican Baseball League and the restraining order named Rud Rennie as an \"agent\" of the foreigners.

He became the only MVP in history who led the league in sacrifice bunts. Rizzuto played in five [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]], in 1942 and each year from 1950 to 1953. In 1950, he also won the [[Hickok Belt]], awarded to the top professional athlete of the year, and was named Major League Player of the Year by ''The Sporting News''. He was voted top major league shortstop by ''The Sporting News'' four consecutive years (1949\u201352).<ref>{{cite news|title=Hall of Fame New York Yankees shortstop and broadcaster dead at 89|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/14/hall-fame-new-york-yankees-shortstop-and-broadcaster-phil-rizzuto-dead-at-8.html|accessdate=June 29, 2017|agency=Fox News|date=August 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nRizzuto batted .320 in the [[1951 World Series]], for which the New York chapter of the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America|BBWAA]] later voted him the [[Babe Ruth Award]] as the Series' top player. Decades later, Rizzuto still spoke resentfully of the incident in which pugnacious [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] second baseman [[Eddie Stanky]] sparked a rally by kicking the ball out of Rizzuto's glove on a tag play. [[Ty Cobb]] named Rizzuto and [[Stan Musial]] as \"two of the few modern ball players who could hold their own among old timers.\" Yankees manager [[Casey Stengel]] had famously dismissed Rizzuto during that Brooklyn Dodgers tryout in 1935 when Stengel was managing that team, advising him to \"go get a shoeshine box.\" But Stengel ended up managing Rizzuto during five consecutive championship seasons, and would later say, \"He is the greatest shortstop I have ever seen in my entire baseball career, and I have watched some beauties.\" During his heyday, Yankees pitcher [[Vic Raschi]] noted, \"My best pitch is anything the batter grounds, lines or pops in the direction of Rizzuto.\" Decades into his retirement, teammate [[Joe DiMaggio]] characterized Rizzuto's enduring appeal to fans: \"People loved watching me play baseball. Scooter, they just loved.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lupica|first1=Mike|title=Brooklyn kid turned Bronx icon made us feel like part of family|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/brooklyn-kid-turned-bronx-icon-made-feel-part-family-article-1.238454|website=Daily News Sports|publisher=NY Daily News.com|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRizzuto was noted for \"small ball\", strong defense, and clutch hitting, which helped the Yankees win seven [[World Series]]. As an offensive player, he is particularly regarded as one of the best [[bunt (baseball)|bunters]] of his era; he led the AL in [[sacrifice hit]]s every season from 1949 to 1952. In retirement, he often tutored players on the bunt during spring training. In the announcing booth, Rizzuto talked about the several different kinds of bunts he would use in different situations. Later during his broadcasting career, he occasionally expressed disappointment that the art of bunting had largely been lost in baseball. Rizzuto was among the AL's top five players in [[stolen base]]s seven times. Defensively, he led the league three times each in [[double plays]] and total chances per game, twice each in fielding and [[putouts]], and once in [[assist (baseball)|assist]]s. Rizzuto ranks among the top ten players in several World Series categories, including games, hits, walks, runs, and steals. Three times during his career, the Yankees played until Game Seven of the World Series; Rizzuto batted .455 in those three games (1947, 1952, 1955).\n\nIn Rizzuto's obituary, ''The New York Times'' recalled a play that had occurred on September 17, 1951, with the Yankees and [[Cleveland Indians]] tied for first place and just 12 games left in the season:\n:Rizzuto was at bat (he was righthanded) against Bob Lemon of the Cleveland Indians. It was the bottom of the ninth inning, in the middle of a pennant chase. The score was tied at 1. DiMaggio was on third base. Rizzuto took Lemon's first pitch, a called strike, and argued the call with the umpire. That gave him time to grab his bat from both ends, the sign to DiMaggio that a [[Squeeze play (baseball)|squeeze play]] was on for the next pitch. But DiMaggio broke early, surprising Rizzuto. Lemon, seeing what was happening, threw high, to avoid a bunt, aiming behind Rizzuto. But with Joltin' Joe bearing down on him, Rizzuto got his bat up in time to lay down a bunt. \"If I didn't bunt, the pitch would've hit me right in the head\", Rizzuto said. \"I bunted it with both feet off the ground, but I got it off toward first base.\" DiMaggio scored the winning run. Stengel called it \"the greatest play I ever saw.\"\n\nAs the winning run scored, Lemon angrily threw both the ball and his pitching glove into the stands.\n\nRizzuto was released by the Yankees on August 25, 1956. Rizzuto often talked about the unusual circumstances of his release. Late in the 1956 season, the Yankees re-acquired [[Enos Slaughter]], who had been with the team in 1954\u201355, and asked Rizzuto to meet with the front office to discuss adjustments to the upcoming postseason roster. They then asked Rizzuto to look over the list of Yankee players and suggest which ones might be cut to make room for Slaughter. For each name Rizzuto mentioned, a reason was given as to why that player needed to be kept. Finally, Rizzuto realized that the expendable name was his own. He called former teammate George Stirnweiss, who told him to refrain from \"blasting\" the Yankees because it might cost him a non-playing job later. Rizzuto said many times that following Stirnweiss' advice was probably the best move he ever made.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Friend|first1=Harold|title=Phil Rizzuto figured it out and listened|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/388031-phil-rizzuto-figured-it-out-and-listened|accessdate=June 29, 2017|agency=Bleacher Report|date=May 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhen he retired, his 1,217 career double plays ranked second in major league history, trailing only [[Luke Appling]]'s total of 1,424, and his .968 career fielding average trailed only [[Lou Boudreau]]'s mark of .973 among AL shortstops. He also ranked fifth in AL history in games at shortstop (1,647), eighth in putouts (3,219) and [[total chances]] (8,148), and ninth in [[assist (baseball)|assists]] (4,666).\n\nAt the time of his last game, he had also appeared in the most World Series games ever (52), a record soon surpassed by five of his Yankees teammates. Rizzuto still holds numerous World Series records for shortstops, including the most career games played, singles, walks, times on base, stolen bases, at-bats, putouts, assists and double plays.\n\n==Personal life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nRizzuto married Cora Anne Ellenborn on June 23, 1943; the two first met the previous year when Rizzuto substituted for [[Joe DiMaggio]] as a speaker at a [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] communion breakfast. \"I fell in love so hard I didn't go home\", Rizzuto recalled. He rented a nearby hotel room for a month to be near her. The Rizzutos moved to [[Hillside, New Jersey]], in 1949, to an apartment in Monroe Gardens. With later financial successes, they moved to a [[Tudorbethan architecture|Tudor]] home on Westminster Avenue, where they lived for many years.\n\nDuring his playing days, Rizzuto (along with several other big leaguers) would work in the off season at the American Shops off [[U.S. Route 22]] near [[Bayonne, New Jersey]]. At a charity event in 1951, Rizzuto met a young blind boy named [[Ed Lucas]], who had lost his sight when he was struck by a baseball between the eyes on the same day as [[Bobby Thomson]]'s \"[[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round the World]].\"\n\nRizzuto took an interest in the boy and his school, St. Joseph's School for the Blind. Until his death, Rizzuto raised millions for St. Joseph's by donating profits from his commercials and books, and also by hosting the Annual Phil Rizzuto Celebrity Golf Classic and \"Scooter\" Awards. Rizzuto and Lucas remained friendly, and it was through the Yankee broadcaster's influence that Lucas's 2006 wedding was the only one ever conducted at Yankee Stadium. Lucas was one of Rizzuto's last visitors at his nursing home, days before his death.\n\n==Broadcasting career==\nRizzuto had options following his release by the Yankees, including a player contract from the Cardinals and a minor league offer from the Dodgers. But Rizzuto, who had filled in for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]' wraparound host [[Frankie Frisch]] in September 1956 following Frisch's heart attack, received a favorable response. With his eye on a post-playing career, Rizzuto submitted an audition tape to the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. The Yankees' sponsor, [[Ballantine Brewery|Ballantine Beer]], took notice, and insisted that the team hire Rizzuto as an announcer for the 1957 season. General manager [[George Weiss (baseball)|George Weiss]] was obliged to fire [[Jim Woods]], who had only been with the Yankees for four years, to make room for Rizzuto in the booth. When Weiss told Woods he was out in favor of Rizzuto, he said that it was the first time he had to fire someone for no reason.\n\nRizzuto broadcast Yankee games on radio and television for the next 40 years. His popular [[catchphrase]] was \"Holy cow.\" Rizzuto also became known for saying \"Unbelievable!\" or \"Did you see that?\" to describe a great play, and would call somebody a \"huckleberry\" if he did something Rizzuto did not like. During game broadcasts, he would frequently wish listeners a happy birthday or anniversary, send get-well wishes to fans in hospitals, and speak well of restaurants he liked, or of the [[cannoli]] he ate between innings.  This chatter sometimes distracted the speaker himself; Rizzuto devised the unique scoring notation \"WW\" for his scorecard; it stood for \"Wasn't Watching.\"\n\nHe also joked about leaving the game early, saying to his wife, \"I'll be home soon, Cora!\" and \"I gotta get over that bridge\", referring to the nearby and often-congested [[George Washington Bridge]], which he would use to get back to his home in Hillside. In later years, Rizzuto would announce the first six innings of Yankee games; the TV director would sometimes puckishly show a shot of the bridge (which can be seen from the top of [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]) after Rizzuto had departed. Rizzuto was also very [[astraphobia|phobic about lightning]], and sometimes left the booth following violent thunderclaps.\n\nRizzuto started his broadcasting career working alongside [[Mel Allen]] and [[Red Barber]] in 1957.  Among a number of announcers that Rizzuto worked with over the course of his career, [[Frank Messer]] (1968\u20131985) and [[Bill White (first baseman)|Bill White]] (1971\u20131988) were the two most memorable. Rizzuto, Messer, and White were the main broadcast trio that presided over an important time period for the Yankees, which spanned from the non-winning CBS years through the championship seasons and other years of struggle during the Steinbrenner era. On television, for example, the Yankees broadcast team went unchanged from 1972 to 1982.\n\nRizzuto was twice assigned to broadcast the World Series while with the Yankees. He worked the 1964 series on NBC-TV and radio with [[Joe Garagiola]] when the Yankees faced the Cardinals. The next time the Yankees made it into the series, in 1976, Rizzuto joined Garagiola and [[Tony Kubek]] on NBC-TV when the Yankees faced the Reds. The 1976 World Series was the last to have a local voice from each of the two teams take part as guest announcers. [[WPIX]] and its usual Rizzuto-Messer-White broadcast trifecta carried the ALCS in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, and 1981, providing metropolitan area viewers a local alternative to the nationally broadcast telecasts.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nRizzuto would typically refer to his broadcast partners by their last names, calling them \"White\", \"Murcer\" and \"Seaver\" instead of \"Bill\", \"Bobby\" or \"Tom.\" Reportedly, he did the same with teammates during his playing days. Rizzuto developed a reputation as a \"homer\", an announcer who would sometimes lapse into openly rooting for the home team. In 1978, on the televised postgame show, the news arrived that [[Pope Paul VI]] had just died.  \"Well,\" said Rizzuto, \"that kind of puts the damper on even a Yankee win.\" ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine called that the \"Holiest Cow of 1978.\"\n\nRizzuto's most significant moments as a broadcaster included the new single-season home run record set by [[Roger Maris]] on October 1, 1961, which he called on [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] radio:\n\n*\"Here's the windup, fastball, hit deep to right, this could be it! Way back there! Holy cow, he did it! Sixty-one for Maris! And look at the fight for that ball out there! Holy cow, what a shot! Another standing ovation for Maris, and they're still fighting for that ball out there, climbing over each other's backs. One of the greatest sights I've ever seen here at Yankee Stadium!\"<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/audio/11715786.html Phil Rizzuto calls Roger Maris' 61st home run], ''Star Tribune''. Retrieved May 9, 2014.</ref>\n\nRizzuto also called the pennant-winning home run hit by [[Chris Chambliss]] in the [[1976 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] on October 14, 1976, on [[WPIX|WPIX-TV]]:<blockquote>''\"He hits one deep to right-center! That ball is out of here! The Yankees win the pennant! Holy cow, Chris Chambliss on one swing!\" [As fans poured onto the field, tearing it up for souvenirs] \"And the Yankees win the American League pennant. Unbelievable, what a finish! As dramatic a finish as you'd ever want to see! With all that delay, we told you [[Mark Littell|Littell]] (Mark Littell, the Royals' reliever who gave up the homer) had to be a little upset. And holy cow, Chambliss hits one over the fence, he is being mobbed by the fans, and this field will never be the same, but the Yankees have won it in the bottom of the 9th, seven to six!\"''</blockquote>\n\nRizzuto was also on the mic for the [[1978 American League East tie-breaker game|one-game playoff]] that decided the dramatic 1978 AL East race between the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, the [[Pine Tar Incident|Pine Tar game]] involving [[George Brett]] in 1983, and [[Phil Niekro]]'s 300th career win in 1985.\n\nMalapropisms and stream-of-consciousness commentary were fairly common for Rizzuto, which annoyed his critics but amused his fans:\n\n*\"Uh-oh, deep to left-center, nobody's gonna get that one! Holy cow, somebody got it!\"\n*\"Bouncer to third, they'll never get him! No, why don't I just shut up!\"\n*\"All right! Stay fair! No, it won't stay fair. Good thing it didn't stay fair, or I think he would've caught it!\"\n*\"Oh, these Yankees can get the clutch hits, Murcer. I might have to go home early, I just got a cramp in my leg.\"\n*[When the camera showed a shot of the full moon]: \"Look, you can see Texas!\"\n\nAs [[Dave Righetti]] hurled his [[no-hitter]] against the [[Boston Red Sox]] on July 4, 1983 at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Rizzuto\u2014broadcasting on [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] radio\u2014described the video of a close play as if his listeners could see it. Partner Frank Messer gently jogged the Scooter's memory by quipping \"Which side of the radio are we looking at?\" (To be fair, Rizzuto and Messer alternated that day between WABC radio, TV's [[SportsChannel America|SportsChannel]] (now [[MSG Plus]]) and the Fan Appreciation giveaways on the field.)\n\nDuring the openings to two separate telecasts, Rizzuto began by reading off a teleprompter, \"Welcome to New York Yankee Baseball. I'm Bill White ... wait a minute.\" Both times, this caused White, standing to Rizzuto's left, to burst out in laughter. On another occasion, Rizzuto introduced the team as \"Bill Rizzuto\" and \"Phil White.\"\n\nRizzuto's relationships with White and Fran Healy (the latter first worked with Rizzuto on radio) produced some good-humored exchanges, including one with White during the WPIX telecast of the [[American League East|American League Eastern Division]] title game on October 2, 1978. Red Sox batter [[Bob Bailey (baseball)|Bob (Beetle) Bailey]], who had gained a little weight, had just stepped into the batter's box:\n\n*'''Rizzuto''': \"Looks a little out of shape, doesn't he, Bill?\"\n*'''White''': ''(chuckles)'' \"Well, Beetle's been around a while ...\"\n*'''Rizzuto''': \"Yeah.\"\n*'''White''': \"Got a lot of money\u2014from the Pirates. Put it all in California real estate. That's why he's got that big ... uh ...\"\n*'''Rizzuto''' ''(chuckles)'': \"Big ''what''?\"\n*'''White''': \"Well, big ''bank'' account.\" ''(Both men laugh.)''\n\nOn another occasion, at a 1978 game at [[Comiskey Park]], Healy impishly introduced Rizzuto's return to the broadcast booth by saying, \"And back from the men's room, Phil Rizzuto\" leading to the following exchange:\n*'''Rizzuto''': \"You can't keep a secret! That Healy is unbelievable! All right, Nettles tries to bunt and fouls it off. ''(Laughing)'' You could've said that I went to visit [[Bill Veeck]] (the [[Chicago White Sox]] president). You know what happens when you drink coffee all day? You gotta go visit Bill Veeck!\"\n*'''Healy''': ''(Laughing off-mike)''\n*'''Rizzuto''': \"That Healy ... I'm gonna throw him right out of this booth. This is the highest booth in the league, too.\"\n*'''Healy''': \"No, don't do that!\"\n\nNot all of Rizzuto's broadcasting experiences were jovial. On the evening of the funeral of former teammate [[Mickey Mantle]] (August 15, 1995 in [[Dallas, Texas]]), the Yankees were set to play a road game against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Announcing partner Bobby Murcer had already left to attend the funeral, and Rizzuto understandably assumed that he would be allowed to miss the game to attend the funeral with former teammates as well. WPIX and/or the Yankees refused to let him go, citing that \"someone needed to do the color commentary.\" Rizzuto eventually gave into emotion and abruptly left the booth in the middle of the telecast saying he could not go on. Rizzuto announced his retirement from announcing soon afterwards, which many attributed to the incident.\n\nHe was eventually persuaded to return for one more season in 1996<ref>{{cite news|title = 50 Years in Game Is Enough for Kaat |work = [[The New York Times]] |date=September 14, 2006 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/sports/baseball/14sandomir.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |author = Richard Sandomir |page = D-3}}</ref> where he called another Yankee shortstop prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Derek Jeter]]'s first home run. When he retired that season, he had spent parts of seven decades\u2014virtually all of his adult life\u2014in the Yankee organization as a minor league player, major league player and broadcaster. Although Mel Allen is to this day identified as \"The Voice of the Yankees\", Rizzuto was the longest serving [[List of New York Yankees broadcasters|Yankees broadcaster]] in the history of the club; he called Yankees games for 40 years to Allen's 35.\n\n==Other==\n* Alongside his broadcasts for the Yankees, Rizzuto hosted a 5-minute weekday evening sports show (\"It's Sports Time with Phil Rizzuto\") on the CBS Radio Network, from 1957 to 1977.\n* Rizzuto was the longtime celebrity spokesman in TV ads for [[The Money Store (company)|The Money Store]]. He was well known as their spokesman for nearly 20 years, from the 1970s into the 1990s.\n* Rizzuto and former teammate Yogi Berra were partners in a bowling alley venture in [[Clifton, New Jersey]], originally called Rizzuto-Berra Lanes. The two eventually sold their stakes in the alley to new owners who changed its name to Astro Bowl before those owners sold the property to a developer, who closed the bowling alley in 1999 and converted it into retail space. \n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Rizzuto Monument Park2.png|thumb|right|Phil Rizzuto's plaque in Monument Park.]]The Yankees retired Rizzuto's number 10 in a ceremony at Yankee Stadium on August 4, 1985. During this ceremony, he was also given a plaque to be placed in the stadium's Monument Park. The plaque makes reference to the fact that he \"has enjoyed two outstanding careers, all-time Yankee shortstop, one of the great Yankee broadcasters.\" Humorously, Rizzuto was accidentally bumped to the ground during his own ceremony, by a live cow wearing a halo (that is, a \"holy cow\"); both honoree and cow were unhurt. Rizzuto later described the encounter: \"That big thing stepped right on my shoe and pushed me backwards, like a karate move.\" In that day's game, future broadcast partner [[Tom Seaver]] recorded his 300th career victory.\n\nMost baseball observers, including Rizzuto himself, came to believe that [[Derek Jeter]] had surpassed him as the greatest shortstop in Yankees history. The Scooter paid tribute to his heir apparent during the 2001 postseason at Yankee Stadium; jogging back to the Yankee dugout, he flipped the ceremonial baseball backhand, imitating Jeter's celebrated game-saving throw to home plate that had just occurred during the Yankees' [[2001 American League Division Series]] triumph. ESPN reported that the photo of Jeter and Rizzuto taken that evening is one of Jeter's most prized possessions.\n\nIn the spring of 1957, following Rizzuto's release, [[Baltimore Orioles]] manager [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]] said, \"Among those shortstops whom I have had the good fortune to see in action, it's got to be Rizzuto on top for career achievement. For a five-year period, I would have to take Lou Boudreau. ... But, year after year, season after season, Rizzuto was a standout.\" Sportswriter [[Dan Daniel (sportswriter)|Dan Daniel]] wrote at the time, \"It seems to me that Rizzuto must be included among the few players of the past five years who may look forward to ultimate election to the Hall of Fame.\" <ref name=Daniel/> However, Daniel's assessment did not come to pass for over 35 years.\n\nRizzuto was elected to the Hall of Fame along with [[Leo Durocher]] (who was selected posthumously), in 1994 by the [[Veterans Committee]], following a long campaign for Rizzuto's election by Yankee fans who were frustrated that he had not received the honor. Some of Rizzuto's peers supported his candidacy, including Boston's [[Ted Williams]].  Williams once claimed that his Red Sox would have won most of the Yankees' 1940s and 1950s pennants if they had had Rizzuto at shortstop,<ref>[http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,6,34,0], sabr.org. Retrieved May 9, 2014.</ref> but Rizzuto himself was more modest: \"My stats don't shout. They kind of whisper.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/14/AR2007081401941.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Yankees Hall of Famer, Broadcaster Phil Rizzuto|first=Adam|last=Bernstein|date=August 15, 2007|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> The push for Rizzuto became especially acute after 1984, when the committee elected [[Pee Wee Reese]], the similarly-regarded shortstop of the crosstown Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\n[[Bill James]] later used Rizzuto's long candidacy as a recurring focus in his book ''[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?]]'', devoting several chapters to the shortstop's career and comparisons with similar players. James assessed Rizzuto's career statistics as historically substandard by Hall of Fame standards, although he acknowledged that credit must be given for the years he missed in World War II, and criticized many of the public arguments both for and against his selection; but despite noting that Rizzuto was a great defensive player and a good hitter he stated that he could not endorse his candidacy, as there were too many similar players with virtually identical accomplishments.<ref>James, pp. 433\u2013434.</ref> The book's final paragraph noted Rizzuto's election to the Hall in February 1994. James, however, did point out that there were numerous players in the Hall who were inferior to Rizzuto, and in 2001 he selected Rizzuto as the 16th greatest shortstop of all time,<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|year=2001|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|location=New York|isbn=0-684-80697-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newbilljameshist00jame/page/603 603\u201304]|url=https://archive.org/details/newbilljameshist00jame/page/603}}</ref> ahead of eight other Hall of Famers.\n\nRizzuto was modest about his achievements, saying, \"I never thought I deserved to be in the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame is for the big guys, pitchers with 100 mph fastballs and hitters who sock homers and drive in a lot of runs. That's the way it always has been, and the way it should be.\"<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/503/story/1361833.html Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222537/http://www.startribune.com/503/story/1361833.html |date=September 26, 2007 }}, ''Star Tribune''.

Rizzuto's \"inimitable and wondrous digressions and ramblings\" were mimicked by ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist [[Ira Berkow]]:<blockquote>''Anyway, somewhere in the speech (Rizzuto) told about leaving home in Brooklyn for the first time when he was 19 years old and going to play shortstop in the minor league town of Bassett, Virginia, and he was on a train with no sleeper and when he got his first taste of Southern fried chicken and it was great and it was also the first time that he ever ate -- \"Hey, White, what's that stuff that looks like oatmeal?\"\u2014and Bill White, his onetime announcing partner on Yankee broadcasts, and, like all his partners, never seemed to learn their first names, though he knew the first and last names of a lot of the birthdays he forever is announcing and the owners of his favorite restaurants even though as he admits he often talks about the score or the game, but after 38 years of announcing games and after a 13-year playing career with championship Yankee teams few seem to care about this either, well, White was in the audience and stood up and said \"Grits\".''</blockquote>\n\nIn 1999, the minor league Staten Island Yankees named their mascot \"Scooter the Holy Cow\", after Rizzuto.<ref>[http://www.newviewgraphics.com/mascots/scooter.html Scooter the Holy Cow], newviewgraphics.com.

His last public appearance came early in 2006; visibly frail, he announced that he was putting much of his memorabilia on the market. In September 2006, Rizzuto's 1950 MVP plaque fetched $175,000, three of his [[World Series ring]]s sold for $84,825, and a Yankee cap with a wad of chewing gum on it went for $8,190.

Rizzuto made four more appearances on the program, three as a guest panelist in the 1956\u20131957 season following his retirement, and one in 1970 as the Mystery Guest on a later incarnation of the quiz show. Rizzuto also made various television appearances on programs such as [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[To Tell The Truth]]'' and ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]''.\n*Rizzuto is the announcer who provides the [[play-by-play]] commentary during the long spoken [[bridge (music)|bridge]] in [[Meat Loaf]]'s 1977 song \"[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]].\" Ostensibly an account of a baseball sequence, it actually describes the singer's step-by-step efforts to engage in coitus with a young woman (voiced by actress and singer [[Ellen Foley]]). When Rizzuto recorded his piece, he was reportedly unaware of how his spoken contribution would be used. When the song broke, Rizzuto said his parish priest called him in shock. However, \"Phil was no dummy\", said singer Meat Loaf. \"He knew exactly what was going on, and he told me such. He was just getting some heat from a priest and felt like he had to do something. I totally understood.\" Years later, Rizzuto would laughingly retell the story saying he got snookered by Meat Loaf, but he had a good attitude about it and when Meat Loaf asked him to go on tour with him, Rizzuto was flattered but declined, jokingly saying that Cora would \"kill him\" if he did.

1917 \u2013 August 13, 2007), nicknamed '''\"The Scooter\"''', was an American [[Major League Baseball]] [[shortstop]]. He spent his entire 13-year baseball career with the [[New York Yankees]] (1941\u20131956), and was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1994.\n\nA popular figure on a team dynasty that captured 10 AL titles and seven World Championships in his 13 seasons, Rizzuto holds numerous World Series records for shortstops. His best statistical season was [[1950 in baseball|1950]], when he was named the [[American League]]'s [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]]. Despite this offensive peak, Rizzuto was a classic \"[[small ball (baseball)|small ball]]\" player, noted for his strong defense in the infield.  The slick-fielding Rizzuto is also regarded as one of the best [[bunt (baseball)|bunters]] in baseball history. When he retired, his 1,217 career [[double plays]] ranked second in major league history, trailing only [[Luke Appling]]'s total of 1,424, and his .968 career [[fielding average]] trailed only [[Lou Boudreau]]'s mark of .973 among AL shortstops.\n\nAfter his playing career, Rizzuto enjoyed a 40-year career as a [[Broadcasting of sports events|radio and television]] [[sports announcer]] for the Yankees. His idiosyncratic style and unpredictable digressions charmed listeners, while his lively play-by-play brought a distinct energy to his broadcasts.

His nickname, at times attributed to Yankees broadcaster [[Mel Allen]], was actually bestowed on Rizzuto (according to him) by minor league teammate [[Billy Hitchcock]] because of the way Rizzuto ran the bases.\n\nAfter being named the Minor League Player of the Year by ''[[The Sporting News]]'' in 1940 while playing with the [[Kansas City Blues (American Association)|Kansas City Blues]], he played his first major league game on April 14, 1941. Taking over for the well-liked [[Frank Crosetti]], whose batting average had dropped to .194 after several strong seasons, Rizzuto quickly fit into the Yankees lineup to form an outstanding middle infield with second baseman [[Joe Gordon]]. In his syndicated column on October 1, [[Grantland Rice]] compared the pair favorably to the middle infield of the crosstown [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]: \"[[Billy Herman]] and [[Pee Wee Reese]] around the highly important keystone spot don't measure up, over a season anyway, with Joe Gordon and Phil Rizzuto, a pair of light-footed, quick-handed operatives who can turn seeming base hits into double plays often enough to save many a close scrap.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill James |title=The Politics of Glory: How Baseball's Hall of Fame Really Works |year=1994 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=0-02-510774-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/politicsofgloryh00jame/page/138 138] |title-link=Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame? }}</ref>\n\n[[File:80-G-49324.jpg|thumb|Rizzuto at bat in front of a group of US Navy Sailors in the South Pacific during his time in the US Navy between 1943 and 1945.]]\nRizzuto's rookie season ended in the [[1941 World Series|World Series]], and though he hit poorly, the Yankees beat the Dodgers. The following year, Rizzuto led all hitters, for both the Yankees and the opposing [[St. Louis Cardinals]], with 8 hits and a .381 average in the [[1942 World Series]]; the light-hitting shortstop even added a home run after hitting just  4 in the regular season.\n\nLike many players of the era, he found his career interrupted by a stint in the [[United States Navy]] during World War II. From [[1943 in baseball|1943]] through [[1945 in baseball|1945]], he played on a Navy baseball team alongside Dodgers shortstop Reese; the team was managed by Yankees catcher [[Bill Dickey]].\n\nShortly after Rizzuto's return to the Yankees for the 1946 season, he attracted the ire of new Yankees general manager, president, and co-owner [[Larry MacPhail]], former president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. MacPhail had served in both World Wars, was hard-drinking, tempestuous, and often paranoid, but as a baseball executive was innovative  and considered a near-genius despite being hobbled by alcohol and a volatile temper.<ref>{{cite web|title=Larry MacPhail Was Wacky Genius|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/June25/larrymacphailwaswackygenius/?/page=all|website=The Washington Times|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref>  In 1946 MacPhail became aware that Mexican millionaire and ball club owner [[Jorge Pasquel]], just named president of the Mexican League and who with his wealthy 2 brothers had poached American players from the Negro League since 1943, was now courting Major League men. Several clubs lost players with others mentioned including the Yankees, and Phil Rizzuto was rumored to be considering a $100,000, 3-year contract. For that matter, a number of players on various teams had begun \"moonlighting\" in winter playing for Cuban teams. The disarray had to end.

The Trib's Rennie sent several dispatches from Mexico, liking some things about the scene but disliking others.  Rennie, who had covered the Yankees since the Roaring Twenties, was soon astounded when MacPhail sued the Mexican Baseball League and the restraining order named Rud Rennie as an \"agent\" of the foreigners.

He became the only MVP in history who led the league in sacrifice bunts. Rizzuto played in five [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]], in [[1942 in baseball|1942]] and each year from 1950 to [[1953 in baseball|1953]]. In 1950, he also won the [[Hickok Belt]], awarded to the top professional athlete of the year, and was named Major League Player of the Year by ''The Sporting News''. He was voted top major league shortstop by ''The Sporting News'' four consecutive years (1949\u201352).<ref>{{cite news|title=Hall of Fame New York Yankees shortstop and broadcaster dead at 89|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/14/hall-fame-new-york-yankees-shortstop-and-broadcaster-phil-rizzuto-dead-at-8.html|accessdate=29 June 2017|agency=Fox News|date=14 Aug 2007}}</ref>\n\nRizzuto batted .320 in the [[1951 World Series]], for which the New York chapter of the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America|BBWAA]] later voted him the [[Babe Ruth Award]] as the Series' top player. Decades later, Rizzuto still spoke resentfully of the incident in which pugnacious [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] second baseman [[Eddie Stanky]] sparked a rally by kicking the ball out of Rizzuto's glove on a tag play. [[Ty Cobb]] named Rizzuto and [[Stan Musial]] as \"two of the few modern ball players who could hold their own among old timers.\" Yankees manager [[Casey Stengel]] had famously dismissed Rizzuto during that Brooklyn Dodgers tryout in 1935 when Stengel was managing that team, advising him to \"go get a shoeshine box.\" But Stengel ended up managing Rizzuto during five consecutive championship seasons, and would later say, \"He is the greatest shortstop I have ever seen in my entire baseball career, and I have watched some beauties.\" During his heyday, Yankees pitcher [[Vic Raschi]] noted, \"My best pitch is anything the batter grounds, lines or pops in the direction of Rizzuto.\" Decades into his retirement, teammate [[Joe DiMaggio]] characterized Rizzuto's enduring appeal to fans: \"People loved watching me play baseball. Scooter, they just loved.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lupica|first1=Mike|title=Brooklyn kid turned Bronx icon made us feel like part of family|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/brooklyn-kid-turned-bronx-icon-made-feel-part-family-article-1.238454|website=Daily News Sports|publisher=NY Daily News.com|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nRizzuto was noted for \"small ball\", strong defense, and clutch hitting, which helped the Yankees win seven [[World Series]]. As an offensive player, he is particularly regarded as one of the best [[bunt (baseball)|bunters]] of his era; he led the AL in [[sacrifice hit]]s every season from 1949 to 1952. In retirement, he often tutored players on the bunt during spring training. In the announcing booth, Rizzuto talked about the several different kinds of bunts he would use in different situations. Later during his broadcasting career, he occasionally expressed disappointment that the art of bunting had largely been lost in baseball. Rizzuto was among the AL's top five players in [[stolen base]]s seven times. Defensively, he led the league three times each in [[double plays]] and total chances per game, twice each in fielding and [[putouts]], and once in [[assist (baseball)|assist]]s. Rizzuto ranks among the top ten players in several World Series categories, including games, hits, walks, runs, and steals. Three times during his career, the Yankees played until Game Seven of the World Series; Rizzuto batted .455 in those three games (1947, 1952, 1955).\n\nIn Rizzuto's obituary, ''The New York Times'' recalled a play that had occurred on September 17, 1951, with the Yankees and [[Cleveland Indians]] tied for first place and just 12 games left in the season:\n:Rizzuto was at bat (he was righthanded) against Bob Lemon of the Cleveland Indians. It was the bottom of the ninth inning, in the middle of a pennant chase. The score was tied at 1. DiMaggio was on third base. Rizzuto took Lemon's first pitch, a called strike, and argued the call with the umpire. That gave him time to grab his bat from both ends, the sign to DiMaggio that a [[Squeeze play (baseball)|squeeze play]] was on for the next pitch. But DiMaggio broke early, surprising Rizzuto. Lemon, seeing what was happening, threw high, to avoid a bunt, aiming behind Rizzuto. But with Joltin' Joe bearing down on him, Rizzuto got his bat up in time to lay down a bunt. \"If I didn't bunt, the pitch would've hit me right in the head\", Rizzuto said. \"I bunted it with both feet off the ground, but I got it off toward first base.\" DiMaggio scored the winning run. Stengel called it \"the greatest play I ever saw.\"\n\nAs the winning run scored, Lemon angrily threw both the ball and his pitching glove into the stands.\n\nRizzuto was released by the Yankees on August 25, 1956. Rizzuto often talked about the unusual circumstances of his release. Late in the 1956 season, the Yankees re-acquired [[Enos Slaughter]], who had been with the team in 1954\u201355, and asked Rizzuto to meet with the front office to discuss adjustments to the upcoming postseason roster. They then asked Rizzuto to look over the list of Yankee players and suggest which ones might be cut to make room for Slaughter. For each name Rizzuto mentioned, a reason was given as to why that player needed to be kept. Finally, Rizzuto realized that the expendable name was his own. He called former teammate George Stirnweiss, who told him to refrain from \"blasting\" the Yankees because it might cost him a non-playing job later. Rizzuto said many times that following Stirnweiss' advice was probably the best move he ever made.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Friend|first1=Harold|title=Phil Rizzuto figured it out and listened|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/388031-phil-rizzuto-figured-it-out-and-listened|accessdate=29 June 2017|agency=Bleacher Report|date=4 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhen he retired, his 1,217 career double plays ranked second in major league history, trailing only [[Luke Appling]]'s total of 1,424, and his .968 career fielding average trailed only [[Lou Boudreau]]'s mark of .973 among AL shortstops. He also ranked fifth in AL history in games at shortstop (1,647), eighth in putouts (3,219) and [[total chances]] (8,148), and ninth in [[assist (baseball)|assists]] (4,666).\n\nAt the time of his last game, he had also appeared in the most World Series games ever (52), a record soon surpassed by five of his Yankees teammates. Rizzuto still holds numerous World Series records for shortstops, including the most career games played, singles, walks, times on base, stolen bases, at-bats, putouts, assists and double plays.\n\n==Personal life==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nRizzuto married Cora Anne Ellenborn on June 23, 1943; the two first met the previous year when Rizzuto substituted for [[Joe DiMaggio]] as a speaker at a [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] communion breakfast. \"I fell in love so hard I didn't go home\", Rizzuto recalled. He rented a nearby hotel room for a month to be near her. The Rizzutos moved to [[Hillside, New Jersey]], in 1949, to an apartment in Monroe Gardens. With later financial successes, they moved to a [[Tudorbethan architecture|Tudor]] home on Westminster Avenue, where they lived for many years.\n\nDuring his playing days, Rizzuto (along with several other big leaguers) would work in the off season at the American Shops off [[U.S. Route 22]] near [[Bayonne, New Jersey]]. At a charity event in [[1951 in baseball|1951]], Rizzuto met a young blind boy named [[Ed Lucas]], who had lost his sight when he was struck by a baseball between the eyes on the same day as [[Bobby Thomson]]'s \"[[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round the World]].\"\n\nRizzuto took an interest in the boy and his school, St. Joseph's School for the Blind. Until his death, Rizzuto raised millions for St. Joseph's by donating profits from his commercials and books, and also by hosting the Annual Phil Rizzuto Celebrity Golf Classic and \"Scooter\" Awards. Rizzuto and Lucas remained friendly, and it was through the Yankee broadcaster's influence that Lucas's 2006 wedding was the only one ever conducted at Yankee Stadium. Lucas was one of Rizzuto's last visitors at his nursing home, days before his death.\n\n==Broadcasting career==\nRizzuto had options following his release by the Yankees, including a player contract from the Cardinals and a minor league offer from the Dodgers. But Rizzuto, who had filled in for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]' wraparound host [[Frankie Frisch]] in September 1956 following Frisch's heart attack, received a favorable response. With his eye on a post-playing career, Rizzuto submitted an audition tape to the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. The Yankees' sponsor, [[Ballantine Brewery|Ballantine Beer]], took notice, and insisted that the team hire Rizzuto as an announcer for the 1957 season. General manager [[George Weiss (baseball)|George Weiss]] was obliged to fire [[Jim Woods]], who had only been with the Yankees for four years, to make room for Rizzuto in the booth. When Weiss told Woods he was out in favor of Rizzuto, he said that it was the first time he had to fire someone for no reason.\n\nRizzuto broadcast Yankee games on radio and television for the next 40 years. His popular [[catchphrase]] was \"Holy cow.\" Rizzuto also became known for saying \"Unbelievable!\" or \"Did you see that?\" to describe a great play, and would call somebody a \"huckleberry\" if he did something Rizzuto did not like. During game broadcasts, he would frequently wish listeners a happy birthday or anniversary, send get-well wishes to fans in hospitals, and speak well of restaurants he liked, or of the [[cannoli]] he ate between innings.  This chatter sometimes distracted the speaker himself; Rizzuto devised the unique scoring notation \"WW\" for his scorecard; it stood for \"Wasn't Watching.\"\n\nHe also joked about leaving the game early, saying to his wife, \"I'll be home soon, Cora!\" and \"I gotta get over that bridge\", referring to the nearby and often-congested [[George Washington Bridge]], which he would use to get back to his home in Hillside. In later years, Rizzuto would announce the first six innings of Yankee games; the TV director would sometimes puckishly show a shot of the bridge (which can be seen from the top of [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]) after Rizzuto had departed. Rizzuto was also very [[astraphobia|phobic about lightning]], and sometimes left the booth following violent thunderclaps.\n\nRizzuto started his broadcasting career working alongside [[Mel Allen]] and [[Red Barber]] in 1957.  Among a number of announcers that Rizzuto worked with over the course of his career, [[Frank Messer]] (1968\u20131985) and [[Bill White (first baseman)|Bill White]] (1971\u20131988) were the two most memorable. Rizzuto, Messer, and White were the main broadcast trio that presided over an important time period for the Yankees, which spanned from the non-winning CBS years through the championship seasons and other years of struggle during the Steinbrenner era. On television, for example, the Yankees broadcast team went unchanged from 1972 to 1982.\n\nRizzuto was twice assigned to broadcast the World Series while with the Yankees. He worked the 1964 series on NBC-TV and radio with [[Joe Garagiola]] when the Yankees faced the Cardinals. The next time the Yankees made it into the series, in 1976, Rizzuto joined Garagiola and [[Tony Kubek]] on NBC-TV when the Yankees faced the Reds. The 1976 World Series was the last to have a local voice from each of the two teams take part as guest announcers. [[WPIX]] and its usual Rizzuto-Messer-White broadcast trifecta carried the ALCS in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, and 1981, providing metropolitan area viewers a local alternative to the nationally broadcast telecasts.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nRizzuto would typically refer to his broadcast partners by their last names, calling them \"White\", \"Murcer\" and \"Seaver\" instead of \"Bill\", \"Bobby\" or \"Tom.\" Reportedly, he did the same with teammates during his playing days. Rizzuto developed a reputation as a \"homer\", an announcer who would sometimes lapse into openly rooting for the home team. In 1978, on the televised postgame show, the news arrived that [[Pope Paul VI]] had just died.  \"Well,\" said Rizzuto, \"that kind of puts the damper on even a Yankee win.\" ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine called that the \"Holiest Cow of 1978.\"\n\nRizzuto's most significant moments as a broadcaster included the new single-season home run record set by [[Roger Maris]] on October 1, 1961, which he called on [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] radio:\n\n*\"Here's the windup, fastball, hit deep to right, this could be it! Way back there! Holy cow, he did it! Sixty-one for Maris! And look at the fight for that ball out there! Holy cow, what a shot! Another standing ovation for Maris, and they're still fighting for that ball out there, climbing over each other's backs. One of the greatest sights I've ever seen here at Yankee Stadium!\"<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/audio/11715786.html Phil Rizzuto calls Roger Maris' 61st home run], ''Star Tribune''. Retrieved May 9, 2014.</ref>\n\nRizzuto also called the pennant-winning home run hit by [[Chris Chambliss]] in the [[1976 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] on October 14, 1976, on [[WPIX|WPIX-TV]]:<blockquote>''\"He hits one deep to right-center! That ball is out of here! The Yankees win the pennant! Holy cow, Chris Chambliss on one swing!\" [As fans poured onto the field, tearing it up for souvenirs] \"And the Yankees win the American League pennant. Unbelievable, what a finish! As dramatic a finish as you'd ever want to see! With all that delay, we told you [[Mark Littell|Littell]] (Mark Littell, the Royals' reliever who gave up the homer) had to be a little upset. And holy cow, Chambliss hits one over the fence, he is being mobbed by the fans, and this field will never be the same, but the Yankees have won it in the bottom of the 9th, seven to six!\"''</blockquote>\n\nRizzuto was also on the mic for the [[1978 American League East tie-breaker game|one-game playoff]] that decided the dramatic 1978 AL East race between the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, the [[Pine Tar Incident|Pine Tar game]] involving [[George Brett]] in 1983, and [[Phil Niekro]]'s 300th career win in 1985.\n\nMalapropisms and stream-of-consciousness commentary were fairly common for Rizzuto, which annoyed his critics but amused his fans:\n\n*\"Uh-oh, deep to left-center, nobody's gonna get that one! Holy cow, somebody got it!\"\n*\"Bouncer to third, they'll never get him! No, why don't I just shut up!\"\n*\"All right! Stay fair! No, it won't stay fair. Good thing it didn't stay fair, or I think he would've caught it!\"\n*\"Oh, these Yankees can get the clutch hits, Murcer. I might have to go home early, I just got a cramp in my leg.\"\n*[When the camera showed a shot of the full moon]: \"Look, you can see Texas!\"\n\nAs [[Dave Righetti]] hurled his [[no-hitter]] against the [[Boston Red Sox]] on July 4, 1983 at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Rizzuto\u2014broadcasting on [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] radio\u2014described the video of a close play as if his listeners could see it. Partner Frank Messer gently jogged the Scooter's memory by quipping \"Which side of the radio are we looking at?\" (To be fair, Rizzuto and Messer alternated that day between WABC radio, TV's [[SportsChannel America|SportsChannel]] (now [[MSG Plus]]) and the Fan Appreciation giveaways on the field.)\n\nDuring the openings to two separate telecasts, Rizzuto began by reading off a teleprompter, \"Welcome to New York Yankee Baseball. I'm Bill White ... wait a minute.\" Both times, this caused White, standing to Rizzuto's left, to burst out in laughter. On another occasion, Rizzuto introduced the team as \"Bill Rizzuto\" and \"Phil White.\"\n\nRizzuto's relationships with White and Fran Healy (the latter first worked with Rizzuto on radio) produced some good-humored exchanges, including one with White during the WPIX telecast of the [[American League East|American League Eastern Division]] title game on October 2, 1978. Red Sox batter [[Bob Bailey (baseball)|Bob (Beetle) Bailey]], who had gained a little weight, had just stepped into the batter's box:\n\n*'''Rizzuto''': \"Looks a little out of shape, doesn't he, Bill?\"\n*'''White''': ''(chuckles)'' \"Well, Beetle's been around a while ...\"\n*'''Rizzuto''': \"Yeah.\"\n*'''White''': \"Got a lot of money\u2014from the Pirates. Put it all in California real estate. That's why he's got that big ... uh ...\"\n*'''Rizzuto''' ''(chuckles)'': \"Big ''what''?\"\n*'''White''': \"Well, big ''bank'' account.\" ''(Both men laugh.)''\n\nOn another occasion, at a 1978 game at [[Comiskey Park]], Healy impishly introduced Rizzuto's return to the broadcast booth by saying, \"And back from the men's room, Phil Rizzuto\" leading to the following exchange:\n*'''Rizzuto''': \"You can't keep a secret! That Healy is unbelievable! All right, Nettles tries to bunt and fouls it off. ''(Laughing)'' You could've said that I went to visit [[Bill Veeck]] (the [[Chicago White Sox]] president). You know what happens when you drink coffee all day? You gotta go visit Bill Veeck!\"\n*'''Healy''': ''(Laughing off-mike)''\n*'''Rizzuto''': \"That Healy ... I'm gonna throw him right out of this booth. This is the highest booth in the league, too.\"\n*'''Healy''': \"No, don't do that!\"\n\nNot all of Rizzuto's broadcasting experiences were jovial. On the evening of the funeral of former teammate [[Mickey Mantle]] (August 15, 1995 in [[Dallas, Texas]]), the Yankees were set to play a road game against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Announcing partner Bobby Murcer had already left to attend the funeral, and Rizzuto understandably assumed that he would be allowed to miss the game to attend the funeral with former teammates as well. WPIX and/or the Yankees refused to let him go, citing that \"someone needed to do the color commentary.\" Rizzuto eventually gave into emotion and abruptly left the booth in the middle of the telecast saying he could not go on. Rizzuto announced his retirement from announcing soon afterwards, which many attributed to the incident.\n\nHe was eventually persuaded to return for one more season in 1996<ref>{{cite news|title = 50 Years in Game Is Enough for Kaat |work = [[The New York Times]] |date=2006-09-14 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/sports/baseball/14sandomir.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |author = Richard Sandomir |page = D-3}}</ref> where he called another Yankee shortstop prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Derek Jeter]]'s first home run. When he retired that season, he had spent parts of seven decades\u2014virtually all of his adult life\u2014in the Yankee organization as a minor league player, major league player and broadcaster. Although Mel Allen is to this day identified as \"The Voice of the Yankees\", Rizzuto was the longest serving [[List of New York Yankees broadcasters|Yankees broadcaster]] in the history of the club; he called Yankees games for 40 years to Allen's 35.\n\n==Other==\n* Alongside his broadcasts for the Yankees, Rizzuto hosted a 5-minute weekday evening sports show (\"It's Sports Time with Phil Rizzuto\") on the CBS Radio Network, from 1957 to 1977.\n* Rizzuto was the longtime celebrity spokesman in TV ads for [[The Money Store (company)|The Money Store]]. He was well known as their spokesman for nearly 20 years, from the 1970s into the 1990s.\n* Rizzuto and former teammate Yogi Berra were partners in a bowling alley venture in [[Clifton, New Jersey]], originally called Rizzuto-Berra Lanes. The two eventually sold their stakes in the alley to new owners who changed its name to Astro Bowl before those owners sold the property to a developer, who closed the bowling alley in 1999 and converted it into retail space. \n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Rizzuto Monument Park2.png|thumb|right|Phil Rizzuto's plaque in Monument Park.]]The Yankees retired Rizzuto's number 10 in a ceremony at Yankee Stadium on August 4, 1985. During this ceremony, he was also given a plaque to be placed in the stadium's Monument Park. The plaque makes reference to the fact that he \"has enjoyed two outstanding careers, all-time Yankee shortstop, one of the great Yankee broadcasters.\" Humorously, Rizzuto was accidentally bumped to the ground during his own ceremony, by a live cow wearing a halo (that is, a \"holy cow\"); both honoree and cow were unhurt. Rizzuto later described the encounter: \"That big thing stepped right on my shoe and pushed me backwards, like a karate move.\" In that day's game, future broadcast partner [[Tom Seaver]] recorded his 300th career victory.\n\nMost baseball observers, including Rizzuto himself, came to believe that [[Derek Jeter]] had surpassed him as the greatest shortstop in Yankees history. The Scooter paid tribute to his heir apparent during the 2001 postseason at Yankee Stadium; jogging back to the Yankee dugout, he flipped the ceremonial baseball backhand, imitating Jeter's celebrated game-saving throw to home plate that had just occurred during the Yankees' [[2001 American League Division Series]] triumph. ESPN reported that the photo of Jeter and Rizzuto taken that evening is one of Jeter's most prized possessions.\n\nIn the spring of 1957, following Rizzuto's release, [[Baltimore Orioles]] manager [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]] said, \"Among those shortstops whom I have had the good fortune to see in action, it's got to be Rizzuto on top for career achievement. For a five-year period, I would have to take Lou Boudreau. ... But, year after year, season after season, Rizzuto was a standout.\" Sportswriter [[Dan Daniel (sportswriter)|Dan Daniel]] wrote at the time, \"It seems to me that Rizzuto must be included among the few players of the past five years who may look forward to ultimate election to the Hall of Fame.\" <ref name=Daniel/> However, Daniel's assessment did not come to pass for over 35 years.\n\nRizzuto was elected to the Hall of Fame along with [[Leo Durocher]] (who was selected posthumously), in [[1994 in baseball|1994]] by the [[Veterans Committee]], following a long campaign for Rizzuto's election by Yankee fans who were frustrated that he had not received the honor. Some of Rizzuto's peers supported his candidacy, including Boston's [[Ted Williams]].  Williams once claimed that his Red Sox would have won most of the Yankees' 1940s and 1950s pennants if they had had Rizzuto at shortstop,<ref>[http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,6,34,0], sabr.org. Retrieved May 9, 2014.</ref> but Rizzuto himself was more modest: \"My stats don't shout. They kind of whisper.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/14/AR2007081401941.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Yankees Hall of Famer, Broadcaster Phil Rizzuto|first=Adam|last=Bernstein|date=August 15, 2007|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> The push for Rizzuto became especially acute after [[1984 in baseball|1984]], when the committee elected [[Pee Wee Reese]], the similarly-regarded shortstop of the crosstown Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\n[[Bill James]] later used Rizzuto's long candidacy as a recurring focus in his book ''[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?]]'', devoting several chapters to the shortstop's career and comparisons with similar players. James assessed Rizzuto's career statistics as historically substandard by Hall of Fame standards, although he acknowledged that credit must be given for the years he missed in World War II, and criticized many of the public arguments both for and against his selection; but despite noting that Rizzuto was a great defensive player and a good hitter he stated that he could not endorse his candidacy, as there were too many similar players with virtually identical accomplishments.<ref>James, pp. 433\u2013434.</ref> The book's final paragraph noted Rizzuto's election to the Hall in February 1994. James, however, did point out that there were numerous players in the Hall who were inferior to Rizzuto, and in 2001 he selected Rizzuto as the 16th greatest shortstop of all time,<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|year=2001|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|location=New York|isbn=0-684-80697-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newbilljameshist00jame/page/603 603\u201304]|url=https://archive.org/details/newbilljameshist00jame/page/603}}</ref> ahead of eight other Hall of Famers.\n\nRizzuto was modest about his achievements, saying, \"I never thought I deserved to be in the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame is for the big guys, pitchers with 100 mph fastballs and hitters who sock homers and drive in a lot of runs. That's the way it always has been, and the way it should be.\"<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/503/story/1361833.html Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222537/http://www.startribune.com/503/story/1361833.html |date=2007-09-26 }}, ''Star Tribune''.

Rizzuto's \"inimitable and wondrous digressions and ramblings\" were mimicked by ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist [[Ira Berkow]]:<blockquote>''Anyway, somewhere in the speech (Rizzuto) told about leaving home in Brooklyn for the first time when he was 19 years old and going to play shortstop in the minor league town of Bassett, Virginia, and he was on a train with no sleeper and when he got his first taste of Southern fried chicken and it was great and it was also the first time that he ever ate -- \"Hey, White, what's that stuff that looks like oatmeal?\"\u2014and Bill White, his onetime announcing partner on Yankee broadcasts, and, like all his partners, never seemed to learn their first names, though he knew the first and last names of a lot of the birthdays he forever is announcing and the owners of his favorite restaurants even though as he admits he often talks about the score or the game, but after 38 years of announcing games and after a 13-year playing career with championship Yankee teams few seem to care about this either, well, White was in the audience and stood up and said \"Grits\".''</blockquote>\n\nIn 1999, the minor league Staten Island Yankees named their mascot \"Scooter the Holy Cow\", after Rizzuto.<ref>[http://www.newviewgraphics.com/mascots/scooter.html Scooter the Holy Cow], newviewgraphics.com.

His last public appearance came early in 2006; visibly frail, he announced that he was putting much of his memorabilia on the market. In September 2006, Rizzuto's 1950 MVP plaque fetched $175,000, three of his [[World Series ring]]s sold for $84,825, and a Yankee cap with a wad of chewing gum on it went for $8,190.

Rizzuto made four more appearances on the program, three as a guest panelist in the 1956\u20131957 season following his retirement, and one in 1970 as the Mystery Guest on a later incarnation of the quiz show. Rizzuto also made various television appearances on programs such as [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[To Tell The Truth]]'' and ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]''.\n*Rizzuto is the announcer who provides the [[play-by-play]] commentary during the long spoken [[bridge (music)|bridge]] in [[Meat Loaf]]'s 1977 song \"[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]].\" Ostensibly an account of a baseball sequence, it actually describes the singer's step-by-step efforts to engage in coitus with a young woman (voiced by actress and singer [[Ellen Foley]]). When Rizzuto recorded his piece, he was reportedly unaware of how his spoken contribution would be used. When the song broke, Rizzuto said his parish priest called him in shock. However, \"Phil was no dummy\", said singer Meat Loaf. \"He knew exactly what was going on, and he told me such. He was just getting some heat from a priest and felt like he had to do something. I totally understood.\" Years later, Rizzuto would laughingly retell the story saying he got snookered by Meat Loaf, but he had a good attitude about it and when Meat Loaf asked him to go on tour with him, Rizzuto was flattered but declined, jokingly saying that Cora would \"kill him\" if he did.
