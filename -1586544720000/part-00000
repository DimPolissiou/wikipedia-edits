She specializes in environmental philosophy and activism. She has also published on the sustainability movement, climate change politics, activist culture, and creative practice.\n\n==Biography==\nParr was born in Sydney Australia. Her father, [[Mike Parr]], and her aunt, [[Julie Rrap]], are contemporary Australian artists who introduced Parr to the world of activist culture at an early age.\n\nShe completed her bachelor's degree with First Class Honors in Philosophy at Deakin University in 1998, followed by a Master's in Philosophy in 2000. She began her PhD studies under the direction of the feminist philosopher Clair Colebrook. Parr's PhD dissertation \"Creative Production: From Da Vinci to Deleuze\u201d was revised and published by Edwin Mellen Press in 2003.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2006 she was a professor of cultural criticism at Savannah College of Art and Design. Whilst in Savannah, Parr co-founded (with [[Avantika Bawa]] and Celina Jeffery) [http://drainmag.com/about/ Drain: A Journal of Contemporary Art and Culture].\n\nIn 2006 she moved to the University of Cincinnati. Parr was a tenured Full Professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Political Science and the School of Architecture and the Interior Design at the University of Cincinnati. In 2011 she was awarded the [https://www.uc.edu/fellows/recipients.html Rieveschl Award for Scholarly and Creative Work].<ref>{{cite web|title=Past Rieveschl Award Recipients|url=https://www.uc.edu/fellows/recipients.html|website=The Fellows of the Graduate School|publisher=University Cincinnati|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref> This distinguished award recognizes a University of Cincinnati faculty for professional achievement in creative and scholarly work.  In 2013, she was appointed Director of The Charles Phelps Taft Research Center and Chair of Taft Faculty.\n\nIn 2013, Parr was one of the speakers at the \"[http://www.fox19.com/story/22424235/cincinnati-joins-national-march-against-monsanto-movement March Against Monsanto]\" rally held in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The protest also spotlighted the companies that use genetically modified [http://www.wsmv.com/story/22424235/cincinnati-joins-national-march-against-monsanto-movement food].\n\nIn that same year (2013), Parr, along with Dr. Dion Dionysiou (also of the University of Cincinnati) were appointed as UNESCO Co-Chairs Co-Chairs of Water Accessibility and Sustainability.  In July 2017, Parr was one of the founding signatories for the [https://genevaactions.org/signatories Geneva Actions on Human Water Security].

In her capacity as a UNESCO water chair, she is strong advocate for water justice.

Again on public radio she speaks of the connection between [[environmental racism]] and the struggles of Native American communities to survive the rising seas and the contamination of their water supplies. Later, in a television interview with the Newsmakers, Parr describes Hurricane Harvey as more of a man-made than a natural disaster.\n\nIn an [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/opinion/our-crime-against-the-planet-and-ourselves.html interview] for The New York Times with journalist Natasha Lennard, Parr discusses how environmental damage and climate change are not only forms violence but a crime against humanity. In his [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/opinion/humans-in-dark-times.html op-ed] in The New York Times [[Brad Evans (author)|Brad Evans]], the founder/director of the [https://www.historiesofviolence.com/ Histories of Violence Project] expanded upon Parr's framework of climate violence explaining that environmental degradation is a crime against humanity.  Evans writes, Parr \"also posed the question of what a crime against humanity actually means in such a context. It turns out, there are many ways in which damage to the environment rises to that level. This type of violence presents profound existential questions about what it means to be human and the ontological crimes (i.e., a crime against the human as such) some of us wage against ourselves.\"\n\n==Films==\nIn 2016, Parr produced, wrote, and narrated her first documentary, ''The Intimate Realities of Water''.   Parr co-directed the film with Sean Hughes.  In addition, Sean Hughes was the editor and Jon Hughes, his father was the director of photography. When the documentary was released in 2016, it was screened it was screened at numerous independent film festivals in the United States where it went on to win 13 awards.\n\nThe film follows the lives of four women living in the slums of Nairobi, documenting the water and sanitation challenges they face. National public radio featured an [http://wvxu.org/post/uc-professors-talk-about-their-documentary-intimate-realities-water#stream/0 interview] with Parr and the film team where they discussed the making of the film.\n\nFrom 2014-2017 Parr produced and directed the TAFTtalks and H2Otalks series.  TAFTtalks concentrate on drawing out issues of interest beyond the academy and focus on big, contemporary ideas, and concerns.  Among those she has interviewed for TAFTtalks include Tara Houska and [http://www.rosibraidotti.com/ Rosi Braidotti].  Houska is a staunch activist of Native American rights.  She is an Ojibwe of Saulteaux, Couchiching First Nation and is the founding board member of Not Your Mascots. Houska was also the Native American adviser for Bernie Sanders, during his presidential campaign, and Houska is the National Campaigns Director for Honor the Earth.  Braidotti is a Distinguished University Professor and the director of the Centre for the Humanities at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n\nThe H2Otalks were featured as a part of the 50th anniversary of the UNESCO Water Programmes during the 38th UNESCO General Conference, as part of the \"50 Years, 50 Movies on Water,\" in November 2015.  Those she has interviewed include prominent environmentalist [http://www.billmckibben.com/ Bill McKibben].\n\n== Writing ==\nParr has published numerous books on environmental politics, the built environment, and cultural production.\n\n*{{cite book|title=Birth of a New Earth|date=212|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231180098|location=New York City, New York|last1=Parr|first1=Adrian}} \n**Her most recent book, ''Birth Of A New Earth'', was published by Columbia University Press in 2017.  In his endorsement of the book, 350.org founder [[Bill McKibben]] writes \"As Adrian Parr suggests in timely fashion, imagination may be the best weapon we have in the fight against environmental destruction, as useful as a new engine or a bigger windmill.\"  [[Ananya Roy]], author of ''Poverty Capital: Microfinance and the Making of Development'', describes Parr's book, as \"one that not only provides a rigorous and critical analysis of emergent environmentalisms but also charts how imaginations of a 'new earth' can be forged at the limits of liberal democracy.  In this sense, the book is as much about the political as it is about the environmental.  It is a must-read for our times.\" [[Henry Giroux]], author of ''America at War with Itself'', noted that \"''Birth Of A New Earth'' is one of those rare and brilliant books that critiques the ongoing destruction of the environment in a writing style that is lyrical compassionate and as accessible as it is informative. Parr masterfully weaves together a language of critique and possibility and in doing so makes a convincing case of environmental and economic justice on a global scale and offers a powerful argument for rethinking the meaning and practice of politics.\" The book explores how activists and popular movements are fighting the environmental crisis of climate change and the ongoing devastation of the earth.  The influence of the growing environment can be seen in how corporate mission statements, government policy, and national security agendas now focus much more on sustainability.  Parr maintains political scenarios for change often pursue either a revolutionary platform or a reformist agenda.  She argues these are false choices as she advocates for an emancipatory political imagination, maintaining that environmental politics engages the twofold problem of democratization and decolonization. \n*{{cite book|title=The Wrath of Capital: Neoliberalism and Climate Change Politics|date=212|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231158289|location=New York City, New York|last1=Parr|first1=Adrian}} \n**This monograph has also been commended by a number of experts in the environmental profession.  [[Raj Patel]], the author of the two books ''Stuffed and Starved'' and the ''Value of Nothing,'' said of Parr's book, \"With this short, pointed, and very welcome text, Parr blends political theory and startling fact to refresh our understanding about the capitalist roots of environmental change.\"  Parr's work investigates the intersection of social and environmental justice issues, arguing that the neoliberalism framework is hurting climate change talks and policy. Parr concentrates on how those with the most economic power continue to have control over the environmental change discourse. Many scholars felt this work contributed greatly to the field.  In positive review of this work, M. M. Gunter Jr., of Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., wrote Parr \u201cpresents an engaging, hard-cutting critique of neoliberalism, arguing more transformative politics are needed to address climate change and sustainability problems worldwide but that a \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 of market mechanisms under the dominant neoliberal paradigm prevents viable alternatives from emerging.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gunter Jr.|first=M.M.|date=August 2013|title=Book Review of the Wrath of Capital: Neoliberalism and Climate Change Politics|url=http://www.cro3.org/content/50/12/50-7016.full|journal=Choice Reviews Online|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>  In Global Environmental Politics, Rebecca Pearse, a research associate working on the Global Arenas of Knowledge at the University of Sydney, also writes that the book gives scholars and activists, who are looking for an introduction of leftist critiques on environmental politics, will receive a good summary from Parr\u2019s book.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pearse|first=R.|date=2014|title=Book Review|url=|journal=Global Environmental Politics|volume=14|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>  Critical of this work, John Bellamy Foster, a sociology professor at the University of Oregon, writes in \u201cContemporary Sociology,\u201d Parr \u201cconfuses matters by providing seemingly conflicting definitions of \u2018neoliberalism,\u2019 which she describes as (1) \u2018a more virulent strain\u2019 of the liberalism inherited from Adam Smith,\u2019 (2) \u2018a cultural mode of production that in turn defines the political economy,\u2019 and (3) a particular \u2018agenda.'\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=J.B.|date=2015|title=The Climate Movement: Environmental Sociology, Climate Change, and the Left|url=|journal=Contemporary Sociology|volume=44|issue=3|pages=314\u2013321|doi=10.1177/0094306115579190a|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>  He says Parr allows readers to use words such as \u201ccapital,\u201d \u201ccapitalism, and \u201cthe law of value,\u201d interchangeably, when the three words have three, different meanings.  Ryder W. Miller, a freelance environmental and science reporter based in San Francisco, writes in the Electronic Green Journal (2013), that Parr focuses too much on drawbacks of the environmental movement and does not acknowledge all the achievements of the movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=R.|date=2013|title=Book Review|url=|journal=Electronic Green Journal|publisher=|volume=1|issue=35|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> \n*{{cite book|title=New directions in sustainable design|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415780373|location=London|editor1-last=Parr|editor1-first=Adrian|editor2-last=Zaretsky|editor2-first=Michael}}\n**Along with Michael Zaretsky, also a University of Cincinnati professor, Parr edited this anthology on sustainable design and development initiatives, combining the viewpoints of practitioners and scholars.  The central idea is that sustainable design is not merely about material production but also about changing the way people live, their relationship to the world, and one another.  This text combines a number of essays from recognized experts in sustainability practices, in theory and design to construction, on order to develop a comprehensive approach to thinking, designing, building, and living sustainably.

She uses five examples of where the capitalists are hijacking sustainability: corporate image-greening, Hollywood activism, gated communities, the greening of the White House, and the incongruous efforts to achieve a \u2018sustainable\u2019 army. These examples are also used to help explain how architecture, especially urban spaces, add to global inequality by contributing more distinct boundaries between areas with and without poverty.

She specializes in environmental philosophy and activism. She has also published on the sustainability movement, climate change politics, activist culture, and creative practice.\n\n==Biography==\nParr was born in Sydney Australia. Her father, [[Mike Parr]], and her aunt, [[Julie Rrap]], are contemporary Australian artists who introduced Parr to the world of activist culture at an early age.\n\nShe completed her bachelor's degree with First Class Honors in Philosophy at Deakin University in 1998, followed by a Master's in Philosophy in 2000. She began her PhD studies under the direction of the feminist philosopher Clair Colebrook. Parr's PhD dissertation \"Creative Production: From Da Vinci to Deleuze\u201d was revised and published by Edwin Mellen Press in 2003.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2006 she was a professor of cultural criticism at Savannah College of Art and Design. Whilst in Savannah, Parr co-founded (with [[Avantika Bawa]] and Celina Jeffery) [http://drainmag.com/about/ Drain: A Journal of Contemporary Art and Culture].\n\nIn 2006 she moved to the University of Cincinnati. Parr was a tenured Full Professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Political Science and the School of Architecture and the Interior Design at the University of Cincinnati. In 2011 she was awarded the [https://www.uc.edu/fellows/recipients.html Rieveschl Award for Scholarly and Creative Work].<ref>{{cite web|title=Past Rieveschl Award Recipients|url=https://www.uc.edu/fellows/recipients.html|website=The Fellows of the Graduate School|publisher=University Cincinnati|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref> This distinguished award recognizes a University of Cincinnati faculty for professional achievement in creative and scholarly work.  In 2013, she was appointed Director of The Charles Phelps Taft Research Center and Chair of Taft Faculty.\n\nIn 2013, Parr was one of the speakers at the \"[http://www.fox19.com/story/22424235/cincinnati-joins-national-march-against-monsanto-movement March Against Monsanto]\" rally held in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Again on public radio she speaks of the connection between [[environmental racism]] and the struggles of Native American communities to survive the rising seas and the contamination of their water supplies. Later, in a television interview with the Newsmakers, Parr describes Hurricane Harvey as more of a man-made than a natural disaster.\n\nIn an [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/opinion/our-crime-against-the-planet-and-ourselves.html interview] for The New York Times with journalist Natasha Lennard, Parr discusses how environmental damage and climate change are not only forms violence but a crime against humanity. In his [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/opinion/humans-in-dark-times.html op-ed] in The New York Times [[Brad Evans (author)|Brad Evans]], the founder/director of the [https://www.historiesofviolence.com/ Histories of Violence Project] expanded upon Parr's framework of climate violence explaining that environmental degradation is a crime against humanity.  Evans writes, Parr \"also posed the question of what a crime against humanity actually means in such a context. It turns out, there are many ways in which damage to the environment rises to that level. This type of violence presents profound existential questions about what it means to be human and the ontological crimes (i.e., a crime against the human as such) some of us wage against ourselves.\"\n\n==Films==\nIn 2016, Parr produced, wrote, and narrated her first documentary, ''The Intimate Realities of Water''.   Parr co-directed the film with Sean Hughes.  In addition, Sean Hughes was the editor and Jon Hughes, his father was the director of photography. When the documentary was released in 2016, it was screened it was screened at numerous independent film festivals in the United States where it went on to win 13 awards.\n\nThe film follows the lives of four women living in the slums of Nairobi, documenting the water and sanitation challenges they face. National public radio featured an [http://wvxu.org/post/uc-professors-talk-about-their-documentary-intimate-realities-water#stream/0 interview] with Parr and the film team where they discussed the making of the film.\n\nFrom 2014-2017 Parr produced and directed the TAFTtalks and H2Otalks series.  TAFTtalks concentrate on drawing out issues of interest beyond the academy and focus on big, contemporary ideas, and concerns.  Among those she has interviewed for TAFTtalks include Tara Houska and [http://www.rosibraidotti.com/ Rosi Braidotti].  Houska is a staunch activist of Native American rights.  She is an Ojibwe of Saulteaux, Couchiching First Nation and is the founding board member of Not Your Mascots. Houska was also the Native American adviser for Bernie Sanders, during his presidential campaign, and Houska is the National Campaigns Director for Honor the Earth.  Braidotti is a Distinguished University Professor and the director of the Centre for the Humanities at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n\nThe H2Otalks were featured as a part of the 50th anniversary of the UNESCO Water Programmes during the 38th UNESCO General Conference, as part of the \"50 Years, 50 Movies on Water,\" in November 2015.  Those she has interviewed include prominent environmentalist [http://www.billmckibben.com/ Bill McKibben].\n\n== Writing ==\nParr has published numerous books on environmental politics, the built environment, and cultural production.\n\n*{{cite book|title=Birth of a New Earth|date=212|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231180098|location=New York City, New York|last1=Parr|first1=Adrian}} \n**Her most recent book, ''Birth Of A New Earth'', was published by Columbia University Press in 2017.  In his endorsement of the book, 350.org founder [[Bill McKibben]] writes \"As Adrian Parr suggests in timely fashion, imagination may be the best weapon we have in the fight against environmental destruction, as useful as a new engine or a bigger windmill.\"  [[Ananya Roy]], author of ''Poverty Capital: Microfinance and the Making of Development'', describes Parr's book, as \"one that not only provides a rigorous and critical analysis of emergent environmentalisms but also charts how imaginations of a 'new earth' can be forged at the limits of liberal democracy.  In this sense, the book is as much about the political as it is about the environmental.  It is a must-read for our times.\" [[Henry Giroux]], author of ''America at War with Itself'', noted that \"''Birth Of A New Earth'' is one of those rare and brilliant books that critiques the ongoing destruction of the environment in a writing style that is lyrical compassionate and as accessible as it is informative. Parr masterfully weaves together a language of critique and possibility and in doing so makes a convincing case of environmental and economic justice on a global scale and offers a powerful argument for rethinking the meaning and practice of politics.\" The book explores how activists and popular movements are fighting the environmental crisis of climate change and the ongoing devastation of the earth.  The influence of the growing environment can be seen in how corporate mission statements, government policy, and national security agendas now focus much more on sustainability.  Parr maintains political scenarios for change often pursue either a revolutionary platform or a reformist agenda.  She argues these are false choices as she advocates for an emancipatory political imagination, maintaining that environmental politics engages the twofold problem of democratization and decolonization. \n*{{cite book|title=The Wrath of Capital: Neoliberalism and Climate Change Politics|date=212|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231158289|location=New York City, New York|last1=Parr|first1=Adrian}} \n**This monograph has also been commended by a number of experts in the environmental profession.  [[Raj Patel]], the author of the two books ''Stuffed and Starved'' and the ''Value of Nothing,'' said of Parr's book, \"With this short, pointed, and very welcome text, Parr blends political theory and startling fact to refresh our understanding about the capitalist roots of environmental change.\"  Parr's work investigates the intersection of social and environmental justice issues, arguing that the neoliberalism framework is hurting climate change talks and policy. Parr concentrates on how those with the most economic power continue to have control over the environmental change discourse. Many scholars felt this work contributed greatly to the field.  In positive review of this work, M. M. Gunter Jr., of Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., wrote Parr \u201cpresents an engaging, hard-cutting critique of neoliberalism, arguing more transformative politics are needed to address climate change and sustainability problems worldwide but that a \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 of market mechanisms under the dominant neoliberal paradigm prevents viable alternatives from emerging.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gunter Jr.|first=M.M.|date=August 2013|title=Book Review of the Wrath of Capital: Neoliberalism and Climate Change Politics|url=http://www.cro3.org/content/50/12/50-7016.full|journal=Choice Reviews Online|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>  In Global Environmental Politics, Rebecca Pearse, a research associate working on the Global Arenas of Knowledge at the University of Sydney, also writes that the book gives scholars and activists, who are looking for an introduction of leftist critiques on environmental politics, will receive a good summary from Parr\u2019s book.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pearse|first=R.|date=2014|title=Book Review|url=|journal=Global Environmental Politics|volume=14|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>  Critical of this work, John Bellamy Foster, a sociology professor at the University of Oregon, writes in \u201cContemporary Sociology,\u201d Parr \u201cconfuses matters by providing seemingly conflicting definitions of \u2018neoliberalism,\u2019 which she describes as (1) \u2018a more virulent strain\u2019 of the liberalism inherited from Adam Smith,\u2019 (2) \u2018a cultural mode of production that in turn defines the political economy,\u2019 and (3) a particular \u2018agenda.'\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=J.B.|date=2015|title=The Climate Movement: Environmental Sociology, Climate Change, and the Left|url=|journal=Contemporary Sociology|volume=44|issue=3|pages=314\u2013321|doi=10.1177/0094306115579190a|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>  He says Parr allows readers to use words such as \u201ccapital,\u201d \u201ccapitalism, and \u201cthe law of value,\u201d interchangeably, when the three words have three, different meanings.  Ryder W.

The central idea is that sustainable design is not merely about material production but also about changing the way people live, their relationship to the world, and one another.  This text combines a number of essays from recognized experts in sustainability practices, in theory and design to construction, on order to develop a comprehensive approach to thinking, designing, building, and living sustainably.

She uses five examples of where the capitalists are hijacking sustainability: corporate image-greening, Hollywood activism, gated communities, the greening of the White House, and the incongruous efforts to achieve a \u2018sustainable\u2019 army. These examples are also used to help explain how architecture, especially urban spaces, add to global inequality by contributing more distinct boundaries between areas with and without poverty.

The survival period used varies from company to company, however, 14 days is the most typical survival period used. In the Australian market, survival periods are set between 8 \u2013 14 days.\n\nThe contract terms contain specific rules that define when a [[diagnosis]] of a critical illness is considered valid. It may state that the diagnosis need be made by a physician who specialises in that illness or condition, or it may name specific tests, e.g. EKG changes of a myocardial infarction, that confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn some markets, however, the definition of a claim for many of the diseases and conditions have become standardised, thus all insurers would use the same claims definition. The standardisation of the claims definitions may serve many purposes including increased clarity of cover for policyholders and greater comparability of policies from different life offices. For example, in the UK the [[Association of British Insurers]] (ABI) has issued a ''Statement of Best Practise'' which includes a number of standard definitions for common critical illnesses.\n\nThere are alternative forms of critical illness insurance to the lump sum cash payment model. These critical illness insurance policies directly pay health providers for the treatment costs of critical and life-threatening illnesses covered by the policyholder\u2019s insurance policy, including the fee of specialists and procedures at a select group of high-ranking hospitals up to a certain amount per episode of treatment as set out in the policy.\n\n==First critical illness product==\n\nCritical illness insurance was founded by [[Marius Barnard (surgeon)|Dr Marius Barnard]],<ref>{{Citation | title=Heart to Heart | newspaper=CoverTen | publisher=Incisive Financial Publishing | pages=11\u201312 | date=10 October 2007 | url=http://db.riskwaters.com/data/cover/pdf/cover_supp_1007.pdf | access-date=15 October 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719150446/http://db.riskwaters.com/data/cover/pdf/cover_supp_1007.pdf | archive-date=19 July 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref> with the first critical illness product being launched on 6 October 1983 in [[South Africa]], under the name '''dread disease insurance'''.\n\nThis form of insurance originally covered four primary human health conditions<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Matt |title=What is Critical Illness Insurance |url=https://protectcritical.com/what-is-critical-illness-insurance/ |website=Protect Critical |accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref>:\n\n*Cancer\n*Stroke\n*Heart attack\n*Coronary bypass surgery\n\nSince 1983, the cover has been accepted into many insurance markets around the world. Other names of the insurance cover include: '''trauma insurance''', '''serious illness insurance''' and '''living assurance'''.\n\n==Conditions covered==\n\nThe schedule of insured illnesses varies between insurance companies. In 1983, four conditions were covered by the policy, i.e. heart attack, cancer, stroke and coronary artery by-pass surgery.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Critical Illness Insurance: Past, present and future | publisher=Marius Barnard | year=2004 | url=http://www.actuaries.org.uk/sites/all/files/documents/pdf/Barnard.pdf | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707092303/http://www.actuaries.org.uk/sites/all/files/documents/pdf/Barnard.pdf | archivedate=2012-07-07 }}</ref>\n\nExamples of other conditions that might be covered include:\n{{div col}}\n*Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n*Aortic surgery \n*Aplastic anaemia \n*Bacterial meningitis \n*Benign brain tumour \n*Blindness \n*Cancer (life-threatening) \n*Coma \n*Coronary artery- bypass surgery \n*Deafness \n*Heart attack \n*Heart valve replacement \n*Kidney failure \n*Loss of independent existence \n*Loss of limbs \n*Loss of speech \n*Major organ transplant \n*Major organ failure on waiting list \n*Motor neuron disease \n*Multiple sclerosis \n*Occupational HIV infection \n*Paralysis \n*Parkinson\u2019s disease \n*Severe burns \n*Stroke (Cerebrovascular accident) \n{{div col end}}\nRef: [https://www.canadalife.co.uk/group-insurance/group-critical-illness Canada Life Critical Illness Insurance Policy] \n\nDue to the fact that the incidence of a condition may decrease over time and both the diagnosis and treatment may improve over time, the financial need to cover some illnesses deemed critical a decade ago are no longer deemed necessary today. Likewise, some of the conditions covered today may no longer be needed a decade or so in the future.\n\nThe actual conditions covered depend on the market need for the cover, competition amongst insurers, as well as the policyholder's '''perceived''' value of the benefits offered. For these reasons conditions such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, among others, may become the norm cover provided in the future.\n\n==Need for critical illness cover==\n\nCritical illness cover was originally sold with the intention of providing financial protection to individuals following the diagnosis or treatment of an illness deemed critical. Critical illness may be purchased by individuals in conjunction with a [[life insurance]] or [[term assurance]] policy at the time of a residential purchase, known as a 'bolt-on' benefit.\n\nThe finances received could be used to:\n\n* pay for the costs of the care and treatment;\n* pay for recuperation aids;\n* replace any lost income due to a decreasing ability to earn; or even\n* fund for a change in lifestyle.\n\nThis insurance can provide financial protection to the policyholder or their dependents on the repayment of a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] due to the policyholder contracting a critical illness condition or on the death of the policyholder. In this type of product design, some insurers may choose to structure the product to repay a portion of the outstanding mortgage debt on the contracting of a critical illness, whilst the full outstanding mortgage debt would be repaid on the death of the policyholder. Alternatively, the full sum assured may be paid on diagnosis of the critical illness, but then no further payment is made on death, effectively making the critical illness payment an 'accelerated death payment'.\n\nSome employers may also take out critical illness insurance for their employees. This contract would be in the form of a group contract and has become an essential strategy used by employers around the world to both protect their employees financially as well as attract more employees to consider working for the company.\n\n==Alternative forms of critical illness insurance==\nTypical critical illness insurance products refer to policies where the insurer pays the policyholder a pre-determined lump sum cash payment if the policyholder is diagnosed with a critical illness listed in the policy. However, alternative forms of critical illness cover provide direct payment to health providers to cover the high medical costs in treating critical illnesses such as cancer, cardiovascular procedures and organ transplants. The maximum amount is set out in the insurance policy and defined per episode of treatment.\n\nThese critical illness insurance products generally pay hospitals directly to avoid policyholder\u2019s incurring out of pocket expenses and lengthy reimbursement processes. In most instances of this alternative to the lump sump critical illness insurance, policyholders may decide where they will receive treatment among a pre-selected group of hospitals.\n\nSome forms of critical illness insurance also offer policyholders the option to travel to highly specialised hospitals in other countries to receive treatment. These policies usually include travel and accommodation expenses for the policyholder and a companion, as well as other concierge services such as translators or personal nurses.\n\n==Assessing risk ==\n\nApplicants are assessed for risk by a process of underwriting.  Underwriting may take place in an automated underwriting computer filtering system.  However the most detailed and holistic underwriting is still performed by experienced life insurance underwriters.\n\nThe underwriting process for critical illness is similar to life insurance underwriting in that it takes into account factors such as age, gender, smoking status, past medical history, family history, alcohol consumption, and body mass index.  In the case of critical illness however, there is an increased emphasis on family history, smoking and bodymass index are risk factors that can demonstrate a marked increase risk with respect to critical illness cover.\n\nHaving underwritten an applicant in full, an underwriter can decide to accept the risk at the standard rate, or they may decide than an extra charge is warranted, or they may decide to apply exclusions of particular illnesses.  If there is any amendment by an underwriter to the terms of acceptance, this has to be agreed by the applicant before the policy can proceed to issue.\n\n==World markets==\n\nIn [[South Africa]], the [[UK]], [[Ireland]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], critical illness insurance has become a well established form of insurance.\n\nCritical illness insurance continues to grow in popularity and has recently been accepted into other territories including the [[far east]] and the [[United States]].\n\nIn markets where the product is newer, many insurers choose to use the expertise of reinsurers with worldwide exposure as well as overseas insurers who have sold the product for a number of years. The expertise may come in the form of data provided as well as assistance with the product design features of the product.\n\n=== Australia ===\nCritical Illness insurance, also known as Trauma Insurance in [[Australia]] is characterised by lump sum payments for listed medical events. Unlike in the [[United Kingdom]], Trauma Insurance conditions are not standardised and market competition is based on both premium and policy definitions. It is not uncommon for an Australian Trauma Insurance policy to list 40+ definitions, including Cancer, Heart Attack, Strokes. Around 85% of Trauma Insurance claims paid in Australia are for either Cancer or Heart Disease. It is not uncommon for policies to also offer partial payments, if the condition suffered does not meet the full definition required for a full claim payout.\n\nTrauma Insurance policies in Australia are most commonly linked to [[Life Insurance]] policies, however can be taken as a stand-alone policy and where a Trauma Insurance policy is linked, it will normally deduct the balance of the insured Life Insurance amount.\n\nTrauma Insurance policies in Australia when used to provide personal protection, are generally not tax deductible and any claim proceeds are not taxable. Trauma Insurance is not offered in [[Superannuation]] as the definitions available for payment do not always align with the required conditions of release.\n\n=== Canada ===\nCritical illness insurance options available in Canada:\n\n* ROP - Return of premium.  If you do not claim a critical illness you can request a return of premium as long as you have fulfilled the minimum time period specified within the policy.\n* ROPD - Return of premium on Death.  Your premiums are returned to your estate. The ROPD is an optional \n* Term CI - Similar to term life insurance, this critical illness insurance increases in premium cost at the start of each new term.  A term is generally 10 years. Term CI expires at age 75 (varies by insurance company).\n* Permanent CI - Permanent critical illness insurance is a level term insurance, which means the premiums do not change.  Permanent CI does not expire unless requested by the client, or failure to pay.\n* Second Event.  If there is a second critical illness you receive 50% of the policy benefit over and above the base benefit.  Second event is an optional rider.\n* Waiver of premium.  The premium are waived if you are disabled. Waiver of premium is an optional rider.\n\n=== United States ===\nCurrently 5 million policies are in force.  Some 1.5 million policies or certificates were purchased in 2018.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Life insurance]]\n*[[Total permanent disability insurance]]\n*[[Health insurance]]\n*[[Health insurance in the United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n[[Category:Health insurance]]\n[[Category:Health economics]]\n[[Category:Insurance law]]\n[[Category:Types of insurance]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{COI|date=July 2011}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2011}}\n}}\n\n'''Critical illness insurance''', otherwise known as '''critical illness cover''' or a '''dread disease policy''', is an [[insurance]] product in which the insurer is contracted to typically make a lump sum cash payment if the policyholder is diagnosed with one of the specific illnesses on a predetermined list as part of an [[insurance policy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Woodfield |first=KR |title=Don't Buy That Health Insurance: Become an Educated Healthcare Consumer |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing, LLC|year=2012 |isbn=1457515326}}</ref>\n\nThe policy may also be structured to pay out regular income and the payout may also be on the policyholder undergoing a surgical procedure, for example, having a heart bypass operation.\n\nThe policy may require the policyholder to survive a minimum number of days (the ''survival period'') from when the illness was first diagnosed.

In 1983, four conditions were covered by the policy, i.e. heart attack, cancer, stroke and coronary artery by-pass surgery.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Critical Illness Insurance: Past, present and future | publisher=Marius Barnard | year=2004 | url=http://www.actuaries.org.uk/sites/all/files/documents/pdf/Barnard.pdf | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707092303/http://www.actuaries.org.uk/sites/all/files/documents/pdf/Barnard.pdf | archivedate=2012-07-07 }}</ref>\n\nExamples of other conditions that might be covered include:\n{{div col}}\n*Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n*Aortic surgery \n*Aplastic anaemia \n*Bacterial meningitis \n*Benign brain tumour \n*Blindness \n*Cancer (life-threatening) \n*Coma \n*Coronary artery- bypass surgery \n*Deafness \n*Heart attack \n*Heart valve replacement \n*Kidney failure \n*Loss of independent existence \n*Loss of limbs \n*Loss of speech \n*Major organ transplant \n*Major organ failure on waiting list \n*Motor neuron disease \n*Multiple sclerosis \n*Occupational HIV infection \n*Paralysis \n*Parkinson\u2019s disease \n*Severe burns \n*Stroke (Cerebrovascular accident) \n{{div col end}}\nRef: [https://www.canadalife.co.uk/group-insurance/group-critical-illness Canada Life Critical Illness Insurance Policy] \n\nDue to the fact that the incidence of a condition may decrease over time and both the diagnosis and treatment may improve over time, the financial need to cover some illnesses deemed critical a decade ago are no longer deemed necessary today. Likewise, some of the conditions covered today may no longer be needed a decade or so in the future.\n\nThe actual conditions covered depend on the market need for the cover, competition amongst insurers, as well as the policyholder's '''perceived''' value of the benefits offered. For these reasons conditions such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, among others, may become the norm cover provided in the future.\n\n==Need for critical illness cover==\n\nCritical illness cover was originally sold with the intention of providing financial protection to individuals following the diagnosis or treatment of an illness deemed critical. Critical illness may be purchased by individuals in conjunction with a [[life insurance]] or [[term assurance]] policy at the time of a residential purchase, known as a 'bolt-on' benefit.\n\nThe finances received could be used to:\n\n* pay for the costs of the care and treatment;\n* pay for recuperation aids;\n* replace any lost income due to a decreasing ability to earn; or even\n* fund for a change in lifestyle.\n\nThis insurance can provide financial protection to the policyholder or their dependents on the repayment of a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] due to the policyholder contracting a critical illness condition or on the death of the policyholder. In this type of product design, some insurers may choose to structure the product to repay a portion of the outstanding mortgage debt on the contracting of a critical illness, whilst the full outstanding mortgage debt would be repaid on the death of the policyholder. Alternatively, the full sum assured may be paid on diagnosis of the critical illness, but then no further payment is made on death, effectively making the critical illness payment an 'accelerated death payment'.\n\nSome employers may also take out critical illness insurance for their employees. This contract would be in the form of a group contract and has become an essential strategy used by employers around the world to both protect their employees financially as well as attract more employees to consider working for the company.\n\n==Alternative forms of critical illness insurance==\nTypical critical illness insurance products refer to policies where the insurer pays the policyholder a pre-determined lump sum cash payment if the policyholder is diagnosed with a critical illness listed in the policy. However, alternative forms of critical illness cover provide direct payment to health providers to cover the high medical costs in treating critical illnesses such as cancer, cardiovascular procedures and organ transplants. The maximum amount is set out in the insurance policy and defined per episode of treatment.\n\nThese critical illness insurance products generally pay hospitals directly to avoid policyholder\u2019s incurring out of pocket expenses and lengthy reimbursement processes. In most instances of this alternative to the lump sump critical illness insurance, policyholders may decide where they will receive treatment among a pre-selected group of hospitals.\n\nSome forms of critical illness insurance also offer policyholders the option to travel to highly specialised hospitals in other countries to receive treatment. These policies usually include travel and accommodation expenses for the policyholder and a companion, as well as other concierge services such as translators or personal nurses.\n\n==Assessing risk ==\n\nApplicants are assessed for risk by a process of underwriting.  Underwriting may take place in an automated underwriting computer filtering system.  However the most detailed and holistic underwriting is still performed by experienced life insurance underwriters.\n\nThe underwriting process for critical illness is similar to life insurance underwriting in that it takes into account factors such as age, gender, smoking status, past medical history, family history, alcohol consumption, and body mass index.  In the case of critical illness however, there is an increased emphasis on family history, smoking and bodymass index are risk factors that can demonstrate a marked increase risk with respect to critical illness cover.\n\nHaving underwritten an applicant in full, an underwriter can decide to accept the risk at the standard rate, or they may decide than an extra charge is warranted, or they may decide to apply exclusions of particular illnesses.  If there is any amendment by an underwriter to the terms of acceptance, this has to be agreed by the applicant before the policy can proceed to issue.\n\n==World markets==\n\nIn [[South Africa]], the [[UK]], [[Ireland]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], critical illness insurance has become a well established form of insurance.\n\nCritical illness insurance continues to grow in popularity and has recently been accepted into other territories including the [[far east]] and the [[United States]].\n\nIn markets where the product is newer, many insurers choose to use the expertise of reinsurers with worldwide exposure as well as overseas insurers who have sold the product for a number of years. The expertise may come in the form of data provided as well as assistance with the product design features of the product.\n\n=== Australia ===\nCritical Illness insurance, also known as Trauma Insurance in [[Australia]] is characterised by lump sum payments for listed medical events. Unlike in the [[United Kingdom]], Trauma Insurance conditions are not standardised and market competition is based on both premium and policy definitions. It is not uncommon for an Australian Trauma Insurance policy to list 40+ definitions, including Cancer, Heart Attack, Strokes. Around 85% of Trauma Insurance claims paid in Australia are for either Cancer or Heart Disease. It is not uncommon for policies to also offer partial payments, if the condition suffered does not meet the full definition required for a full claim payout.\n\nTrauma Insurance policies in Australia are most commonly linked to [[Life Insurance]] policies, however can be taken as a stand-alone policy and where a Trauma Insurance policy is linked, it will normally deduct the balance of the insured Life Insurance amount.\n\nTrauma Insurance policies in Australia when used to provide personal protection, are generally not tax deductible and any claim proceeds are not taxable. Trauma Insurance is not offered in [[Superannuation]] as the definitions available for payment do not always align with the required conditions of release.\n\n=== Canada ===\nCritical illness insurance options available in Canada:\n\n* ROP - Return of premium.  If you do not claim a critical illness you can request a return of premium as long as you have fulfilled the minimum time period specified within the policy.\n* ROPD - Return of premium on Death.  Your premiums are returned to your estate. The ROPD is an optional \n* Term CI - Similar to term life insurance, this critical illness insurance increases in premium cost at the start of each new term.  A term is generally 10 years. Term CI expires at age 75 (varies by insurance company).\n* Permanent CI - Permanent critical illness insurance is a level term insurance, which means the premiums do not change.  Permanent CI does not expire unless requested by the client, or failure to pay.\n* Second Event.  If there is a second critical illness you receive 50% of the policy benefit over and above the base benefit.  Second event is an optional rider.\n* Waiver of premium.  The premium are waived if you are disabled. Waiver of premium is an optional rider.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Life insurance]]\n*[[Total permanent disability insurance]]\n*[[Health insurance]]\n*[[Health insurance in the United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n[[Category:Health insurance]]\n[[Category:Health economics]]\n[[Category:Insurance law]]\n[[Category:Types of insurance]]\n", "name_user": "Cislome", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding U.S. data<ref>American Association for Critical Illness Insurance</ref> https://www.criticalillnessinsuranceinfo.org", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_illness_insurance"}

He is best known for his role in the discovery of the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) as the [[pathogen|infectious agent]] responsible for [[AIDS|acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) and in the development of the HIV blood test, and he has been a major contributor to subsequent HIV research.\n\nGallo is the director and co-founder of the [[Institute of Human Virology]] (IHV) at the [[University of Maryland School of Medicine]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], established in 1996 in a partnership including the State of Maryland and the City of Baltimore. In November 2011, Gallo was named the first Homer & Martha Gudelsky Distinguished Professor in Medicine.

In 1976, Doris Morgan, a first year post-doctoral fellow in Gallo's lab, was asked by Gallo to examine culture fluid of activated lymphocytes for the possible production of growth factors. Soon she was successful in growing [[T lymphocyte]]s. Gallo, Morgan and Frank Ruscetti, another researcher in Gallo's lab, coauthored a paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' describing their method.<ref name=Morgan76>{{cite journal |vauthors=Morgan DA, Ruscetti FW, Gallo R |title=Selective in vitro growth of T lymphocytes from normal human bone marrows |journal=Science |volume=193 |issue=4257 |pages=1007\u20138 |date=September 1976 |pmid=181845 |doi=10.1126/science.181845|bibcode = 1976Sci...193.1007M }}</ref> The Gallo group identified this as T-cell growth factor (TCGF).
