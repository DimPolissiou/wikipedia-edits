He is a former [[lead guitarist]] of the [[rock and roll]] [[jam band]] [[The Black Crowes]], the former [[lead guitarist]] of [[The Magpie Salute]] and the leader of his own bands: Burning Tree, Marc Ford & The Neptune Blues Club, Jefferson Steelflex, Fuzz Machine and Marc Ford & The Sinners.\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\nFord was born in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]], United States.\n\n===Burning Tree===\nFord started out playing the Southern California/Los Angeles underground rock scene in the early/mid-eighties in bands such as Citadel, which later went by the names Citadel Ltd & Head. He also played guitar on the self-titled 1984 [[Extended play|EP]] by [[Jack Grisham]]'s post-[[T.S.O.L.]] band Cathedral of Tears, on which he is credited as \"Mark Ford\". He played in the L.A. side-project band Stronzo which featured Mickey Finn of Jetboy, Sami Yaffa of Hanoi Rocks/Jetboy, and various other musicians playing shows outside of their main bands, and in 1988 Ford played guitar for Michael Monroe at the Scream club, also with Sami Yaffa on bass, which was the first ever L.A. show for the former Hanoi Rocks singer. Ford also played with early Dogs D\u2019Amour/L.A. Guns man Robert Stoddard, and around this time was in Orange County band The Scarecrows.\n\nIn the late eighties, Citadel Ltd/Head evolved into the [[blues-rock]] outfit [[Burning Tree]], a power trio featuring Ford on guitars and vocals, Mark Dutton on bass and vocals, and Doni Gray on drums and vocals. Burning Tree released their self-titled debut album on [[Epic Records]] in 1990. A commercial failure but a critical success, ''Burning Tree'' allowed the group to tour extensively throughout most of 1990 and 1991. The band's career was cut short when Ford left to join the Black Crowes, for whom Burning Tree had opened on their first (and only) tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/burning-tree |title=Burning Tree: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\n===The Black Crowes===\nIn mid-1991, Marc Ford sat in a couple of times with the Black Crowes in concert, performing [[The Allman Brothers Band]]'s classic hit, \"Dreams\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crowesbase.com/tapelisting.cfm?TapeID=879 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904164855/http://crowesbase.com/tapelisting.cfm?TapeID=879 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-09-04 |title=17 May 1991 @ Chicago, IL |publisher=Crowesbase.com |date=1991-05-17 |accessdate=2014-06-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://crowesbase.com/tapelisting.cfm?TapeID=878 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115231017/http://crowesbase.com/tapelisting.cfm?TapeID=878 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-01-15 |title=18 May 1991 @ Milwaukee, WI |publisher=Crowesbase.com |date=1991-05-18 |accessdate=2014-06-04 }}</ref>\n\nWhen the Black Crowes severed their relationship with their original guitarist Jeff Cease, Ford was asked to fill the vacancy. He accepted the offer, and a few days later was asked by [[Slash (musician)|Slash]]  to join [[Guns n' Roses]]. Ford refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-16/entertainment/ca-1563_1_black-crowe |publisher=LaTimes.com |date=1991-11-16 |accessdate=2017-09-11 |title=O.C.

The album reached Number 1 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and earned a double platinum certificate for sales. Ford performed on the next two Black Crowes releases, ''[[Amorica]]'' (1994) and ''[[Three Snakes and One Charm]]'' (1996), and is also credited for tracks from the band's two unreleased albums (1993's ''Tall'' and 1997's ''Band'', later released together as ''[[The Lost Crowes]]''). His addition to the Black Crowes sound, which consisted primarily of [[slide guitar]] and [[southern rock|southern]] twang, helped define the band at the time. Ford's ability to adapt to core songwriter [[Rich Robinson]]'s music and crunchy [[rhythm guitar]] sound solidified him and Robinson as the preeminent guitar duo of the 1990s.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120907230033/http://www.roccaforteamps.com/marc_ford.htm|url-status=dead|title=http://www.roccaforteamps.com/marc_ford.htm] {{dead link|date=June 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring his time in the Black Crowes Ford also played slide guitar on British band Thee Hypnotics' 1994 album ''The Very Crystal Speed Machine'', produced by Chris Robinson.\n\nFord was dismissed from the Black Crowes in late 1997, following the band's stint on the summer-long Furthur Festival tour. Black Crowes leaders Chris and Rich Robinson cited Ford's excessive drug use as the reason for his firing, a reason that was confirmed by the guitarist entering a rehab facility soon after his dismissal.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Solo and collaborations===\nAfter his departure from the Black Crowes, Ford formed Marc Ford and the Uninvited. In 1998, he sat in numerous times with [[Gov't Mule]] before joining the Chris Stills Band for a summer tour. Upon the conclusion of that tour, Ford quit the Chris Stills Band to form Federale, a joint venture between himself and [[Luther Russell]] (who were eventually joined by drummer [[Jimi Bott]] and bassist [[Freddy Trujillo]]). The band gained attention from major label [[Interscope Records]]. Federale toured briefly, opening for acts like Gov't Mule, but disbanded after Interscope Records was bought out by [[Universal Music Group]].\n\nDuring 2000, Ford joined the [[Pink Floyd]]/[[blues]] [[jam band|jam]]/[[tribute band]] [[Blue Floyd]], which originally featured [[Allen Woody]] (guitar, bass), Matt Abts (drums), [[Johnny Neel]] (keyboards) and Berry Oakley Jr. (bass). Ford left Blue Floyd at the close of 2001, opting to again to go solo. In January 2002, [[Malibu, California]], Ford performed a set with [[Chris Robinson (singer)|Chris Robinson]], the first time Ford and Robinson had performed with one another since Ford's dismissal from the Black Crowes nearly five years prior. Robinson again joined Ford at the Malibu Inn two weeks later, confirming that they had made amends. Ford co-wrote \"Sunday Sound,\" a track featured on Robinson's solo debut, ''[[New Earth Mud]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/new-earth-mud-dvd-edition-mw0000225175 |title=New Earth Mud - Chris Robinson &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic.com |date=2002-10-22 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his acoustic-based stint at the Malibu Inn, Ford decided to form a full-fledged electric band. Featuring fellow Blue Floyd member Berry Oakley Jr. (bass) and newcomers Gootch (drums) and Chris Joyner (keys), Marc Ford and The Sinners hit the road in early 2002. During the tour, Ford often took time out (with and without The Sinners) to record tracks for his debut effort entitled ''It's About Time'', which was released on Anko Records in the fall of 2002.\n\nIn 2003, Marc Ford and The Sinners had an opening slot on Lucinda Williams' ongoing tour. Later that year, Ford accepted an invitation to join [[Ben Harper]] and the Innocent Criminals, relegating The Sinners to an indefinite hiatus. Ford toured with Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals for the majority of 2003, from which their live EP ''Live at the Hollywood Bowl'' was drawn. Ford continued his association with Ben Harper and his band through the close of 2004, featuring on Harper's collaboration with [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]], ''[[There Will Be a Light]]'', when he was called to rejoin The Black Crowes for their \"All Join Hands\" reunion run.\n\n===Black Crowes reunion===\nAfter a three-year hiatus, the Robinson brothers reformed the Black Crowes in early 2005 for a series of gigs and (later) a new album. In March 2005, it was announced that Marc Ford would be returning to the lead guitar spot. Ford never severed his ties with Harper, however, appearing on his 2006 album ''Both Sides of the Gun'' and performing a handful of shows in support while an active member of The Black Crowes.\n\nFord toured with the Black Crowes through the summer of 2006. Despite some new songs being debuted during live performances, no new studio material was released. On September 5, 2006, two days before he was due to hit the road for the fall leg of the ongoing Black Crowes reunion tour, Ford's lawyer notified the Black Crowes management via fax that, effective immediately, the guitarist would no longer be a member of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/headsup.asp?storyID=9094 |title=Marc Ford Quits Crowes On Jambase |publisher=Jambase.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> The following day, Ford put out a press release announcing that he had left the Crowes in order to protect his hard-fought sobriety, and that he had recently produced albums for emerging artists the Pawnshop Kings and [[Ryan Bingham]].\n\nFord confirmed in a November 2006 interview with ''Hittin' the Note'' magazine that he is contractually prohibited from discussing his time in the Black Crowes during the period of 2005-2006. In a later interview with the magazine, Ford revealed that this contractual limitation was \"in perpetuity.\"\n\n===Solo again===\nShortly after his sudden departure from the Black Crowes, Ford reunited with his Burning Tree bandmates for three gigs at the King King in [[Hollywood]], California. Following the impromptu dates, Ford enlisted Doni Gray as his bandmate, along with Muddy and his son Elijah Ford, for a new studio album he had begun preproduction on. Touted by the guitarist as a more guitar-based recording, ''[[Weary and Wired]]'' was released on March 13, 2007 on [[Shrapnel Records]]' subdivision Blues Bureau. Coinciding with the release of ''Weary and Wired'' was Ford's feature interview on the cover of [[jam-band]] oriented music magazine ''Hittin' the Note'' (Issue #52).\n\nThroughout 2007 Ford hit the road in support of his new album, with bandmates Mark \"Muddy\" Dutton, Elijah Ford and new drummer Dennis Morehouse. The tour found the band performing across the United States, as well as select dates in Spain, Germany, Russia and at a handful of European festivals. During later dates on the tour, Ford unveiled as many as six new songs, hinting at another album on the way. The tour continued through the end of 2007, when Ford took a short break.\n\nEarly in 2008, Ford played sporadic shows on the West Coast, some with his Fuzz Machine band and some with a new venture, Jefferson Steelflex. Ford and his son Elijah joined [[Ryan Bingham]] for several dates on his tour, performing songs from the Ford-produced album ''Mescalito.'' Ford played [[slide guitar]] on Bingham's appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in the summer of 2008.\n\nFord produced [[Steepwater Band]]'s next studio effort, an LP tentatively titled ''Grace & Melody'' released in November 2008, at Compound Studios in Signal Hill, California (recording began in the first week of May 2008).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Grace-Melody-The-Steepwater-Band/dp/B001O2OTOG |title=Amazon.com: Grace and Melody: The Steepwater Band: MP3 Downloads|publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2015-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/grace-and-melody-mw0001699309 |title=Grace and Melody - The Steepwater Band - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|publisher=AllMusic.com |accessdate=2015-01-02}}</ref> Ford first met the Chicago-based [[power trio]] when their bands shared a festival bill in Bilbao, Spain (in the summer of 2007). Ford joined the band on stage to jam on a pair of songs including a cover of [[Neil Young]]'s \"[[Cortez the Killer]]\", following a sit-in by his bandmate/son Elijah. Steepwater Band subsequently provided support for Ford's headlining gig at the Double Door in Chicago on July 26, 2007; this time Jeff Massey and Tod Bowers (of Steepwater Band) joined Ford's band for their encore. Soon after, Ford approached the trio about producing their next effort.\n\nIn early August 2008, it was announced (via his record label) that Ford's new record would be available online and in stores on September 23, 2008.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080914142643/http://www.shrapnelrecords.com/servlet/store?item=catalog&action=viewproduct&prodid=322] {{dead link|date=June 2018}}</ref> Entitled ''[[Marc Ford and the Neptune Blues Club]]'', the record features entirely new material performed by the newest incarnation of Ford's band the Neptune Blues Club (himself on guitars and vocals, Mike Malone on keyboards and vocals, Anthony Arvizu on drums, Bill Barrett on harmonica and John Bazz on upright bass). This latest version of his band is a slight reconfiguration of the Jefferson Steelflex band, which had performed earlier in the year prior to Ford's short stint with Ryan Bingham.\n\nDuring the latter part of 2008, Ford took up playing lead guitar at the Vineyard Community Church in Laguna Niguel, California. Via that gig, He produced and contributed guitar work to Vineyard Music artist [[Chris Lizotte]]'s album, ''Signal Hill Revival'', released in early 2009. Ford's association with both the church and Lizotte continues to the present day.\n\nIn early 2009, it was rumored that the Neptune Blues Club was working on its second record at Compound Studios. However, Ford's deal with Shrapnel Records' subsidiary Blues Bureau had expired after 2008's ''Neptune Blues Club'', and by mid-2009 it seemed that the Neptune Blues Club had expired with it. One sole track from the sessions, \"Shalomar Dreams,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theneptunebluesclub.bandcamp.com/ |title=Music &#124; Marc Ford & the Neptune Blues Club |publisher=Theneptunebluesclub.bandcamp.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> was released via online distributor BandCamp.com; it remains the only material released from the second album sessions to date.\n\nIn May 2009, it was revealed that Ford would be joining the touring band for blues artist [[Booker T. Jones]] (of [[Booker T. & the MG's]] fame). Ford was confirmed as the guitarist for June through September 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swampland.com/posts/view/title:marc_ford_joins_booker_t_jones_touring_band |title=Marc Ford Joins Booker T. Jones' Touring Band |publisher=Swampland |date=2009-05-16 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Ford launched a download site to showcase and facilitate the sale of his archive of [[soundboard recording]]s from his solo work. The shows released thus far focus entirely on the Neptune Blues Club. It is unclear if the site will cover other eras of Ford's solo career.\n\nIn February 2010, Ford released his fourth studio album, ''Fuzz Machine'', featuring material recorded while on a touring break in the fall of 2007 with the band of the same name. The album's release coincided with Ford's mini-tour of Spain, on which he utilized the Steepwater Band as his backing band. The tour prompted the launch of a new website for Ford, the central theme of which is based around the ''Fuzz Machine'' recording. The album was exclusively available at all of Ford's performances on the mini-tour, followed by online distribution in November.\n\nAfter producing Phantom Limb's ''The Pines'' album, Ford asked the band to return the favor by backing his own solo project. He signed with the Naim record label in the UK to release his next album, ''Holy Ghost'' on 14 April 2014. He announced the new album in ''[[Country Music (magazine)|Country Music]]'' magazine.\n\nIn 2015, Ford played on his friend, singer songwriter Craig Helmreich's, record (It's Just Craig's ''Blood On the Table'') which was recorded with John Vanderslice at Tiny Telephone in San Francisco.

He is a former [[lead guitarist]] of the [[rock and roll]] [[jam band]] [[The Black Crowes]], the former [[lead guitarist]] of the [[The Magpie Salute]] and the leader of his own bands: Burning Tree, Marc Ford & The Neptune Blues Club, Jefferson Steelflex, Fuzz Machine and Marc Ford & The Sinners.\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\nFord was born in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]], United States.\n\n===Burning Tree===\nFord started out playing the Southern California/Los Angeles underground rock scene in the early/mid-eighties in bands such as Citadel, which later went by the names Citadel Ltd & Head. He also played guitar on the self-titled 1984 [[Extended play|EP]] by [[Jack Grisham]]'s post-[[T.S.O.L.]] band Cathedral of Tears, on which he is credited as \"Mark Ford\". He played in the L.A. side-project band Stronzo which featured Mickey Finn of Jetboy, Sami Yaffa of Hanoi Rocks/Jetboy, and various other musicians playing shows outside of their main bands, and in 1988 Ford played guitar for Michael Monroe at the Scream club, also with Sami Yaffa on bass, which was the first ever L.A. show for the former Hanoi Rocks singer. Ford also played with early Dogs D\u2019Amour/L.A. Guns man Robert Stoddard, and around this time was in Orange County band The Scarecrows.\n\nIn the late eighties, Citadel Ltd/Head evolved into the [[blues-rock]] outfit [[Burning Tree]], a power trio featuring Ford on guitars and vocals, Mark Dutton on bass and vocals, and Doni Gray on drums and vocals. Burning Tree released their self-titled debut album on [[Epic Records]] in 1990. A commercial failure but a critical success, ''Burning Tree'' allowed the group to tour extensively throughout most of 1990 and 1991. The band's career was cut short when Ford left to join the Black Crowes, for whom Burning Tree had opened on their first (and only) tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/burning-tree |title=Burning Tree: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\n===The Black Crowes===\nIn mid-1991, Marc Ford sat in a couple of times with the Black Crowes in concert, performing [[The Allman Brothers Band]]'s classic hit, \"Dreams\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crowesbase.com/tapelisting.cfm?TapeID=879 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904164855/http://crowesbase.com/tapelisting.cfm?TapeID=879 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-09-04 |title=17 May 1991 @ Chicago, IL |publisher=Crowesbase.com |date=1991-05-17 |accessdate=2014-06-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://crowesbase.com/tapelisting.cfm?TapeID=878 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115231017/http://crowesbase.com/tapelisting.cfm?TapeID=878 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-01-15 |title=18 May 1991 @ Milwaukee, WI |publisher=Crowesbase.com |date=1991-05-18 |accessdate=2014-06-04 }}</ref>\n\nWhen the Black Crowes severed their relationship with their original guitarist Jeff Cease, Ford was asked to fill the vacancy. He accepted the offer, and a few days later was asked by [[Slash (musician)|Slash]]  to join [[Guns n' Roses]]. Ford refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-16/entertainment/ca-1563_1_black-crowe |publisher=LaTimes.com |date=1991-11-16 |accessdate=2017-09-11 |title=O.C.

The album reached Number 1 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and earned a double platinum certificate for sales. Ford performed on the next two Black Crowes releases, ''[[Amorica]]'' (1994) and ''[[Three Snakes and One Charm]]'' (1996), and is also credited for tracks from the band's two unreleased albums (1993's ''Tall'' and 1997's ''Band'', later released together as ''[[The Lost Crowes]]''). His addition to the Black Crowes sound, which consisted primarily of [[slide guitar]] and [[southern rock|southern]] twang, helped define the band at the time. Ford's ability to adapt to core songwriter [[Rich Robinson]]'s music and crunchy [[rhythm guitar]] sound solidified him and Robinson as the preeminent guitar duo of the 1990s.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120907230033/http://www.roccaforteamps.com/marc_ford.htm|url-status=dead|title=http://www.roccaforteamps.com/marc_ford.htm] {{dead link|date=June 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring his time in the Black Crowes Ford also played slide guitar on British band Thee Hypnotics' 1994 album ''The Very Crystal Speed Machine'', produced by Chris Robinson.\n\nFord was dismissed from the Black Crowes in late 1997, following the band's stint on the summer-long Furthur Festival tour. Black Crowes leaders Chris and Rich Robinson cited Ford's excessive drug use as the reason for his firing, a reason that was confirmed by the guitarist entering a rehab facility soon after his dismissal.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Solo and collaborations===\nAfter his departure from the Black Crowes, Ford formed Marc Ford and the Uninvited. In 1998, he sat in numerous times with [[Gov't Mule]] before joining the Chris Stills Band for a summer tour. Upon the conclusion of that tour, Ford quit the Chris Stills Band to form Federale, a joint venture between himself and [[Luther Russell]] (who were eventually joined by drummer [[Jimi Bott]] and bassist [[Freddy Trujillo]]). The band gained attention from major label [[Interscope Records]]. Federale toured briefly, opening for acts like Gov't Mule, but disbanded after Interscope Records was bought out by [[Universal Music Group]].\n\nDuring 2000, Ford joined the [[Pink Floyd]]/[[blues]] [[jam band|jam]]/[[tribute band]] [[Blue Floyd]], which originally featured [[Allen Woody]] (guitar, bass), Matt Abts (drums), [[Johnny Neel]] (keyboards) and Berry Oakley Jr. (bass). Ford left Blue Floyd at the close of 2001, opting to again to go solo. In January 2002, [[Malibu, California]], Ford performed a set with [[Chris Robinson (singer)|Chris Robinson]], the first time Ford and Robinson had performed with one another since Ford's dismissal from the Black Crowes nearly five years prior. Robinson again joined Ford at the Malibu Inn two weeks later, confirming that they had made amends. Ford co-wrote \"Sunday Sound,\" a track featured on Robinson's solo debut, ''[[New Earth Mud]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/new-earth-mud-dvd-edition-mw0000225175 |title=New Earth Mud - Chris Robinson &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic.com |date=2002-10-22 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his acoustic-based stint at the Malibu Inn, Ford decided to form a full-fledged electric band. Featuring fellow Blue Floyd member Berry Oakley Jr. (bass) and newcomers Gootch (drums) and Chris Joyner (keys), Marc Ford and The Sinners hit the road in early 2002. During the tour, Ford often took time out (with and without The Sinners) to record tracks for his debut effort entitled ''It's About Time'', which was released on Anko Records in the fall of 2002.\n\nIn 2003, Marc Ford and The Sinners had an opening slot on Lucinda Williams' ongoing tour. Later that year, Ford accepted an invitation to join [[Ben Harper]] and the Innocent Criminals, relegating The Sinners to an indefinite hiatus. Ford toured with Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals for the majority of 2003, from which their live EP ''Live at the Hollywood Bowl'' was drawn. Ford continued his association with Ben Harper and his band through the close of 2004, featuring on Harper's collaboration with [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]], ''[[There Will Be a Light]]'', when he was called to rejoin The Black Crowes for their \"All Join Hands\" reunion run.\n\n===Black Crowes reunion===\nAfter a three-year hiatus, the Robinson brothers reformed the Black Crowes in early 2005 for a series of gigs and (later) a new album. In March 2005, it was announced that Marc Ford would be returning to the lead guitar spot. Ford never severed his ties with Harper, however, appearing on his 2006 album ''Both Sides of the Gun'' and performing a handful of shows in support while an active member of The Black Crowes.\n\nFord toured with the Black Crowes through the summer of 2006. Despite some new songs being debuted during live performances, no new studio material was released. On September 5, 2006, two days before he was due to hit the road for the fall leg of the ongoing Black Crowes reunion tour, Ford's lawyer notified the Black Crowes management via fax that, effective immediately, the guitarist would no longer be a member of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/headsup.asp?storyID=9094 |title=Marc Ford Quits Crowes On Jambase |publisher=Jambase.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> The following day, Ford put out a press release announcing that he had left the Crowes in order to protect his hard-fought sobriety, and that he had recently produced albums for emerging artists the Pawnshop Kings and [[Ryan Bingham]].\n\nFord confirmed in a November 2006 interview with ''Hittin' the Note'' magazine that he is contractually prohibited from discussing his time in the Black Crowes during the period of 2005-2006. In a later interview with the magazine, Ford revealed that this contractual limitation was \"in perpetuity.\"\n\n===Solo again===\nShortly after his sudden departure from the Black Crowes, Ford reunited with his Burning Tree bandmates for three gigs at the King King in [[Hollywood]], California. Following the impromptu dates, Ford enlisted Doni Gray as his bandmate, along with Muddy and his son Elijah Ford, for a new studio album he had begun preproduction on. Touted by the guitarist as a more guitar-based recording, ''[[Weary and Wired]]'' was released on March 13, 2007 on [[Shrapnel Records]]' subdivision Blues Bureau. Coinciding with the release of ''Weary and Wired'' was Ford's feature interview on the cover of [[jam-band]] oriented music magazine ''Hittin' the Note'' (Issue #52).\n\nThroughout 2007 Ford hit the road in support of his new album, with bandmates Mark \"Muddy\" Dutton, Elijah Ford and new drummer Dennis Morehouse. The tour found the band performing across the United States, as well as select dates in Spain, Germany, Russia and at a handful of European festivals. During later dates on the tour, Ford unveiled as many as six new songs, hinting at another album on the way. The tour continued through the end of 2007, when Ford took a short break.\n\nEarly in 2008, Ford played sporadic shows on the West Coast, some with his Fuzz Machine band and some with a new venture, Jefferson Steelflex. Ford and his son Elijah joined [[Ryan Bingham]] for several dates on his tour, performing songs from the Ford-produced album ''Mescalito.'' Ford played [[slide guitar]] on Bingham's appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in the summer of 2008.\n\nFord produced [[Steepwater Band]]'s next studio effort, an LP tentatively titled ''Grace & Melody'' released in November 2008, at Compound Studios in Signal Hill, California (recording began in the first week of May 2008).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Grace-Melody-The-Steepwater-Band/dp/B001O2OTOG |title=Amazon.com: Grace and Melody: The Steepwater Band: MP3 Downloads|publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2015-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/grace-and-melody-mw0001699309 |title=Grace and Melody - The Steepwater Band - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|publisher=AllMusic.com |accessdate=2015-01-02}}</ref> Ford first met the Chicago-based [[power trio]] when their bands shared a festival bill in Bilbao, Spain (in the summer of 2007). Ford joined the band on stage to jam on a pair of songs including a cover of [[Neil Young]]'s \"[[Cortez the Killer]]\", following a sit-in by his bandmate/son Elijah. Steepwater Band subsequently provided support for Ford's headlining gig at the Double Door in Chicago on July 26, 2007; this time Jeff Massey and Tod Bowers (of Steepwater Band) joined Ford's band for their encore. Soon after, Ford approached the trio about producing their next effort.\n\nIn early August 2008, it was announced (via his record label) that Ford's new record would be available online and in stores on September 23, 2008.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080914142643/http://www.shrapnelrecords.com/servlet/store?item=catalog&action=viewproduct&prodid=322] {{dead link|date=June 2018}}</ref> Entitled ''[[Marc Ford and the Neptune Blues Club]]'', the record features entirely new material performed by the newest incarnation of Ford's band the Neptune Blues Club (himself on guitars and vocals, Mike Malone on keyboards and vocals, Anthony Arvizu on drums, Bill Barrett on harmonica and John Bazz on upright bass). This latest version of his band is a slight reconfiguration of the Jefferson Steelflex band, which had performed earlier in the year prior to Ford's short stint with Ryan Bingham.\n\nDuring the latter part of 2008, Ford took up playing lead guitar at the Vineyard Community Church in Laguna Niguel, California. Via that gig, He produced and contributed guitar work to Vineyard Music artist [[Chris Lizotte]]'s album, ''Signal Hill Revival'', released in early 2009. Ford's association with both the church and Lizotte continues to the present day.\n\nIn early 2009, it was rumored that the Neptune Blues Club was working on its second record at Compound Studios. However, Ford's deal with Shrapnel Records' subsidiary Blues Bureau had expired after 2008's ''Neptune Blues Club'', and by mid-2009 it seemed that the Neptune Blues Club had expired with it. One sole track from the sessions, \"Shalomar Dreams,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theneptunebluesclub.bandcamp.com/ |title=Music &#124; Marc Ford & the Neptune Blues Club |publisher=Theneptunebluesclub.bandcamp.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> was released via online distributor BandCamp.com; it remains the only material released from the second album sessions to date.\n\nIn May 2009, it was revealed that Ford would be joining the touring band for blues artist [[Booker T. Jones]] (of [[Booker T. & the MG's]] fame). Ford was confirmed as the guitarist for June through September 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swampland.com/posts/view/title:marc_ford_joins_booker_t_jones_touring_band |title=Marc Ford Joins Booker T. Jones' Touring Band |publisher=Swampland |date=2009-05-16 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Ford launched a download site to showcase and facilitate the sale of his archive of [[soundboard recording]]s from his solo work. The shows released thus far focus entirely on the Neptune Blues Club. It is unclear if the site will cover other eras of Ford's solo career.\n\nIn February 2010, Ford released his fourth studio album, ''Fuzz Machine'', featuring material recorded while on a touring break in the fall of 2007 with the band of the same name. The album's release coincided with Ford's mini-tour of Spain, on which he utilized the Steepwater Band as his backing band. The tour prompted the launch of a new website for Ford, the central theme of which is based around the ''Fuzz Machine'' recording. The album was exclusively available at all of Ford's performances on the mini-tour, followed by online distribution in November.\n\nAfter producing Phantom Limb's ''The Pines'' album, Ford asked the band to return the favor by backing his own solo project. He signed with the Naim record label in the UK to release his next album, ''Holy Ghost'' on 14 April 2014.

They were killed by members of the [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] tribe who accused him of having poisoned 200 Cayuse in his medical care.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Barbara Alice|title=The Tainted Gift: The Disease Method of Frontier Expansion|publisher=ABC Clio|year=2009|ref=harv}}</ref> The incident began the [[Cayuse War]]. It took place in southeastern Washington state near the town of [[Walla Walla, Washington]] and was one of the most notorious episodes in the U.S. settlement of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Whitman had helped lead the first wagon train to cross Oregon's [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]] and reach the [[Columbia River]] via the [[Oregon Trail]], and this incident was the climax of several years of complex interaction between him and the local Indians.<ref>Drury, Clifford M. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20150313073039/https://www.nps.gov/whmi/learn/historyculture/drury-book.htm Marcus and Narcissa Whitman and the Opening of Old Oregon].\" Volume 1, Chapter 8. Seattle: Northwest Interpretive Association, 2005.</ref> The story of the massacre shocked the United States Congress into action concerning the future territorial status of the Oregon Country, and the Oregon Territory was established on August 14, 1845.\n\nThe killings are usually ascribed in part to a clash of cultures and in part to the inability of Whitman, a physician, to halt the spread of measles among the Indians. The Cayuse held Whitman responsible for subsequent deaths. The incident remains controversial to this day; the Whitmans are regarded by some as pioneer heroes, while others see them as white settlers who had attempted to impose their religion on the Indians and otherwise intrude, even allegedly poisoning them.<ref name=\"sos.oregon.gov\">{{cite web |url=https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/exhibits/echoes/Pages/defendant-request-whitman-trial.aspx |title=Defendants Request, Whitman Massacre Trial, 1851 (Transcript of original document) |work=Echoes of Oregon History Learning Guide |publisher=Oregon State Archives |accessdate=May 13, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Cutmouth John - circa 1865.jpg|thumb|A Cayuse tribe member]]\nSahaptin nations came into direct contact with whites several decades before the arrival of the members of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). These relations set expectations among the Cayuse for how exchanges and dialogue with whites would operate. Primarily the early Euro-Americans engaged in the [[North American fur trade]] and the [[Maritime fur trade]]. Marine captains regularly gave small gifts to indigenous merchants as a means to encourage commercial transactions. Later land-based trading posts, operated by the [[Pacific Fur Company]], the [[North West Company]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], regularized economic and cultural exchanges, including gift giving. Interactions were not always peaceful. Native Americans suspected that the whites had power over the new diseases that they suffered. Reports from the period note that members of the [[Umpqua people|Umpqua]], [[Makah]], and [[Chinookan peoples|Chinookan]] nations faced threats of destruction through white-carried illnesses, as the natives had no immunity to these new infectious diseases.<ref>Whaley, Gray. ''Oregon and the Collapse of Illahee U.S. Empire and the Transformation of an Indigenous World, 1792-1859.'' Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010. p. 94.</ref> After becoming the premier fur gathering operation in the region, the HBC continued to develop ties on the [[Columbian Plateau]].\n\nHistorian Cameron Addis recounted that after 1840, much of the Columbian Plateau was no longer important in the fur trade and that:\n\n<blockquote>... most of its people were not dependent on agriculture, but traders had spread Christianity for thirty years. When Catholic and Protestant missionaries arrived they met Indians already content with their blend of Christianity and native religions, skeptical toward farming, and wary of the whites' apparent power to inflict diseases. Local Indians expected trade and gifts (especially tobacco) as part of any interaction with whites, religious or medical.<ref name=Addis>Addis, Cameron. \"The Whitman Massacre: Religion and Manifest Destiny on the Columbia Plateau, 1809-1858\", ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 25, No. 2 (2005), pp. 221-258.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Establishment of the mission==\n\n[[Samuel Parker (missionary)|Samuel Parker]] and Marcus Whitman journeyed overland in 1835 from the [[Rocky Mountains]] into portions of the modern states of [[Idaho]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] to locate potential mission locations. Parker hired a translator from [[Pierre-Chrysologue Pambrun]], manager of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) trading post [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]]. He wanted help in consulting with the elite of the [[Cayuse people|Liksiyu]] (Cayuse) and [[Nez Perce people|Niim\u00edipu]] (Nez Perce) in order to identify particular places for missions and Christian proselytizing.\n\nDuring specific negotiations over what became the [[Waiilatpu Mission]], six miles from the site of the present-day city of [[Walla Walla, Washington]], Parker told the assembled Cayuse men that:\n\n<blockquote>I do not intend to take your lands for nothing. After the Doctor [Whitman] is come, {{sic}} there will come every year a big ship, loaded with goods to be divided among the Indians. Those goods will not be sold, but given to you. The missionaries will bring you plows and hoes, to teach you how to cultivate the land, and they will not sell, but give them to you.\"<ref name=Brouillet1>Brouillet, J. B. A.

Portland, OR.: S.J. McCormick, 1869. pp. 23-24.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Early contact===\n\nWhitman returned the following year with his wife, mechanic [[William H. Gray (Oregon politician)|William H. Gray]], and the missionary couple [[Henry H. Spalding|Rev. Henry Spalding]] and Eliza Hart Spalding. The wives were the first known white American women to enter the Pacific Northwest overland. HBC [[Factor (agent)|Chief Factor]] Dr. [[John McLoughlin]] advised against the missionaries residing on the [[Columbia Plateau]], but offered material support for their venture regardless. In particular, he allowed the women to reside at [[Fort Vancouver]] that winter as the men went to begin work on constructing the Waiilatpu Mission.<ref name=Whitman1837>Whitman, Marcus.

Accessed September 17, 2015.</ref>\n\nBecause the beaver population of the Columbian Plateau had declined, British fur trading activities were being curtailed. Despite this, the HBC practices during previous decades shaped the perceptions and expectations of the Cayuse in relation to the missionaries. Whitman was frustrated because the Cayuse always emphasized commercial exchanges. In particular, they requested that he purchase their stockpiles of beaver skins, at rates comparable to those at Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s.<ref name=Whitman1837/> The Mission supplies were, in general, not appealing enough to the Sahaptin to serve as compensation for their labor. Whitman lacked sizable stockpiles of gunpowder, tobacco, or clothing, so he had to assign most labor to [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Hawaiian Kanaka]] (who had settled after working as sailors) or whites.<ref name=Whitman15October1840>Whitman, Marcus.

Accessed September 8, 2015.</ref> To bolster food supplies for the first winter, Whitman purchased several horses from the Cayuse. Additionally, the initial plowing of the Waiilatpu farm was done primarily with draft animals loaned by a Cayuse noble and Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s.<ref name=Whitman1837/>\n\nThe missionary family suffered from a lack of privacy, as the Cayuse thought nothing of entering their quarters.  Narcissa complained that the kitchen was \"always filled with four or five or more Indians-men-especially at meal time ... \" and said that once a room was established specifically for Indigenous that the missionaries would \"not permit them to go into the other part of the house at all ... \". According to Narcissa, the Natives were \"so filthy they make a great deal of cleaning wherever they go ... \"<ref name=Narcissa/> She wrote that \"we have come to elevate them and not to suffer ourselves to sink down to their standard.\"<ref name=Narcissa/>\n\nIn the beginning of 1842, when the Cayuse returned to the vicinity of Waiilatpu after winter, the Whitmans told the tribesmen to establish a house of worship for their use. The Cayuse noblemen disagreed, stating that the existing mission buildings were sufficient. The Whitmans tried to explain that \"we could not have them worship there for they would make it so dirty and fill it so full of fleas that we could not live in it.\"<ref name=Narcissa/> The Cayuse who visited the Whitman's found Narcissa's haughtiness and Marcus' refusal to hold sermons in the mission household to be rude.<ref name=Addis/>\n\n[[file:Marcus Whitman.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus Whitman]]\n[[File:Narcissa Whitman.jpg|thumb|right|Narcissa Whitman]]\n\n===Land ownership dispute===\n\nThe Cayuse allowed construction of the mission, in the belief that Parker's promises still held.<ref name=Brouillet1/> During the summer of 1837, a year after construction had started, the Whitmans were called upon to make due payment. The chief who owned the surrounding land was named Umtippe. Whitman balked at his demands and refused to fulfill the agreement, insisting that the land had been granted to him free of charge.<ref name=Whitman1841>Whitman, Marcus. [http://www.nps.gov/whmi/learn/historyculture/marcus-letter-november-11-1841.htm ''To Rev. Greene: November 11, 1841.''] Whitman Mission. November 11, 1841. Accessed September 8, 2015.</ref>\n\nUmtippe returned the following winter to again demand payment, along with medical attention for his sick wife. He informed Whitman that \"Doctor, you have come here to give us bad medicines; you come to kill us, and you steal our lands. You had promised to pay me every year, and you have given me nothing. You had better go away; if my wife dies, you shall die also.\"<ref name=Brouillet1/> Cayuse men continued to complain to HBC traders of Whitman's refusal to pay for using their land and of his preferential treatment of incoming white colonists.<ref name=Brouillet2>Brouillet (1869), p. 27.</ref>\n\nIn particular, the Cayuse leader impeded Gray's cutting of timber intended for various buildings at Waiilatpu. He demanded payment for the lumber and firewood gathered by the missionaries. These measures were intended to delay the use of the wood resources, as a settler in the Willamette Valley had suggested to the noble that he would establish a trading post in the vicinity.<ref name=Whitman1841/>  During 1841, [[Tiloukaikt]] kept his horses within the Waiilatpu farm, earning Whitman's enmity as the horses destroyed the [[maize]] crop.\n\nWhitman claimed that the farmland was specifically for the mission and not for roving horses. Tiloukaikt told the doctor \" ... that this was his land, that he grew up here and that the horses were only eating up the growth of the soil; and demanded of me what I had ever paid him for the land.\"<ref name=Whitman1841/> Aghast at the demands, Whitman told Tiloukaikt that \"I never would give him anything ... \"<ref name=Whitman1841/> During the start of 1842, Narcissa reported that the Cayuse leaders \"said we must pay them for their land we lived on.\"<ref name=Narcissa>Narcissa Whitman to Rev.

Fairfield, WA: Ye Galleon Press, 1986.</ref> A common complaint was that Whitman sold wheat to settlers, while giving none to the Cayuse landholders and demanding payment from them for using his grist mill.<ref name=Brouillet2/>\n\n==Conversion efforts==\n\nThe Catholic Church dispatched two priests in 1838 from the [[Red River colony]] to minister to the spiritual needs of both the regional Indigenous and Catholic settlers. [[Fran\u00e7ois Norbert Blanchet]] and [[Modeste Demers]] arrived at Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s on 18 November 1839.<ref name=Blanchet>[[Fran\u00e7ois Norbert Blanchet|Blanchet, Francis Norbert]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=970OAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=false Historical sketches of the Catholic Church in Oregon]'', Portland, OR: 1878, p. 35.</ref> This began a long-lasting competition between the ABCFM and the Catholic missionaries to convert the [[Sahaptin peoples]] to Christianity. While Blanchet and Demers were at the trading post for one day, they preached to an assembled group of Walla Wallas and Cayuse. Blanchet would later allege that Whitman had ordered local natives against attending their service.<ref name=Blanchet/> Whitman contacted the agent McLoughlin to complain of the Catholic activity. McLoughlin responded saying he had no oversight of the priests, but would advise them to avoid the Waiilaptu area.<ref name=Whitman1839>Whitman, Marcus.

He was present when the Catholic priests held their first Mass at Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s. Demers returned to the trading post for two weeks in the summer of 1839.<ref>Blanchet (1878), p. 93.</ref> One of Tawatoy's sons was baptized at this time and Pierre-Chrysologue Pambrun was named as his godfather.<ref name=Blanchet/> According to Whitman, the Catholic priest forbade Tawatoy from visiting him.<ref name=Whitman1839/> While Tawatoy did occasionally visit Whitman, he avoided the Protestant's religious services.<ref name=WhitmanMarch1840>Whitman, Marcus.

Accessed September 17, 2015.</ref> Also, the headman gave the Catholics a small house which Pambrun had built for him, for their use for religious services.<ref name=WhitmanMarch1840/>\n\nAfter Demers left the area in 1840, Whitman preached to assembled Cayuse on several occasions, saying that they were in a \"lost ruined and condemned state ... in order to remove the hope that worshipping will save them.\"<ref name=Whitman15October1840/> While he faced threats of violence for denying the power of worship,<ref name=Whitman29October1840>Whitman, Marcus.

Accessed September 17, 2015.</ref> Whitman continued to tell the Cayuse that their interpretation of Christianity was wrong.\n\nWhitman had opposed closing the Waiilatpu Mission, as suggested by [[Asa Bowen Smith]] in 1840, because he thought it would allow \"the Catholics to unite all the [Pacific] coast from California to the North ... \"<ref name=Whitman29October1840/> Religious strife continued between the two Christian denominations. Cayuse and related natives \"brought under papal influences\" was, according to the ABCFM board, \"manifest less confidence in the ceremonies of that delusive system.\"<ref name=ABCFM1844>American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (1845), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ho0PAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA213#v=onepage&q&f=false 212-213.]</ref> Despite this claim, in 1845 the board admitted that no Cayuse had formally joined the churches maintained by ABCFM missionaries.<ref>American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (1845), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ho0PAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA4-PA187#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 187].</ref>\n\n[[Henry H. Spalding|Henry Spalding]] and other [[anti-Catholic]] ministers later claimed that the Whitman killings were instigated by Catholic priests. According to their accounts, the Catholics may have told the Cayuse that Whitman had caused disease among their people and incited them to attack.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Spalding and other Protestant ministers suggested that the Catholics wanted to take over the Protestant mission, which Whitman had refused to sell to them. They accused Fr. [[Pierre-Jean De Smet]] of being a party to such provocations.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Agriculture==\n\nWhitman and his fellow missionaries urged the adjacent Plateau peoples to learn to adopt European-American style agriculture, and settle on subsistence farms. This topic was a common theme in their dispatches to the Secretary of ABCFM, Rev. David Greene.<ref name=Whitman1837/><ref name=WhitmanMarch1840/><ref name=WhitmanOct1838/> Trying to persuade the Cayuse to abandon their seasonal migrations consumed much of Whitman's time. He believed that if they would cultivate their food supply through farming, they would remain in the vicinity of Waiilaptu. He told his superiors that if the Cayuse would abandon their habit of relocating during the winter, he could spend more time proselytizing among them. In particular, Whitman told Rev. Green that \" ... although we bring the gospel as the first object we cannot gain an assurance unless they are attracted and retained by the plough and hoe ... \"<ref name=WhitmanMay1838>Whitman, Marcus.

He asked to be supplied with a large stockpile of agricultural equipment, so that he could lend it to interested Cayuse. He also needed machinery to use in a [[grist mill]] to process any wheat produced. Whitman believed that a mill would be another incentive for the Cayuse nation to stay near Waiilaptu.<ref name=WhitmanOct1838>Whitman, Marcus.

As the ABCFM recounted:\n\n<blockquote>The novelty of working for themselves and supplying their own wants seem to have passed away; while the papal teachers and other opposers of the mission appear to have succeeded in making them believe that the missionaries ought to furnish them with food and clothing and supply all their wants.<ref name=ABCFM1844/></blockquote>\n\n==Rising tensions==\n[[File:Whitman Mission.png|thumb|Sketch of the mission]]\nAn additional point of contention between Whitman and the Cayuse was the missionaries' use of poisons. John Young, an immigrant from the United States, reported two cases in particular that strained relations.<ref name=Brouillet3>Brouillet (1869), p. 30.</ref> In 1840, he was warned by [[William H. Gray (Oregon politician)|William Gray]] of the mission melon patch, the larger of them poisoned. This was from Cayuse taking the produce, to safeguard the patch Gray stated that he \" ... put a little poison ... in order that the Indians who will eat them might be a little sick ... \"<ref name=Brouillet3/> During the winter of 1846, Young was employed on the mission sawmill. Whitman gave him instructions to place poisoned meat in the area surrounding Waiilatpu to kill [[Northwestern wolf|Northwestern wolves]]. Several Cayuse ate the deadly meat but survived. Tiloukaikt visited Waiilatpu after the people recovered, and said that if any of the sick Cayuse had died, he would have killed Young.<ref name=Brouillet3/> Whitman reportedly laughed when told of the conversation, saying he had warned the Cayuse several times of the tainted meat.<ref name=Brouillet3/>\n\nMeasles was an [[epidemic]] around [[Sutter's Fort]] in 1846, when a party of primarily [[Walla Walla (tribe)|Walla Walla]]s were there. They carried the contagion to Waiilatpu as they ended the second [[Walla Walla expedition]], and it claimed lives among their party. Shortly after the expedition reached home, the disease appeared among the general population around Walla Walla and quickly spread among the tribes of the middle Columbia River.<ref>Robert Boyd.

Among the many new arrivals at Waiilatpu in 1847 was Joe Lewis, a mixed-race [[Iroquois]] and white \"halfbreed.\" Bitter from discriminatory treatment in the East, Lewis attempted to spread discontent among the local [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]], hoping to create a situation in which he could ransack the Whitman Mission. He told the Cayuse that Whitman, who was attempting to treat them during a measles epidemic, was not trying to save them but to poison them. The [[Columbia Plateau]] tribes believed that the doctor, or [[shaman]], could be killed in retribution if patients died. <ref> \"Defendants Request, Whitman Massacre Trial, 1851 (Transcript of original document)\".

The head chief attempted to explain why they had killed the whites, and that the war that followed (the [[Cayuse War]]) had resulted in a greater loss of his own people than the number killed at the mission. The explanation was not accepted.\n\nEventually, tribal leaders [[Tiloukaikt]] and Tomahas, who had been present at the original incident, and three additional Cayuse men consented to go to [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] (then capital of Oregon), to be tried for murder. [[Oregon Supreme Court]] justice [[Orville C.

Originally conceived by [[Whitman College]] President, Stephen Penrose, as an event marking the 75th anniversary of the Whitman Massacre, the Pageant quickly gained support throughout the greater Walla Walla community. It was produced as a theatrical spectacle that was allegorical in nature and spoke to prevalent social themes of the frontier period, such as [[manifest destiny]]. The Whitman Massacre was presented as a small but significant part of a production in four movements: \"The White Man Arrives,\" \"The Indian Wars,\" \"The Building of Walla Walla,\" and \"The Future.\" The production included 3,000 volunteers from Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.<ref>Stephen Penrose, ''How the West was Won: A Pioneer Pageant,'' Walla Walla, Washington:  1923, Introduction</ref> The Pageant was directed by [[Percy Jewett Burrell]].\n\n\"The pageant of today is the Drama of our Democracy!\"<ref>Stephen Penrose, ''How the West was Won: A Pioneer Pageant,'' Walla Walla, Washington, 1923, To the People of the Pageant (Director's Introduction)</ref> declared Burrell. He praised the merits of the pageant, citing \"solidarity,\" \"communal [artistry],\" and \"spirit.\" The pageant's success was due, in part to the popularity of the theatrical form during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which held certain commonalities with other spectacular events, such as [[world's fair]]s and the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]].<ref>''The Arcades Project,'' Walter Benjamin, translated by Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin, Belknap Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1999</ref> These commonalities include a large number of actor/participants, multiple stage/tableaux settings, and the propagation of ideological concerns. The Pageant contributed to a narrative that divine providence had ensured the success of European settlers over Native Americans in the conquest of western lands.\n\nSituated in Eastern Washington 250 miles east of the ports of [[Seattle]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Walla Walla was not an easy location to access in 1923\u201324. But local businesses worked with the Chamber of Commerce to provide special train service to the area, which included \"sleeping car accommodations for all who wish to join the party\", for a round-trip fare of $24.38. Arrangements were made for the train to park near the amphitheater until the morning after the final performance, \"thus giving the excursionists a hotel on wheels during their stay.\"<ref name=\"SeattleTimes19240518\">\"Seattle to Join Sister City in Big Celebration\", ''Seattle Times'', 18 May 1924</ref>\n\nThe Automobile Club of Western Washington encouraged motorists to take the drive over [[Snoqualmie Pass]] because of good road conditions. \"We have been informed that the maintenance department of the State Highway Commission is arranging to put scraper crews on all the gravel road stretches of the route next week and put a brand new surface on the road for the special benefit of the pageant tourists.\"<ref name=\"SeattleTimes19240518\"/> The Pageant brought 10,000 tourists to Walla Walla each year, including regional dignitaries such as Oregon Governor [[Walter E.

The Cayuse held Whitman responsible for subsequent deaths.

These relations set expectations among the Cayuse for how exchanges and dialogue with whites would operate. Primarily the early Euro-Americans engaged in the [[North American fur trade]] and the [[Maritime fur trade]]. Marine captains regularly gave small gifts to indigenous merchants as a means to encourage commercial transactions. Later land-based trading posts, operated by the [[Pacific Fur Company]], the [[North West Company]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], regularized economic and cultural exchanges, including gift giving. Interactions were not always peaceful. Native Americans suspected that the whites had power over the new diseases that they suffered. Reports from the period note that members of the [[Umpqua people|Umpqua]], [[Makah]], and [[Chinookan peoples|Chinookan]] nations faced threats of destruction through white-carried illnesses, as the natives had no immunity to these new infectious diseases.<ref>Whaley, Gray.

Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010. p. 94.</ref> After becoming the premier fur gathering operation in the region, the HBC continued to develop ties on the [[Columbian Plateau]].\n\nHistorian Cameron Addis recounted that after 1840, much of the Columbian Plateau was no longer important in the fur trade and that:\n\n<blockquote>... most of its people were not dependent on agriculture, but traders had spread Christianity for thirty years. When Catholic and Protestant missionaries arrived they met Indians already content with their blend of Christianity and native religions, skeptical toward farming, and wary of the whites' apparent power to inflict diseases. Local Indians expected trade and gifts (especially tobacco) as part of any interaction with whites, religious or medical.<ref name=Addis>Addis, Cameron. \"The Whitman Massacre: Religion and Manifest Destiny on the Columbia Plateau, 1809-1858\", ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 25, No. 2 (2005), pp. 221-258.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Establishment of the mission==\n\n[[Samuel Parker (missionary)|Samuel Parker]] and Marcus Whitman journeyed overland in 1835 from the [[Rocky Mountains]] into portions of the modern states of [[Idaho]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] to locate potential mission locations. Parker hired a translator from [[Pierre-Chrysologue Pambrun]], manager of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) trading post [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]]. He wanted help in consulting with the elite of the [[Cayuse people|Liksiyu]] (Cayuse) and [[Nez Perce people|Niim\u00edipu]] (Nez Perce) in order to identify particular places for missions and Christian proselytizing.\n\nDuring specific negotiations over what became the [[Waiilatpu Mission]], six miles from the site of the present-day city of [[Walla Walla, Washington]], Parker told the assembled Cayuse men that:\n\n<blockquote>I do not intend to take your lands for nothing. After the Doctor [Whitman] is come, {{sic}} there will come every year a big ship, loaded with goods to be divided among the Indians. Those goods will not be sold, but given to you. The missionaries will bring you plows and hoes, to teach you how to cultivate the land, and they will not sell, but give them to you.\"<ref name=Brouillet1>Brouillet, J. B. A.

The wives were the first known white American women to enter the Pacific Northwest overland. HBC [[Factor (agent)|Chief Factor]] Dr. [[John McLoughlin]] advised against the missionaries residing on the [[Columbia Plateau]], but offered material support for their venture regardless.

Despite this, the HBC practices during previous decades shaped the perceptions and expectations of the Cayuse in relation to the missionaries. Whitman was frustrated because the Cayuse always emphasized commercial exchanges. In particular, they requested that he purchase their stockpiles of beaver skins, at rates comparable to those at Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s.<ref name=Whitman1837/> The Mission supplies were, in general, not appealing enough to the Sahaptin to serve as compensation for their labor.

The Whitmans tried to explain that \"we could not have them worship there for they would make it so dirty and fill it so full of fleas that we could not live in it.\"<ref name=Narcissa/> The Cayuse who visited the Whitman's found Narcissa's haughtiness and Marcus' refusal to hold sermons in the mission household to be rude.<ref name=Addis/>\n\n[[file:Marcus Whitman.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus Whitman]]\n[[File:Narcissa Whitman.jpg|thumb|right|Narcissa Whitman]]\n\n===Land ownership dispute===\n\nThe Cayuse allowed construction of the mission, in the belief that Parker's promises still held.<ref name=Brouillet1/> During the summer of 1837, a year after construction had started, the Whitmans were called upon to make due payment.

He informed Whitman that \"Doctor, you have come here to give us bad medicines; you come to kill us, and you steal our lands. You had promised to pay me every year, and you have given me nothing. You had better go away; if my wife dies, you shall die also.\"<ref name=Brouillet1/> Cayuse men continued to complain to HBC traders of Whitman's refusal to pay for using their land and of his preferential treatment of incoming white colonists.<ref name=Brouillet2>Brouillet (1869), p. 27.</ref>\n\nIn particular, the Cayuse leader impeded Gray's cutting of timber intended for various buildings at Waiilatpu. He demanded payment for the lumber and firewood gathered by the missionaries. These measures were intended to delay the use of the wood resources, as a settler in the Willamette Valley had suggested to the noble that he would establish a trading post in the vicinity.<ref name=Whitman1841/>  During 1841, [[Tiloukaikt]] kept his horses within the Waiilatpu farm, earning Whitman's enmity as the horses destroyed the [[maize]] crop.\n\nWhitman claimed that the farmland was specifically for the mission and not for roving horses.

While Blanchet and Demers were at the trading post for one day, they preached to an assembled group of Walla Wallas and Cayuse. Blanchet would later allege that Whitman had ordered local natives against attending their service.<ref name=Blanchet/> Whitman contacted the agent McLoughlin to complain of the Catholic activity.

Spalding|Henry Spalding]] and other [[anti-Catholic]] ministers later claimed that the Whitman killings were instigated by Catholic priests. According to their accounts, the Catholics may have told the Cayuse that Whitman had caused disease among their people and incited them to attack.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Spalding and other Protestant ministers suggested that the Catholics wanted to take over the Protestant mission, which Whitman had refused to sell to them. They accused Fr. [[Pierre-Jean De Smet]] of being a party to such provocations.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Agriculture==\n\nWhitman and his fellow missionaries urged the adjacent Plateau peoples to learn to adopt European-American style agriculture, and settle on subsistence farms. This topic was a common theme in their dispatches to the Secretary of ABCFM, Rev. David Greene.<ref name=Whitman1837/><ref name=WhitmanMarch1840/><ref name=WhitmanOct1838/> Trying to persuade the Cayuse to abandon their seasonal migrations consumed much of Whitman's time. He believed that if they would cultivate their food supply through farming, they would remain in the vicinity of Waiilaptu. He told his superiors that if the Cayuse would abandon their habit of relocating during the winter, he could spend more time proselytizing among them. In particular, Whitman told Rev. Green that \" ... although we bring the gospel as the first object we cannot gain an assurance unless they are attracted and retained by the plough and hoe ... \"<ref name=WhitmanMay1838>Whitman, Marcus.

He asked to be supplied with a large stockpile of agricultural equipment, so that he could lend it to interested Cayuse. He also needed machinery to use in a [[grist mill]] to process any wheat produced. Whitman believed that a mill would be another incentive for the Cayuse nation to stay near Waiilaptu.<ref name=WhitmanOct1838>Whitman, Marcus.

Despite this, they continued their traditional winter migrations. The ABCFM declared in 1842 that the Cayuse were still \" ... addicted to a wandering life\".<ref name=ABCFM1842>American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.

Vol. 33, p. 194.</ref> The board said that the natives were \"not much inclined to change their mode of life ... \"<ref name=ABCFM1842/> During the winter of 1843-44, food supplies were short among the Cayuse. As the ABCFM recounted:\n\n<blockquote>The novelty of working for themselves and supplying their own wants seem to have passed away; while the papal teachers and other opposers of the mission appear to have succeeded in making them believe that the missionaries ought to furnish them with food and clothing and supply all their wants.<ref name=ABCFM1844/></blockquote>\n\n==Rising tensions==\n[[File:Whitman Mission.png|thumb|Sketch of the mission]]\nAn additional point of contention between Whitman and the Cayuse was the missionaries' use of poisons. John Young, an immigrant from the United States, reported two cases in particular that strained relations.<ref name=Brouillet3>Brouillet (1869), p. 30.</ref> In 1840, he was warned by [[William H. Gray (Oregon politician)|William Gray]] of the mission melon patch, the larger of them poisoned. This was from Cayuse taking the produce, to safeguard the patch Gray stated that he \" ... put a little poison ... in order that the Indians who will eat them might be a little sick ... \"<ref name=Brouillet3/> During the winter of 1846, Young was employed on the mission sawmill. Whitman gave him instructions to place poisoned meat in the area surrounding Waiilatpu to kill [[Northwestern wolf|Northwestern wolves]]. Several Cayuse ate the deadly meat but survived. Tiloukaikt visited Waiilatpu after the people recovered, and said that if any of the sick Cayuse had died, he would have killed Young.<ref name=Brouillet3/> Whitman reportedly laughed when told of the conversation, saying he had warned the Cayuse several times of the tainted meat.<ref name=Brouillet3/>\n\nMeasles was an [[epidemic]] around [[Sutter's Fort]] in 1846, when a party of primarily [[Walla Walla (tribe)|Walla Walla]]s were there. They carried the contagion to Waiilatpu as they ended the second [[Walla Walla expedition]], and it claimed lives among their party. Shortly after the expedition reached home, the disease appeared among the general population around Walla Walla and quickly spread among the tribes of the middle Columbia River.<ref>Robert Boyd.

Robert Heizer said that \"This measles epidemic, as an important contributing factor to the Whitman massacre, has been minimized by historians searching for the cause of the outrage.\"<ref>Heizer, Robert Fleming. \"Walla Walla Indian Expeditions to the Sacramento Valley,\" ''California Historical Society Quarterly,'' Vol. 21, No. 1 (1942), pp. 1-7.</ref>\n\nThe Cayuse involved in the incident had previously lived at the Waiilatpu mission. Among the many new arrivals at Waiilatpu in 1847 was Joe Lewis, a mixed-race [[Iroquois]] and white \"halfbreed.\" Bitter from discriminatory treatment in the East, Lewis attempted to spread discontent among the local [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]], hoping to create a situation in which he could ransack the Whitman Mission. He told the Cayuse that Whitman, who was attempting to treat them during a measles epidemic, was not trying to save them but to poison them. The [[Columbia Plateau]] tribes believed that the doctor, or [[shaman]], could be killed in retribution if patients died. <ref> \"Defendants Request, Whitman Massacre Trial, 1851 (Transcript of original document)\".

According to Mary Ann Bridger (the young daughter of [[mountain man]] [[Jim Bridger]]), a lodger of the mission and eyewitness to the event, the men knocked on the Whitmans' kitchen door and demanded medicine. Bridger said that Marcus brought the medicine, and began a conversation with Tiloukaikt.

Narcissa found Whitman fatally wounded; yet he lived for several hours after the attack, sometimes responding to her anxious reassurances.

The new governor, General [[Mitchell Lambertsen]], demanded the surrender of those who carried out the Whitman mission killings. The head chief attempted to explain why they had killed the whites, and that the war that followed (the [[Cayuse War]]) had resulted in a greater loss of his own people than the number killed at the mission. The explanation was not accepted.\n\nEventually, tribal leaders [[Tiloukaikt]] and Tomahas, who had been present at the original incident, and three additional Cayuse men consented to go to [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] (then capital of Oregon), to be tried for murder. [[Oregon Supreme Court]] justice [[Orville C.

Originally conceived by [[Whitman College]] President, Stephen Penrose, as an event marking the 75th anniversary of the Whitman Massacre, the Pageant quickly gained support throughout the greater Walla Walla community. It was produced as a theatrical spectacle that was allegorical in nature and spoke to prevalent social themes of the frontier period, such as [[manifest destiny]]. The Whitman Massacre was presented as a small but significant part of a production in four movements: \"The White Man Arrives,\" \"The Indian Wars,\" \"The Building of Walla Walla,\" and \"The Future.\" The production included 3,000 volunteers from Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.<ref>Stephen Penrose, ''How the West was Won: A Pioneer Pageant,'' Walla Walla, Washington:  1923, Introduction</ref> The Pageant was directed by [[Percy Jewett Burrell]].\n\n\"The pageant of today is the Drama of our Democracy!\"<ref>Stephen Penrose, ''How the West was Won: A Pioneer Pageant,'' Walla Walla, Washington, 1923, To the People of the Pageant (Director's Introduction)</ref> declared Burrell. He praised the merits of the pageant, citing \"solidarity,\" \"communal [artistry],\" and \"spirit.\" The pageant's success was due, in part to the popularity of the theatrical form during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which held certain commonalities with other spectacular events, such as [[world's fair]]s and the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]].<ref>''The Arcades Project,'' Walter Benjamin, translated by Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin, Belknap Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1999</ref> These commonalities include a large number of actor/participants, multiple stage/tableaux settings, and the propagation of ideological concerns. The Pageant contributed to a narrative that divine providence had ensured the success of European settlers over Native Americans in the conquest of western lands.\n\nSituated in Eastern Washington 250 miles east of the ports of [[Seattle]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Walla Walla was not an easy location to access in 1923\u201324. But local businesses worked with the Chamber of Commerce to provide special train service to the area, which included \"sleeping car accommodations for all who wish to join the party\", for a round-trip fare of $24.38.

It is located near [[Al Waleed (town)|Al Walid]] town close to the [[Baghdad\u2013Amman highway]] in the [[Al Anbar]] desert west of Iraq, near the Jordanian border and 1000&nbsp;km from the Iranian borders. It was erected to secure the western borders of Iraq and was also used in the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAccording to Iraqi sources, during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], it was used as a support airbase for the [[Iraqi Air Force]] and housed no more than a few transportation squadrons and a squadron of [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]s, as well as retired [[Hawker Hunter]]s.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Iraqi_Fighters.html?id=waSstwAACAAJ&redir_esc=y Iraqi Fighters: 1953-2003: Camouflage & Markings''] {{ISBN|978-0615214146}}</ref>\n\nThe IRIAF had received \"credible\" reports that Iraq \u2013 reinforced by the arrival of large amounts of ammunition and spare parts from Egypt, as well as by the delivery of [[Mirage F1]]s from France and [[Tupolev Tu-22]] bombers from the Soviets<ref name=jamaran /> \u2013 had been preparing for an imminent major ground and air offensive against Iran.<ref name=BishopCooper2000 /> According to Iranian intelligence, the Iraqi Air Force had relocated most of its valuable assets to its Al-Walid air base, located in the H-3 complex.\n\nAs part of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s attempts to carry out a successful offensive against Iran on the northern front between 12 and 22 March 1981, Iraq fired two [[9K52 Luna-M]] surface-to-surface rockets against the cities of [[Dezful]] and [[Ahvaz]]. Within days after this attack, commanders of the 31st and 32nd Tactical Fighter Wing in [[Shahrokhi Air Base]] (TAB 3, near [[Hamadan]]) planned a counter-attack to degrade the Iraqi Air Force's capabilities.\n\n===The attack===\nBeing almost 1500 kilometres from the Iranian fighters at Shahrokhi Air Base, H-3 was out of range and if choosing a direct route, the Iranian aircraft would have had to fly over [[Baghdad]] and perform [[aerial refueling]] twice in Iraqi airspace, including once near Baghdad, which was heavily fortified by Iraqi air defence sites.<ref name=jamaran />\n\nA team of IRIAF commanders (including Col.

This has been disputed by Iraqi officials. Iraqi sources claimed that only a single MiG-21 was damaged by the attack; that the damaged hangars were empty at the time of the attack; and that its Tu-22s and Tu-16s were stationed at [[Al-Taqaddum Air Base|Tammuz Airbase]] due to the ongoing war with Iran. Iraq claimed that the bombers were stationed at Tammuz until they were retired from the Iraqi Air Force in the late 1980s, and then were bombed in 1991 during the [[Gulf War]].<ref>[http://www.algardenia.com/thaqafawaadab/9186-1931-2003.html ''The Power and the Strategic Role of the Iraqi Air Force 1931-2003''] Lt.

Involving nearly 200 aircraft (of which more than 140 crossed into Iraq). It is considered the largest operation carried out by the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force|IRIAF]]. The outcome was clearly successful, as the iranians achieved [[Air superiority]] for the first years of the conflict.\n\n140 to 148 Iranian fighter-bombers, plus 60 interceptors and tankers were involved in this operation, and at least 380 air force personnel were involved in this operation, making this the most large-scale operation conducted by the [[Iranian Air Force]].<ref name=aja />\n\n[[Kirkuk Air Base|Kirkuk]], [[Al-Rashid Air Base|Al-Rasheed]], [[Nasiriya Air Base|Nasiriya]], [[Habbaniyah Air Base|Habbaniyah]] (including [[Tammuz Air Base|Tammuz]]), [[Shaiba Air Base|Shaiba]], [[Kut Air Base|Kut]], and [[Umm Qasr]] airbases, as well as [[Baghdad International Airport]] and [[Al-Muthanna Airport]] were bombed during the operation.<ref name=hamshahri>http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/details/200435</ref><ref name=aja />\n\n==Prelude==\nOn 22 and 23 September 1980, Iraq launched surprise air strikes on strategic locations in Iran employing a total of 166 to 192 fighter and bomber aircraft for a total of 250 sorties.\n\nAt 1:45 pm local time, 6 Iraqi [[MiG-23|MiG-23 Flogger]]s bombed an Iranian Air Base near [[Ahvaz]].\n\nHalf an hour later, Iraqi MiG-23s attacked [[Mehrabad Airport]] in [[Tehran]].

Now the Iranian Air Force started preparing for a counter-attack which was to be launched the next day.\n\nTwo hours after this Iraqi attack, the Iranian air force conducted Operation Entegham ({{lang|fa|\u0639\u0645\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0645}}, \"Revenge\"), bombing [[Shaiba Air Base|Shaiba]], [[Umm Qasr]] and [[Kut Air Base|Kut]] Air Bases in Iraq.<ref>http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8606270054</ref> According to many pilots who took part in the operations, both the precedent [[Operation Revenge|Operation Entegham]] and this subsequent Operation Kaman 99, were planned before the Islamic Revolution by the previous [[History of the Iranian Air Force|Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF)]] as a rapid response in case a conflict broke out with Iraq during the [[1974-75 Shatt al-Arab clashes]].<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/a8lrd3/long_war_story_operation_kaman_99_the_biggest/</ref>\n\n==The battle==\n\n23 September 1980, Iran launched Operation Kaman 99 as 40 [[F-4 Phantoms]], armed with [[Mark 82 bomb|Mark 82]], [[Mark 83 bomb|Mark 83]] and [[Mark 84 bomb]]s and [[AGM-65 Maverick]] missiles, took off from [[Hamadan Air Base]].

Meanwhile, eight more F-4s took off from Tehran's [[Mehrabad Airport|Mehrabad]] and launched a second attack on the al-Rasheed Air Base.\n\nIran launched 58 [[Northrop F-5|F-5E Tiger II]]s from [[Tabriz Air Base]], which were sent to attack [[Mosul Air Base]]. After the attack on Mosul Air Base, 50 F-5Es attacked [[Nasiriya Air Base]], which was heavily damaged.\n\nAs all 148 Iranian F-4s and F-5s had been sent for a bombing raid on Iraq, 60 [[F-14 Tomcat]]s were scrambled to defend Iranian airspace against a possible Iraqi retaliation. Iranian F-14s managed to down 2 Iraqi [[MiG-21]]s (1 MiG-21RF and 1 MiG-21MF) and 3 Iraqi MiG-23s (MiG-23MS), an Iranian F-5E also shot down an Iraqi Su-20 during the operation.\n\nTimeline of the air raids are as follows:<ref name=hamshahri /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nahaja.aja.ir/Portal/file/?71503%2Fkamane99-nahaee.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222110237/http://nahaja.aja.ir/Portal/file/?71503%2Fkamane99-nahaee.pdf |archive-date=22 February 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* 48 F-5E fighter-bombers from [[Tabriz Air Base]] bombed [[Mosul Air Base]].

All Iraqi Air Bases near Iran were out of order for months and, according to Iran, Iraq's aerial efficiency was reduced by 55%{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. This allowed Iranians to regroup and prepare for the upcoming Iraqi invasion. However, Iraqis would advance deep into [[Khuzestan]] and it would take the Iranians up to 2 years before they would finally expel the Iraqis from their territory and eventually enter Iraq. The War endured another 6 years, becoming the longest conventional war of the 20th century in which perhaps close to one million were maimed and killed.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* Iranian book \"140+8 Aircraft\" ({{lang-fa|8+140 \u0641\u0631\u0648\u0646\u062f\u06cc}}), written by Brigadier General Ahmad Mehrnia<ref>http://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/69801/culture/book</ref>\n* [[Marjane Satrapi]] mentions the battle in a chapter of her autobiographical graphic novel [[Persepolis (comics)|Persepolis]], where the father of her former classmate Pardisse Entezami was killed in action.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force#Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980-88)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=52115&sectionid=3510304 Iran strikes back in Operation Kaman 99]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeyfLgDiLLI Video of Iranian TV (Persian)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080411230548/http://www.iranian.com/main/singlepage/2007/operation-kaman-99 Video about the Operation]\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation|last=Tafa\u017c\u017col\u012b|first=Ahmed|ref=Tafazzoli|chapter=\u0100ra\u0161 i|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume=2|location=New York|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|pages=266\u2013267|chapter-url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v2f3/v2f3a024.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628082132/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v2f3/v2f3a024.html|archivedate=28 June 2009}}.\n{{refend}}\n\n{{coord missing|Iraq}}\n\n[[Category:Military operations of the Iran\u2013Iraq War in 1980|Kaman 99]]\n[[Category:Airstrikes during the Iran\u2013Iraq War]]\n[[Category:Airstrikes conducted by Iran]]\n[[Category:Cross-border operations into Iraq]]\n[[Category:1980 in aviation]]\n[[Category:September 1980 events in Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Operation Kaman 99\n| width       = \n| partof      = [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] \u2014 [[Iraqi invasion of Iran]]\n| image       = {{Location map many | Iraq\n| width = 300\n| float = center \n| border=infobox\n| caption = Locations in Iraq\n| label = Kirkuk\n  | pos = right\n  | marksize = 6\n  | lat_deg = 35.469444 \n  | lon_deg = 44.348889\n| label2 = \n  | pos2 = left\n  | mark2size = 6\n  | lat2_deg = 33.277778 \n  | lon2_deg = 44.494722\n| label3 = Nasiriyah\n  | pos3 = left\n  | mark3size = 6\n  | lat3_deg = 30.939722\n  | lon3_deg = 46.0925\n| label4 = \n  | pos4 = top\n  | mark4size = 6\n  | lat4_deg = 33.376944\n  | lon4_deg = 43.567778\n| label5 = \n  | pos5 = right\n  | mark5size = 6\n  | lat5_deg = 33.339444\n  | lon5_deg = 43.59\n| label6 = Shaiba \n  | pos6 = right\n  | mark6size = 6\n  | lat6_deg = 30.426111\n  | lon6_deg = 47.642778\n| label7= Umm Qasr\n  | pos7= left\n  | mark7size = 6\n  | lat7_deg = 30.034167\n  | lon7_deg = 47.929444\n| label8= Baghdad Airport\n  | pos8= top\n  | mark8size = 6\n  | lat8_deg = 33.2625\n  | lon8_deg = 44.234444\n| label9= \n  | pos9= right\n  | mark9size = 6\n  | lat9_deg = 33.326667\n  | lon9_deg = 44.368056\n}}\n| caption     = \n| date        = 23 September 1980\n| place       = [[Iraq]]\n| coordinates = \n| map_type    = \n| map_relief  = \n| latitude    = \n| longitude   = \n| map_size    = \n| map_marksize = \n| map_caption = \n| map_label   = \n| territory   = \n| result      = Iranian victory; Iran achieves air superiority against Iraq during the first years of the war.\n| status      = \n| combatants_header = \n| combatant1  = {{flag|Iran}}\n| combatant2  = {{flag|Iraq|1963}}\n| commander1  = {{flagicon|Iran}} [[Abulhassan Banisadr]]<br>{{flagicon|Iran}} Col.

At the same time the Iraqis also bombed 8 other major Air Bases in Iran.\n\n[[Media of Iraq#Iraqi media under Saddam|Radio Baghdad]] asks Iranian pilots to [[defector|defect]] to Iraq in a message after this operation.<ref name=aja>http://www.aja.ir/portal/home/?news/65175/65178/84491/%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AA-%DA%A9%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-99-%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%B1%D9%88%DB%8C-%D9%87%D9%88%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%B4</ref>\n\nHowever, having learned from the [[Six-Day War]], Iran had built [[hardened aircraft shelter]]s where most of its combat aircraft were stored, thus the Iraqis succeeded mainly in cratering Iranian [[runway]]s (which were quickly repaired), without causing any significant damage to Iran's Air Force. Now the Iranian Air Force started preparing for a counter-attack which was to be launched the next day.\n\nTwo hours after this Iraqi attack, the Iranian air force conducted Operation Entegham ({{lang|fa|\u0639\u0645\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0645}}, \"Revenge\"), bombing [[Shaiba Air Base|Shaiba]], [[Umm Qasr]] and [[Kut Air Base|Kut]] Air Bases in Iraq.<ref>http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8606270054</ref> According to many pilots who took part in the operations, both the precedent [[Operation Revenge|Operation Entegham]] and this subsequent Operation Kaman 99, were planned before the Islamic Revolution by the previous [[History of the Iranian Air Force|Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF)]] as a rapid response in case a conflict broke out with Iraq during the [[1974-75 Shatt al-Arab clashes]].<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/hoggit/comments/a8lrd3/long_war_story_operation_kaman_99_the_biggest/</ref>\n\n==The battle==\n\n23 September 1980, Iran launched Operation Kaman 99 as 40 [[F-4 Phantoms]], armed with [[Mark 82 bomb|Mark 82]], [[Mark 83 bomb|Mark 83]] and [[Mark 84 bomb]]s and [[AGM-65 Maverick]] missiles, took off from [[Hamadan Air Base]].

Meanwhile, eight more F-4s took off from Tehran's [[Mehrabad Airport|Mehrabad]] and launched a second attack on the al-Rasheed Air Base.\n\nIran launched 58 [[Northrop F-5|F-5E Tiger II]]s from [[Tabriz Air Base]], which were sent to attack [[Mosul Air Base]]. After the attack on Mosul Air Base, 50 F-5Es attacked [[Nasiriya Air Base]], which was heavily damaged.\n\nAs all 148 Iranian F-4s and F-5s had been sent for a bombing raid on Iraq, 60 [[F-14 Tomcat]]s were scrambled to defend Iranian airspace against a possible Iraqi retaliation. Iranian F-14s managed to down 2 Iraqi [[MiG-21]]s (1 MiG-21RF and 1 MiG-21MF) and 3 Iraqi MiG-23s (MiG-23MS), an Iranian F-5E also shot down an Iraqi Su-20 during the operation.\n\nTimeline of the air raids are as follows:<ref name=hamshahri /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nahaja.aja.ir/Portal/file/?71503%2Fkamane99-nahaee.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222110237/http://nahaja.aja.ir/Portal/file/?71503%2Fkamane99-nahaee.pdf |archive-date=22 February 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* 48 F-5E fighter-bombers from [[Tabriz Air Base]] bombed [[Mosul Air Base]].

This allowed Iranians to regroup and prepare for the upcoming Iraqi invasion.
