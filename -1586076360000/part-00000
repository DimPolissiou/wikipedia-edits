Approximately 600&nbsp;mg of bile salts are synthesized daily to replace bile acids lost in the feces, although, as described below, much larger amounts are secreted, reabsorbed in the gut and recycled. The [[rate-limiting step]] in synthesis is the addition of a hydroxyl group of the 7th position of the steroid nucleus by the enzyme [[CYP7A1|cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase]]. This enzyme is down-regulated by cholic acid, up-regulated by cholesterol and is inhibited by the actions of the [[ileal]] [[hormone]] [[FGF15/19]].<ref name=pmid12543708/><ref name=pmid19346330/>\n\nPrior to secreting any of the bile acids (primary or secondary, see below), liver cells conjugate them with either [[glycine]] or [[taurine]], to form a total of 8 possible '''conjugated bile acids'''. These conjugated bile acids are often referred to as '''bile salts'''. The [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] of the unconjugated bile acids are between 5 and 6.5,<ref name=Small /> and the pH of the duodenum ranges between 3 and 5, so when unconjugated bile acids are in the duodenum, they are almost always protonated (HA form), which makes them relatively insoluble in water. Conjugating bile acids with amino acids lowers the pKa of the bile-acid/amino-acid conjugate to between 1 and 4. Thus conjugated bile acids are almost always in their deprotonated (A-) form in the duodenum, which makes them much more water-soluble and much more able to fulfil their physiologic function of emulsifying fats.<ref>'Essentials of Medical Biochemistry, Lieberman, Marks and Smith, eds, p432, 2007'</ref><ref name=\"pmid14097367\">{{cite journal |author=Hofmann AF |title=The function of bile salts in fat absorption.

They are partial dehydroxylated. Their glycine and taurine groups are removed to give the '''secondary bile acids''', [[deoxycholic acid]] and [[lithocholic acid]]. Cholic acid is converted into deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid into lithocholic acid. All four of these bile acids recycled, in a process known as [[enterohepatic circulation]].<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\n==Functions==\nAs [[amphipathic]] molecules with [[hydrophobic]] and [[hydrophilic]] regions, conjugated bile salts sit at the lipid/water interface and, at the right concentration, form [[micelles]].<ref name=\"pmid14097367\"/> The added solubility of conjugated bile salts aids in their function by preventing passive re-absorption in the small intestine. As a result, the concentration of bile acids/salts in the small intestine is high enough to form micelles and solubilize lipids. \"Critical micellar concentration\" refers to both an intrinsic property of the bile acid itself and amount of bile acid necessary to function in the spontaneous and dynamic formation of micelles.<ref name=\"pmid14097367\"/> Bile acid-containing micelles aid [[lipases]] to digest lipids and bring them near the intestinal [[brush border]] membrane, which results in fat absorption.<ref name=\"pmid14162533\"/>\n\nSynthesis of bile acids is a major route of cholesterol metabolism in most species other than humans. The body produces about 800&nbsp;mg of cholesterol per day and about half of that is used for bile acid synthesis producing 400\u2013600&nbsp;mg daily. Human adults secrete between 12-18&nbsp;g of bile acids into the intestine each day, mostly after meals. The bile acid pool size is between 4\u20136&nbsp;g, which means that bile acids are recycled several times each day. About 95% of bile acids are reabsorbed by [[active transport]] in the [[ileum]] and recycled back to the liver for further secretion into the biliary system and gallbladder. This [[enterohepatic circulation]] of bile acids allows a low rate of synthesis, only about 0.3g/day, but with large amounts being secreted into the intestine.<ref name=\"pmid10597755\"/>\n\nBile acids have other functions, including eliminating cholesterol from the body, driving the flow of bile to eliminate certain catabolites (including [[bilirubin]]), emulsifying fat-soluble vitamins to enable their absorption, and aiding in motility and the reduction of the bacteria flora found in the small intestine and biliary tract.<ref name=\"pmid10597755\"/>\n\nBile acids have metabolic actions in the body resembling those of [[hormones]], acting through two specific receptors, the [[farnesoid X receptor]] and [[G protein-coupled bile acid receptor]]/[[G protein-coupled bile acid receptor|TGR5]].<ref name=\"pmid19758712\"/><ref name=\"pmid25073467\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Li T, Chiang JY |title=Bile acid signaling in metabolic disease and drug therapy |journal=Pharmacol.

The D-ring is smaller by one carbon than the other three. The structure is commonly drawn with A at the left and D at the right.  The hydroxyl groups can be in either of two configurations: either up (or out), termed beta (\u03b2; often drawn by convention as a solid line), or down, termed alpha (\u03b1; displayed as a dashed line). All bile acids have a 3-hydroxyl group, derived from the parent molecule, cholesterol, in which the 3-hydroxyl is beta.<ref name=\"pmid19638645\"/>\n[[Image:Steroid numbering.png|thumb|320px|[[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] recommended ring lettering (left) and atom numbering (right) of the steroid skeleton. The four rings A-D form a [[sterane]] core.]]\n\nThe initial step in the classical pathway of hepatic synthesis of bile acids is the enzymatic addition of a 7\u03b1 hydroxyl group by cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) forming [[7\u03b1-Hydroxycholesterol|7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol]]. This is then metabolised to [[7\u03b1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one]]. There are multiple steps in bile acid synthesis requiring 14 enzymes in all.<ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/> These result in the junction between the first two steroid rings (A and B) being altered, making the molecule bent; in this process, the 3-hydroxyl is converted to the \u03b1 orientation. The simplest 24-carbon bile acid has two hydroxyl groups at positions 3\u03b1 and 7\u03b1.  This is 3\u03b1,7\u03b1-dihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholan-24-oic acid, or, as more usually known, [[chenodeoxycholic acid]]. This bile acid was first isolated from the domestic goose, from which the \"[[Chen (genus)|cheno]]\" portion of the name was derived. The 5\u03b2 in the name denotes the orientation of the junction between rings A and B of the steroid nucleus (in this case, they are bent). The term \"cholan\" denotes a particular steroid structure of 24 carbons, and the \"24-oic acid\" indicates that the carboxylic acid is found at position 24, at the end of the side-chain. Chenodeoxycholic acid is made by many species, and is the prototypic functional bile acid.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\nAn alternative (acidic) pathway of bile acid synthesis is initiated by [[mitochondrial]] sterol 27-hydroxylase ([[CYP27A1]]), expressed in liver, and also in macrophages and other tissues. CYP27A1 contributes significantly to total bile acid synthesis by catalyzing sterol side chain oxidation, after which cleavage of a three-carbon unit in the [[peroxisomes]] leads to formation of a C24 bile acid. Minor pathways initiated by 25-hydroxylase in the liver and 24-hydroxylase in the brain also may contribute to bile acid synthesis. 7\u03b1-hydroxylase ([[CYP7B1]]) generates [[oxysterols]], which may be further converted in the liver to CDCA.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\n[[Cholic acid]], 3\u03b1,7\u03b1,12\u03b1-trihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholan-24-oic acid, the most abundant bile acid in humans and many other species, was discovered before chenodeoxycholic acid. It is a tri-hydroxy-bile acid with 3 hydroxyl groups (3\u03b1, 7\u03b1 and 12\u03b1). In its synthesis in the liver, 12\u03b1 hydroxylation is performed by the additional action of [[CYP8B1]]. As this had already been described, the discovery of chenodeoxcholic acid (with 2 hydroxyl groups) made this new bile acid a \"deoxycholic acid\" in that it had one fewer hydroxyl group than cholic acid.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\n[[Deoxycholic acid]] is formed from cholic acid by 7-dehydroxylation, resulting in 2 hydroxyl groups (3\u03b1 and 12\u03b1). This process with chenodeoxycholic acid results in a bile acid with only a 3\u03b1 hydroxyl group, termed [[lithocholic acid]] (litho = stone) having been identified first in a gallstone from a calf. It is poorly water-soluble and rather toxic to cells.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\nDifferent vertebrate families have evolved to use modifications of most positions on the steroid nucleus and side-chain of the bile acid structure. To avoid the problems associated with the production of lithocholic acid, most species add a third hydroxyl group to chenodeoxycholic acid. The subsequent removal of the 7\u03b1 hydroxyl group by intestinal bacteria will then result in a less toxic but still-functional dihydroxy bile acid. Over the course of vertebrate evolution, a number of positions have been chosen for placement of the third hydroxyl group. Initially, the 16\u03b1 position was favored, in particular in birds. Later, this position was superseded in a large number of species selecting the 12\u03b1 position. Primates (including humans) utilize 12\u03b1 for their third hydroxyl group position, producing cholic acid. In mice and other rodents, 6\u03b2 hydroxylation forms [[muricholic acid]]s (\u03b1 or \u03b2 depending on the 7 hydroxyl position). Pigs have 6\u03b1 hydroxylation in [[hyocholic acid]] (3\u03b1,6\u03b1,7\u03b1-trihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholanoic acid), and other species have a hydroxyl group on position 23 of the side-chain.\n\n[[Ursodeoxycholic acid]] was first isolated from [[bear bile]], which has been used medicinally for centuries. Its structure resembles chenodeoxycholic acid but with the 7-hydroxyl group in the \u03b2 position.<ref name=\"pmid19638645\"/>\n\n[[Obeticholic acid]], 6\u03b1-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, is a semi-synthetic bile acid with greater activity as FXR agonist which is undergoing investigation as a pharmaceutical agent.\n\n==Hormonal actions==\nBile acids also act as steroid hormones, secreted from the liver, absorbed from the intestine and having various direct metabolic actions in the body through the nuclear receptor [[Farnesoid X receptor]] (FXR), also known by its gene name {{Gene|NR1H4}}.<ref name=\"pmid10334992\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Makishima M, Okamoto AY, Repa JJ |title=Identification of a nuclear receptor for bile acids |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5418 |pages=1362\u20135 |date=May 1999  |pmid=10334992 |doi= 10.1126/science.284.5418.1362|url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10334993\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Parks DJ, Blanchard SG, Bledsoe RK |title=Bile acids: natural ligands for an orphan nuclear receptor |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5418 |pages=1365\u20138 |date=May 1999  |pmid=10334993 |doi= 10.1126/science.284.5418.1365|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10360171\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang H, Chen J, Hollister K, Sowers LC, Forman BM |title=Endogenous bile acids are ligands for the nuclear receptor FXR/BAR |journal=Mol.

Activation of FXR in the liver inhibits synthesis of bile acids, and is one mechanism of feedback control when bile acid levels are too high. Secondly, FXR activation by bile acids during absorption in the intestine increases transcription and synthesis of [[FGF19]], which then inhibits bile acid synthesis in the liver.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kim|first=I |author2=Ahn, SH |author3=Inagaki, T |author4=Choi, M |author5=Ito, S |author6=Guo, GL |author7=Kliewer, SA |author8=Gonzalez, FJ|title=Differential regulation of bile acid homeostasis by the farnesoid X receptor in liver and intestine|journal=Journal of Lipid Research|year=2007|volume=48|issue=12|pages=2664\u201372|pmid=17720959|doi=10.1194/jlr.M700330-JLR200}}</ref>\n\n===Metabolic functions===\nEmerging evidence associates FXR activation with alterations in [[triglyceride]] [[metabolism]], [[glucose metabolism]], and liver growth.<ref name=\"pmid19758712\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Hagit|last2=Kolodziejczyk|first2=Aleksandra A.|last3=Halstuch|first3=Daniel|last4=Elinav|first4=Eran|date=2018-01-16|title=Bile acids in glucose metabolism in health and disease|journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine|volume=215|issue=2|language=en|pages=383\u2013396|doi=10.1084/jem.20171965|pmid=29339445|pmc=5789421|issn=0022-1007}}</ref>\n\n===Other interactions===\nBile acids bind to some other proteins in addition to their hormone receptors (FXR and TGR5) and their transporters.

Approximately 600&nbsp;mg of bile salts are synthesized daily to replace bile acids lost in the feces, although, as described below, much larger amounts are secreted, reabsorbed in the gut and recycled. The [[rate-limiting step]] in synthesis is the addition of a hydroxyl group of the 7th position of the steroid nucleus by the enzyme [[CYP7A1|cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase]]. This enzyme is down-regulated by cholic acid, up-regulated by cholesterol and is inhibited by the actions of the [[ileal]] [[hormone]] [[FGF15/19]].<ref name=pmid12543708/><ref name=pmid19346330/>\n\nPrior to secreting any of the bile acids (primary or secondary, see below), liver cells conjugate them with either [[glycine]] or [[taurine]], to form a total of 8 possible '''conjugated bile acids'''. These conjugated bile acids are often referred to as '''bile salts'''. The [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] of the unconjugated bile acids are between 5 and 6.5,<ref name=Small /> and the pH of the duodenum ranges between 3 and 5, so when unconjugated bile acids are in the duodenum, they are almost always protonated (HA form), which makes them relatively insoluble in water. Conjugating bile acids with amino acids lowers the pKa of the bile-acid/amino-acid conjugate to between 1 and 4. Thus conjugated bile acids are almost always in their deprotonated (A-) form in the duodenum, which makes them much more water-soluble and much more able to fulfil their physiologic function of emulsifying fats.<ref>'Essentials of Medical Biochemistry, Lieberman, Marks and Smith, eds, p432, 2007'</ref><ref name=\"pmid14097367\">{{cite journal |author=Hofmann AF |title=The function of bile salts in fat absorption.

They are partial dehydroxylated. Their glycine and taurine groups are removed to give the '''secondary bile acids''', [[deoxycholic acid]] and [[lithocholic acid]]. Cholic acid is converted into deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid into lithocholic acid.

As a result, the concentration of bile acids/salts in the small intestine is high enough to form micelles and solubilize lipids. \"Critical micellar concentration\" refers to both an intrinsic property of the bile acid itself and amount of bile acid necessary to function in the spontaneous and dynamic formation of micelles.<ref name=\"pmid14097367\"/> Bile acid-containing micelles aid [[lipases]] to digest lipids and bring them near the intestinal [[brush border]] membrane, which results in fat absorption.<ref name=\"pmid14162533\"/>\n\nSynthesis of bile acids is a major route of cholesterol metabolism in most species other than humans. The body produces about 800&nbsp;mg of cholesterol per day and about half of that is used for bile acid synthesis producing 400\u2013600&nbsp;mg daily. Human adults secrete between 12-18&nbsp;g of bile acids into the intestine each day, mostly after meals. The bile acid pool size is between 4\u20136&nbsp;g, which means that bile acids are recycled several times each day. About 95% of bile acids are reabsorbed by [[active transport]] in the [[ileum]] and recycled back to the liver for further secretion into the biliary system and gallbladder. This [[enterohepatic circulation]] of bile acids allows a low rate of synthesis, only about 0.3g/day, but with large amounts being secreted into the intestine. <ref name=\"pmid10597755\"/>\n\nBile acids have other functions, including eliminating cholesterol from the body, driving the flow of bile to eliminate certain catabolites (including [[bilirubin]]), emulsifying fat-soluble vitamins to enable their absorption, and aiding in motility and the reduction of the bacteria flora found in the small intestine and biliary tract.<ref name=\"pmid10597755\"/>\n\nBile acids have metabolic actions in the body resembling those of [[hormones]], acting through two specific receptors, the [[farnesoid X receptor]] and [[G protein-coupled bile acid receptor]]/[[G protein-coupled bile acid receptor|TGR5]].<ref name=\"pmid19758712\"/><ref name=\"pmid25073467\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Li T, Chiang JY |title=Bile acid signaling in metabolic disease and drug therapy |journal=Pharmacol.

The D-ring is smaller by one carbon than the other three. The structure is commonly drawn with A at the left and D at the right.  The hydroxyl groups can be in either of two configurations: either up (or out), termed beta (\u03b2; often drawn by convention as a solid line), or down, termed alpha (\u03b1; displayed as a dashed line). All bile acids have a 3-hydroxyl group, derived from the parent molecule, cholesterol, in which the 3-hydroxyl is beta.<ref name=\"pmid19638645\"/>\n[[Image:Steroid numbering.png|thumb|320px|[[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] recommended ring lettering (left) and atom numbering (right) of the steroid skeleton. The four rings A-D form a [[sterane]] core.]]\n\nThe initial step in the classical pathway of hepatic synthesis of bile acids is the enzymatic addition of a 7\u03b1 hydroxyl group by cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) forming [[7\u03b1-Hydroxycholesterol|7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol]]. This is then metabolised to [[7\u03b1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one]]. There are multiple steps in bile acid synthesis requiring 14 enzymes in all.<ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/> These result in the junction between the first two steroid rings (A and B) being altered, making the molecule bent; in this process, the 3-hydroxyl is converted to the \u03b1 orientation. The simplest 24-carbon bile acid has two hydroxyl groups at positions 3\u03b1 and 7\u03b1.  This is 3\u03b1,7\u03b1-dihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholan-24-oic acid, or, as more usually known, [[chenodeoxycholic acid]]. This bile acid was first isolated from the domestic goose, from which the \"[[Chen (genus)|cheno]]\" portion of the name was derived. The 5\u03b2 in the name denotes the orientation of the junction between rings A and B of the steroid nucleus (in this case, they are bent). The term \"cholan\" denotes a particular steroid structure of 24 carbons, and the \"24-oic acid\" indicates that the carboxylic acid is found at position 24, at the end of the side-chain. Chenodeoxycholic acid is made by many species, and is the prototypic functional bile acid.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\nAn alternative (acidic) pathway of bile acid synthesis is initiated by [[mitochondrial]] sterol 27-hydroxylase ([[CYP27A1]]), expressed in liver, and also in macrophages and other tissues. CYP27A1 contributes significantly to total bile acid synthesis by catalyzing sterol side chain oxidation, after which cleavage of a three-carbon unit in the [[peroxisomes]] leads to formation of a C24 bile acid. Minor pathways initiated by 25-hydroxylase in the liver and 24-hydroxylase in the brain also may contribute to bile acid synthesis. 7\u03b1-hydroxylase ([[CYP7B1]]) generates [[oxysterols]], which may be further converted in the liver to CDCA.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\n[[Cholic acid]], 3\u03b1,7\u03b1,12\u03b1-trihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholan-24-oic acid, the most abundant bile acid in humans and many other species, was discovered before chenodeoxycholic acid. It is a tri-hydroxy-bile acid with 3 hydroxyl groups (3\u03b1, 7\u03b1 and 12\u03b1). In its synthesis in the liver, 12\u03b1 hydroxylation is performed by the additional action of [[CYP8B1]]. As this had already been described, the discovery of chenodeoxcholic acid (with 2 hydroxyl groups) made this new bile acid a \"deoxycholic acid\" in that it had one fewer hydroxyl group than cholic acid.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\n[[Deoxycholic acid]] is formed from cholic acid by 7-dehydroxylation, resulting in 2 hydroxyl groups (3\u03b1 and 12\u03b1). This process with chenodeoxycholic acid results in a bile acid with only a 3\u03b1 hydroxyl group, termed [[lithocholic acid]] (litho = stone) having been identified first in a gallstone from a calf. It is poorly water-soluble and rather toxic to cells.<ref name=\"pmid12543708\"/><ref name=\"pmid19346330\"/>\n\nDifferent vertebrate families have evolved to use modifications of most positions on the steroid nucleus and side-chain of the bile acid structure. To avoid the problems associated with the production of lithocholic acid, most species add a third hydroxyl group to chenodeoxycholic acid. The subsequent removal of the 7\u03b1 hydroxyl group by intestinal bacteria will then result in a less toxic but still-functional dihydroxy bile acid. Over the course of vertebrate evolution, a number of positions have been chosen for placement of the third hydroxyl group. Initially, the 16\u03b1 position was favored, in particular in birds. Later, this position was superseded in a large number of species selecting the 12\u03b1 position. Primates (including humans) utilize 12\u03b1 for their third hydroxyl group position, producing cholic acid. In mice and other rodents, 6\u03b2 hydroxylation forms [[muricholic acid]]s (\u03b1 or \u03b2 depending on the 7 hydroxyl position). Pigs have 6\u03b1 hydroxylation in [[hyocholic acid]] (3\u03b1,6\u03b1,7\u03b1-trihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholanoic acid), and other species have a hydroxyl group on position 23 of the side-chain.\n\n[[Ursodeoxycholic acid]] was first isolated from [[bear bile]], which has been used medicinally for centuries. Its structure resembles chenodeoxycholic acid but with the 7-hydroxyl group in the \u03b2 position.<ref name=\"pmid19638645\"/>\n\n[[Obeticholic acid]], 6\u03b1-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, is a semi-synthetic bile acid with greater activity as FXR agonist which is undergoing investigation as a pharmaceutical agent.\n\n==Hormonal actions==\nBile acids also act as steroid hormones, secreted from the liver, absorbed from the intestine and having various direct metabolic actions in the body through the nuclear receptor [[Farnesoid X receptor]] (FXR), also known by its gene name {{Gene|NR1H4}}.<ref name=\"pmid10334992\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Makishima M, Okamoto AY, Repa JJ |title=Identification of a nuclear receptor for bile acids |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5418 |pages=1362\u20135 |date=May 1999  |pmid=10334992 |doi= 10.1126/science.284.5418.1362|url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10334993\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Parks DJ, Blanchard SG, Bledsoe RK |title=Bile acids: natural ligands for an orphan nuclear receptor |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5418 |pages=1365\u20138 |date=May 1999  |pmid=10334993 |doi= 10.1126/science.284.5418.1365|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10360171\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang H, Chen J, Hollister K, Sowers LC, Forman BM |title=Endogenous bile acids are ligands for the nuclear receptor FXR/BAR |journal=Mol.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Woolworths, however, has no association to Australia's [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] supermarket chain.\n\nThe South African Woolworths business consists of full-line fashion, home and beauty stores, many of which incorporate a premium food retail offering. Stand-alone food stores and \"Food Stops\" attached to [[Engen Petroleum|Engen]] petrol stations are also located in urban areas. Woolworths operates 218 full line stores and 430 food stand alone stores in South Africa, with 64 stores throughout the rest of Africa. Woolworths sells clothing and accessory items under a number of premium brands, namely Studio W, RE: and Edition, with the Group\u2019s Australian brands [[Country Road]], [[Witchery (company)|Witchery]] and Trenery also represented.\n\nThe Group's Australian-based specialty apparel and homewares retail subsidiary Country Road Group operates 557 stores (and a further 242 concession locations within [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]]), The Group operates under separate brands [[Country Road]], [[Witchery (company)|Witchery]], [[Trenery]], [[Mimco]] and [[Politix]].\n\n==History==\n\nFounded by [[Max Sonnenberg]], Woolworths first opened its doors on 30 October 1931 in Plein Street Cape Town, in the dining room of the recently-closed down Royal Hotel. It was an immediate success, and two more stores were opened in the Cape. It was clear that the new business had the potential to expand nationwide except for a lack of capital. Sonnenberg's friend Elie Susman put up the money for the expansion of the business into the [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]] and became Sonnenberg's business partner.[[File:Woolworths_first_store_in_The_Royal_Hotel,_Plein_Street.jpg|thumb|The first Woolworths store, in the stately dining room of The Royal Hotel, Cape Town]]\nThe choice of name came from Sonnenberg's friendship with a London shipper and financier called Percy (P.R.) Lewis. Lewis was a director of Australasian Chain Stores, ACS, a London shipping and finance house that had been formed to service a rapidly expanding Australian business founded by W.T. Christmas. London shippers commonly provided finance and often selected goods, sight unseen, which were dispatched to their clients. Given that the (now defunct) American company [[F. W. Woolworth Company|F.W Woolworth Company]] had no desire to trade in Australia, \"Father\" Christmas as he was known, used the name for his new [[Woolworths Group (Australia)|Woolworths]] enterprise.  Lewis proposed to Sonnenberg that ACS could add to 'Father' Christmas's order sheet and send a scaled-down quantity of every item that was succeeding in Australia, to South Africa. Sonnenberg therefore also adopted the name for his new venture. Two years later, a South African court ruled that sufficient goodwill had been established to refuse an injunction brought against the use of the name by the American retailer.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An African Shopkeeper|last=Susman|first=David|publisher=Fernwood Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-874950-78-3|location=Cape Town|pages=27}}</ref>\n\n== Corporate Affairs and Culture ==\n\n===Good Business Journey===\nStarted in 2007, the Good Business Journey set specific public targets in sustainability for the company.

The campaign had four layers: entertainment, showcasing young talent, fundraising for education, and driving sustainable fashion.\n\n===Black Economic Empowerment Employee Share Ownership Scheme===\nIn July 2015, Woolworths announced the maturity of its [[Black Economic Empowerment]] Employee Share Ownership Scheme (BEEESOS).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Retail/Woolworths-R24bn-BEE-scheme-matures-20150716|title=R2.4bn BEE pot matures for Woolworths staff|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Fin24|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe scheme was launched in 2007 as part of the company\u2019s Good Business Journey and is one element of the company\u2019s commitment to socio-economic transformation. Woolworths was the first retailer to launch an empowerment scheme with BEESOS shares allocated to previously disadvantaged employees on the basis of both length of service and seniority.  The scheme represented approximately 10% of the ordinary share capital of Woolworths at the time.\n\nThe strong performance of the business over the past eight years has created R2.4 billion for the participants, who have also enjoyed dividends of R332 million during the life of the scheme.\n\n===World Retail Congress\u2019s International Women in Retail: Woman of the Year award===\nZyda Rylands, CEO of Woolworths South Africa received the inaugural Woman of The Year award at the World Retail Congress\u2019s International Women in Retail Reception held on 5 April 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shoppingandretail.co.za/2017/05/02/sas-zyda-rylands-scoops-woman-of-the-year-award-at-world-retail-awards-2017-in-dubai/|title=SA\u2019s Zyda Rylands scoops Woman of the Year award at World Retail Awards 2017 in Dubai|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Shopping and Retail|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nZyda was given the special award in recognition of her work, both as an international leader, philanthropist and for her outstanding commercial success.

In the United States, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA) fell exactly 508 points (22.6%), accompanied by crashes in the [[Futures exchange|futures]] and [[Option (finance)|options]] markets.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|p=1}} This was the largest one-day percentage drop in Dow Jones history. Significant selling created steep price declines throughout the day, particularly during the last hour and a half of trading. The [[S&P 500]] and [[Wilshire 5000]] indices each declined more than 18 percent, and the S&P 500 futures contract declined 29 percent.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|pp=8\u20139}} Total trading volume was so large that the computer and communications systems in place at the time were overwhelmed, leaving orders unfilled for an hour or more. Large funds transfers were delayed for hours and the [[Fedwire]] and NYSE [[SuperDot|DOT]] systems shut down for extended periods of time, further compounding traders' confusion.{{sfnm|1a1=Carlson|1y=2007|1p=9|2a1=Bernanke|2y=1990|2p=146}}\n\nAll of the twenty-three major world markets experienced a similar decline that October. When measured in a common currency (US dollars), eight of them declined by 20 to 29%, three by 30 to 39% (Malaysia, Mexico and New Zealand), and three by more than 40% (Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore).{{sfn|Roll|1988|pp=20 (table 1), 21}}{{efn-ua| The markets were: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore,  South  Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.}} Worldwide losses were estimated at $1.7 trillion US dollars.{{sfn|Schaede|1991|p=42}} The severity of the crash sparked fears of extended economic instability{{sfn|Group of 33}} or even a reprise of the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Lobb|2007}} Across nations, the degree to which  the financial  markets' distress spread to the wider economy (the \"real economy\") was directly related to the [[monetary policy]] each nation pursued in response. The [[central bank]]s of the United States, West Germany and Japan provided [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] to prevent debt defaults among financial institutions, and the impact on the real economy was relatively limited and short-lived. The [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]]'s refusal to loosen monetary policy in response to the crisis, however, had sharply negative and relatively long-term consequences for both financial markets and the real economy.{{sfnm|1a1=Grant|1y=1997|1p=330|2a1=Hunt|2y=2009}}\n\nIn [[finance]], the crash of 1987 also apparently had the ongoing effect of altering [[implied volatility]] patterns that arise in pricing financial [[option (finance)|options]]. Equity options traded in American markets did not show a [[volatility smile]] before the crash but began showing one afterwards.{{sfn|Hull|2003|p=335}}\n\n==United States==\n===Background===\n[[File:S&P 500 index around the time of the crash.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Timeline compiled by the [[Federal Reserve]]]]\n\nIn late 1985 and early 1986, the United States economy shifted from a rapid recovery from the [[early 1980s recession]] to a slower expansion, resulting in a brief \"[[soft landing (economics)|soft landing]]\" period as the economy slowed and [[inflation]] dropped. The stock market advanced significantly, with the Dow peaking in August 1987 at 2,722 points, or 44% over the previous year's closing of 1,895 points.\n\nThe crash was preceded by significant drops in the prior week. Two events in the news on the morning of October 14 have sometimes been singled out as possible triggers for the crash.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=6}} The [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]] introduced a tax bill that would reduce the tax benefits associated with financing mergers and [[leveraged buyout]]s.{{sfnm|1a1=Carlson|1y=2007|1p=6|2a1=Malliaris |2a2= Urrutia |2y= 1992 |2p=354}} Second, unexpectedly high [[trade deficit]] figures announced by the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] had a negative impact on the value of the US dollar while pushing interest rates upward and also put downward pressure on stock prices.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=6}} However, other sources have questioned the impact of these news events. For example, Nobel-prize winning economist [[Robert J. Shiller]] surveyed 889 investors (605 individual investors and 284 institutional investors) immediately after the crash regarding several aspects of their experience at the time. Only three institutional investors and no individual investors reported a belief that the news regarding proposed tax legislation was a trigger for the crash. According to Shiller, the most common responses were related to a general mindset of investors at the time: a \"gut feeling\" of an impending crash, perhaps brought on by \"too much indebtedness\".{{sfn |Shiller| 1988|pp=292&ndash;293}}\n\nOn Wednesday, the DJIA dropped 95.46 points (3.8%) ([[List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average|a then record]]) to 2,412.70, and it fell another 58 points (2.4%) the next day, down over 12% from the August 25 all-time high. On Friday, October 16, the DJIA fell 108.35 points (4.6%) to close at 2,246.74 on record volume. That was again a one-day record at the time.{{sfn|Bernhardt|Eckblad|2013|pp=2, 6 ''note 5''}} Though the markets were closed for the weekend, significant selling pressure still existed. The computer models of portfolio insurers continued to dictate very large sales.{{sfn|Lindsey | Pecora|1998 |pp=3&ndash;4}} Moreover, some large [[mutual fund]] groups had procedures that enabled customers to easily redeem their shares during the weekend at the same prices that existed at the close of market on Friday.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|p=29}} The amount of these redemption requests was far greater than the firms' cash reserves, requiring them to make large sales of shares as soon as the market opened on the following Monday. Finally, some traders anticipated these pressures and tried to get ahead of the market by selling early and aggressively Monday, before the anticipated price drop.{{sfn|Lindsey|Pecora|1998|pp=3&ndash;4}}\n\n===De-linked markets and index arbitrage===\nBefore the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) opened on Monday the 19th there was pent-up pressure to sell stocks. When the market opened, a large imbalance immediately arose between the volume of sell orders and buy orders, placing considerable downward pressure on stock prices. Regulations at the time permitted designated [[market maker]]s (also known as \"specialists\") to delay or suspend trading in a stock if the order imbalance exceeded that specialist's ability to fulfill orders in an orderly manner.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=8, note 11}} The order imbalance on the 19th was so large that 95 stocks on the [[S&P 500 Index]] (S&P) opened late, as also did 11 of the 30 [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA) stocks.{{sfn |Carlson |2007 |p=8}} Importantly, however, the futures market opened on time across the board, with heavy selling.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=8}}\n\nUnder normal circumstances the stock market and those of its main [[Stock#Stock derivatives|derivatives]]\u2013futures and options\u2013are functionally a single market, given that the price of any particular [[stock]] is closely connected to the prices of its counterpart in both the futures and options market.{{sfnm |1a1=Kleidon |1a2=Whaley |1y=1992 |1pp=851\u201352|2a1=Brady Report|2y=1988|2p=55 & 57}} Prices in the derivative markets are typically tightly connected to those of the underlying stock, though they differ somewhat  (as for example, prices of futures are typically higher than that of their particular cash stock).{{sfn |Kleidon |Whaley |1992 |p=851}} During the crisis this link was broken.{{sfnm |1a1=Kleidon |1a2=Whaley |1y=1992 |1pp=851\u201352}}\n\nWhen the futures market opened while the stock market was closed, it created a pricing imbalance: the listed price of those stocks which opened late had no chance to change from their closing price of the day before. The quoted prices were thus \"stale\" and did not reflect current economic conditions; they were generally listed higher than they should have been{{sfn|Kleidon |Whaley |1992 |pp=859\u201360}} (and dramatically higher than their respective futures, which are typically higher than stocks).{{sfn|Kleidon |Whaley |1992 |pp=859\u201360}}\n\nThe decoupling of these markets meant that futures prices had temporarily lost their validity as a vehicle for [[price discovery]]; they no longer could be relied upon to inform traders of the direction or degree of stock market expectations. This had harmful effects: it added to the atmosphere of uncertainty and confusion at a time when investor confidence was sorely needed; it discouraged investors from \"leaning against the wind\" and buying stocks, since the discount in the futures market logically implied that investors could wait and purchase stocks at an even lower price; and it encouraged portfolio insurance investors to sell in the stock market, putting further downward pressure on stock prices.{{sfn|Macey|Mitchell|Netter|1988|p=832}}\n\nThe gap between the futures and stocks was quickly noted by [[index arbitrage]] traders who tried to profit through [[Order (exchange)#Market order|sell at market]] orders. Index arbitrage, a form of [[program trading]],{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=5}} added to the confusion and the downward pressure on prices:{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=8}}\n{{quote|...reflecting the natural linkages among markets, the selling pressure washed across to the stock market, both through index arbitrage and direct  portfolio insurance stock sales. Large amounts of selling, and the demand for liquidity associated with it, cannot be contained in a single market segment. It  necessarily overflows into the other market segments, which are naturally linked. There are, however, natural limits to intermarket liquidity which were made evident on October 19 and 20.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|p=56}}}}\nAlthough arbitrage between index futures and stocks placed downward pressure on prices, it does not explain why the surge in sell orders that brought steep price declines began in the first place.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=933}} Moreover, the markets \"performed most chaotically\"  during those times when the links that index arbitrage program trading creates between these markets was ''broken''.{{sfn|Miller | Hawke |  Malkiel |Scholes  |1989|pp=12&ndash;13}}\n\n===Portfolio insurance hedges===\n[[Portfolio insurance]] is a [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] technique which attempts to manage risk and limit losses by buying and selling [[financial instrument]]s (for example, stocks or futures) in reaction to changes in market price rather than changes in [[Fundamental analysis|market fundamental]]s. Specifically, they buy when the market is rising, and sell when the market is falling, without regard for any fundamental information about ''why'' the market is rising or falling.{{sfnm|1a1=Leland|1y=1988| 2a1=Leland|2y=1992 }} Thus it is an example of an \"informationless trade\"{{sfn|Macey|Mitchell|Netter|1988|p=819, note 84}} that has the potential to create a market-destabilizing feedback loop.{{sfn|Leland|1992|p=55}}\n\nThis strategy became a source of downward pressure when portfolio insurers whose computer models noted that stocks opened lower and continued their steep price. The models  recommended even further sales.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=8}} The potential for computer-generated feedback loops that these hedges created has been discussed as a factor compounding the severity of the crash, but not as an initial trigger.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|p=v}} Economist [[Hayne Leland]] argues against this interpretation, suggesting that the impact of portfolio hedging on stock prices was probably relatively small.{{sfn|Leland|1988|pp=83\u201384}} Similarly, the report of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] found the influence of \"other investors &ndash; mutual funds, broker-dealers and individual shareholders &ndash; was thus three to five times greater than that of the portfolio insurers\" during the crash.{{sfn|Miller | Hawke |  Malkiel |Scholes |1989|p=6}} Numerous econometric studies have analyzed the evidence  to determine whether portfolio insurance exacerbated the crash, but the results have been unclear.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2004|p=10}} Markets around the world which did not have portfolio insurance trading experienced as much turmoil and loss as the U.S. market;{{sfn|Miller | Hawke |  Malkiel |Scholes |1989|pp=6&ndash;7}}. More to the point, the cross-market analysis of [[Richard Roll]], for example, found that markets with a greater prevalence of computerized trading (including portfolio insurance) actually experienced relatively less severe losses (in percentage terms) than those without.{{sfn|Roll|1988|pp=29\u201330}}\n\n===Noise trading===\nThe crisis affected markets around the world; however, no international news event or change in market fundamentals has been shown to have had a strong effect on investor behavior.{{sfnm|1a1= Shiller |1y= 1987 |1p=23| 2a1=Bernanke |2y=1990 |2p= 133}} Instead, contemporaneous causality and feedback behavior between markets increased dramatically during this period.{{sfn|Malliaris | Urrutia | 1992 |pp=362\u201363}} In an environment of increased [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]], confusion and uncertainty, investors not only in the US but also across the world{{sfn|King|Wadhwani|1990}} were inferring information from changes in stock prices and communication with other investors{{sfn|Shiller|1987 |p=23}} in a self-reinforcing contagion of fear.{{sfn|Goodhart|1988}} This pattern of basing trading decisions largely on [[market psychology|psychological factor]]s is often referred to as one form of \"noise trading\", which occurs when ill-informed investors \"[trade] on noise as if it were news\".{{sfn|Black|1988|pp=273\u201374}} If noise is misinterpreted as bad news, then the reactions of risk-averse traders and arbitrageurs will bias the market, preventing it from establishing prices that accurately reflect the fundamental state of the underlying stocks.{{sfn|Cunningham|1994|p=10}} For example, on October 19 rumors that the New York Stock Exchange would close created additional confusion and  drove prices further downward, while rumors the next day that two [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] clearinghouses were insolvent deterred some investors from trading in that marketplace.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|pp=9, 10, 17}}\n\nA [[feedback loop]] of noise-induced-volatility has been cited by some analysts as the major reason for the severe depth of the crash. It does not, however, explain what initially triggered the market break.{{sfnm|1a1=Shleifer|1a2=Summers|1y=1990|1p=30|2a1=Black|2y=1988|2pp=273\u201374}} Moreover, [[Lawrence A. Cunningham]] has suggested that while noise theory is \"supported by substantial empirical evidence and a well-developed intellectual foundation\", it makes only a partial contribution toward explaining events such as the crash of October 1987.{{sfn|Cunningham|1994|pp=3, 10}} Informed traders, not swayed by psychological or emotional factors, have room to make trades they know to be less risky.{{sfn|Cunningham|1994|p=26}}\n\n===Margin calls and liquidity===\n[[Frederic Mishkin]] suggested that the greatest economic danger was not events on the day of the crash itself, but the potential for \"spreading collapse of securities firms\" if an extended [[liquidity crisis]] in the [[securities industry]] began to threaten the [[solvency]] and viability of [[brokerage house]]s and specialists. This possibility first loomed on the day after the crash.{{sfn|Mishkin|1988|pp=29\u201330}} At least initially, there was a very real risk that these institutions could fail.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|ps=,&nbsp;Study VI, p. 73}} If that happened, [[spillover effect]]s could sweep over the entire financial system, with negative consequences for the [[real economy]] as a whole.{{sfnm|1a1=Cecchetti|1a2=Disyatat|1y=2009|1p=1|2a1=Carlson|2y=2007|2p=20}}\n\nThe source of these liquidity problems was a general increase in [[margin call]]s; after the market's plunge, these were about ten times their average size and three times greater than the highest previous morning variation call.{{sfnm|1a1=Brady Report |1y=1988|1ps=,&nbsp;Study VI, p. 70|2a1=Carlson|2y=2007|2pp=12\u201313}} Several firms had insufficient cash in customers' accounts (that is, they were \"undersegregated\"). Firms drawing funds from their own capital to meet the shortfall sometimes became undercapitalized; for example, 11 firms had a margin call from a single customer that exceeded that firm's adjusted net capital, sometimes by as much as two-to-one.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|ps=,&nbsp;Study VI, p. 73}} Investors needed to repay end-of-day margin calls made on the 19th before the opening of the market on the 20th. Clearinghouse member firms called on lending institutions to extend credit to cover these sudden and unexpected charges, but the brokerages requesting additional credit began to exceed their credit limit. Banks were also worried about increasing their involvement and exposure to a chaotic market.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|pp=12\u201313}} The size and urgency of the demands for credit placed upon banks was unprecedented.{{sfn|Garcia|1989|p=153}} In general, [[counterparty risk]] increased as the creditworthiness of [[counterparty|counterparties]] and the value of collateral posted became highly uncertain.{{sfnm|1a1=Kohn|1y=2006|2a1=Bernanke |2y=1990 |2pp= 146\u201347 }}\n<!-- The Black Monday decline was, and currently remains, the [[List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average|largest one-day percentage decline in the DJIA]]. (Saturday, December 12, 1914, is sometimes erroneously cited as the largest one-day percentage decline of the DJIA. In reality, the ostensible decline of 24.39% was created retroactively by a redefinition of the DJIA in 1916.{{sfn|Setting Record Straight|1987}} {{sfn|Bialik|2008}}) -->\n\n===Federal Reserve response===\nThe U.S. [[central bank]]ing system (the [[Federal Reserve]] or \"the Fed\") acted swiftly and decisively as [[lender of last resort]] to counter the crisis.{{sfn|Garcia |1989}} The Fed utilized tools it had at its disposal to meet the market disruption: [[crisis management]] via public pronouncements, supplying liquidity through [[open market operation]]s,{{sfn|Garcia |1989|p=151}}{{efn-ua| [[Discount window]] borrowing did not play a major role in the Federal Reserve's response to the crisis.{{sfnm|1a1=Carlson|1y=2007|1p=18, note 17|2a1=Garcia |2y=1989|2p=159}}}} persuading banks to lend to securities firms,  and intervening directly in a few cases.{{sfn|Bernanke |1990 |p=148}}\n\nOn the morning of October 20, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made a brief statement: \"The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the Nation's central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system\".{{sfn|Greenspan|1987|p= 915}} Fed sources suggested that the brevity was deliberate, in order to avoid misinterpretations.{{sfn|Garcia |1989|p=151}} This \"extraordinary\"{{sfn|Mishkin|1988|p=30}} announcement probably had a calming effect on markets{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=10}} that were facing an equally unprecedented demand for liquidity{{sfn|Garcia|1989|p=153}} and the immediate potential for a liquidity crisis.{{sfnm|1a1=Mishkin|1y=1988|1pp=29\u201330|2a1=Brady Report|2y=1988|2ps=,&nbsp;Study VI, p. 73}}\n\nThe Fed then acted to provide [[market liquidity]] and prevent the crisis from expanding into other markets. It immediately began injecting its reserves into the financial system via purchases on the open market. This rapidly pushed the federal funds rate down by 0.5%. The Fed continued its expansive open market purchases of securities for weeks. The Fed also repeatedly began these interventions an hour before the regularly scheduled time, notifying dealers of the schedule change on the evening beforehand. This was all done in a very high-profile and public manner, similar to Greenspan's initial announcement, to restore market confidence that liquidity was forthcoming.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|pp=17\u201318}} Although the Fed's holdings expanded appreciably over time, the speed of expansion was not excessive.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=18}} Moreover, the Fed later disposed of these holdings so that its long-term policy goals would not be adversely affected.{{sfn|Garcia |1989|p=151}}\n\nFinally, and very importantly, the Fed successfully  met the unprecedented demands for credit{{sfnm|1a1=Carlson|1y=2007|1pp=13\u201314|2a1=Garcia|2y=1989|2p=153}} by pairing a strategy of [[moral suasion]] that motivated nervous banks to lend to securities firms alongside its moves to reassure those banks by actively supplying them with liquidity.{{sfnm|1a1=Garcia |1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Bernanke|2y=1990|2p=149}} As economist [[Ben Bernanke]] (who was later to become Chairman of the Federal Reserve) wrote:\n{{quote|The Fed's key action was to induce the banks (by suasion and by the supply of liquidity) to make loans, on customary terms, despite chaotic conditions and the possibility of severe adverse selection of borrowers. In expectation, making these loans must have been a money-losing strategy from the point of view of the banks (and the Fed); otherwise, Fed persuasion would not have been needed.{{sfn|Bernanke|1990|p=149}}}}\nThe Fed's two-part strategy was thoroughly successful, since lending to securities firms by large banks in Chicago  and especially in New York increased substantially,  often nearly doubling.{{sfnm|1a1=Carlson|1y=2007|1p=14|2a1=Bernanke|2y=1990|2p=149}}\n\n===Regulation===\nAfter Black Monday, regulators overhauled trade-clearing protocols to bring uniformity to all prominent market products. They also developed new rules, known as \"[[trading curb]]s\" or colloquially as circuit breakers, allowing exchanges to temporarily halt trading in instances of exceptionally large price declines in some indexes; for instance, the DJIA.{{sfnm|1a1=Bernhardt|1a2=Eckblad|1y=2013|1p=3|2a1=Lindsey | 2a2=Pecora|2y=1998}} These trading curbs were first used multiple times during the [[2020 stock market crash]].{{sfn|Shieber|2020}}\n\n==UK==\n{{main|Economy of England}}\nOn Friday, October 16, all the markets in London were unexpectedly closed due to the [[Great Storm of 1987]]. After London re-opened, the speed of the crash accelerated in London, partially attributed by some to the storm closure. By  9:30&nbsp;a.m., the FTSE100 had fallen over 136 points.{{sfn|Black Monday 10th |1997}} The abrupt drop of the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] index brought it down  23 percent in two days, roughly the same percentage that the [[NYSE]] dropped on the day of the crash.  Stocks then continued to fall, albeit at a less precipitous rate, until reaching a trough in mid-November at an accumulative 36% below its pre-crash peak. Stocks did not begin to recover until 1989.{{sfn|Roberts|2008|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n==Japan==\n{{main|Economy of Japan}}\nIn Japan the October 1987 crash is sometimes referred to as \"Blue Tuesday\", in part because of the time zone difference, and in part because its effects after the initial crash were relatively mild.{{sfn|Schaede|1991|p=42}}  In both places, according to economist [[Ulrike Schaede]], the initial market break was severe: the Tokyo market declined 14.9% in one day, and Japan's losses of US$421 billion ranked next to New York's $500 billion, out of a worldwide total loss of $1.7 trillion. However, systemic differences between the US and Japanese financial systems led to significantly different outcomes during and after the crash on Tuesday, October 20. In Japan the ensuing panic was no more than mild at worst. The [[Nikkei 225]] Index returned to its pre-crash levels after only five months. Other global markets performed less well in the aftermath of the crash, with New York, London and Frankfurt all needing more than a year to achieve the same level of recovery.{{sfn|Schaede|1991|pp=42\u201345}}\n\nSeveral of Japan's distinctive institutional characteristics already in place at the time, according to  [[economist]] [[David Hale (economist)|David D. Hale]], helped it dampen volatility. These included [[trading curb]]s  such as a sharp limit on price movements of a share of more than 10\u201315 percent; restrictions and institutional barriers to  [[short-selling]] by domestic and international traders; frequent adjustments of [[margin requirement]]s in response to changes in volatility; strict guidelines on [[mutual fund]] redemptions; and actions of the  [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Ministry of Finance]] to control the total shares of stock and exert [[moral suasion]] on the securities industry.{{sfn|Hale|1988|pages=182\u201383}} An example of the latter occurred when the ministry invited representatives of the four largest securities firms to tea in the early afternoon of the day of the crash.{{sfn|Schaede|1991|p=45}} After tea at the ministry, these firms began to make large purchases of [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|Nippon Telephone and Telegraph]] (NTT) stocks.{{sfn|Schaede|1991|p=45}}\n\n==New Zealand==\n{{main|Economy of New Zealand}}\nThe crash of the New Zealand stock market was notably long and deep, continuing its decline for an extended period of time after other global markets had recovered.{{sfn|Grant|1997|p=329}}  Unlike other nations, moreover, for New Zealand the effects of the October 1987 crash spilled over into its real economy, contributing to a prolonged recession.{{sfnm|1a1=Hunt|1y=2009|1p=36|2a1=Grant|2y=1997|2p=337}}\n\nThe effects of the worldwide economic boom of the mid-1980s had been amplified in New Zealand by a recent relaxation of [[foreign exchange controls]] and a wave of [[banking deregulation]].  Deregulation in particular  suddenly gave financial institutions considerably more freedom to lend, though they had little experience in doing so.{{sfnm|1a1=Hunt|1y=2009|1p=35|2a1=Reddell|2a2= Sleeman|2y=2008|2p=14}} The finance industry was in a state of increasing optimism that approached euphoria.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=35}} This created an atmosphere conducive to greater [[financial risk|risk]] taking, which investors took advantage of through increased [[speculation]] in the stock market and real estate.  Foreign investors were notably active in this trend, attracted by New Zealand's relatively high interest rates. From around the end of 1984 until the date of the crash, commercial property prices and commercial construction rose sharply, while share prices in the stock market tripled.{{sfnm|1a1=Hunt|1y=2009|1p=35|2a1=Reddell|2a2= Sleeman|2y=2008|2p=14}}\n\nNew Zealand's stock market fell nearly 15% on the first day of the crash.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=36}} In the first three-and-a-half months following the crash, the value of New Zealand's market shares was cut in half.{{sfn|Reddell|Sleeman|2008|p=14}} By the time it reached its [[Trough (economics)|trough]] in February 1988 the market had lost 60 percent of its value.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=36}} The financial crisis triggered a wave of [[deleveraging]] with significant macro-economic consequences. Investment companies and property developers began a [[fire sale]] of their properties, partially to help offset their share price losses, and partially because the crash had exposed overbuilding. Moreover, these firms had been using property as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for their increased borrowing. Thus when property values collapsed, the health of [[balance sheet]]s of lending institutions was damaged.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=36}} The Reserve Bank of New Zealand declined to loosen monetary policy in response to the crisis, however, which would have helped firms settle their obligations and remain in operation.{{sfnm|1a1=Grant|1y=1997|1p=330|2a1=Hunt|2y=2009}} As the harmful effects spread over the next few years,  major corporations and financial institutions went out of business, and the banking systems of New Zealand and Australia were impaired.{{sfn|Reddell|Sleeman|2008|p=14}} Access to credit was reduced.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=36}} The combination of these contributed significantly to a long recession running from 1987 until 1993.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=36}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[2010 Flash Crash]]\n* [[Friday the 13th mini-crash|Black Friday]] (October 13, 1989)\n* [[List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average]]\n* [[Stock market crashes in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] (Black Tuesday)\n* [[Black Monday (TV series)|Black Monday]] (2019 TV Series)\n* [[Black Monday (2020)]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal|last=Bates |first=David S. |title=The Crash of \u02bc87: Was It Expected?

In the United States, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA) fell exactly 508 points (22.6%), accompanied by crashes in the [[Futures exchange|futures]] and [[Option (finance)|options]] markets.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|p=1}} This was the largest one-day percentage drop in Dow Jones history. Significant selling created steep price declines throughout the day, particularly during the last hour and a half of trading. The [[S&P 500]] and [[Wilshire 5000]] indices each declined more than 18 percent, and the S&P 500 futures contract declined 29 percent.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|pp=8\u20139}} Total trading volume was so large that the computer and communications systems in place at the time were overwhelmed, leaving orders unfilled for an hour or more. Large funds transfers were delayed for hours and the [[Fedwire]] and NYSE [[SuperDot|DOT]] systems shut down for extended periods of time, further compounding traders' confusion.{{sfnm|1a1=Carlson|1y=2007|1p=9|2a1=Bernanke|2y=1990|2p=146}}\n\nAll of the twenty-three major world markets experienced a similar decline that October. When measured in a common currency (US dollars), eight of them declined by 20 to 29%, three by 30 to 39% (Malaysia, Mexico and New Zealand), and three by more than 40% (Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore).{{sfn|Roll|1988|pp=20 (table 1), 21}}{{efn-ua| The markets were: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore,  South  Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.}} Worldwide losses were estimated at $1.7 trillion US dollars.{{sfn|Schaede|1991|p=42}} The severity of the crash sparked fears of extended economic instability{{sfn|Group of 33}} or even a reprise of the Great Depression.{{sfn|Lobb|2007}} Across nations, the degree to which  the financial  markets' distress spread to the wider economy (the \"real economy\") was directly related to the [[monetary policy]] each nation pursued in response. The [[central bank]]s of the United States, West Germany and Japan provided [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] to prevent debt defaults among financial institutions, and the impact on the real economy was relatively limited and short-lived. The [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]]'s refusal to loosen monetary policy in response to the crisis, however, had sharply negative and relatively long-term consequences for both financial markets and the real economy.{{sfnm|1a1=Grant|1y=1997|1p=330|2a1=Hunt|2y=2009}}\n\nIn [[finance]], the crash of 1987 also apparently had the ongoing effect of altering [[implied volatility]] patterns that arise in pricing financial [[option (finance)|options]]. Equity options traded in American markets did not show a [[volatility smile]] before the crash but began showing one afterwards.{{sfn|Hull|2003|p=335}}\n\n==United States==\n===Background===\n[[File:S&P 500 index around the time of the crash.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Timeline compiled by the [[Federal Reserve]]]]\n\nIn late 1985 and early 1986, the United States economy shifted from a rapid recovery from the [[early 1980s recession]] to a slower expansion, resulting in a brief \"[[soft landing (economics)|soft landing]]\" period as the economy slowed and [[inflation]] dropped. The stock market advanced significantly, with the Dow peaking in August 1987 at 2,722 points, or 44% over the previous year's closing of 1,895 points.\n\nThe crash was preceded by significant drops in the prior week. Two events in the news on the morning of October 14 have sometimes been singled out as possible triggers for the crash.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=6}} The [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]] introduced a tax bill that would reduce the tax benefits associated with financing mergers and [[leveraged buyout]]s.{{sfnm|1a1=Carlson|1y=2007|1p=6|2a1=Malliaris |2a2= Urrutia |2y= 1992 |2p=354}} Second, unexpectedly high [[trade deficit]] figures announced by the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] had a negative impact on the value of the US dollar while pushing interest rates upward and also put downward pressure on stock prices.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=6}} However, other sources have questioned the impact of these news events. For example, Nobel-prize winning economist [[Robert J. Shiller]] surveyed 889 investors (605 individual investors and 284 institutional investors) immediately after the crash regarding several aspects of their experience at the time. Only three institutional investors and no individual investors reported a belief that the news regarding proposed tax legislation was a trigger for the crash. According to Shiller, the most common responses were related to a general mindset of investors at the time: a \"gut feeling\" of an impending crash, perhaps brought on by \"too much indebtedness\".{{sfn |Shiller| 1988|pp=292&ndash;293}}\n\nOn Wednesday, the DJIA dropped 95.46 points (3.8%) ([[List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average|a then record]]) to 2,412.70, and it fell another 58 points (2.4%) the next day, down over 12% from the August 25 all-time high. On Friday, October 16, the DJIA fell 108.35 points (4.6%) to close at 2,246.74 on record volume. That was again a one-day record at the time.{{sfn|Bernhardt|Eckblad|2013|pp=2, 6 ''note 5''}} Though the markets were closed for the weekend, significant selling pressure still existed. The computer models of portfolio insurers continued to dictate very large sales.{{sfn|Lindsey | Pecora|1998 |pp=3&ndash;4}} Moreover, some large [[mutual fund]] groups had procedures that enabled customers to easily redeem their shares during the weekend at the same prices that existed at the close of market on Friday.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|p=29}} The amount of these redemption requests was far greater than the firms' cash reserves, requiring them to make large sales of shares as soon as the market opened on the following Monday. Finally, some traders anticipated these pressures and tried to get ahead of the market by selling early and aggressively Monday, before the anticipated price drop.{{sfn|Lindsey|Pecora|1998|pp=3&ndash;4}}\n\n===De-linked markets and index arbitrage===\nBefore the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) opened on Monday the 19th there was pent-up pressure to sell stocks. When the market opened, a large imbalance immediately arose between the volume of sell orders and buy orders, placing considerable downward pressure on stock prices. Regulations at the time permitted designated [[market maker]]s (also known as \"specialists\") to delay or suspend trading in a stock if the order imbalance exceeded that specialist's ability to fulfill orders in an orderly manner.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=8, note 11}} The order imbalance on the 19th was so large that 95 stocks on the [[S&P 500 Index]] (S&P) opened late, as also did 11 of the 30 [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA) stocks.{{sfn |Carlson |2007 |p=8}} Importantly, however, the futures market opened on time across the board, with heavy selling.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=8}}\n\nUnder normal circumstances the stock market and those of its main [[Stock#Stock derivatives|derivatives]]\u2013futures and options\u2013are functionally a single market, given that the price of any particular [[stock]] is closely connected to the prices of its counterpart in both the futures and options market.{{sfnm |1a1=Kleidon |1a2=Whaley |1y=1992 |1pp=851\u201352|2a1=Brady Report|2y=1988|2p=55 & 57}} Prices in the derivative markets are typically tightly connected to those of the underlying stock, though they differ somewhat  (as for example, prices of futures are typically higher than that of their particular cash stock).{{sfn |Kleidon |Whaley |1992 |p=851}} During the crisis this link was broken.{{sfnm |1a1=Kleidon |1a2=Whaley |1y=1992 |1pp=851\u201352}}\n\nWhen the futures market opened while the stock market was closed, it created a pricing imbalance: the listed price of those stocks which opened late had no chance to change from their closing price of the day before. The quoted prices were thus \"stale\" and did not reflect current economic conditions; they were generally listed higher than they should have been{{sfn|Kleidon |Whaley |1992 |pp=859\u201360}} (and dramatically higher than their respective futures, which are typically higher than stocks).{{sfn|Kleidon |Whaley |1992 |pp=859\u201360}}\n\nThe decoupling of these markets meant that futures prices had temporarily lost their validity as a vehicle for [[price discovery]]; they no longer could be relied upon to inform traders of the direction or degree of stock market expectations. This had harmful effects: it added to the atmosphere of uncertainty and confusion at a time when investor confidence was sorely needed; it discouraged investors from \"leaning against the wind\" and buying stocks, since the discount in the futures market logically implied that investors could wait and purchase stocks at an even lower price; and it encouraged portfolio insurance investors to sell in the stock market, putting further downward pressure on stock prices.{{sfn|Macey|Mitchell|Netter|1988|p=832}}\n\nThe gap between the futures and stocks was quickly noted by [[index arbitrage]] traders who tried to profit through [[Order (exchange)#Market order|sell at market]] orders. Index arbitrage, a form of [[program trading]],{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=5}} added to the confusion and the downward pressure on prices:{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=8}}\n{{quote|...reflecting the natural linkages among markets, the selling pressure washed across to the stock market, both through index arbitrage and direct  portfolio insurance stock sales. Large amounts of selling, and the demand for liquidity associated with it, cannot be contained in a single market segment. It  necessarily overflows into the other market segments, which are naturally linked. There are, however, natural limits to intermarket liquidity which were made evident on October 19 and 20.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|p=56}}}}\nAlthough arbitrage between index futures and stocks placed downward pressure on prices, it does not explain why the surge in sell orders that brought steep price declines began in the first place.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=933}} Moreover, the markets \"performed most chaotically\"  during those times when the links that index arbitrage program trading creates between these markets was ''broken''.{{sfn|Miller | Hawke |  Malkiel |Scholes  |1989|pp=12&ndash;13}}\n\n===Portfolio insurance hedges===\n[[Portfolio insurance]] is a [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] technique which attempts to manage risk and limit losses by buying and selling [[financial instrument]]s (for example, stocks or futures) in reaction to changes in market price rather than changes in [[Fundamental analysis|market fundamental]]s. Specifically, they buy when the market is rising, and sell when the market is falling, without regard for any fundamental information about ''why'' the market is rising or falling.{{sfnm|1a1=Leland|1y=1988| 2a1=Leland|2y=1992 }} Thus it is an example of an \"informationless trade\"{{sfn|Macey|Mitchell|Netter|1988|p=819, note 84}} that has the potential to create a market-destabilizing feedback loop.{{sfn|Leland|1992|p=55}}\n\nThis strategy became a source of downward pressure when portfolio insurers whose computer models noted that stocks opened lower and continued their steep price. The models  recommended even further sales.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=8}} The potential for computer-generated feedback loops that these hedges created has been discussed as a factor compounding the severity of the crash, but not as an initial trigger.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|p=v}} Economist [[Hayne Leland]] argues against this interpretation, suggesting that the impact of portfolio hedging on stock prices was probably relatively small.{{sfn|Leland|1988|pp=83\u201384}} Similarly, the report of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] found the influence of \"other investors &ndash; mutual funds, broker-dealers and individual shareholders &ndash; was thus three to five times greater than that of the portfolio insurers\" during the crash.{{sfn|Miller | Hawke |  Malkiel |Scholes |1989|p=6}} Numerous econometric studies have analyzed the evidence  to determine whether portfolio insurance exacerbated the crash, but the results have been unclear.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2004|p=10}} Markets around the world which did not have portfolio insurance trading experienced as much turmoil and loss as the U.S. market;{{sfn|Miller | Hawke |  Malkiel |Scholes |1989|pp=6&ndash;7}}. More to the point, the cross-market analysis of [[Richard Roll]], for example, found that markets with a greater prevalence of computerized trading (including portfolio insurance) actually experienced relatively less severe losses (in percentage terms) than those without.{{sfn|Roll|1988|pp=29\u201330}}\n\n===Noise trading===\nThe crisis affected markets around the world; however, no international news event or change in market fundamentals has been shown to have had a strong effect on investor behavior.{{sfnm|1a1= Shiller |1y= 1987 |1p=23| 2a1=Bernanke |2y=1990 |2p= 133}} Instead, contemporaneous causality and feedback behavior between markets increased dramatically during this period.{{sfn|Malliaris | Urrutia | 1992 |pp=362\u201363}} In an environment of increased [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]], confusion and uncertainty, investors not only in the US but also across the world{{sfn|King|Wadhwani|1990}} were inferring information from changes in stock prices and communication with other investors{{sfn|Shiller|1987 |p=23}} in a self-reinforcing contagion of fear.{{sfn|Goodhart|1988}} This pattern of basing trading decisions largely on [[market psychology|psychological factor]]s is often referred to as one form of \"noise trading\", which occurs when ill-informed investors \"[trade] on noise as if it were news\".{{sfn|Black|1988|pp=273\u201374}} If noise is misinterpreted as bad news, then the reactions of risk-averse traders and arbitrageurs will bias the market, preventing it from establishing prices that accurately reflect the fundamental state of the underlying stocks.{{sfn|Cunningham|1994|p=10}} For example, on October 19 rumors that the New York Stock Exchange would close created additional confusion and  drove prices further downward, while rumors the next day that two [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] clearinghouses were insolvent deterred some investors from trading in that marketplace.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|pp=9, 10, 17}}\n\nA [[feedback loop]] of noise-induced-volatility has been cited by some analysts as the major reason for the severe depth of the crash. It does not, however, explain what initially triggered the market break.{{sfnm|1a1=Shleifer|1a2=Summers|1y=1990|1p=30|2a1=Black|2y=1988|2pp=273\u201374}} Moreover, [[Lawrence A. Cunningham]] has suggested that while noise theory is \"supported by substantial empirical evidence and a well-developed intellectual foundation\", it makes only a partial contribution toward explaining events such as the crash of October 1987.{{sfn|Cunningham|1994|pp=3, 10}} Informed traders, not swayed by psychological or emotional factors, have room to make trades they know to be less risky.{{sfn|Cunningham|1994|p=26}}\n\n===Margin calls and liquidity===\n[[Frederic Mishkin]] suggested that the greatest economic danger was not events on the day of the crash itself, but the potential for \"spreading collapse of securities firms\" if an extended [[liquidity crisis]] in the [[securities industry]] began to threaten the [[solvency]] and viability of [[brokerage house]]s and specialists. This possibility first loomed on the day after the crash.{{sfn|Mishkin|1988|pp=29\u201330}} At least initially, there was a very real risk that these institutions could fail.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|ps=,&nbsp;Study VI, p. 73}} If that happened, [[spillover effect]]s could sweep over the entire financial system, with negative consequences for the [[real economy]] as a whole.{{sfnm|1a1=Cecchetti|1a2=Disyatat|1y=2009|1p=1|2a1=Carlson|2y=2007|2p=20}}\n\nThe source of these liquidity problems was a general increase in [[margin call]]s; after the market's plunge, these were about ten times their average size and three times greater than the highest previous morning variation call.{{sfnm|1a1=Brady Report |1y=1988|1ps=,&nbsp;Study VI, p. 70|2a1=Carlson|2y=2007|2pp=12\u201313}} Several firms had insufficient cash in customers' accounts (that is, they were \"undersegregated\"). Firms drawing funds from their own capital to meet the shortfall sometimes became undercapitalized; for example, 11 firms had a margin call from a single customer that exceeded that firm's adjusted net capital, sometimes by as much as two-to-one.{{sfn|Brady Report|1988|ps=,&nbsp;Study VI, p. 73}} Investors needed to repay end-of-day margin calls made on the 19th before the opening of the market on the 20th. Clearinghouse member firms called on lending institutions to extend credit to cover these sudden and unexpected charges, but the brokerages requesting additional credit began to exceed their credit limit. Banks were also worried about increasing their involvement and exposure to a chaotic market.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|pp=12\u201313}} The size and urgency of the demands for credit placed upon banks was unprecedented.{{sfn|Garcia|1989|p=153}} In general, [[counterparty risk]] increased as the creditworthiness of [[counterparty|counterparties]] and the value of collateral posted became highly uncertain.{{sfnm|1a1=Kohn|1y=2006|2a1=Bernanke |2y=1990 |2pp= 146\u201347 }}\n<!-- The Black Monday decline was, and currently remains, the [[List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average|largest one-day percentage decline in the DJIA]]. (Saturday, December 12, 1914, is sometimes erroneously cited as the largest one-day percentage decline of the DJIA. In reality, the ostensible decline of 24.39% was created retroactively by a redefinition of the DJIA in 1916.{{sfn|Setting Record Straight|1987}} {{sfn|Bialik|2008}}) -->\n\n===Federal Reserve response===\nThe U.S. [[central bank]]ing system (the [[Federal Reserve]] or \"the Fed\") acted swiftly and decisively as [[lender of last resort]] to counter the crisis.{{sfn|Garcia |1989}} The Fed utilized tools it had at its disposal to meet the market disruption: [[crisis management]] via public pronouncements, supplying liquidity through [[open market operation]]s,{{sfn|Garcia |1989|p=151}}{{efn-ua| [[Discount window]] borrowing did not play a major role in the Federal Reserve's response to the crisis.{{sfnm|1a1=Carlson|1y=2007|1p=18, note 17|2a1=Garcia |2y=1989|2p=159}}}} persuading banks to lend to securities firms,  and intervening directly in a few cases.{{sfn|Bernanke |1990 |p=148}}\n\nOn the morning of October 20, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made a brief statement: \"The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the Nation's central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system\".{{sfn|Greenspan|1987|p= 915}} Fed sources suggested that the brevity was deliberate, in order to avoid misinterpretations.{{sfn|Garcia |1989|p=151}} This \"extraordinary\"{{sfn|Mishkin|1988|p=30}} announcement probably had a calming effect on markets{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=10}} that were facing an equally unprecedented demand for liquidity{{sfn|Garcia|1989|p=153}} and the immediate potential for a liquidity crisis.{{sfnm|1a1=Mishkin|1y=1988|1pp=29\u201330|2a1=Brady Report|2y=1988|2ps=,&nbsp;Study VI, p. 73}}\n\nThe Fed then acted to provide [[market liquidity]] and prevent the crisis from expanding into other markets. It immediately began injecting its reserves into the financial system via purchases on the open market. This rapidly pushed the federal funds rate down by 0.5%. The Fed continued its expansive open market purchases of securities for weeks. The Fed also repeatedly began these interventions an hour before the regularly scheduled time, notifying dealers of the schedule change on the evening beforehand. This was all done in a very high-profile and public manner, similar to Greenspan's initial announcement, to restore market confidence that liquidity was forthcoming.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|pp=17\u201318}} Although the Fed's holdings expanded appreciably over time, the speed of expansion was not excessive.{{sfn|Carlson|2007|p=18}} Moreover, the Fed later disposed of these holdings so that its long-term policy goals would not be adversely affected.{{sfn|Garcia |1989|p=151}}\n\nFinally, and very importantly, the Fed successfully  met the unprecedented demands for credit{{sfnm|1a1=Carlson|1y=2007|1pp=13\u201314|2a1=Garcia|2y=1989|2p=153}} by pairing a strategy of [[moral suasion]] that motivated nervous banks to lend to securities firms alongside its moves to reassure those banks by actively supplying them with liquidity.{{sfnm|1a1=Garcia |1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Bernanke|2y=1990|2p=149}} As economist [[Ben Bernanke]] (who was later to become Chairman of the Federal Reserve) wrote:\n{{quote|The Fed's key action was to induce the banks (by suasion and by the supply of liquidity) to make loans, on customary terms, despite chaotic conditions and the possibility of severe adverse selection of borrowers. In expectation, making these loans must have been a money-losing strategy from the point of view of the banks (and the Fed); otherwise, Fed persuasion would not have been needed.{{sfn|Bernanke|1990|p=149}}}}\nThe Fed's two-part strategy was thoroughly successful, since lending to securities firms by large banks in Chicago  and especially in New York increased substantially,  often nearly doubling.{{sfnm|1a1=Carlson|1y=2007|1p=14|2a1=Bernanke|2y=1990|2p=149}}\n\n===Regulation===\nAfter Black Monday, regulators overhauled trade-clearing protocols to bring uniformity to all prominent market products. They also developed new rules, known as \"[[trading curb]]s\" or colloquially as circuit breakers, allowing exchanges to temporarily halt trading in instances of exceptionally large price declines in some indexes; for instance, the DJIA.{{sfnm|1a1=Bernhardt|1a2=Eckblad|1y=2013|1p=3|2a1=Lindsey | 2a2=Pecora|2y=1998}} These trading curbs were first used multiple times during the [[2020 stock market crash]].{{sfn|Shieber|2020}}\n\n==UK==\n{{main|Economy of England}}\nOn Friday, October 16, all the markets in London were unexpectedly closed due to the [[Great Storm of 1987]]. After London re-opened, the speed of the crash accelerated in London, partially attributed by some to the storm closure. By  9:30&nbsp;a.m., the FTSE100 had fallen over 136 points.{{sfn|Black Monday 10th |1997}} The abrupt drop of the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] index brought it down  23 percent in two days, roughly the same percentage that the [[NYSE]] dropped on the day of the crash.  Stocks then continued to fall, albeit at a less precipitous rate, until reaching a trough in mid-November at an accumulative 36% below its pre-crash peak. Stocks did not begin to recover until 1989.{{sfn|Roberts|2008|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n==Japan==\n{{main|Economy of Japan}}\nIn Japan the October 1987 crash is sometimes referred to as \"Blue Tuesday\", in part because of the time zone difference, and in part because its effects after the initial crash were relatively mild.{{sfn|Schaede|1991|p=42}}  In both places, according to economist [[Ulrike Schaede]], the initial market break was severe: the Tokyo market declined 14.9% in one day, and Japan's losses of US$421 billion ranked next to New York's $500 billion, out of a worldwide total loss of $1.7 trillion. However, systemic differences between the US and Japanese financial systems led to significantly different outcomes during and after the crash on Tuesday, October 20. In Japan the ensuing panic was no more than mild at worst. The [[Nikkei 225]] Index returned to its pre-crash levels after only five months. Other global markets performed less well in the aftermath of the crash, with New York, London and Frankfurt all needing more than a year to achieve the same level of recovery.{{sfn|Schaede|1991|pp=42\u201345}}\n\nSeveral of Japan's distinctive institutional characteristics already in place at the time, according to  [[economist]] [[David Hale (economist)|David D. Hale]], helped it dampen volatility. These included [[trading curb]]s  such as a sharp limit on price movements of a share of more than 10\u201315 percent; restrictions and institutional barriers to  [[short-selling]] by domestic and international traders; frequent adjustments of [[margin requirement]]s in response to changes in volatility; strict guidelines on [[mutual fund]] redemptions; and actions of the  [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Ministry of Finance]] to control the total shares of stock and exert [[moral suasion]] on the securities industry.{{sfn|Hale|1988|pages=182\u201383}} An example of the latter occurred when the ministry invited representatives of the four largest securities firms to tea in the early afternoon of the day of the crash.{{sfn|Schaede|1991|p=45}} After tea at the ministry, these firms began to make large purchases of [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|Nippon Telephone and Telegraph]] (NTT) stocks.{{sfn|Schaede|1991|p=45}}\n\n==New Zealand==\n{{main|Economy of New Zealand}}\nThe crash of the New Zealand stock market was notably long and deep, continuing its decline for an extended period of time after other global markets had recovered.{{sfn|Grant|1997|p=329}}  Unlike other nations, moreover, for New Zealand the effects of the October 1987 crash spilled over into its real economy, contributing to a prolonged recession.{{sfnm|1a1=Hunt|1y=2009|1p=36|2a1=Grant|2y=1997|2p=337}}\n\nThe effects of the worldwide economic boom of the mid-1980s had been amplified in New Zealand by a recent relaxation of [[foreign exchange controls]] and a wave of [[banking deregulation]].  Deregulation in particular  suddenly gave financial institutions considerably more freedom to lend, though they had little experience in doing so.{{sfnm|1a1=Hunt|1y=2009|1p=35|2a1=Reddell|2a2= Sleeman|2y=2008|2p=14}} The finance industry was in a state of increasing optimism that approached euphoria.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=35}} This created an atmosphere conducive to greater [[financial risk|risk]] taking, which investors took advantage of through increased [[speculation]] in the stock market and real estate.  Foreign investors were notably active in this trend, attracted by New Zealand's relatively high interest rates. From around the end of 1984 until the date of the crash, commercial property prices and commercial construction rose sharply, while share prices in the stock market tripled.{{sfnm|1a1=Hunt|1y=2009|1p=35|2a1=Reddell|2a2= Sleeman|2y=2008|2p=14}}\n\nNew Zealand's stock market fell nearly 15% on the first day of the crash.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=36}} In the first three-and-a-half months following the crash, the value of New Zealand's market shares was cut in half.{{sfn|Reddell|Sleeman|2008|p=14}} By the time it reached its [[Trough (economics)|trough]] in February 1988 the market had lost 60 percent of its value.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=36}} The financial crisis triggered a wave of [[deleveraging]] with significant macro-economic consequences. Investment companies and property developers began a [[fire sale]] of their properties, partially to help offset their share price losses, and partially because the crash had exposed overbuilding. Moreover, these firms had been using property as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for their increased borrowing. Thus when property values collapsed, the health of [[balance sheet]]s of lending institutions was damaged.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=36}} The Reserve Bank of New Zealand declined to loosen monetary policy in response to the crisis, however, which would have helped firms settle their obligations and remain in operation.{{sfnm|1a1=Grant|1y=1997|1p=330|2a1=Hunt|2y=2009}} As the harmful effects spread over the next few years,  major corporations and financial institutions went out of business, and the banking systems of New Zealand and Australia were impaired.{{sfn|Reddell|Sleeman|2008|p=14}} Access to credit was reduced.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=36}} The combination of these contributed significantly to a long recession running from 1987 until 1993.{{sfn|Hunt|2009|p=36}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[2010 Flash Crash]]\n* [[Friday the 13th mini-crash|Black Friday]] (October 13, 1989)\n* [[List of largest daily changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average]]\n* [[Stock market crashes in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] (Black Tuesday)\n* [[Black Monday (TV series)|Black Monday]] (2019 TV Series)\n* [[Black Monday (2020)]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal|last=Bates |first=David S. |title=The Crash of \u02bc87: Was It Expected?
