Its dimensions served to rule out another matter which the work discussed: the Book of Genesis records that there were giants on the earth in ancient times, and some held that Noah himself was one of them.  Kircher demonstrated that the size of the Ark made this impossible - there would not have been room for a family of giants on board alongside all the animals. This affirmation of Noah's humanity allowed Kircher to show that the Ark represented not only the human body, vehicle of the living soul, but also symbolised the Church itself, just as Noah prefigured Christ as mediator between God and sinful mankind.<ref name=\"DR\"/>\n\n==Classification of animals in the ark==\n[[File:Arca Noe, arrangement inside ark, by A. Kircher. Wellcome L0013358.jpg|thumb|Internal arrangement of the ark, ''Arca No\u00eb'']]\nKircher sought to account for how different kinds of animal was accommodated in the Ark, and to do this, he classified them, focusing mainly on [[Old World]] species. Echoing [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], he ignored the taxonomies of his contemporary scholars and simply classified them by size, from the elephant downwards. He went on to explain how they would have been accommodated, with plant-eaters separated from meat-eaters, land-dwellers from amphibians and water creatures, and 'clean' from 'unclean'.<ref name=\"Zoo\">{{cite book|last1=Enenkel |first1=Karl A.

Such creatures did not need a place in the Ark since they could simply produce themselves from dung or mud. In Kircher's account this included small mammals such as mice and voles, as well as reptiles and insects.<ref name=\"Cole2016\">{{cite book|author=Lucinda Cole|title=Imperfect Creatures: Vermin, Literature, and the Sciences of Life, 1600-1740|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCalCwAAQBAJ|date=26 February 2016|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-05295-0|page=16}}</ref><ref name=\"MP\"/>{{rp|62}} Kircher did say that snakes were taken on the Ark, partly because of their unique medicinal value, and partly too as food for some of the birds on board.<ref name=\"MP\"/>{{rp|62}} He also excluded from all animals he regarded as 'hybrid', including the giraffe. These creatures he argued were descended from offspring of different animals carried on the ark which later interbred. He considered the [[armadillo]] to be a hybrid of the hedgehog and the turtle, and the [[alpine marmot]] to be a mixture of the badger and the squirrel.<ref name=\"Zoo\"/>\n\nKircher also explained that many of the creatures of the [[New World]] did not need to have a place in the Ark. The original creatures of God's creation came from the [[Garden of Eden]] and were adapted to its climate; as they spread out over the world after the Flood they adapted to different climates and conditions, evolving over time into the new forms seen today.<ref name=\"Zoo\"/> Through these arguments, Kircher was able to show that the Biblical dimensions of the Ark (198 metres long, 33 metres wide and 19,8 metres high) afforded sufficient space to allow the ancestors of all modern creatures in the world to be carried.<ref name=\"MP\"/>{{rp|62}}\n\n==Illustrations==\n[[File:Frontispiece of Athanasius Kircher's \"Arca Noe\" (1675).tif|thumb|Frontispiece of Athanasius Kircher's \"Arca No\u00eb\" (1675)]]\n''Arca No\u00eb'' was dedicated to the twelve year-old king [[Charles II of Spain]].

Beneath them, surrounded by lost souls struggling in the waves to reach it, the Ark is afloat on the Flood, representing the Church with Christ keeping watch in the [[crow's nest]] and the words \"Extra quam non est salus\" (\"outside of which there is no salvation\") on its sail.

Three of he finest illustrations were by [[Coenraet Decker]] - the portrait of Charles II, Noah and His Progeny, and the Submerged Mountains. ''Arca No\u00eb'' also contains the largest illustration contained in any of Kircher\u2019s books. This was the cutaway diagram of the interior of the Ark, showing where the animals were housed. Measuring 39 x 17 \u00bd inches, it was made from three separate plates and folded out of the book. An entire section of the work was devoted to animals Kircher considered to be hybrid. As well as allowing Kircher to minimise the number of animals requiring space on the Ark, these hybrids also provided a good opportunity for including many exotic and fanciful illustrations to attract the interest of the book's young patron.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Spindler |first1=Christine |title=A Flood of Faith and Knowledge: Kircher\u2019s Arca N\u00f6e |url=https://johnjburnslibrary.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/kircherarcanoe/ |website=johnjburnslibrary.wordpress.com |publisher=John J Burns Library |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k111864r.texteImage digital copy of Arca No\u00eb]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Don Cameron Allen, ''The Arca Noe of Athanasius Kircher'' in ''The Legend of Noah: Renaissance Rationalism in Art, Science and Letters'', Urbana 1949\n* Davis A.

In Kircher's account this included small mammals such as mice and voles, as well as reptiles and insects.<ref name=\"Cole2016\">{{cite book|author=Lucinda Cole|title=Imperfect Creatures: Vermin, Literature, and the Sciences of Life, 1600-1740|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCalCwAAQBAJ|date=26 February 2016|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-05295-0|page=16}}</ref><ref name=\"MP\"/>{{rp|62}} Kircher did say that snakes were taken on the Ark, partly because of their unique medicinal value, and partly too as food for some of the birds on board.<ref name=\"MP\"/>{{rp|62}} He also excluded from all animals he regarded as 'hybrid', including the giraffe. These creatures he argued were descended from offspring of different animals carried on the ark which later interbred. He considered the [[armadillo]] to be a hybrid of the hedgehog and the turtle, and the [[alpine marmot]] to be a mixture of the badger and the squirrel.<ref name=\"Zoo\"/>\n\nKircher also explained that many of the creatures of the [[New World]] did not need to have a place in the Ark. The original creatures of God's creation came from the [[Garden of Eden]] and were adapted to its climate; as they spread out over the world after the Flood they adapted to different climates and conditions, evolving over time into the new forms seen today.<ref name=\"Zoo\"/> Through these arguments, Kircher was able to show that the Biblical dimensions of the Ark (198 metres long, 33 metres wide and 19,8 metres high) afforded sufficient space to allow the ancestors of all modern creatures in the world to be carried.<ref name=\"MP\"/>{{rp|62}}\n\n==Illustrations==\n[[File:Frontispiece of Athanasius Kircher's \"Arca Noe\" (1675).tif|thumb|Frontispiece of Athanasius Kircher's \"Arca No\u00eb\" (1675)]]\n''Arca No\u00eb'' was dedicated to the twelve year-old king [[Charles II of Spain]].

''Arca No\u00eb'' also contains the largest illustration contained in any of Kircher\u2019s books. This was the cutaway diagram of the interior of the Ark, showing where the animals were housed. Measuring 39 x 17 \u00bd inches, it was made from three separate plates and folded out of the book. An entire section of the work was devoted to animals Kircher considered to be hybrid.

Exposed after the [[Cold War]], Barsky became a resource for U.S. counterintelligence agencies and was allowed to remain in the United States. His autobiography, ''Deep Undercover'', was published in 2017, and he frequently speaks on his experiences and as an expert on [[espionage]].\n\n==Early life==\nDittrich was born in [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]], [[Upper Lusatia]], [[East Germany]], only a few weeks after the [[partition of Germany]], and grew up in [[Jena]], East Germany.<ref name=60min /> His father, a schoolteacher, was an adamant Marxist\u2013Leninist. He also has a brother, G\u00fcnther, who is three years younger.<ref name=\"guardian21117\"/> When Dittrich was 14, he was sent away to boarding school. Shortly after that, his parents divorced.

This turned out to be a ruse, however, and he was offered a job with the [[Stasi]].<ref name=\"guardian21117\"/> The next year, he was studying for a doctorate in chemistry and working as an assistant professor when he was sent to East Berlin for several weeks of training with the [[KGB]].<ref name=\"blaze\">{{cite news|title=Former KGB spy reveals his secret double life|url=http://www.theblaze.com/video/former-kgb-spy-reveals-his-secret-double-life/|accessdate=28 May 2017|publisher=[[The Blaze]]|date=13 April 2017}}</ref> He was told that the Soviet Union only had use for spies who were willing participants, and thus he was free to turn down the offer, but that he had only 24 hours to decide.

The KGB taught him [[Morse code]], [[cryptography]] and techniques to avoid surveillance, as well as English. He was sent to [[Moscow]] in 1975, where his English was evaluated by an American woman who had married a Russian. He underwent two further years of training in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"guardian21117\"/>\n\nIn 1978, Dittrich was sent to the United States as a [[sleeper agent]].

The KGB provided him with Barsky's birth certificate and $6,000 in cash.  His mission was to get a U.S. passport, insert himself into American society, to make contacts with foreign policy think tanks and \"get close\" to President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s National Security Adviser [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] in order to influence policy.<ref name=\"guardian21117\"/>\n\nDittrich rented an apartment in New York City and assumed the identity of Jack Barsky. His instructions had been to use the birth certificate to get a passport, but the bureaucracy proved more difficult than the KGB had anticipated.<ref name=\"spiegel2\"/> He established his identity first by obtaining a membership card at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], followed by a library card, a driver's license and finally a [[Social Security card]].<ref name=\"guardian21117\"/> He worked as a [[bicycle messenger]] and began attending [[Baruch College]], studying computer programming.<ref name=60min />\n\nBarsky discovered that the people who trained him did not have an authentic understanding of Americans, and he struggled at first with his assignment.<ref name=60min /> While his instructions were to infiltrate political circles and get close to Brzezinski, he was not given specific instructions on how he was supposed to accomplish that. He also learned that while his English was excellent, he was very pushy and argumentative when dealing with people. He was shocked when he was confronted with this fact by a fed-up friend. He realized that he was essentially too East German to fit in.<ref name=\"spiegel2\"/><ref name=\"guardian21117\"/>\n\nBarsky received weekly radio transmissions from the Soviets and at night spent hours decrypting messages.

For years, she desperately searched for him, contacting the German embassies in Moscow and even writing to Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. In 1996, investigators with the [[Federal Foreign Office|German Foreign Office]] determined that the story he had told his mother was a lie. The project in Baikonur that he had claimed to be working on for many years had ended in 1978. His mother was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] and died without knowing the truth.<ref name=\"spiegel2\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the [[Berlin Wall]] began coming down, followed by the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] two years later. In 1992, a KGB defector to Great Britain named [[Vasili Mitrokhin]] provided information to [[MI6]] about Soviet spy operations around the world, including the name \"Barsky\" in the United States.<ref name=60min />\n\nThe [[FBI]] located Barsky in 1994 and observed him for three years, bugging his house and even buying the home next to his in Pennsylvania. An FBI agent moved into the house next door and monitored Barsky's every movement to determine whether or not he was still an active agent in a [[sleeper cell]]. The FBI contacted the elderly parents of the real Jack Barsky, who had died as a child in 1955, out of fear they would happen to discover their dead son's [[identity theft|identity had been stolen]] and would alert local authorities. Although upset, the Barskys agreed not to disclose the information.<ref name=\"original\"/>\n\nThe FBI investigation quickly escalated when one day in 1997, during a fight with his soon-to-be ex-wife being recorded by the FBI, Barsky confessed that he was actually a spy.<ref name=\"spiegel2\"/><ref name=\"blaze2\"/> Shortly after that, Barsky was pulled over by the police on his way home from work and taken into FBI custody. During interrogation, Barsky quickly confessed his real identity and that he had stopped spying in 1988. He shared his knowledge of KGB espionage training and the ''modus operandi'' of Russian sleeper agents.<ref name=\"spiegel2\"/> The FBI determined that he was no longer an active spy and found him to be a valuable source of information about spy techniques.

Exposed after the [[Cold War]], Barsky became a resource for U.S. counterintelligence agencies and was allowed to remain in the United States. His autobiography, ''Deep Undercover'', was published in 2017, and he frequently speaks on his experiences and as an expert on [[espionage]].\n\n==Early life==\nDittrich was born in [[Reichenbach (Oberlausitz)|Reichenbach]], [[Upper Lusatia]], [[East Germany]], only a few weeks after the [[partition of Germany]], and grew up in [[Jena]], East Germany.<ref name=60min /> His father, a schoolteacher, was an adamant Marxist\u2013Leninist. He also has a brother, G\u00fcnther, who is three years younger.<ref name=\"guardian21117\"/> When Dittrich was 14, he was sent away to boarding school. Shortly after that, his parents divorced.

This turned out to be a ruse, however, and he was offered a job with the [[Stasi]].<ref name=\"guardian21117\"/> The next year, he was studying for a doctorate in chemistry and working as an assistant professor when he was sent to East Berlin for several weeks of training with the [[KGB]].<ref name=\"blaze\">{{cite news|title=Former KGB spy reveals his secret double life|url=http://www.theblaze.com/video/former-kgb-spy-reveals-his-secret-double-life/|accessdate=28 May 2017|publisher=[[The Blaze]]|date=13 April 2017}}</ref> He was told that the Soviet Union only had use for spies who were willing participants, and thus he was free to turn down the offer, but that he had only 24 hours to decide.

The KGB taught him [[Morse code]], [[cryptography]] and techniques to avoid surveillance, as well as English. He was sent to [[Moscow]] in 1975, where his English was evaluated by an American woman who had married a Russian. He underwent two further years of training in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"guardian21117\"/>\n\nIn 1978, Dittrich was sent to the United States as a [[sleeper agent]].

The KGB provided him with Barsky's birth certificate and $6,000 in cash.  His mission was to get a U.S. passport, insert himself into American society, to make contacts with foreign policy think tanks and \"get close\" to President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s National Security Adviser [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] in order to influence policy.<ref name=\"guardian21117\"/>\n\nDittrich rented an apartment in New York City and assumed the identity of Jack Barsky. His instructions had been to use the birth certificate to get a passport, but the bureaucracy proved more difficult than the KGB had anticipated.<ref name=\"spiegel2\"/> He established his identity first by obtaining a membership card at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], followed by a library card, a driver's license and finally a [[Social Security card]].<ref name=\"guardian21117\"/> He worked as a [[bicycle messenger]] and began attending [[Baruch College]], studying computer programming.<ref name=60min />\n\nBarsky discovered that the people who trained him did not have an authentic understanding of Americans, and he struggled at first with his assignment.<ref name=60min /> While his instructions were to infiltrate political circles and get close to Brzezinski, he was not given specific instructions on how he was supposed to accomplish that.

He realized that he was essentially too East German to fit in.<ref name=\"spiegel2\"/><ref name=\"guardian21117\"/>\n\nBarsky received weekly radio transmissions from the Soviets and at night spent hours decrypting messages.

He was alerted on his way to work when he saw a small splash of red paint on the subway platform.<ref name=\"blaze\"/> The red paint was a predefined signal of the highest emergency, ordering him to immediately report to the [[Embassy of Russia in Ottawa|Soviet Embassy in Canada]] to return to East Germany.<ref name=\"blaze\"/> Concerned about the welfare of his infant daughter, Barsky decided he could not return.<ref name=60min /> He ignored it for several months, until another KGB agent met him in the subway and quietly told him he needed to follow orders or he would wind up dead.<ref name=\"blaze\"/> He falsely told his handlers he had contracted [[HIV]] and needed to stay in the United States for treatment, relying on the KGB's fear of [[HIV/AIDS]] being spread in the Soviet Union.

For years, she desperately searched for him, contacting the German embassies in Moscow and even writing to Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. In 1996, investigators with the [[Federal Foreign Office|German Foreign Office]] determined that the story he had told his mother was a lie. The project in Baikonur that he had claimed to be working on for many years had ended in 1978. His mother was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] and died without knowing the truth.<ref name=\"spiegel2\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the [[Berlin Wall]] began coming down, followed by the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] two years later. In 1992, a KGB defector to Great Britain named [[Vasili Mitrokhin]] provided information to [[MI6]] about Soviet spy operations around the world, including the name \"Barsky\" in the United States.<ref name=60min />\n\nThe [[FBI]] located Barsky in 1994 and observed him for three years, bugging his house and even buying the home next to his in Pennsylvania. An FBI agent moved into the house next door and monitored Barsky's every movement to determine whether or not he was still an active agent in a [[sleeper cell]]. The FBI contacted the elderly parents of the real Jack Barsky, who had died as a child in 1955, out of fear they would happen to discover their dead son's [[identity theft|identity had been stolen]] and would alert local authorities. Although upset, the Barskys agreed not to disclose the information.<ref name=\"original\"/>\n\nThe FBI investigation quickly escalated when one day in 1997, during a fight with his soon-to-be ex-wife being recorded by the FBI, Barsky confessed that he was actually a spy.<ref name=\"spiegel2\"/><ref name=\"blaze2\"/> Shortly after that, Barsky was pulled over by the police on his way home from work and taken into FBI custody. During interrogation, Barsky quickly confessed his real identity and that he had stopped spying in 1988. He shared his knowledge of KGB espionage training and the ''modus operandi'' of Russian sleeper agents.<ref name=\"spiegel2\"/> The FBI determined that he was no longer an active spy and found him to be a valuable source of information about spy techniques.

They in turn are members of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Procellariidae]], and the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Procellariiformes]]. The prions are small and typically eat just [[zooplankton]];<ref name=\"Maynard\">Maynard, B. J. (2003)</ref> however as a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called [[naricorns]]. Although the nostrils on the prion are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. They produce a stomach oil made up of [[wax ester]]s and [[triglycerides]] that is stored in the [[proventriculus]]. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.<ref>Double, M. C. (2003)</ref> Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.<ref>Ehrlich, Paul R. (1988)</ref>\n\n===Subspecies===\nSalvin's prion has two [[subspecies]]:\n* ''Pachyptila salvini salvini'', the [[nominate subspecies]], breeds on [[Prince Edward Islands|Prince Edward Island]] and the [[Crozet Islands]]<ref name=\"Clements\">Clements, James (2007)</ref>\n* ''Pachyptila salvini macgillivray'' breeds on [[\u00cele Saint-Paul|St. Paul Island]] and [[\u00cele Amsterdam|Amsterdam Island]]<ref name=\"Clements\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Pachyptila'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''pakhus'' and ''ptilon''. ''Pakhus'' means \"thick\" or \"stout\" and ''ptilon'' means \"a feather\". Also from the Greek language, ''prion'' comes from the word ''pri\u014dn'' meaning \"a saw\", which is in reference to its serrated edges of its [[beak|bill]].<ref name=\"Gotch\">Gotch, A. T. (1995)</ref> The species is named for the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[ornithology|ornithologist]] [[Osbert Salvin]].\n\n==Description==\nSalvin's prion is a small {{convert|29|cm|in|abbr=on}} petrel with grey and white [[plumage]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and a blue bill.<ref name=\"ZCZ\">ZipCode Zoo (19 Jun 2009)</ref> Like the [[broad-billed prion]] it has [[lamella (zoology)|lamella]]e in its [[beak|bill]] in order to filter seawater for food.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Prion de Salvin MHNT.jpg|thumb|''Pachyptila salvini''- [[MHNT]]]]\nThis small [[prion (bird)|prion]] breeds [[seabird colony|colonially]] on a number of [[subantarctic]] islands in the southern [[Indian Ocean]]. The colonies of medium-billed prions are attended [[nocturnality|nocturnally]] in order to avoid predation by [[skua]]s. The nests are concealed in burrows usually dug into soil. Nests are attended regularly for several months prior to breeding. A single egg is laid in November or early December, which is [[avian incubation|incubated]] for around 50 days. Both parents share the incubation duties and feed the chick once it is hatched. The chicks [[fledge]] around 60 days after hatching.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Feeding===\nThe main components of its diet are [[amphipod]]s and [[krill]], although it will also take [[fish]] and [[squid]]. In addition to filter feeding, food is obtained by seizing and hydroplaning.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n==Range and habitat==\nSalvin's prion breeds principally on [[\u00cele aux Cochons (Crozet)|\u00cele aux Cochons]] in the [[Crozet Islands]], where four million pairs are thought to breed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Other breeding colonies include [[Prince Edward Island]], [[\u00cele Saint-Paul|St Paul Island]] and [[\u00cele Amsterdam|Amsterdam Island]].

They in turn are members of the [[Procellariidae]] [[family (biology)|family]], and the [[Procellariiformes]] [[order (biology)|order]]. The prions are small and typically eat just [[zooplankton]];<ref name=\"Maynard\">Maynard, B. J. (2003)</ref> however as a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called [[naricorns]]. Although the nostrils on the prion are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. They produce a stomach oil made up of [[wax ester]]s and [[triglycerides]] that is stored in the [[proventriculus]]. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.<ref>Double, M. C. (2003)</ref> Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.<ref>Ehrlich, Paul R. (1988)</ref>\n\n===Subspecies===\nSalvin's prion has two [[subspecies]]:\n* ''Pachyptila salvini salvini'', the [[nominate subspecies]], breeds on [[Prince Edward Islands|Prince Edward Island]] and the [[Crozet Islands]]<ref name=\"Clements\">Clements, James (2007)</ref>\n* ''Pachyptila salvini macgillivray'' breeds on [[\u00cele Saint-Paul|St. Paul Island]] and [[\u00cele Amsterdam|Amsterdam Island]]<ref name=\"Clements\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Pachyptila'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''pakhus'' and ''ptilon''. ''Pakhus'' means \"thick\" or \"stout\" and ''ptilon'' means \"a feather\". Also from the Greek language, ''prion'' comes from the word ''pri\u014dn'' meaning \"a saw\", which is in reference to its serrated edges of its [[beak|bill]].<ref name=\"Gotch\">Gotch, A. T.

The colonies of medium-billed prions are attended [[nocturnality|nocturnally]] in order to avoid predation by [[skua]]s. The nests are concealed in burrows usually dug into soil. Nests are attended regularly for several months prior to breeding. A single egg is laid in November or early December, which is [[avian incubation|incubated]] for around 50 days. Both parents share the incubation duties and feed the chick once it is hatched. The chicks [[fledge]] around 60 days after hatching.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Feeding===\nThe main components of its diet are [[amphipod]]s and [[krill]], although it will also take [[fish]] and [[squid]].

It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for [[target acquisition]] and [[night vision device|night vision systems]]. It is armed with a [[30 mm caliber|{{convert|30|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] [[M230 chain gun]] carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage, and four [[hardpoint]]s mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores, typically a mixture of [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] missiles and [[Hydra 70]] rocket pods. The AH-64 has significant systems redundancy to improve combat survivability.\n\nThe Apache began as the ''Model 77'' developed by [[Hughes Helicopters]] for the [[United States Army]]'s [[Advanced Attack Helicopter]] program to replace the [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobra]]. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the [[Bell YAH-63]] in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, [[McDonnell Douglas]] continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The advanced AH-64D Apache Longbow was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security]], with over 2,000 AH-64s being produced by 2013.<ref name=Sterling_March_2013>{{cite web |last1=Sterling |first1=Robert |title=Apache helicopters roar ahead |url=http://www.boeing.com/boeing/Features/2013/06/bds_apache_06_03_13.page |website=Boeing.com |publisher=Boeing|date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army is the primary operator of the AH-64. It has also become the primary attack helicopter of multiple nations, including [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Singapore]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It has been built under license in the [[United Kingdom]] as the [[AgustaWestland Apache]]. American AH-64s have served in conflicts in [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)|Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq War|Iraq]].

It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for [[target acquisition]] and [[night vision device|night vision systems]]. It is armed with a [[30 mm caliber|{{convert|30|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}]] [[M230 chain gun]] carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage, and four [[hardpoint]]s mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores, typically a mixture of [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] missiles and [[Hydra 70]] rocket pods. The AH-64 has significant systems redundancy to improve combat survivability.\n\nThe Apache began as the ''Model 77'' developed by [[Hughes Helicopters]] for the [[United States Army]]'s [[Advanced Attack Helicopter]] program to replace the [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobra]]. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the [[Bell YAH-63]] in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, [[McDonnell Douglas]] continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The advanced AH-64D Apache Longbow was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security]], with over 2,000 AH-64s being produced by 2013.<ref name=Sterling_March_2013>{{cite web |last1=Sterling |first1=Robert |title=Apache helicopters roar ahead |url=http://www.boeing.com/boeing/Features/2013/06/bds_apache_06_03_13.page |website=Boeing.com |publisher=Boeing|date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army is the primary operator of the AH-64. It has also become the primary attack helicopter of multiple nations, including [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Singapore]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It has been built under license in the [[United Kingdom]] as the [[AgustaWestland Apache]]. American AH-64s have served in conflicts in [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)|Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Israel used the Apache in its military conflicts in [[Lebanon]] and the [[Gaza Strip]].

The upgrade would have included new rotor blades, a Global Positioning System (GPS), improved navigation systems and new radios. U.S. Congress approved $82M to begin the Apache B upgrade.

More funding changed the plan to upgrade to AH-64C. The C upgrade would include all changes to be included in the Longbow except for mast-mounted radar and newer \u2212700C engine versions.

Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak.\n\nRed Top was originally intended to replace Firestreak outright, but carrying the missiles on the [[English Electric Lightning]] required additional area to be added to the Lightning's [[vertical stabilizer]]. For this reason, Firestreak continued to be used on older models of the Lightning. Both missiles passed out of service in 1988 when the last of the Lightnings retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, Magpie II. Mk. III derated the motor to limit acceleration when launched at high speed in order to avoid overheating due to aerodynamic friction. Neither project was proceeded with.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=35}}\n\n===Blue Vesta===\nLooking for a further improved weapon for the [[Operational Requirement F.155]] interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk. IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, \"Blue Vesta\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nBlue Vesta adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk. II, further upgrading the motor to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker. They suggested moving to the much larger [[radar]]-guided [[Red Hebe]], although some low-level work on Blue Vesta's underlying technologies continued.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\n===Red Top===\nF.155 was canceled in the aftermath of the release of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]]. It was decided to proceed with the development of the [[English Electric Lightning]] largely because it was already close to being complete. Blue Vesta was reactivated in July 1957 to arm this aircraft. For security reasons, yet another rainbow code was assigned in November 1957 and it became Red Top.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nIn contrast to Blue Vesta, Red Top was a simpler design, more of a rationalised, upgraded version of the earlier Firestreak. Lower launch speeds allowed the steel wings and fins to be abandoned and they were replaced with larger surfaces that provided more maneuvering power. New attachments allowed them to be removed for storage. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. Other oddities of the Firestreak, like the fin actuators being in the nose and requiring pushrods running the length of the fuselage were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\". This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer general all-aspect capability; while it worked against supersonic targets warmed by skin friction, it would not work against subsonic targets and required a tail-aspect in these cases.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/aveeltg.html The English Electric (BAC) Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This loss in performance was offset to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which greatly improved reliability and eliminated the need for continual cooling. {{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nThese changes allowed the warhead to be moved to the forward fuselage from its former rear-mounted location. This move also allowed it to be enlarged to 31&nbsp;kg (68.3&nbsp;lb) from Firestreak's already prodigious 22.7&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;lb) and added an [[expanding-rod warhead]] in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type. With the warhead moved forward, room was left at the rear of the fuselage for one of the two rows of the IR [[proximity fuse]], improving its view of targets. The new \"Green Garland\" fuse required only one row of smaller rectangular \"windows\", compared to the Firestreak's two rows of larger triangular windows, further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267 Boyne, Walter J, ''Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], pub ABC-CLIO Inc, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-345-9}} p267.</ref> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles. \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.\"<ref name=Black141>Black, Ian, ''The Last of the Lightnings'', pub PSL, 1996, {{ISBN|1-85260-541-3}}, p141.</ref>\n\n===Almost cancelled===\nAlthough Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, [[Duncan Sandys]] almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk. II]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for [[interceptor aircraft]] altogether. The [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been proposed to replace Sea Vixen for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], assuming the aircraft to have a larger engine, a pair of Red Top, and the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Testing and service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Vesta program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service on both the Lightning and Sea Vixen in [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. It remained in service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox weapon\n|is_missile=yes\n| image= Red Top missile.png\n| image_size = 250\n|caption= Red Top missile\n|name=Red Top\n|type=[[Air-to-air missile]]\n|origin=United Kingdom\n|era=Cold War\n|platform=aircraft\n|target=aircraft\n|manufacturer=Hawker Siddeley Dynamics\n|design_date=\n|production_date=\n|service=1964 - 1988\n|used_by= United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait\n|wars=\n|spec_type= homing missile\n|diameter= 0.23 m\n|wingspan=0.91 m\n|length=3.32 m\n|weight= 154 kg\n|speed=Mach 3.2\n|vehicle_range=7.5 miles (12 km)\n|ceiling=\n|filling=31 kg (68.3 lb) [[annular blast fragmentation]]\n|engine=''Linnet'' solid fuel motor\n|steering=control surfaces\n|guidance=[[infrared homing]], limited [[all-aspect]]\n|variants=?\n|number=\n|detonation=''Green Garland'' infrared proximity; secondary contact [[fuze]]\n}}\n\nThe [[Hawker Siddeley]] (later [[British Aerospace]]) '''Red Top''' was the third indigenous British [[air-to-air missile]] to enter service, following the [[de Havilland Firestreak]] and limited-service [[Fireflash]].

His talk ''Remembrances of the Guru, Paramahansa Yogananda'' was recorded into a CD.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Self Realization Magazine |title= Brother Mokshananda in Memoriam|year=1982 |publisher=Self Realization Fellowship }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Paramahansa Yogananda}}\n\n[[Category:Paramahansa Yogananda]]\n", "name_user": "Red Rose 13", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1930s", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_direct_disciples_of_Yogananda"}

The electorate was first established for the 1978 election and was abolished again in 1984, and has existed again since the 2002 election. The MP for Helensville is [[Chris Penk]] of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], who has held the seat since the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]].\n\n==Population centres==\nThe 1977 electoral redistribution was the most overtly political since the Representation Commission had been established through an amendment to the ''Representation Act'' in 1886, initiated by [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]]'s [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government]].{{sfn|McRobie |1989 |pp=8\u20139, 51, 119}} As part of the [[1976 New Zealand census|1976 census]], a large number of people failed to fill in an electoral re-registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand's population, this resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the [[North Island]].{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=119}} The electoral redistribution was very disruptive, and 22 electorates were abolished, while 27 electorates were newly created (including Helensville) or re-established. These changes came into effect for the {{NZ election link|1978}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=115\u2013120}}\n\nIn the 1983 electoral redistribution, the Helensville electorate was abolished, and its area went to {{NZ electorate link|West Auckland}} and {{NZ electorate link|Rodney}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=118\u2013123}} The electorate was re-established in time for the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election]] in reaction to continued high population growth in and around Auckland. It was made by cutting off the northern flank of the electorate of [[Waitakere (New Zealand electorate)|Waitakere]] and adding in areas from the electorate of [[Rodney (New Zealand electorate)|Rodney]] around its southern boundary.\n\nHelensville covered an area of the rapidly growing northern [[Auckland]] urban fringe, drawing [[Helensville]] and [[Kumeu]] from [[Rodney, New Zealand|Rodney District]], moving south to take in [[Paremoremo]], [[Greenhithe, New Zealand|Greenhithe]] and [[Albany, New Zealand|Albany]] from [[North Shore City]], and finally tacking west to include [[Whenuapai]], [[Hobsonville]] and [[West Harbour, Auckland|West Harbour]] from [[Waitakere City]].\n\nThe electorate was abolished as part of the 2019/20 boundary review, with the southern section around the [[Waitakere Ranges]] being merged into {{NZ electorate link|New Lynn}}, an area around [[Coatesville]] was shed to {{NZ electorate link|Whangapar\u0101oa}}, and the rest of the seat was merged into the new electorate of [[Kaipara ki Mahurangi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Key electorate office.jpg|thumb|John Key's electorate office]]\nIn the 1978 election, the Helensville electorate was won by [[Dail Jones]], who had been MP for the {{NZ electorate link|Waitemata}} electorate since the {{NZ election link|1975}}.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=208}} After the Helensville electorate was abolished, Jones stood in the West Auckland electorate in the {{NZ election link|1984}} but was defeated by the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] candidate, [[Jack Elder]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|pp=194, 208}}\n\nSince the Helensville electorate was re-established for the {{NZ election link|2002}}, its only MP was the former Prime Minister, [[John Key]], who beat sitting Waitakere MP [[Brian Neeson]] to the nomination, and in a tight year for his party, won the electorate by 1,705 votes in a split field when a disgruntled Neeson chose to stand as an independent. Helensville is partly rural, and wealthy beyond the national average, making it a safe National electorate, and Key was returned easily in [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]], [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]] and [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011]] with large majorities.\n\nIn December 2016, Key announced that he was stepping down as prime minister and would retire from politics before the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], citing pressure on his family.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11760656|accessdate=27 September 2017|title=John Key resigns as Prime Minister of New Zealand, cites family reasons for leaving|date=5 December 2016|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref> The Helensville seat was won in the election by [[Chris Penk]], retaining it for the National Party.\n\n===Members of Parliament===\n'''Key'''\n\n{{Party index link|New Zealand National Party}} {{Party index link|New Zealand First}} {{Party index link|New Zealand Labour Party}} {{Party index link|ACT New Zealand}} {{Party index link|Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand}}\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!width=100| Election\n!width=175 colspan=2| Winner\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|1978}}\n|rowspan=2 width=5 bgcolor={{New Zealand National Party/meta/color}}|\n|rowspan=2| [[Dail Jones]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|1981}}\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=center|<small>Electorate abolished in 1984 (see {{NZ electorate link|West Auckland}} and {{NZ electorate link|Rodney}})</small>\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2002}}\n|rowspan=5 {{Meta color|New Zealand National Party}}\n|rowspan=5|[[John Key]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2005}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2008}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2011}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2014}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2017}}\n|{{Meta color|New Zealand National Party}}\n|[[Chris Penk]]\n|}\n\n===List MPs===\nMembers of Parliament elected from party lists in elections where that person also unsuccessfully contested the Helensville electorate.

The electorate was first established for the 1978 election and was abolished again in 1984, and has existed again since the 2002 election. The MP for Helensville is [[Chris Penk]] of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], who has held the seat since the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]].\n\n==Population centres==\nThe 1977 electoral redistribution was the most overtly political since the Representation Commission had been established through an amendment to the ''Representation Act'' in 1886, initiated by [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]]'s [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government]].{{sfn|McRobie |1989 |pp=8\u20139, 51, 119}} As part of the [[1976 New Zealand census|1976 census]], a large number of people failed to fill in an electoral re-registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand's population, this resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the [[North Island]].{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=119}} The electoral redistribution was very disruptive, and 22 electorates were abolished, while 27 electorates were newly created (including Helensville) or re-established. These changes came into effect for the {{NZ election link|1978}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=115\u2013120}}\n\nIn the 1983 electoral redistribution, the Helensville electorate was abolished, and its area went to {{NZ electorate link|West Auckland}} and {{NZ electorate link|Rodney}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=118\u2013123}} The electorate was re-established in time for the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election]] in reaction to continued high population growth in and around Auckland. It was made by cutting off the northern flank of the electorate of [[Waitakere (New Zealand electorate)|Waitakere]] and adding in areas from the electorate of [[Rodney (New Zealand electorate)|Rodney]] around its southern boundary.\n\nHelensville covered an area of the rapidly growing northern [[Auckland]] urban fringe, drawing [[Helensville]] and [[Kumeu]] from [[Rodney, New Zealand|Rodney District]], moving south to take in [[Paremoremo]], [[Greenhithe, New Zealand|Greenhithe]] and [[Albany, New Zealand|Albany]] from [[North Shore City]], and finally tacking west to include [[Whenuapai]], [[Hobsonville]] and [[West Harbour, Auckland|West Harbour]] from [[Waitakere City]].\n\nThe electorate was abolished as part of the 2019/2019 boundary review, with the southern section around the [[Waitakere Ranges]] being merged into {{NZ electorate link|New Lynn}}, an area around [[Coatesville]] was shed to {{NZ electorate link|Whangapar\u0101oa}}, and the rest of the seat was merged into the new electorate of [[Kaipara ki Mahurangi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Key electorate office.jpg|thumb|John Key's electorate office]]\nIn the 1978 election, the Helensville electorate was won by [[Dail Jones]], who had been MP for the {{NZ electorate link|Waitemata}} electorate since the {{NZ election link|1975}}.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=208}} After the Helensville electorate was abolished, Jones stood in the West Auckland electorate in the {{NZ election link|1984}} but was defeated by the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] candidate, [[Jack Elder]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|pp=194, 208}}\n\nSince the Helensville electorate was re-established for the {{NZ election link|2002}}, its only MP was the former Prime Minister, [[John Key]], who beat sitting Waitakere MP [[Brian Neeson]] to the nomination, and in a tight year for his party, won the electorate by 1,705 votes in a split field when a disgruntled Neeson chose to stand as an independent. Helensville is partly rural, and wealthy beyond the national average, making it a safe National electorate, and Key was returned easily in [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]], [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]] and [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011]] with large majorities.\n\nIn December 2016, Key announced that he was stepping down as prime minister and would retire from politics before the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], citing pressure on his family.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11760656|accessdate=27 September 2017|title=John Key resigns as Prime Minister of New Zealand, cites family reasons for leaving|date=5 December 2016|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref> The Helensville seat was won in the election by [[Chris Penk]], retaining it for the National Party.\n\n===Members of Parliament===\n'''Key'''\n\n{{Party index link|New Zealand National Party}} {{Party index link|New Zealand First}} {{Party index link|New Zealand Labour Party}} {{Party index link|ACT New Zealand}} {{Party index link|Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand}}\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!width=100| Election\n!width=175 colspan=2| Winner\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|1978}}\n|rowspan=2 width=5 bgcolor={{New Zealand National Party/meta/color}}|\n|rowspan=2| [[Dail Jones]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|1981}}\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=center|<small>Electorate abolished in 1984 (see {{NZ electorate link|West Auckland}} and {{NZ electorate link|Rodney}})</small>\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2002}}\n|rowspan=5 {{Meta color|New Zealand National Party}}\n|rowspan=5|[[John Key]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2005}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2008}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2011}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2014}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2017}}\n|{{Meta color|New Zealand National Party}}\n|[[Chris Penk]]\n|}\n\n===List MPs===\nMembers of Parliament elected from party lists in elections where that person also unsuccessfully contested the Helensville electorate.
