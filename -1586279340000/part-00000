The document Croatian ban Nikola Erd\u00f6dy call Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a [[Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a]] to allow colonization by Serbs Bovi\u0107 and Kirin, which were in possession bishops. Sometime later Petrinjska count Erd\u00f6dy Francis, the year 1693. sets Prince Peter Draskovic for chief Serbs in Slabinji and other surrounding areas. Lower Banovina had their possessions the family of Croatian nobles [[House of Keglevi\u0107|Keglevi\u0107]]. Because of their possessions around Blinje they were with the sukobljavali constantly Turks. For this reason, Croatian aristocrat Peter Keglevi\u0107 inhabits Wallachian families around Petrinja.

The country's economy is run in a very primitive way, using animals to assist in a lot of human work. Were to chipped households, with a small number of livestock and small land parcel. Owing to its very difficult work, people were able to vegetate and recover from the terrors of war (1945 whole village was in ash). Productivity was very weak, and the daily work was hard and tiring. Because of proximity to city centers (Petrinja, Sisak, Zagreb) and the existence of traffic connections with those cities, industrialization development, the late fifties and early sixties of the last century, people are increasingly going to work in factories. A large part of male population was employed in the cities. Thanks to daily migrations of people are, in addition to working in factories, managed to sustain agricultural production and even the more they build on a higher level. As time went by all over the went young people in the cities of the training.{{clarification needed|date=May 2016}} Given the popularity of the then no life at the village and on agriculture, after schooling the young are mainly employed and remained in the cities.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1991, the average age of the population in the village increased, which points to the possibility that the working-age population largely fled the village.

The document Croatian ban Nikola Erd\u00f6dy call Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a [[Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a]] to allow colonization by Serbs Bovi\u0107 and Kirin, which were in possession bishops. Sometime later Petrinjska count Erd\u00f6dy Francis, the year 1693. sets Prince Peter Draskovic for chief Serbs in Slabinji and other surrounding areas. Lower Banovina had their possessions the family of Croatian nobles [[House of Keglevi\u0107|Keglevi\u0107]]. Because of their possessions around Blinje they were with the sukobljavali constantly Turks. For this reason, Croatian aristocrat Peter Keglevi\u0107 inhabits Wallachian families around Petrinja. The year 1697. leads Vlahe wrong. That same year, Serbs are settled in and around Sunja. Two years later, in 1699 was inhabited by \u017divaja.\n\nAfter World War II population in the village focused mainly on agricultural production and livestock breeding as the primary branches. The country's economy is run in a very primitive way, using animals to assist in a lot of human work. Were to chipped households, with a small number of livestock and small land parcel. Owing to its very difficult work, people were able to vegetate and recover from the terrors of war (1945 whole village was in ash). Productivity was very weak, and the daily work was hard and tiring. Because of proximity to city centers (Petrinja, Sisak, Zagreb) and the existence of traffic connections with those cities, industrialization development, the late fifties and early sixties of the last century, people are increasingly going to work in factories. A large part of male population was employed in the cities. Thanks to daily migrations of people are, in addition to working in factories, managed to sustain agricultural production and even the more they build on a higher level. As time went by all over the went young people in the cities of the training.{{clarification needed|date=May 2016}} Given the popularity of the then no life at the village and on agriculture, after schooling the young are mainly employed and remained in the cities.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1991, the average age of the population in the village increased, which points to the possibility that the working-age population largely fled the village. From the list of 1981.g. with 800 inhabitants, there was a drop to 726 on the list 1991.g.\n\n==Traffic connections==\nThrough the village [[\u017divaja]] passing road traffic categorized as the state of roads and carrying the label D224.\n\nThe railroad that passes parallel to the village, the distance of about 300 meters from the construction zone [[villages]], classified in the category of tracks from the importance of international trade.

The church is [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] in governance. It has approximately 130 congregations in 14 states and 4 countries and a membership of over 50,000. The organization's headquarters is located in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia, PA]].\n\n==History==\nFounded by [[Ida B. Robinson]], the organization is the only organization founded by an [[African American|African-American]] woman that held consistent female leadership from its founding in 1924 until February 2001.\n\nIda B. Robinson grew up in [[Pensacola, Florida]], the seventh of twelve children born to Robert and Annie Bell. After her conversion as a teenager at an evangelistic street meeting, she led prayer services in homes. In 1910 she married Oliver Robinson. In search for better employment opportunities, the couple relocated from Pensacola to Philadelphia in 1917.\n\nIn Philadelphia, she began conducting street [[evangelism]] in Philadelphia under the auspices of The [[United Holy Church of America]]. In 1919, Robinson was installed as pastor of Mount Olive Holy Temple, a small mission that was affiliated with the United Holy Church.\n\n1924 became a significant year in the life of Ida Robinson. While fasting and praying in the church for ten days, she  stated that she received a revelation from God. As she related, \u201cThe [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]] spoke and said, \u2018Come out on [[Mount Sinai]].\u201d After this encounter, Robinson believed that God was calling her to \u201cCome out on Mount Sinai,\u201d so that \u201cI will use you to loose the women.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lindley|first1=Susan Hill|title=You Have Stept Out of Your Place: A History of Women and Religion in America|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664257996|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/You_Have_Stept_Out_of_Your_Place.html?id=gBIPJiXRcZUC|language=en}}</ref> On May 20, 1924, the [[Pennsylvania|State of Pennsylvania]] granted her a charter for the church under the name of the Mount Sinai Holy Church of America, Incorporated.\n\nAt its founding, women comprised six of nine members of the Board of Elders as well as the top four officers. Ida Robinson began to conduct many evangelistic works and [[church planting]]. To strengthen the general organization, an Annual Convocation was instituted. This Annual meeting was first held in Philadelphia for eight days in September, 1925, she was also consecrated as Bishop during the meeting. When she died, the denomination consisted of 84 churches, more than 160 ordained ministers of whom 125 were women, an accredited school in Philadelphia, mission work in Cuba and Guyana, and a farm in [[South Jersey]] that provided a safe haven away from the city for church members.\n\n==Doctrine==\nThe doctrinal emphasis of the church is the inspired, infallible, authority of Scripture, belief in the trinity, conversion, repentance, salvation in the Lord [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], justification, sanctification and [[Baptism with the Holy Spirit|baptism by the Holy Spirit]]. The Church teaches that baptism by the Holy Spirit is given to all Christian believers who ask for it. [[Faith healing|Divine healing]] is practiced, but not to the exclusion of medical supervision. Holiness of life and practice are emphasized. The ordinances of the Church, as act of obedience to Faith, are water [[baptism]] (immersion), the Lord's Supper (Holy Communion) and the Ordinance of Humility (foot washing).  One particular doctrine that is solidified in the denomination's history is its beliefs on [[gender equality]].

Robinson]]''' was the founder, Senior Bishop, Presiding [[Prelate]] and first President from 1924 to 1946. On April 6, 1946, Ida Robinson left Philadelphia with a group of missionaries to visit some of the organization's churches in Florida. Her first stop in Florida was Jacksonville. From there she journeyed on to Winter Haven where on 20 April 1946 she died. At the time of her death, the denomination consisted of 84 churches.\n\n'''Bishop Elmira Jeffries''' served as Senior Bishop, Presiding Prelate, and President from 1946 to 1964. She was a charter member of the denomination, and became its first vice-president. Subsequent to the death of Bishop Ida Robinson, Jeffries was set aside to the Bishopric in 1946 by Bishop W.E. Fuller, President of the Fire Baptized Holy Church. At this time, she became president of Mount Sinai Holy Church of America, Inc., and the pastor of Mount Olive Holy Temple in Philadelphia. Under her leadership, the church purchased the Physicians' and Surgeons' Hospital located 1512-1514 on 15th street in the city of Philadelphia. Today the building has been named, The Elmira Jeffries Memorial Home. On Monday, June 15, 1964, she died.\n\n''' Bishop Mary E. Jackson''' served as Senior Bishop, Presiding Prelate, and President from 1964 to 1983. Born in 1881, she was also a charter member of the denomination. Jackson's tenure as president was the second longest in the church's history. Jackson was 83 years old when she became the denomination's president. Bishop Jackson is accredited with the creation of the National Youth Department and National Youth Convention for the denomination. On October 26, 1980, Bishop Mary Elizabeth Jackson retired from active pastorate service. When she died on November 8, 1983, her age was 102 years making her the oldest president in the history of the church. Her administration was also the second longest in the church's history.  There is currently a book scholarship provided by the National Youth Department in honor of Bishop Mary E. Jackson.\n\n'''Bishop Amy B. Stevens, DD''' served as Presiding Prelate, President and Senior Bishop from 1983 to 2000. Bishop Stevens was appointed President of Mount Sinai Holy Church of America, Inc., in February, 1984.  Under her administration as president of Mount Sinai Holy Church of America, Inc., she created the Mount Sinai Training Institute and the expansion of ministry on the Mount Sinai Farm. She traveled to Mount Sinai's churches in Guyana and Cuba. Bishop Stevens received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] of Theology degree from the Official Board of Christian Bible Institute and Seminary. In 1984 Bishop Stevens along with Bishop James F. Brown, Jr. (Mt.

Satchell, DD''' served as Presiding Prelate and President from 2000 to 2001. After the death of Bishop Amy Stevens, Bishop Satchell, who at that time was serving as vice president, was appointed president of the denomination. Satchell was in her mid 1990s when beginning her tenure as president. She resigned as president in 2001, making her the shortest-serving president in the church's history. After her resignation she held the title of \"President Emeritus\" from 2001 until her death on March 1, 2011.

The church is [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] in governance. It has approximately 130 congregations in 14 states and 4 countries and a membership of over 50,000. The organization's headquarters is located in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia, PA]].\n\n==History==\nFounded by [[Ida B. Robinson]], the organization is the only organization founded by an [[African American|African-American]] woman that held consistent female leadership from its founding in 1924 until February 2001.\n\nIda B. Robinson grew up in [[Pensacola, Florida]], the seventh of twelve children born to Robert and Annie Bell. After her conversion as a teenager at an evangelistic street meeting, she led prayer services in homes. In 1910 she married Oliver Robinson. In search for better employment opportunities, the couple relocated from Pensacola to Philadelphia in 1917.\n\nIn Philadelphia, she began conducting street [[evangelism]] in Philadelphia under the auspices of The [[United Holy Church of America]]. In 1919, Robinson was installed as pastor of Mount Olive Holy Temple, a small mission that was affiliated with the United Holy Church.\n\n1924 became a significant year in the life of Ida Robinson. While fasting and praying in the church for ten days, she  stated that she received a revelation from God. As she related, \u201cThe [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]] spoke and said, \u2018Come out on [[Mount Sinai]].\u201d After this encounter, Robinson believed that God was calling her to \u201cCome out on Mount Sinai,\u201d so that \u201cI will use you to loose the women.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lindley|first1=Susan Hill|title=You Have Stept Out of Your Place: A History of Women and Religion in America|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664257996|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/You_Have_Stept_Out_of_Your_Place.html?id=gBIPJiXRcZUC|language=en}}</ref> On May 20, 1924, the [[Pennsylvania|State of Pennsylvania]] granted her a charter for the church under the name of the Mount Sinai Holy Church of America, Incorporated.\n\nAt its founding, women comprised six of nine members of the Board of Elders as well as the top four officers. Ida Robinson began to conduct many evangelistic works and [[church planting]]. To strengthen the general organization, an Annual Convocation was instituted. This Annual meeting was first held in Philadelphia for eight days in September, 1925, she was also consecrated as Bishop during the meeting. When she died, the denomination consisted of 84 churches, more than 160 ordained ministers of whom 125 were women, an accredited school in Philadelphia, mission work in Cuba and Guyana, and a farm in [[South Jersey]] that provided a safe haven away from the city for church members.\n\n==Doctrine==\nThe doctrinal emphasis of the church is the inspired, infallible, authority of Scripture, belief in the trinity, conversion, repentance, salvation in the Lord [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], justification, sanctification and [[Baptism with the Holy Spirit|baptism by the Holy Spirit]]. The Church teaches that baptism by the Holy Spirit is given to all Christian believers who ask for it. [[Faith healing|Divine healing]] is practiced, but not to the exclusion of medical supervision. Holiness of life and practice are emphasized. The ordinances of the Church, as act of obedience to Faith, are water [[baptism]] (immersion), the Lord's Supper (Holy Communion) and the Ordinance of Humility (foot washing).  One particular doctrine that is solidified in the denomination's history is its beliefs on [[gender equality]]. Both men and women are considered equal in reference to official ordinations and ecclesiastical rights.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keller|first1=Rosemary Skinner|last2=Ruether|first2=Rosemary Radford|last3=Cantlon|first3=Marie|title=Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253346858|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Encyclopedia_of_Women_and_Religion_in_No.html?id=0jCInAEACAAJ|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Senior Bishops and Presidents==\n*Bishop [[Ida B.

The electrons interact with [[atom]]s in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the surface [[topography]] and composition of the sample. The electron beam is scanned in a [[raster scan]] pattern, and the position of the beam is combined with the intensity of the detected signal to produce an image. In the most common SEM mode, [[secondary electrons]] emitted by atoms excited by the electron beam are detected using a secondary electron detector ([[Everhart-Thornley detector]]). The number of secondary electrons that can be detected, and thus the signal intensity, depends, among other things, on specimen topography. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer.\n\nSpecimens are observed in high vacuum in conventional SEM, or in low vacuum or wet conditions in variable pressure or environmental SEM, and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments.<ref name=\"Stokes\">{{cite book|last1=Stokes|first1=Debbie J.|title=Principles and Practice of Variable Pressure Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (VP-ESEM).|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0470758748}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAn account of the early history of SEM has been presented by McMullan.<ref>{{cite journal|author=McMullan, D. |doi=10.1002/sca.4950170309|url=http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/achievements/mcmullan/mcm.htm|title=Scanning electron microscopy 1928\u20131965|year=2006|journal=Scanning|volume=17|issue=3|pages=175\u2013185|pmc=2496789}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=McMullan, D.|year=1988|title=Von Ardenne and the scanning electron microscope|journal= Proc Roy Microsc Soc |volume=23|pages= 283\u2013288}}</ref> Although [[Max Knoll]] produced a photo with a 50&nbsp;mm object-field-width showing channeling contrast by the use of an electron beam scanner,<ref name=\"knoll\">{{cite journal |last=Knoll |first=Max|year=1935 |title=Aufladepotentiel und Sekund\u00e4remission elektronenbestrahlter K\u00f6rper |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Technische Physik |volume=16|pages=467\u2013475}}</ref> it was [[Manfred von Ardenne]] who in 1937 invented<ref name=\"vonardenne\">von Ardenne M.

Various types of signals are produced including [[secondary electrons]] (SE), reflected or [[Backscatter|back-scattered electrons]] (BSE), characteristic X-rays and light ([[cathodoluminescence]]) (CL), absorbed current (specimen current) and transmitted electrons.  Secondary electron detectors are standard equipment in all SEMs, but it is rare for a single machine to have detectors for all other possible signals.\n\nSecondary electrons have very low energies on the order of 50 eV, which limits their mean free path in solid matter.  Consequently, SEs can only escape from the top few nanometers of the surface of a sample.  The signal from secondary electrons tends to be highly localized at the point of impact of the primary electron beam, making it possible to collect images of the sample surface with a resolution of below 1 [[Nanometre|nm]]. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the sample by [[elastic scattering]]. They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and, consequently, the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM, along with the spectra made from the characteristic X-rays, because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution, but not the identity, of different elements in the sample.  In samples predominantly composed of light elements, such as biological specimens, BSE imaging can image [[colloidal gold]] [[Immunogold labelling|immuno-labels]] of 5 or 10&nbsp;nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images.<ref name=\"Suzuki\"/> Characteristic [[X-ray]]s are emitted when the electron beam removes an [[Electron shell|inner shell electron]] from the sample, causing a [[Energy level|higher-energy electron]] to fill the shell and release energy. The energy or wavelength of these characteristic X-rays can be measured by [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] or [[Wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] and used to identify and measure the abundance of elements in the sample and map their distribution.\n\nDue to the very narrow electron beam, SEM micrographs have a large [[depth of field]] yielding a characteristic three-dimensional appearance useful for understanding the surface structure of a sample.<ref name=\"Goldsteinetal1981\" /> This is exemplified by the micrograph of pollen shown above. A wide range of magnifications is possible, from about 10 times (about equivalent to that of a powerful hand-lens) to more than 500,000 times, about 250 times the magnification limit of the best [[light microscope]]s.\n\n==Sample preparation==\n[[File:Gold Spider SEM sample.jpg|thumb|A spider sputter-coated in gold, having been prepared for viewing with an SEM]]\n[[File:Pos.tif|thumb|Low-voltage micrograph (300&nbsp;V) of distribution of adhesive droplets on a [[Post-it note]]. No conductive coating was applied: such a coating would alter this fragile specimen.]]\nSEM samples have to be small enough to fit on the specimen stage, and may need special preparation to increase their electrical conductivity and to stabilize them, so that they can withstand the high vacuum conditions and the high energy beam of electrons. Samples are generally mounted rigidly on a specimen holder or stub using a conductive adhesive. SEM is used extensively for defect analysis of semiconductor wafers, and manufacturers make instruments that can examine any part of a 300&nbsp;mm semiconductor wafer. Many instruments have chambers that can tilt an object of that size to 45\u00b0 and provide continuous 360\u00b0 rotation.\n\nNonconductive specimens collect charge when scanned by the electron beam, and especially in secondary electron imaging mode, this causes scanning faults and other image artifacts. For conventional imaging in the SEM, specimens must be [[electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]], at least at the surface, and [[ground (electricity)|electrically grounded]] to prevent the accumulation of [[static electricity|electrostatic charge]]. Metal objects require little special preparation for SEM except for cleaning and conductively mounting to a specimen stub.  Non-conducting materials are usually coated with an ultrathin coating of electrically conducting material, deposited on the sample either by low-vacuum [[sputter coating]] or by high-vacuum evaporation. Conductive materials in current use for specimen coating include [[gold]], gold/[[palladium]] alloy, [[platinum]], [[iridium]], [[tungsten]], [[chromium]], [[osmium]],<ref name=\"Suzuki\">{{cite journal |last=Suzuki |first=E. |year=2002 |title=High-resolution scanning electron microscopy of immunogold-labelled cells by the use of thin plasma coating of osmium |journal=Journal of Microscopy |volume=208 |issue=3 |pages=153\u2013157 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2818.2002.01082.x}}</ref> and [[graphite]]. Coating with heavy metals may increase signal/noise ratio for samples of low [[atomic number]] (Z). The improvement arises because secondary electron emission for high-Z materials is enhanced.\n\nAn alternative to coating for some biological samples is to increase the bulk conductivity of the material by impregnation with osmium using variants of the OTO [[staining]] method (O-[[osmium tetroxide]], T-[[thiocarbohydrazide]], O-osmium).<ref name=\"Seligman\">{{cite journal |last=Seligman |first=Arnold M. |author2=Wasserkrug, Hannah L. |author3=Hanker, Jacob S.  |year=1966 |title=A new staining method for enhancing contrast of lipid-containing membranes and droplets in osmium tetroxide-fixed tissue with osmiophilic thiocarbohydrazide (TCH) |journal=Journal of Cell Biology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=424\u2013432 |doi=10.1083/jcb.30.2.424 |pmid=4165523 |pmc=2106998}}</ref><ref name=\"Malick\">{{cite journal |last=Malick |first=Linda E. |author2=Wilson, Richard B. |author3=Stetson, David  |year=1975 |title=Modified Thiocarbohydrazide Procedure for Scanning Electron Microscopy: Routine use for Normal, Pathological, or Experimental Tissues |journal=Biotechnic & Histochemistry |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=265\u2013269 |doi=10.3109/10520297509117069}}</ref>\n\nNonconducting specimens may be imaged without coating using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation.<ref name=\"Hortol\u00e0\">{{cite journal |last=Hortol\u00e0 |first=Policarp |year=2005 |title=SEM Examination of Human Erythrocytes in Uncoated Bloodstains on Stone: Use of Conventional as Environmental-like SEM in a Soft Biological Tissue (and Hard Inorganic Material) |journal=Journal of Microscopy |volume=218 |issue=2 |pages=94\u2013103 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.2005.01477.x|pmid=15857371 }}</ref> In ESEM instruments the specimen is placed in a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately{{clarify|date=April 2019}} low at the electron gun.

Specimens that undergo [[Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|WDS]] or [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDS]] analysis are often carbon-coated. In general, metals are not coated prior to imaging in the SEM because they are conductive and provide their own pathway to ground.\n\n[[Fractography]] is the study of fractured surfaces that can be done on a light microscope or, commonly, on an SEM. The fractured surface is cut to a suitable size, cleaned of any organic residues, and mounted on a specimen holder for viewing in the SEM.\n\nIntegrated circuits may be cut with a [[focused ion beam]] (FIB) or other [[ion beam]] milling instrument for viewing in the SEM. The SEM in the first case may be incorporated into the FIB.{{clarify|reason=how, for what purpose?|date=February 2016}}\n\nMetals, geological specimens, and integrated circuits all may also be chemically polished for viewing in the SEM.\n\nSpecial high-resolution coating techniques are required for high-magnification imaging of inorganic thin films.\n\n==Scanning process and image formation==\n[[File:Schema MEB (en).svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of an SEM]]\n\nIn a typical SEM, an electron beam is [[thermionically]] emitted from an [[electron gun]] fitted with a tungsten filament [[cathode]]. Tungsten is normally used in thermionic electron guns because it has the highest melting point and lowest vapor pressure of all metals, thereby allowing it to be electrically heated for electron emission, and because of its low cost. Other types of electron emitters include [[lanthanum hexaboride]] ({{chem|LaB|6}}) cathodes, which can be used in a standard tungsten filament SEM if the vacuum system is upgraded or field emission guns (FEG), which may be of the [[cold-cathode]] type using tungsten single crystal emitters or the thermally assisted [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] type, that use emitters of [[zirconium oxide]].\n\nThe electron beam, which typically has an [[energy]] ranging from 0.2 [[electronvolt|keV]] to 40 keV, is focused by one or two condenser lenses to a spot about 0.4&nbsp;nm to 5&nbsp;nm in diameter. The beam passes through pairs of [[scanning coils]] or pairs of deflector plates in the electron column, typically in the final lens, which deflect the beam in the ''x'' and ''y'' axes so that it scans in a [[Raster scan|raster]] fashion over a rectangular area of the sample surface.\n\n[[File:Electron emission mechanisms.svg|thumb|Mechanisms of emission of secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, and characteristic X-rays from atoms of the sample]]\n\nWhen the primary electron beam interacts with the sample, the electrons lose energy by repeated random scattering and absorption within a teardrop-shaped volume of the specimen known as the '''interaction volume''', which extends from less than 100&nbsp;nm to approximately 5&nbsp;\u00b5m into the surface. The size of the interaction volume depends on the electron's landing energy, the atomic number of the specimen and the specimen's density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample results in the reflection of high-energy electrons by elastic scattering, emission of secondary electrons by [[inelastic scattering]] and the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]], each of which can be detected by specialized detectors. The beam current absorbed by the specimen can also be detected and used to create images of the distribution of specimen current. [[Electronics|Electronic amplifiers]] of various types are used to amplify the signals, which are displayed as variations in brightness on a computer monitor (or, for vintage models, on a [[cathode ray tube]]). Each pixel of computer video memory is synchronized with the position of the beam on the specimen in the microscope, and the resulting image is, therefore, a distribution map of the intensity of the signal being emitted from the scanned area of the specimen. Older microscopes captured images on film, but most modern instrument collect [[digital images]].\n\n[[File:LT-SEM snow crystal magnification series-3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Low-temperature SEM magnification series for a [[snow]] crystal. The crystals are captured, stored, and sputter-coated with platinum at cryogenic temperatures for imaging.]]\n\n===Magnification===\nMagnification in an SEM can be controlled over a range of about 6 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] from about 10 to 3,000,000 times<ref>[https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/eu/product_detail/?pn=em-su9000&version=#productSub-1 Ultra-high Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope SU9000]</ref>. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not a function of the power of the [[objective (optics)|objective lens]]. SEMs may have [[condenser (microscope)|condenser]] and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, a SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in [[scanning probe microscopy]], magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.\n\n==Detection of secondary electrons==\nThe most common imaging mode collects low-energy (<50 eV) secondary electrons that are ejected from conduction or valence bands of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate from within a few [[nanometer]]s below the sample surface.<ref name=\"Goldsteinetal1981\" /> The electrons are detected by an [[Everhart-Thornley detector]],<ref name=\"EverhartThornley\">{{cite journal |last=Everhart |first=T.

The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the specimen chamber. The amplified electrical [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue [[video]] display, or subjected to [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital conversion]] and displayed and saved as a [[digital image]]. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the [[sensor|detector]]. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform about the axis of the beam and a certain number of electrons \"escape\" from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the \"escape\" distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance. Using the signal of secondary electrons [[image resolution]] less than 0.5&nbsp;nm is possible.\n\n==Detection of backscattered electrons==\n[[File:SEM SE vs BE Zr Al.png|thumb|Comparison of SEM techniques: <br />Top: backscattered electron analysis{{snd}} composition <br /> Bottom: secondary electron analysis{{snd}} topography]]\n\nBackscattered electrons (BSE) consist of high-energy electrons originating in the electron beam, that are reflected or back-scattered out of the specimen interaction volume by elastic scattering interactions with specimen atoms. Since heavy elements (high atomic number) backscatter electrons more strongly than light elements (low atomic number), and thus appear brighter in the image, BSEs are used to detect contrast between areas with different chemical compositions.<ref name=\"Goldsteinetal1981\">{{cite book |title=Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray microanalysis |last=Goldstein |first=G.

Dedicated backscattered electron detectors are positioned above the sample in a \"doughnut\" type arrangement, concentric with the electron beam, maximizing the solid angle of collection. BSE detectors are usually either of scintillator or of semiconductor types. When all parts of the detector are used to collect electrons symmetrically about the beam, atomic number contrast is produced. However, strong topographic contrast is produced by collecting back-scattered electrons from one side above the specimen using an asymmetrical, directional BSE detector; the resulting contrast appears as illumination of the topography from that side. Semiconductor detectors can be made in radial segments that can be switched in or out to control the type of contrast produced and its directionality.\n\nBackscattered electrons can also be used to form an [[electron backscatter diffraction]] ([[EBSD]]) image that can be used to determine the crystallographic structure of the specimen.\n\n==Beam-injection analysis of semiconductors==\nThe nature of the SEM's probe, energetic electrons, makes it uniquely suited to examining the optical and electronic properties of semiconductor materials. The high-energy electrons from the SEM beam will inject [[charge carrier]]s into the semiconductor. Thus, beam electrons lose energy by promoting electrons from the [[valence band]] into the [[conduction band]], leaving behind [[electron hole|holes]].\n\nIn a [[direct bandgap]] material, recombination of these electron-hole pairs will result in cathodoluminescence; if the sample contains an internal electric field, such as is present at a [[p-n junction]], the SEM beam injection of carriers will cause [[electron beam induced current]] (EBIC) to flow.  Cathodoluminescence and EBIC are referred to as \"beam-injection\" techniques, and are very powerful probes of the optoelectronic behavior of semiconductors, in particular for studying nanoscale features and defects.\n\n==Cathodoluminescence==\n[[File:InGaN_crystal_SEM%2BCL.png|thumb|Color cathodoluminescence overlay on SEM image of an [[InGaN]] polycrystal. The blue and green channels represent real colors, the red channel corresponds to UV emission.]]\n\n[[Cathodoluminescence]], the emission of light when atoms excited by high-energy electrons return to their ground state, is analogous to [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-induced [[fluorescence]], and some materials such as zinc sulfide and some fluorescent dyes, exhibit both phenomena. Over the last decades, cathodoluminescence was most commonly experienced as the light emission from the inner surface of the [[cathode ray tube]] in television sets and computer CRT monitors. In the SEM, CL detectors either collect all light emitted by the specimen or can analyse the wavelengths emitted by the specimen and display an emission [[spectrum]] or an image of the distribution of cathodoluminescence emitted by the specimen in real color.\n\n==X-ray microanalysis==\n[[Characteristic X-ray]]s that are produced by the interaction of [[electrons]] with the sample may also be detected in an SEM equipped for [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] or [[wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]]. Analysis of the x-ray signals may be used to map the distribution and estimate the abundance of elements in the sample.\n\n==Resolution of the SEM==\n[[File:SEM Zoom.ogv|thumb|right|300px|A video illustrating a typical practical magnification range of a scanning electron microscope designed for biological specimens. The video starts at 25x, about 6 mm across the whole field of view, and zooms in to 12000\u00d7, about 12&nbsp;[[\u03bcm]] across the whole field of view. The spherical objects are glass beads with a diameter of 10&nbsp;\u03bcm, similar in diameter to a [[red blood cell]].]]\nSEM is not a [[camera]] and the detector is not continuously image-forming like a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] array or [[Photographic film|film]]. Unlike in an optical system, the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] is not limited by the [[diffraction limit]], fineness of lenses or mirrors or detector array resolution. The focusing optics can be large and coarse, and the SE detector is fist-sized and simply detects current. Instead, the spatial resolution of the SEM depends on the size of the electron spot, which in turn depends on both the wavelength of the electrons and the electron-optical system that produces the scanning beam. The resolution is also limited by the size of the interaction volume, the volume of specimen material that interacts with the electron beam. The spot size and the interaction volume are both large compared to the distances between atoms, so the resolution of the SEM is not high enough to image individual atoms, as is possible with [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM). The SEM has compensating advantages, though, including the ability to image a comparatively large area of the specimen; the ability to image bulk materials (not just thin films or foils); and the variety of analytical modes available for measuring the composition and properties of the specimen. Depending on the instrument, the resolution can fall somewhere between less than 1&nbsp;nm and 20&nbsp;nm. As of 2009, The world's highest resolution conventional (\u226430&nbsp;kV) SEM can reach a point resolution of 0.4&nbsp;nm using a secondary electron detector.<ref>[http://www.nanotech-now.com/news.cgi?story_id=42612 Hitachi Launches World\u2019s Highest Resolution FE-SEM]. ''Nanotech Now''. 31 May 2011.</ref>\n\n==Environmental SEM==\n{{Main|Environmental scanning electron microscope}}\nConventional SEM requires samples to be imaged under [[vacuum]], because a gas atmosphere rapidly spreads and [[attenuation|attenuates]] electron beams. As a consequence, samples that produce a significant amount of [[vapour pressure|vapour]], e.g. wet biological samples or oil-bearing rock, must be either dried or cryogenically frozen. Processes involving [[phase transition]]s, such as the drying of [[adhesive]]s or melting of [[alloy]]s, liquid transport, chemical reactions, and solid-air-gas systems, in general cannot be observed with conventional high-vacuum SEM. In environmental SEM (ESEM), the chamber is evacuated of air, but water vapor is retained near its saturation pressure, and the residual pressure remains relatively high. This allows the analysis of samples containing water or other volatile substances. With ESEM, observations of living insects have been possible.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Takaku |first1=Yasuharu |last2=Suzuki |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Ohta |first3=Isao |last4=Tsutsui |first4=Takami |last5=Matsumoto |first5=Haruko |last6=Shimomura |first6=Masatsugu |last7=Hariyama |first7=Takahiko |date=7 March 2015 |title=A 'NanoSuit' surface shield successfully protects organisms in high vacuum: observations on living organisms in an FE-SEM |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |language=en |volume=282 |issue=1802 |pages=20142857 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2857 |issn=0962-8452 |pmc=4344158 |pmid=25631998}}</ref>\n\nThe first commercial development of the ESEM in the late 1980s<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Danilatos\n|first = G.

Uncoated [[plastics]] and [[elastomers]] can be routinely examined, as can uncoated biological samples. This is useful because coating can be difficult to reverse, may conceal small features on the surface of the sample and may reduce the value of the results obtained. X-ray analysis is difficult with a coating of a heavy metal, so carbon coatings are routinely used in conventional SEMs, but ESEM makes it possible to perform X-ray microanalysis on uncoated non-conductive specimens; however some specific for ESEM artifacts are introduced in X-ray analysis. ESEM may be the preferred for electron microscopy of unique samples from criminal or civil actions, where [[forensic analysis]] may need to be repeated by several different experts.

In SEM systems using these detectors it is common to color code these extra signals and superimpose them in a single color image, so that differences in the distribution of the various components of the specimen can be seen clearly and compared. Optionally, the standard secondary electron image can be merged with the one or more compositional channels, so that the specimen's structure and composition can be compared.  Such images can be made while maintaining the full integrity of the original signal data, which is not modified in any way.\n\n==3D in SEM==\nSEMs do not naturally provide 3D images contrary to [[Scanning probe microscope|SPMs]].

The drawbacks are that it works only if there is a minimum texture, and it requires two images to be acquired from two different angles, which implies the use of a tilt stage. ([[Photogrammetry]] is a software operation that calculates the shift (or \"disparity\") for each pixel, between the left image and the right image of the same pair. Such disparity reflects the local height).\n\n<gallery widths=\"340px\" heights=\"220px\">\n\nFile:SEM Stereo Pair.jpg|An SEM stereo pair of [[microfossils]] of less than 1&nbsp;mm in size ([[Ostracoda]]) produced by tilting along the longitudinal axis.\n\nFile:SEM Stereo pair of micro-fossil (Juxilyocypris schwarzbachi Ostracoda).gif|From this pair of SEM images, the third dimension has been reconstructed by photogrammetry (using [[MountainsMap]] software, see next image) ; then a series of 3D representations with different angles have been made and assembled into a GIF file to produce this animation.\n\nFile:3D surface reconstruction from 2 scanning electron microscope images.gif|3D surface reconstruction of a (Ra = 3&nbsp;\u00b5m) [[Surface roughness|roughness]] calibration sample (as used to calibrate profilometers), from 2 scanning electron microscope images tilted of 15\u00b0 (top left).

The prominence of this effect depends on the angle of the BSE detectors with respect to the sample, but these detectors are usually situated around (and close to) the electron beam, so this effect is very common.\n\n===Photometric 3D rendering from a single SEM image===\nThis method requires an SEM image obtained in oblique low angle lighting.

This method, based on a Shannon Entropy and conditional simulation, can be used for most of the available stationary materials and can build various stochastic 3D models just using a few thin sections.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tahmasebi|first1=Pejman|last2=Javadpour|first2=Farzam|last3=Sahimi|first3=Muhammad| title=Multiscale and multiresolution modeling of shales and their flow and morphological properties|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|pages=16373|doi=10.1038/srep16373|pmid=26560178|pmc=4642334|year=2015|bibcode=2015NatSR...516373T}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tahmasebi|first1=Pejman|last2=Javadpour|first2=Farzam|last3=Sahimi|first3=Muhammad| title=Three-Dimensional Stochastic Characterization of Shale SEM Images|journal=Transport in Porous Media|volume=110|issue=3|pages=521\u2013531|doi=10.1007/s11242-015-0570-1|year=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tahmasebi|first1=Pejman|last2=Sahimi|first2=Muhammad| title=Reconstruction of three-dimensional porous media using a single thin section|journal=Physical Review E|volume=85|issue=6|pages=066709|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.85.066709|pmid=23005245|year=2012|bibcode=2012PhRvE..85f6709T|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fda5fc81c4aa52b63c44643ef61c69280c00cbc5}}</ref>\n\n===Applications of 3D SEM===\nOne possible application is measuring the roughness of ice crystals.

The electrons interact with [[atom]]s in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the surface [[topography]] and composition of the sample. The electron beam is scanned in a [[raster scan]] pattern, and the position of the beam is combined with the intensity of the detected signal to produce an image. In the most common SEM mode, [[secondary electrons]] emitted by atoms excited by the electron beam are detected using a secondary electron detector ([[Everhart-Thornley detector]]). The number of secondary electrons that can be detected, and thus the signal intensity, depends, among other things, on specimen topography. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer.\n\nSpecimens are observed in high vacuum in conventional SEM, or in low vacuum or wet conditions in variable pressure or environmental SEM, and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments.<ref name=\"Stokes\">{{cite book|last1=Stokes|first1=Debbie J.|title=Principles and Practice of Variable Pressure Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (VP-ESEM).|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0470758748}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAn account of the early history of SEM has been presented by McMullan.<ref>{{cite journal|author=McMullan, D. |doi=10.1002/sca.4950170309|url=http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/achievements/mcmullan/mcm.htm|title=Scanning electron microscopy 1928\u20131965|year=2006|journal=Scanning|volume=17|issue=3|pages=175\u2013185|pmc=2496789}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=McMullan, D.|year=1988|title=Von Ardenne and the scanning electron microscope|journal= Proc Roy Microsc Soc |volume=23|pages= 283\u2013288}}</ref> Although [[Max Knoll]] produced a photo with a 50&nbsp;mm object-field-width showing channeling contrast by the use of an electron beam scanner,<ref name=\"knoll\">{{cite journal |last=Knoll |first=Max|year=1935 |title=Aufladepotentiel und Sekund\u00e4remission elektronenbestrahlter K\u00f6rper |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Technische Physik |volume=16|pages=467\u2013475}}</ref> it was [[Manfred von Ardenne]] who in 1937 invented<ref name=\"vonardenne\">von Ardenne M.

Various types of signals are produced including [[secondary electrons]] (SE), reflected or [[Backscatter|back-scattered electrons]] (BSE), characteristic X-rays and light ([[cathodoluminescence]]) (CL), absorbed current (specimen current) and transmitted electrons.  Secondary electron detectors are standard equipment in all SEMs, but it is rare for a single machine to have detectors for all other possible signals.\n\nSecondary electrons have very low energies on the order of 50 eV, which limits their mean free path in solid matter.  Consequently, SEs can only escape from the top few nanometers of the surface of a sample.  The signal from secondary electrons tends to be highly localized at the point of impact of the primary electron beam, making it possible to collect images of the sample surface with a resolution of below 1 [[Nanometre|nm]]. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the sample by [[elastic scattering]]. They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and, consequently, the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM, along with the spectra made from the characteristic X-rays, because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution, but not the identity, of different elements in the sample.  In samples predominantly composed of light elements, such as biological specimens, BSE imaging can image [[colloidal gold]] [[Immunogold labelling|immuno-labels]] of 5 or 10&nbsp;nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images.<ref name=\"Suzuki\"/> Characteristic [[X-ray]]s are emitted when the electron beam removes an [[Electron shell|inner shell electron]] from the sample, causing a [[Energy level|higher-energy electron]] to fill the shell and release energy. The energy or wavelength of these characteristic X-rays can be measured by [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] or [[Wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] and used to identify and measure the abundance of elements in the sample and map their distribution.\n\nDue to the very narrow electron beam, SEM micrographs have a large [[depth of field]] yielding a characteristic three-dimensional appearance useful for understanding the surface structure of a sample.<ref name=\"Goldsteinetal1981\" /> This is exemplified by the micrograph of pollen shown above. A wide range of magnifications is possible, from about 10 times (about equivalent to that of a powerful hand-lens) to more than 500,000 times, about 250 times the magnification limit of the best [[light microscope]]s.\n\n==Sample preparation==\n[[File:Gold Spider SEM sample.jpg|thumb|A spider sputter-coated in gold, having been prepared for viewing with an SEM]]\n[[File:Pos.tif|thumb|Low-voltage micrograph (300&nbsp;V) of distribution of adhesive droplets on a [[Post-it note]]. No conductive coating was applied: such a coating would alter this fragile specimen.]]\nSEM samples have to be small enough to fit on the specimen stage, and may need special preparation to increase their electrical conductivity and to stabilize them, so that they can withstand the high vacuum conditions and the high energy beam of electrons. Samples are generally mounted rigidly on a specimen holder or stub using a conductive adhesive. SEM is used extensively for defect analysis of semiconductor wafers, and manufacturers make instruments that can examine any part of a 300&nbsp;mm semiconductor wafer. Many instruments have chambers that can tilt an object of that size to 45\u00b0 and provide continuous 360\u00b0 rotation.\n\nNonconductive specimens collect charge when scanned by the electron beam, and especially in secondary electron imaging mode, this causes scanning faults and other image artifacts. For conventional imaging in the SEM, specimens must be [[electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]], at least at the surface, and [[ground (electricity)|electrically grounded]] to prevent the accumulation of [[static electricity|electrostatic charge]]. Metal objects require little special preparation for SEM except for cleaning and conductively mounting to a specimen stub.  Non-conducting materials are usually coated with an ultrathin coating of electrically conducting material, deposited on the sample either by low-vacuum [[sputter coating]] or by high-vacuum evaporation. Conductive materials in current use for specimen coating include [[gold]], gold/[[palladium]] alloy, [[platinum]], [[iridium]], [[tungsten]], [[chromium]], [[osmium]],<ref name=\"Suzuki\">{{cite journal |last=Suzuki |first=E. |year=2002 |title=High-resolution scanning electron microscopy of immunogold-labelled cells by the use of thin plasma coating of osmium |journal=Journal of Microscopy |volume=208 |issue=3 |pages=153\u2013157 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2818.2002.01082.x}}</ref> and [[graphite]]. Coating with heavy metals may increase signal/noise ratio for samples of low [[atomic number]] (Z). The improvement arises because secondary electron emission for high-Z materials is enhanced.\n\nAn alternative to coating for some biological samples is to increase the bulk conductivity of the material by impregnation with osmium using variants of the OTO [[staining]] method (O-[[osmium tetroxide]], T-[[thiocarbohydrazide]], O-osmium).<ref name=\"Seligman\">{{cite journal |last=Seligman |first=Arnold M. |author2=Wasserkrug, Hannah L. |author3=Hanker, Jacob S.  |year=1966 |title=A new staining method for enhancing contrast of lipid-containing membranes and droplets in osmium tetroxide-fixed tissue with osmiophilic thiocarbohydrazide (TCH) |journal=Journal of Cell Biology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=424\u2013432 |doi=10.1083/jcb.30.2.424 |pmid=4165523 |pmc=2106998}}</ref><ref name=\"Malick\">{{cite journal |last=Malick |first=Linda E. |author2=Wilson, Richard B. |author3=Stetson, David  |year=1975 |title=Modified Thiocarbohydrazide Procedure for Scanning Electron Microscopy: Routine use for Normal, Pathological, or Experimental Tissues |journal=Biotechnic & Histochemistry |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=265\u2013269 |doi=10.3109/10520297509117069}}</ref>\n\nNonconducting specimens may be imaged without coating using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation.<ref name=\"Hortol\u00e0\">{{cite journal |last=Hortol\u00e0 |first=Policarp |year=2005 |title=SEM Examination of Human Erythrocytes in Uncoated Bloodstains on Stone: Use of Conventional as Environmental-like SEM in a Soft Biological Tissue (and Hard Inorganic Material) |journal=Journal of Microscopy |volume=218 |issue=2 |pages=94\u2013103 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.2005.01477.x|pmid=15857371 }}</ref> In ESEM instruments the specimen is placed in a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately{{clarify|date=April 2019}} low at the electron gun.

The preparation method reveals the proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer.\n\n===Materials===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\n\nBack-scattered electron imaging, quantitative X-ray analysis, and X-ray mapping of specimens often requires grinding and polishing the surfaces to an ultra-smooth surface. Specimens that undergo [[Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|WDS]] or [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDS]] analysis are often carbon-coated. In general, metals are not coated prior to imaging in the SEM because they are conductive and provide their own pathway to ground.\n\n[[Fractography]] is the study of fractured surfaces that can be done on a light microscope or, commonly, on an SEM. The fractured surface is cut to a suitable size, cleaned of any organic residues, and mounted on a specimen holder for viewing in the SEM.\n\nIntegrated circuits may be cut with a [[focused ion beam]] (FIB) or other [[ion beam]] milling instrument for viewing in the SEM. The SEM in the first case may be incorporated into the FIB.{{clarify|reason=how, for what purpose?|date=February 2016}}\n\nMetals, geological specimens, and integrated circuits all may also be chemically polished for viewing in the SEM.\n\nSpecial high-resolution coating techniques are required for high-magnification imaging of inorganic thin films.\n\n==Scanning process and image formation==\n[[File:Schema MEB (en).svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of an SEM]]\n\nIn a typical SEM, an electron beam is [[thermionically]] emitted from an [[electron gun]] fitted with a tungsten filament [[cathode]]. Tungsten is normally used in thermionic electron guns because it has the highest melting point and lowest vapor pressure of all metals, thereby allowing it to be electrically heated for electron emission, and because of its low cost. Other types of electron emitters include [[lanthanum hexaboride]] ({{chem|LaB|6}}) cathodes, which can be used in a standard tungsten filament SEM if the vacuum system is upgraded or field emission guns (FEG), which may be of the [[cold-cathode]] type using tungsten single crystal emitters or the thermally assisted [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] type, that use emitters of [[zirconium oxide]].\n\nThe electron beam, which typically has an [[energy]] ranging from 0.2 [[electronvolt|keV]] to 40 keV, is focused by one or two condenser lenses to a spot about 0.4&nbsp;nm to 5&nbsp;nm in diameter. The beam passes through pairs of [[scanning coils]] or pairs of deflector plates in the electron column, typically in the final lens, which deflect the beam in the ''x'' and ''y'' axes so that it scans in a [[Raster scan|raster]] fashion over a rectangular area of the sample surface.\n\n[[File:Electron emission mechanisms.svg|thumb|Mechanisms of emission of secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, and characteristic X-rays from atoms of the sample]]\n\nWhen the primary electron beam interacts with the sample, the electrons lose energy by repeated random scattering and absorption within a teardrop-shaped volume of the specimen known as the '''interaction volume''', which extends from less than 100&nbsp;nm to approximately 5&nbsp;\u00b5m into the surface. The size of the interaction volume depends on the electron's landing energy, the atomic number of the specimen and the specimen's density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample results in the reflection of high-energy electrons by elastic scattering, emission of secondary electrons by [[inelastic scattering]] and the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]], each of which can be detected by specialized detectors. The beam current absorbed by the specimen can also be detected and used to create images of the distribution of specimen current. [[Electronics|Electronic amplifiers]] of various types are used to amplify the signals, which are displayed as variations in brightness on a computer monitor (or, for vintage models, on a [[cathode ray tube]]). Each pixel of computer video memory is synchronized with the position of the beam on the specimen in the microscope, and the resulting image is, therefore, a distribution map of the intensity of the signal being emitted from the scanned area of the specimen. Older microscopes captured images on film, but most modern instrument collect [[digital images]].\n\n[[File:LT-SEM snow crystal magnification series-3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Low-temperature SEM magnification series for a [[snow]] crystal. The crystals are captured, stored, and sputter-coated with platinum at cryogenic temperatures for imaging.]]\n\n===Magnification===\nMagnification in an SEM can be controlled over a range of about 6 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] from about 10 to 3,000,000 times<ref>[https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/eu/product_detail/?pn=em-su9000&version=#productSub-1 Ultra-high Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope SU9000]</ref>. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not a function of the power of the [[objective (optics)|objective lens]]. SEMs may have [[condenser (microscope)|condenser]] and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, a SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in [[scanning probe microscopy]], magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.\n\n==Detection of secondary electrons==\nThe most common imaging mode collects low-energy (<50 eV) secondary electrons that are ejected from conduction or valence bands of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate from within a few [[nanometer]]s below the sample surface.<ref name=\"Goldsteinetal1981\" /> The electrons are detected by an [[Everhart-Thornley detector]],<ref name=\"EverhartThornley\">{{cite journal |last=Everhart |first=T. E. |author2=Thornley, R. F.

The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the specimen chamber. The amplified electrical [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue [[video]] display, or subjected to [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital conversion]] and displayed and saved as a [[digital image]]. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the [[sensor|detector]]. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform about the axis of the beam and a certain number of electrons \"escape\" from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the \"escape\" distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance. Using the signal of secondary electrons [[image resolution]] less than 0.5&nbsp;nm is possible.\n\n==Detection of backscattered electrons==\n[[File:SEM SE vs BE Zr Al.png|thumb|Comparison of SEM techniques: <br />Top: backscattered electron analysis{{snd}} composition <br /> Bottom: secondary electron analysis{{snd}} topography]]\n\nBackscattered electrons (BSE) consist of high-energy electrons originating in the electron beam, that are reflected or back-scattered out of the specimen interaction volume by elastic scattering interactions with specimen atoms. Since heavy elements (high atomic number) backscatter electrons more strongly than light elements (low atomic number), and thus appear brighter in the image, BSEs are used to detect contrast between areas with different chemical compositions.<ref name=\"Goldsteinetal1981\">{{cite book |title=Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray microanalysis |last=Goldstein |first=G. I. |author2=Newbury, D. E. |author3=Echlin, P. |author4=Joy, D. C. |author5=Fiori, C. |author6= Lifshin, E. |year=1981 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-306-40768-0}}</ref> The Everhart-Thornley detector, which is normally positioned to one side of the specimen, is inefficient for the detection of backscattered electrons because few such electrons are emitted in the solid angle subtended by the detector, and because the positively biased detection grid has little ability to attract the higher energy BSE. Dedicated backscattered electron detectors are positioned above the sample in a \"doughnut\" type arrangement, concentric with the electron beam, maximizing the solid angle of collection. BSE detectors are usually either of scintillator or of semiconductor types. When all parts of the detector are used to collect electrons symmetrically about the beam, atomic number contrast is produced. However, strong topographic contrast is produced by collecting back-scattered electrons from one side above the specimen using an asymmetrical, directional BSE detector; the resulting contrast appears as illumination of the topography from that side. Semiconductor detectors can be made in radial segments that can be switched in or out to control the type of contrast produced and its directionality.\n\nBackscattered electrons can also be used to form an [[electron backscatter diffraction]] ([[EBSD]]) image that can be used to determine the crystallographic structure of the specimen.\n\n==Beam-injection analysis of semiconductors==\nThe nature of the SEM's probe, energetic electrons, makes it uniquely suited to examining the optical and electronic properties of semiconductor materials. The high-energy electrons from the SEM beam will inject [[charge carrier]]s into the semiconductor. Thus, beam electrons lose energy by promoting electrons from the [[valence band]] into the [[conduction band]], leaving behind [[electron hole|holes]].\n\nIn a [[direct bandgap]] material, recombination of these electron-hole pairs will result in cathodoluminescence; if the sample contains an internal electric field, such as is present at a [[p-n junction]], the SEM beam injection of carriers will cause [[electron beam induced current]] (EBIC) to flow.  Cathodoluminescence and EBIC are referred to as \"beam-injection\" techniques, and are very powerful probes of the optoelectronic behavior of semiconductors, in particular for studying nanoscale features and defects.\n\n==Cathodoluminescence==\n[[File:InGaN_crystal_SEM%2BCL.png|thumb|Color cathodoluminescence overlay on SEM image of an [[InGaN]] polycrystal. The blue and green channels represent real colors, the red channel corresponds to UV emission.]]\n\n[[Cathodoluminescence]], the emission of light when atoms excited by high-energy electrons return to their ground state, is analogous to [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-induced [[fluorescence]], and some materials such as zinc sulfide and some fluorescent dyes, exhibit both phenomena. Over the last decades, cathodoluminescence was most commonly experienced as the light emission from the inner surface of the [[cathode ray tube]] in television sets and computer CRT monitors. In the SEM, CL detectors either collect all light emitted by the specimen or can analyse the wavelengths emitted by the specimen and display an emission [[spectrum]] or an image of the distribution of cathodoluminescence emitted by the specimen in real color.\n\n==X-ray microanalysis==\n[[Characteristic X-ray]]s that are produced by the interaction of [[electrons]] with the sample may also be detected in an SEM equipped for [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] or [[wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]]. Analysis of the x-ray signals may be used to map the distribution and estimate the abundance of elements in the sample.\n\n==Resolution of the SEM==\n[[File:SEM Zoom.ogv|thumb|right|300px|A video illustrating a typical practical magnification range of a scanning electron microscope designed for biological specimens. The video starts at 25x, about 6 mm across the whole field of view, and zooms in to 12000\u00d7, about 12&nbsp;[[\u03bcm]] across the whole field of view. The spherical objects are glass beads with a diameter of 10&nbsp;\u03bcm, similar in diameter to a [[red blood cell]].]]\nSEM is not a [[camera]] and the detector is not continuously image-forming like a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] array or [[Photographic film|film]]. Unlike in an optical system, the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] is not limited by the [[diffraction limit]], fineness of lenses or mirrors or detector array resolution. The focusing optics can be large and coarse, and the SE detector is fist-sized and simply detects current. Instead, the spatial resolution of the SEM depends on the size of the electron spot, which in turn depends on both the wavelength of the electrons and the electron-optical system that produces the scanning beam. The resolution is also limited by the size of the interaction volume, the volume of specimen material that interacts with the electron beam. The spot size and the interaction volume are both large compared to the distances between atoms, so the resolution of the SEM is not high enough to image individual atoms, as is possible with [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM). The SEM has compensating advantages, though, including the ability to image a comparatively large area of the specimen; the ability to image bulk materials (not just thin films or foils); and the variety of analytical modes available for measuring the composition and properties of the specimen. Depending on the instrument, the resolution can fall somewhere between less than 1&nbsp;nm and 20&nbsp;nm. As of 2009, The world's highest resolution conventional (\u226430&nbsp;kV) SEM can reach a point resolution of 0.4&nbsp;nm using a secondary electron detector.<ref>[http://www.nanotech-now.com/news.cgi?story_id=42612 Hitachi Launches World\u2019s Highest Resolution FE-SEM]. ''Nanotech Now''. 31 May 2011.</ref>\n\n==Environmental SEM==\n{{Main|Environmental scanning electron microscope}}\nConventional SEM requires samples to be imaged under [[vacuum]], because a gas atmosphere rapidly spreads and [[attenuation|attenuates]] electron beams. As a consequence, samples that produce a significant amount of [[vapour pressure|vapour]], e.g. wet biological samples or oil-bearing rock, must be either dried or cryogenically frozen. Processes involving [[phase transition]]s, such as the drying of [[adhesive]]s or melting of [[alloy]]s, liquid transport, chemical reactions, and solid-air-gas systems, in general cannot be observed with conventional high-vacuum SEM. In environmental SEM (ESEM), the chamber is evacuated of air, but water vapor is retained near its saturation pressure, and the residual pressure remains relatively high. This allows the analysis of samples containing water or other volatile substances. With ESEM, observations of living insects have been possible.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Takaku |first1=Yasuharu |last2=Suzuki |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Ohta |first3=Isao |last4=Tsutsui |first4=Takami |last5=Matsumoto |first5=Haruko |last6=Shimomura |first6=Masatsugu |last7=Hariyama |first7=Takahiko |date=7 March 2015 |title=A 'NanoSuit' surface shield successfully protects organisms in high vacuum: observations on living organisms in an FE-SEM |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |language=en |volume=282 |issue=1802 |pages=20142857 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2857 |issn=0962-8452 |pmc=4344158 |pmid=25631998}}</ref>\n\nThe first commercial development of the ESEM in the late 1980s<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Danilatos\n|first = G.

Uncoated [[plastics]] and [[elastomers]] can be routinely examined, as can uncoated biological samples. This is useful because coating can be difficult to reverse, may conceal small features on the surface of the sample and may reduce the value of the results obtained. X-ray analysis is difficult with a coating of a heavy metal, so carbon coatings are routinely used in conventional SEMs, but ESEM makes it possible to perform X-ray microanalysis on uncoated non-conductive specimens; however some specific for ESEM artifacts are introduced in X-ray analysis. ESEM may be the preferred for electron microscopy of unique samples from criminal or civil actions, where [[forensic analysis]] may need to be repeated by several different experts.

Optionally, the standard secondary electron image can be merged with the one or more compositional channels, so that the specimen's structure and composition can be compared.

However 3D data can be obtained using an SEM with different methods as follows.\n\n===3D SEM reconstruction from a stereo pair===\n* [[photogrammetry]] is the most metrologically accurate method to bring the third dimension to SEM images.<ref name=\"3D_Color_SEM_Microscopy_Today\"/> Contrary to photometric methods (next paragraph), photogrammetry calculates absolute heights using triangulation methods. The drawbacks are that it works only if there is a minimum texture, and it requires two images to be acquired from two different angles, which implies the use of a tilt stage. ([[Photogrammetry]] is a software operation that calculates the shift (or \"disparity\") for each pixel, between the left image and the right image of the same pair. Such disparity reflects the local height).\n\n<gallery widths=\"340px\" heights=\"220px\">\n\nFile:SEM Stereo Pair.jpg|An SEM stereo pair of [[microfossils]] of less than 1&nbsp;mm in size ([[Ostracoda]]) produced by tilting along the longitudinal axis.\n\nFile:SEM Stereo pair of micro-fossil (Juxilyocypris schwarzbachi Ostracoda).gif|From this pair of SEM images, the third dimension has been reconstructed by photogrammetry (using [[MountainsMap]] software, see next image) ; then a series of 3D representations with different angles have been made and assembled into a GIF file to produce this animation.\n\nFile:3D surface reconstruction from 2 scanning electron microscope images.gif|3D surface reconstruction of a (Ra = 3&nbsp;\u00b5m) [[Surface roughness|roughness]] calibration sample (as used to calibrate profilometers), from 2 scanning electron microscope images tilted of 15\u00b0 (top left). The calculation of the 3D model (bottom right) takes about 1.5 second<ref>Stereo SEM reconstruction using MountainsMap SEM version 7.4 on i7 2600 CPU at 3.4 GHz</ref> and the error on the Ra roughness value calculated is less than 0.5%.\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Photometric 3D SEM reconstruction from a four-quadrant detector \"shape from shading\"=== \nThis method typically uses a four-quadrant BSE detector (alternatively for one manufacturer, a 3-segment detector). The microscope produces four images of the same specimen at the same time, so no tilt of the sample is required. The method gives metrological 3D dimensions as far as the slope of the specimen remains reasonable.<ref name=\"3D_Color_SEM_Microscopy_Today\"/> Most SEM manufacturers now (2018) offer such built-in or optional four-quadrant BSE detector, together with proprietary software allowing to calculate a 3D image in real time.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Butterfield|first1=Nicholas|last2=Rowe|first2=Penny M.|last3=Stewart|first3=Emily|last4=Roesel|first4=David|last5=Neshyba|first5=Steven|title=Quantitative three-dimensional ice roughness from scanning electron microscopy|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|date=16 March 2017|volume=122|issue=5|pages=3023\u20133025|doi=10.1002/2016JD026094|ref=Butterfield2017|bibcode=2017JGRD..122.3023B}}</ref>\n \nOther approaches use more sophisticated (and sometimes GPU-intensive) methods like the [[optimal estimation]] algorithm and offer much better results<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Butterfield|first1=Nicholas|last2=Rowe|first2=Penny M.|last3=Stewart|first3=Emily|last4=Roesel|first4=David|last5=Neshyba|first5=Steven|title=Quantitative three-dimensional ice roughness from scanning electron microscopy|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|date=16 March 2017|volume=122|issue=5|pages=3025\u20133041|doi=10.1002/2016JD026094|ref=Butterfield2017|bibcode=2017JGRD..122.3023B}}</ref> at the cost of high demands on computing power.\n\nIn all instances, this approach works by integration of the slope, so vertical slopes and overhangs are ignored; for instance, if an entire sphere lies on a flat, little more than the upper hemisphere is seen emerging above the flat, resulting in wrong altitude of the sphere apex. The prominence of this effect depends on the angle of the BSE detectors with respect to the sample, but these detectors are usually situated around (and close to) the electron beam, so this effect is very common.\n\n===Photometric 3D rendering from a single SEM image===\nThis method requires an SEM image obtained in oblique low angle lighting. The grey-level is then interpreted as the slope, and the slope integrated to restore the specimen topography. This method is interesting for visual enhancement and the detection of the shape and position of objects ; however the vertical heights cannot usually be calibrated, contrary to other methods such as photogrammetry.<ref name=\"3D_Color_SEM_Microscopy_Today\"/>\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\n\nFile:FLY EYE.jpg|SEM image of a house fly compound eye surface at 450\u00d7 magnification.\n\nFile:Fly eye detail.jpg|Detail of the previous image.\n\nFile:Fly Eye 3D SEM Image with form.jpg|SEM 3D reconstruction from the previous using [[shape from shading]] algorithms.\n\nFile:Fly Eye 3D SEM Image without form.jpg|Same as the previous, but with lighting homogenized before applying the shape from shading algorithms\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Other types of 3D SEM reconstruction=== \n* inverse reconstruction using electron-material interactive models<ref>{{cite journal\n|last = Baghaei Rad\n|first = Leili\n|year = 2007\n|title = Computational Scanning Electron Microscopy\n|journal = International Conference on Frontiers of Characterization and Metrology\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last = Baghaei Rad\n|first = Leili\n|year = 2007|doi=10.1116/1.2794068\n|title = Economic approximate models for backscattered electrons\n|journal = Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology\n|volume = 25\n|last2 = Downes\n|first2 = Ian\n|last3 = Ye\n|first3 = Jun\n|last4 = Adler\n|first4 = David\n|last5 = Pease\n|first5 = R.

High-quality 2D SEM images, on the other hand, are widely available. Recently, a novel three-step, multiscale, multiresolution reconstruction method is presented that directly uses 2D images in order to develop 3D models. This method, based on a Shannon Entropy and conditional simulation, can be used for most of the available stationary materials and can build various stochastic 3D models just using a few thin sections.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tahmasebi|first1=Pejman|last2=Javadpour|first2=Farzam|last3=Sahimi|first3=Muhammad| title=Multiscale and multiresolution modeling of shales and their flow and morphological properties|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|pages=16373|doi=10.1038/srep16373|pmid=26560178|pmc=4642334|year=2015|bibcode=2015NatSR...516373T}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tahmasebi|first1=Pejman|last2=Javadpour|first2=Farzam|last3=Sahimi|first3=Muhammad| title=Three-Dimensional Stochastic Characterization of Shale SEM Images|journal=Transport in Porous Media|volume=110|issue=3|pages=521\u2013531|doi=10.1007/s11242-015-0570-1|year=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tahmasebi|first1=Pejman|last2=Sahimi|first2=Muhammad| title=Reconstruction of three-dimensional porous media using a single thin section|journal=Physical Review E|volume=85|issue=6|pages=066709|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.85.066709|pmid=23005245|year=2012|bibcode=2012PhRvE..85f6709T|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fda5fc81c4aa52b63c44643ef61c69280c00cbc5}}</ref>\n\n===Applications of 3D SEM===\nOne possible application is measuring the roughness of ice crystals.

Many Australian state governments have legislated mandatory monitoring for all gaming machines they license, to protect the integrity of the industry. Under this system, Monitoring Licences are granted to independent companies who operate computer networks connected to all gaming machines within a relevant jurisdiction. All machine activity is monitored to ensure that correct prizes are paid and taxes are calculated correctly on revenue.\n\nMaxGaming holds licences for three jurisdictions: New South Wales, Queensland and The Northern Territory.

He first discovered his love for music at the age of 10. Being raised in a household surrounded by music, Erwin initially became influenced by his father\u2019s talent on the guitar and the organ.\n\nErwin began his classical training at 11 years old and continued his instruction when he moved to the United States 2 years later in 1987. Throughout junior-high, high school and college, he studied music privately and in school, simultaneously attending the Grove School of Music in Los Angeles. After graduating in 1996 from [[California State University, Northridge|Cal State University of Northridge]] with a BA in psychology, he began his career as a professional musician.\n\n==The Major Label Era==\n\nThe past 15 years have been a blessed musical journey for Erwin. Since the mid '1990s, he has been on tour and recording in the studio with various well-known artists. He is a member of Serj Tankian\u2019s (System of a Down) solo project called Serj Tankian and the FCC. Since August 2007, the band has toured with [[Foo Fighters|The Foo Fighters]], [[Ozzy Osbourne|Ozzy Osborne]], [[Metallica]], [[R.E.M.|REM]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], and appeared on TV shows, such as [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|Jay Leno]],<ref>{{Citation|last=ahlucino bootlegs|title=(2011) Serj Tankian - NBC Studios (Stage 11) \"The Tonight Show\" [PRO#1]|date=2012-09-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dnln0JfXjE|accessdate=2016-10-23}}</ref> [[Jimmy Kimmel Live!|Jimmy Kimmel]],<ref>{{Citation|last=Ronaldo Marques|title=Serj Tankian Harakiri Legendado|date=2012-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_ZSIFAs83w|accessdate=2016-10-23}}</ref> and [[Carson Daly]]. In 2010, they began touring and collaborating with Europe's finest and most prestigious symphony orchestras. The band has performed in sold out arenas and festivals all over the world, one of which included Germany's Rock Am Ring in front of an audience of 80,000.<ref>{{Citation|last=Malakian81|title=SERJ TANKIAN live at Rock Am Ring - EMPTY WALLS|date=2009-03-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14ItHaASuUw|accessdate=2016-10-23}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2001 to 2006, Erwin was a member of the very promising band Slow Motion Reign. Signed with Columbia Records/Serjical Strike Records, the band released an album in 2004. During that time, Erwin had the opportunity to support and perform with artists such as Neal Schon of \u2018Journey\u2019, Cliff Hue of \u2018Supertramp\u2019 and Jerry Cantrell of \u2018Alice and Chains\u2019 and Ozomatli.\n\n==Sticking To His Roots==\n\nBetween the years 2001 and 2004, Erwin co-produced and arranged 2 albums \u2018Neghab\u2019 and \u2018Bi Sarzamin tar az bad\u2019 for a famous Persian artist and Composer, [[Siavash Ghomayshi|Siavash Ghomeyshi]]. With the success of these albums, along with leading the band for the live performances, Erwin earned his place as a top producer and musical director in the Persian music scene. He has worked in the studio and toured within the US, Australia, Europe and the Middle East with other artists such as [[Andranik Madadian|Andy]], [[Mansour (singer)|Mansour]], Martik, Helen, to name a few. In 2010, Erwin was part of a documentary and a compilation made in Iran called \u2018Gheseye Zirzamin\u2019 about Iran's innovative and somewhat controversial underground music. In addition, Erwin\u2019s solo project [http://www.karmandan.com Karmandan] released a full-length album in 2011 and 2018. Erwin has helped Persian music make significant strides in the contemporary arena.\n\nErwin has released his second album for KARMANDAN titled 'Gozargah'.

In addition to his solo career is a member of [[Serj Tankian]]'s solo band [[The F.C.C. (band)|The F.C.C.]] and also the creator of [https://www.karmandan.com/ Karmandan], which is focused in the Iranian music scene. As a musical director he leads the artists and bands in notable festivals globally, [http://www.eldfesten.se/ Eldfesten] in Sweden, [https://www.diasporaartsconnection.org/lethersingoverview Let Her Sing] in San Francisco, [https://www.riksteatern.se/femineast Femineast festival] in Sweden\n\n==Early life==\nErwin Khachikian was born in Tehran, Iran into an Armenian family in 1973. He first discovered his love for music at the age of 10. Being raised in a household surrounded by music, Erwin initially became influenced by his father\u2019s talent on the guitar and the organ.\n\nErwin began his classical training at 11 years old and continued his instruction when he moved to the United States 2 years later in 1987. Throughout junior-high, high school and college, he studied music privately and in school, simultaneously attending the Grove School of Music in Los Angeles. After graduating in 1996 from [[California State University, Northridge|Cal State University of Northridge]] with a BA in psychology, he began his career as a professional musician.\n\n==The Major Label Era==\n\nThe past 15 years have been a blessed musical journey for Erwin. Since the mid '90's, he has been on tour and recording in the studio with various well-known artists. He is a member of Serj Tankian\u2019s (System of a Down) solo project called Serj Tankian and the FCC. Since August 2007, the band has toured with [[Foo Fighters|The Foo Fighters]], [[Ozzy Osbourne|Ozzy Osborne]], [[Metallica]], [[R.E.M.|REM]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], and appeared on TV shows, such as [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|Jay Leno]],<ref>{{Citation|last=ahlucino bootlegs|title=(2011) Serj Tankian - NBC Studios (Stage 11) \"The Tonight Show\" [PRO#1]|date=2012-09-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dnln0JfXjE|accessdate=2016-10-23}}</ref> [[Jimmy Kimmel Live!|Jimmy Kimmel]],<ref>{{Citation|last=Ronaldo Marques|title=Serj Tankian Harakiri Legendado|date=2012-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_ZSIFAs83w|accessdate=2016-10-23}}</ref> and [[Carson Daly]]. In 2010, they began touring and collaborating with Europe's finest and most prestigious symphony orchestras. The band has performed in sold out arenas and festivals all over the world, one of which included Germany's Rock Am Ring in front of an audience of 80,000.<ref>{{Citation|last=Malakian81|title=SERJ TANKIAN live at Rock Am Ring - EMPTY WALLS|date=2009-03-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14ItHaASuUw|accessdate=2016-10-23}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2001 to 2006, Erwin was a member of the very promising band Slow Motion Reign. Signed with Columbia Records/Serjical Strike Records, the band released an album in 2004. During that time, Erwin had the opportunity to support and perform with artists such as Neal Schon of \u2018Journey\u2019, Cliff Hue of \u2018Supertramp\u2019 and Jerry Cantrell of \u2018Alice and Chains\u2019 and Ozomatli.\n\n==Sticking To His Roots==\n\nBetween the years 2001 and 2004, Erwin co-produced and arranged 2 albums \u2018Neghab\u2019 and \u2018Bi Sarzamin tar az bad\u2019 for a famous Persian artist and Composer, [[Siavash Ghomayshi|Siavash Ghomeyshi]]. With the success of these albums, along with leading the band for the live performances, Erwin earned his place as a top producer and musical director in the Persian music scene. He has worked in the studio and toured within the US, Australia, Europe and the Middle East with other artists such as [[Andranik Madadian|Andy]], [[Mansour (singer)|Mansour]], Martik, Helen, to name a few. In 2010, Erwin was part of a documentary and a compilation made in Iran called \u2018Gheseye Zirzamin\u2019 about Iran's innovative and somewhat controversial underground music. In addition, Erwin\u2019s solo project [http://www.karmandan.com Karmandan] released a full-length album in 2011 and 2018. Erwin has helped Persian music make significant strides in the contemporary arena.\n\nErwin has released his second album for KARMANDAN titled 'Gozargah'. The album produced by Erwin Khachikian and Nicolas Nami is a combination of lyrics written by Yaghma Golrouee, Omid Oliae and Abbas Sadeghi.\n\nCurrently Erwin is producing other acts such as Niaz Nawab, as well as festivals around the globe like 'Let Her Sing' for the 3rd year that is being held in San Francisco.\n\n==The Man Behind the Mission==\n\nIt is Erwin's musical versatility coupled with his intense passion that has made him a unsurpassed musician, manager and producer.
