The park is primarily an interpretive effort, telling the story of mid-19th-century army life and providing insights into the lifeways of local Native Americans. Five original buildings are still standing at the fort: the commander's house, three captain's houses, and a blockhouse. Various other buildings have been recreated to appear original. Houses are filled with period furnishings. The park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\nThe interpretive center, the original commander's house and two officer's buildings with period furnishings open to the public from April through September on Wednesday through Sunday.  The original blockhouse and other recreated fort buildings are not open to the public.  Special re-enactments and living history events are held during the year, as well as other special events.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{stack|{{Commons category|Fort Simcoe}}}}\n*[http://parks.state.wa.us/509/Fort-Simcoe Fort Simcoe Historical State Park] Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission\n*[http://parks.state.wa.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1871 Fort Simcoe Historical State Park Map] Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission\n*[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=washington--yakima+county--simcoe&co=hh&st=gallery Photos of Fort Simcoe] Library of Congress Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record/Historic American Landscapes Survey\n\n{{Protected Areas of Washington}}\n{{Registered Historic Places}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Forts in Washington (state)|Simcoe]]\n[[Category:State parks of Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Museums in Yakima County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Military and war museums in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Native American museums in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Parks in Yakima County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Yakima County, Washington]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Yakima County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Forts on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington (state)|Simcoe]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox protected area\n| name            = Fort Simcoe Historical State Park\n| iucn_category   = \n| iucn_ref        = \n<!-- images -->\n| photo           = East_(front)_elevation_of_commandant%27s_house_-_Fort_Simcoe,_Commandant%27s_House_and_Blockhouse,_Fort_Simcoe_Road,_White_Swan,_Yakima_County,_WA_HABS_WASH,39-WHIT.V,1-6.tif\n| photo_caption   = Commandant's House\n<!-- map -->\n| map             = USA Washington\n| map_image       = \n| map_size        = \n| map_caption     = Location in the state of Washington\n| relief          = 1\n<!-- location -->\n| location        = [[Yakima County, Washington|Yakima]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States\n| nearest_city    = \n| nearest_town    = \n| coordinates     = {{coord|46|20|34|N|120|50|13|W|display=inline,title}}\n| coords_ref      = \n<!-- stats --> \n| length          = \n| length_mi       = \n| length_km       = \n| width           = \n| width_mi        = \n| width_km        = \n| area_acre       = 200\n| area_ref        = \n| elevation       = {{convert|1401|ft|m|abbr=on}}<ref name=gnis>{{cite gnis|1513925|Fort Simcoe State Park}}</ref>\n| elevation_avg   = \n| elevation_min   = \n| elevation_max   = \n| dimensions      = \n| designation     = \n<!-- dates & info -->\n| authorized      = \n| created         = \n| designated      = \n| established     = 1856-1859<ref name=nomination>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=74001994}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Fort Simcoe State Park |author=Douglas M.

The park is primarily an interpretive effort, telling the story of mid-19th-century army life and providing insights into the lifeways of local Native Americans. Five original buildings are still standing at the fort: the commander's house, three captain's houses, and a blockhouse. Various other buildings have been recreated to appear original. Houses are filled with period furnishings. The park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\nThe interpretive center, the original commander's house and two officer's buildings with period furnishings open to the public from April through September on Wednesday through Sunday.  The original blockhouse and other recreated fort buildings are not open to the public.  Special re-enactments and living history events are held during the year, as well as other special events.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{stack|{{Commons category|Fort Simcoe}}}}\n*[http://parks.state.wa.us/509/Fort-Simcoe Fort Simcoe Historical State Park] Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission\n*[http://parks.state.wa.us/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1871 Fort Simcoe Historical State Park Map] Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission\n*[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=washington--yakima+county--simcoe&co=hh&st=gallery Photos of Fort Simcoe] Library of Congress Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record/Historic American Landscapes Survey\n\n{{Protected Areas of Washington}}\n{{Registered Historic Places}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Forts in Washington (state)|Simcoe]]\n[[Category:State parks of Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Museums in Yakima County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Military and war museums in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Native American museums in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Parks in Yakima County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Yakima County, Washington]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Yakima County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Forts on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington (state)|Simcoe]]\n", "name_user": "Writhing", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:\"school for 'prehistoric'??? tribes?", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Simcoe"}

The single, first released in the UK in early 1979, was bolstered by a music video (directed by [[Brian Grant (director)|Brian Grant]]) that was well received by critics. The clip featured Scott as a DJ singing into a microphone from behind an exaggerated turntable setup, at times flanked by two female models who sang and danced in a robotic manner. The video also featured Brigit Novik, Scott's partner at the time, who provided the backup vocals for the track.<ref>{{cite episode|title= 1970s |series= Defining Decades |airdate= 17 April 2015 |network= [[Vintage TV (TV channel)|Vintage TV]]}}</ref>\n\nThe single's B-side, \"M Factor\", was featured in two different versions. The original cut appeared on the first UK and European releases of the single, while a slightly remixed version appeared on the single released in the United States and Canada. The song reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the Australian [[ARIA]] Singles Chart, and number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\n==Concept and chart performance==\nThe song was initially recorded in R&B and funk styles before a friend of Scott suggested using synthesisers.<ref>{{cite episode|series= One-Hit Wonders at the BBC |network= [[BBC Four]] |airdate= 17 April 2015}}</ref> He describes the genesis of \"Pop Muzik\":\n<blockquote>\nI was looking to make a fusion of various styles which somehow would summarise the last 25 years of pop music. It was a deliberate point I was trying to make. Whereas rock and roll had created a generation gap, disco was bringing people together on an enormous scale. That's why I really wanted to make a simple, bland statement, which was, 'All we're talking about basically (is) pop music.'<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|first= Fred |last= Bronson |title= \"Pop Muzik\" \u2013 M |year= 1988 |edition= 4th |work= The Billboard Book of Number One Hits |url= https://archive.org/details/billboardbookofn00fred |publisher= Super Seventies |isbn= 0-8230-7641-5 |accessdate= 23 July 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe single was released in the UK first, peaking at number two on 12 May 1979,<ref name=\"Bronson\"/> unable to break [[Art Garfunkel]]'s 6-week stint at number one with \"[[Bright Eyes (Art Garfunkel song)|Bright Eyes]]\". In August of that same year, it was released in North America, where it eventually climbed all the way to number one in Canada on 27 October<ref name=\"CAN\"/> and in the US on 3 November.\n\nAlong with Scott, other musicians who played on the track were his brother Julian Scott (on bass), then unknown keyboardist [[Wally Badarou]], Canadian synthesiser programmer John Lewis, drummer [[Phil Gould (musician)|Phil Gould]] (who later became one of the founding members of the group [[Level 42]]), [[Gary Barnacle]] and Brigit Novik, the backing vocalist, credited as \"Brigit Vinchon\" on the records and sleeves.\n\nThe image of the baby on \"Pop Muzik\"'s single disc pictures Robin Scott's daughter, named Berenice, who is now a singer and piano/keyboard player and composer and involved with her father's friend Phil Gould and Wally Badarou projects.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Album==\nThe subsequent full-length album ''[[New York - London - Paris - Munich|New York \u00b7 London \u00b7 Paris \u00b7 Munich]]'' was recorded in [[Montreux]], Switzerland, at [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s Mountain Studio, with lead singer and guitarist Robin Scott and regular engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]], as well as Julian Scott, [[Wally Badarou]] and Brigit Novik.\n\nAdditional musicians on the album included drummer [[Phil Gould (musician)|Phil Gould]], [[Gary Barnacle]] on saxophone and flute, and [[David Bowie]] (a friend of Scott and a resident of Montreux at the time) who provided occasional handclaps.\n\nThe album was also released in the United States on [[Sire Records]] with a different track listing but it was not commercially successful, compared to the album's success in Europe.\n\n==Other formats==\nThe UK [[12-inch single]] version was notable for the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]] having a double groove such that the two tracks (\"Pop Muzik\" and \"M Factor\") both started at the outer edge of the record and finished in the middle (with a long silence at the end of \"M Factor\" since the track was the shorter of the two). This resulted in a random selection of the two tracks, depending on which groove the needle landed in the lead-in. To further market this idea, the UK record sleeve stated \"B side included on A side, full length disco mix of Pop Musik on Seaside\". 'Seaside' (in other words \"C side\") was a simple play on words as the letter C, apart from being the logical next \"side\" after the A and B sides, is pronounced the same way as the English word \"sea\".\n\nThe song was remixed and re-released in 1989 where it reached number 15 in the [[UK Singles Charts]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Official Singles Chart Top 100: 02 July 1989 \u2013 08 July 1989 |publisher= [[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate= 7 March 2017 |url= http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19890702/7501/}}</ref>\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1979\u20131980)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.worldcharts.co.uk/chartfeatures/aus/aus70.htm |title= Australia No. 1 hits -- 1970's |website= World Charts |accessdate= 10 June 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140424142031/http://www.worldcharts.co.uk/chartfeatures/aus/aus70.htm |archivedate= 24 April 2014}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|2|artist=M|song=Pop Muzik|accessdate=23 July 2013}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|3|artist=M|song=Pop Muzik|accessdate=23 July 2013}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|19|chartid=6874|accessdate=12 May 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadadance|1|chartid=7883|accessdate=12 May 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|1|chartid=9459a|accessdate=12 May 2015|refname=\"CAN\"}}\n|-\n|Denmark ([[IFPI Denmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite journal|title= Billboard \u2013 Hits Of The World |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 27 October 1979 |page= 80 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xyQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT95&dq=%22denmark%22 |volume= 91 |issue= 43 |id= '''See last week peak position''' |issn= 0006-2510}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite web|url= http://musicseek.info/no1hits/1979.htm |title= MusicSeek.info \u2013 UK, Eurochart, Billboard & Cashbox No.1 Hits |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060614052056/http://musicseek.info/no1hits/1979.htm |archivedate= 14 June 2006}}.

The single, first released in the UK in early 1979, was bolstered by a music video (directed by [[Brian Grant (director)|Brian Grant]]) that was well received by critics. The clip featured Scott as a DJ singing into a microphone from behind an exaggerated turntable setup, at times flanked by two female models who sang and danced in a robotic manner. The video also featured Brigit Novik, Scott's partner at the time, who provided the backup vocals for the track.<ref>{{cite episode|title= 1970s |series= Defining Decades |airdate= 17 April 2015 |network= [[Vintage TV (TV channel)|Vintage TV]]}}</ref>\n\nThe single's B-side, \"M Factor\", was featured in two different versions. The original cut appeared on the first UK and European releases of the single, while a slightly remixed version appeared on the single released in the United States and Canada. The song reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the Australian [[ARIA]] Singles Chart, and number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\n==Concept and chart performance==\nThe song was initially recorded in R&B and funk styles before a friend of Scott suggested using synthesisers.<ref>{{cite episode|series= One-Hit Wonders at the BBC |network= [[BBC Four]] |airdate= 17 April 2015}}</ref> He describes the genesis of \"Pop Muzik\":\n<blockquote>\nI was looking to make a fusion of various styles which somehow would summarise the last 25 years of pop music. It was a deliberate point I was trying to make. Whereas rock and roll had created a generation gap, disco was bringing people together on an enormous scale. That's why I really wanted to make a simple, bland statement, which was, 'All we're talking about basically (is) pop music.'<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|first= Fred |last= Bronson |title= \"Pop Muzik\" \u2013 M |year= 1988 |edition= 4th |work= The Billboard Book of Number One Hits |url= https://archive.org/details/billboardbookofn00fred |publisher= Super Seventies |isbn= 0-8230-7641-5 |accessdate= 23 July 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe single was released in the UK first, peaking at number two on 12 May 1979,<ref name=\"Bronson\"/> unable to break [[Art Garfunkel]]'s 6-week stint at number one with \"[[Bright Eyes (Art Garfunkel song)|Bright Eyes]]\". In August of that same year, it was released in North America, where it eventually climbed all the way to number one in Canada on 27 October<ref name=\"CAN\"/> and in the US on 3 November.\n\nAlong with Scott, other musicians who played on the track were his brother Julian Scott (on bass), then unknown keyboardist [[Wally Badarou]], Canadian synthesiser programmer John Lewis, drummer [[Phil Gould (musician)|Phil Gould]] (who later became one of the founding members of the group [[Level 42]]), [[Gary Barnacle]] and Brigit Novik, the backing vocalist, credited as \"Brigit Vinchon\" on the records and sleeves.\n\nThe image of the baby on \"Pop Muzik\"'s single disc pictures Robin Scott's daughter, named Berenice, who is now a singer and piano/keyboard player and composer and involved with her father's friend Phil Gould and Wally Badarou projects.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Album==\nThe subsequent full-length album ''[[New York - London - Paris - Munich|New York \u00b7 London \u00b7 Paris \u00b7 Munich]]'' was recorded in [[Montreux]], Switzerland, at [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s Mountain Studio, with lead singer and guitarist Robin Scott and regular engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]], as well as Julian Scott, [[Wally Badarou]] and Brigit Novik.\n\nAdditional musicians on the album included drummer [[Phil Gould (musician)|Phil Gould]], [[Gary Barnacle]] on saxophone and flute, and [[David Bowie]] (a friend of Scott and a resident of Montreux at the time) who provided occasional handclaps.\n\nThe album was also released in the United States on [[Sire Records]] with a different track listing but it was not commercially successful, compared to the album's success in Europe.\n\n==Other formats==\nThe UK [[12-inch single]] version was notable for the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]] having a double groove such that the two tracks (\"Pop Muzik\" and \"M Factor\") both started at the outer edge of the record and finished in the middle (with a long silence at the end of \"M Factor\" since the track was the shorter of the two). This resulted in a random selection of the two tracks, depending on which groove the needle landed in the lead-in. To further market this idea, the UK record sleeve stated \"B side included on A side, full length disco mix of Pop Musik on Seaside\". 'Seaside' (in other words \"C side\") was a simple play on words as the letter C, apart from being the logical next \"side\" after the A and B sides, is pronounced the same way as the English word \"sea\".\n\nThe song was remixed and re-released in 1989 where it reached number 15 in the [[UK Singles Charts]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Official Singles Chart Top 100: 02 July 1989 \u2013 08 July 1989 |publisher= [[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate= 7 March 2017 |url= http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19890702/7501/}}</ref>\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1979\u20131980)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.worldcharts.co.uk/chartfeatures/aus/aus70.htm |title= Australia No. 1 hits -- 1970's |website= World Charts |accessdate= 10 June 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140424142031/http://www.worldcharts.co.uk/chartfeatures/aus/aus70.htm |archivedate= 24 April 2014}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|2|artist=M|song=Pop Muzik|accessdate=23 July 2013}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|3|artist=M|song=Pop Muzik|accessdate=23 July 2013}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|19|chartid=6874|accessdate=12 May 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadadance|1|chartid=7883|accessdate=12 May 2015}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|1|chartid=9459a|accessdate=12 May 2015|refname=\"CAN\"}}\n|-\n|Denmark ([[IFPI Denmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite journal|title= Billboard \u2013 Hits Of The World |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 27 October 1979 |page= 80 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xyQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT95&dq=%22denmark%22 |volume= 91 |issue= 43 |id= '''See last week peak position''' |issn= 0006-2510}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite web|url= http://musicseek.info/no1hits/1979.htm |title= MusicSeek.info \u2013 UK, Eurochart, Billboard & Cashbox No.1 Hits |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060614052056/http://musicseek.info/no1hits/1979.htm |archivedate= 14 June 2006}}.

Born in [[Sunderland]], England, Wight lived in Glasgow during his childhood and teenage years. After graduating from [[Glasgow Veterinary College]] in 1939, Wight moved back to England and was a veterinarian in the [[Yorkshire Dales]] for almost fifty years. He used this experience to write a series of eight books set in 1930s\u20131950s England about animals and their owners. He is best known for these semi-autobiographical works, which began with ''If Only They Could Talk'', published in 1970.\n\nThere have been multiple television and film adaptions of Wight's books, including the 1975 film ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (film)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' and the [[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|BBC television series of the same name]], which ran for a total of 90 episodes.\n\n==Personal life==\nJames Alfred Wight was born on 3 October 1916 in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[County Durham]], England to James (1890\u20131960) and Hannah Bell (1890\u20131980) Wight.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/james-herriot-9336867 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226215236/http://www.biography.com/people/james-herriot-9336867 |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 February 2012 |title=James Herriot Biography |website=Biography.com |accessdate=5 December 2015 }}</ref> Shortly after their wedding, the Wights moved from Brandling Street, Sunderland, to [[Glasgow]], Scotland, where James took work as a ship plater and as a pianist for a local cinema, while Hannah was a singer and a dressmaker.<ref name=\"memoir\">Wight, Jim. 2000.

He later wrote that \"I was intrigued by the character and behaviour of these animals... [I wanted to] spend my life working with them if possible.\"  At age twelve, he read an article in ''[[Meccano Magazine]]'' about veterinarians, and was captivated with the idea of treating sick animals as a career. Two years later, in 1930, he decided to become a veterinarian after the principal of [[Glasgow Veterinary College]] gave a lecture at his high school.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herriot |first1=James |title=James Herriot's Dog Stories |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-92558-1 |pages=xi\u2013xii}}</ref> Wight studied for six years at Glasgow Veterinary College, and qualified as a veterinary surgeon in December 1939 at age 23.<ref name=\"tti\"/>\n\nWight's first position, which he accepted in January 1940, was at a veterinary practice in Sunderland. He moved to work in a rural practice the following July, based at 23 Kirkgate in [[Thirsk]], Yorkshire, near the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and [[North York Moors]]. The practice owner, [[Donald Sinclair (veterinarian)|Donald Sinclair]], had enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and needed someone to look after the practice while he was away. He offered Wight a salaried partnership in the practice, which was an excellent position at that time for a young veterinarian with little experience. Wight married Joan Catherine Anderson Danbury on 5 November 1941 at [[St Mary's Church, Thirsk]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Herriot|first1=James|title=All Things Bright and Beautiful|date=1973|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York}}</ref> They had two children: James Alexander (born 13 February 1943), who also became a veterinarian and was a partner in the practice, and Rosemary (born 1947), who became a doctor. \n\n[[File:Herriot sign 9667.jpg|thumb|upright|Wight's original practice at 23 Kirkgate, Thirsk]]\n\n[[File:James-Herriot-Surgery-Exterior-GCR 7884.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Herriot's former surgery|Wight's former surgery at 23 Kirkgate, [[Thirsk]]]]\n\nWight enlisted in the RAF in November 1942. He did well in his training, and was one of the first men in his regiment to fly solo. After undergoing surgery on an [[anal fistula]] in July 1943, he was deemed unfit to fly combat aircraft and was discharged as a [[leading aircraftman]]. He joined his wife at her parents' house, where she had lived since he left Thirsk. They lived there until the summer of 1945, when they moved back to 23 Kirkgate after Sinclair and his wife moved to another location. In May 1949, Wight obtained a full partnership with Sinclair.{{r|memoir|p=162}} In 1953, the family moved to a house on Topcliffe Road, Thirsk, opposite the secondary school.

At that time, books written by veterinary surgeons were considered advertisements of their services, so Wight took \"James Herriot\" as his pen name after seeing Scottish goalkeeper [[Jim Herriot]] play for [[Birmingham City F.C.]] in a televised game against [[Manchester United F.C.]]. ''If Only They Could Talk'' was published in the United Kingdom in 1970 by [[Michael Joseph Ltd]], but sales were slow until [[Thomas McCormack (writer)|Thomas McCormack]] of [[St. Martin's Press]] in New York City received a copy and arranged to have the first two books published as a single volume in the United States. Wight named the volume ''All Creatures Great and Small'' from the second line of the hymn \"[[All Things Bright and Beautiful]]\".{{r|memoir|p=271}} The resulting book was a huge success, spawning numerous sequels and movies and a television adaptation. \n\nWight's books are partially autobiographical, with many of the stories loosely based on real events or people. The stories are set in the fictional town of [[Darrowby]], which is a composite of Thirsk and its nearby market towns [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]], [[Leyburn]], and [[Middleham]].<ref>''James Herriot's Yorkshire'' (1979), James Herriot, St. Martin's</ref> Wight renamed Donald Sinclair and his brother [[Brian Sinclair (veterinary surgeon)|Brian]] as Siegfried and Tristan Farnon respectively, and used the name \"Helen Alderson\" for his wife Joan Danbury.  Wight's son James stated in his memoir that many of the stories which are set in the 1930s\u20131950s in the books were inspired by cases that Wight attended in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"memoir\" /> \n\nThe books also document a transitional period in Britain's veterinary profession. Agriculture was moving from the use of draught animals (primarily horses) to the use of mechanical tractors, and medical science was on the verge of discovering antibiotics and other drugs that eliminated many of the ancient remedies still in use. These and other sociological factors (such as increased affluence) prompted a large-scale shift in veterinary practice over the course of the 20th century. At the beginning of the century, virtually all of a veterinarian's time was spent working with large animals such as horses, cattle and other livestock. By 2000, the majority of vets practised mostly on dogs, cats, and other pets belonging to a population having a larger disposable income. Wight (as Herriot) occasionally steps out of his narrative to comment on the primitive state of veterinary medicine at the time of the story he is relating.<ref name=\"thelordgodmadethemall:caesarian\">{{cite book|last1=Herriot|first1=James|title=The Lord God Made Them All|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=62\u201376}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''If Only They Could Talk'', Wight wrote seven more books. In the United States, the first six books of the original series were thought too short to publish independently and were collected into omnibus volumes: the final two books were published separately. The last book of the series, ''Every Living Thing'', immediately went into the top 10 best-seller list in Britain and had an 865,000 copy first edition printing in the United States.<ref name=\"But it did happen to a vet\">Margolis, Jonathan (12 December 2002 ''Time Magazine''{{Failed verification|date=March 2012}}<!--no such issue date, no such title in the magazine's online article index--></ref> \n\n[[File:AllCreaturesGreatAndSmallSet-1-GCR 7908.JPG|thumb|Part of the [[BBC]] TV set for ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' on permanent display at the [[World of James Herriot]] museum in Thirsk, North Yorkshire]]\n\n==Film and television adaptions==\nWight's books have been adapted for film and television, including the 1975 film ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (film)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' followed by ''[[It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet]]'' in 1976, and the long-running [[BBC]] television series ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]''.

Born in [[Sunderland]], England, Wight lived in Glasgow during his childhood and teenage years. After graduating from [[Glasgow Veterinary College]] in 1939, Wight moved back to England and was a veterinarian in the [[Yorkshire Dales]] for almost fifty years. He used this experience to write a series of eight books set in 1930s\u20131950s England about animals and their owners. He is best known for these semi-autobiographical works, which began with ''If Only They Could Talk'', published in 1970.\n\nThere have been multiple television and film adaptions of Wight's books, including the 1975 film ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (film)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' and the [[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|BBC television series of the same name]], which ran for a total of 90 episodes.\n\n==Personal life==\nJames Alfred Wight was born on 3 October 1916 in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[County Durham]], England to James (1890\u20131960) and Hannah Bell (1890\u20131980) Wight.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/james-herriot-9336867 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226215236/http://www.biography.com/people/james-herriot-9336867 |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 February 2012 |title=James Herriot Biography |website=Biography.com |accessdate=5 December 2015 }}</ref> Shortly after their wedding, the Wights moved from Brandling Street, Sunderland, to [[Glasgow]], Scotland, where James took work as a ship plater and as a pianist for a local cinema, while Hannah was a singer and a dressmaker.<ref name=\"memoir\">Wight, Jim. 2000.

He later wrote that \"I was intrigued by the character and behaviour of these animals... [I wanted to] spend my life working with them if possible.\"  At age twelve, he read an article in ''[[Meccano Magazine]]'' about veterinarians, and was captivated with the idea of treating sick animals as a career. Two years later, in 1930, he decided to become a veterinarian after the principal of [[Glasgow Veterinary College]] gave a lecture at his high school.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herriot |first1=James |title=James Herriot's Dog Stories |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-92558-1 |pages=xi\u2013xii}}</ref> Wight studied for six years at Glasgow Veterinary College, and qualified as a veterinary surgeon in December 1939 at age 23.<ref name=\"tti\"/>\n\nWight's first position, which he accepted in January 1940, was at a veterinary practice in Sunderland. He moved to work in a rural practice the following July, based at 23 Kirkgate in [[Thirsk]], Yorkshire, near the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and [[North York Moors]]. The practice owner, [[Donald Sinclair (veterinarian)|Donald Sinclair]], had enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and needed someone to look after the practice while he was away. He offered Wight a salaried partnership in the practice, which was an excellent position at that time for a young veterinarian with little experience. Wight married Joan Catherine Anderson Danbury on 5 November 1941 at [[St Mary's Church, Thirsk]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Herriot|first1=James|title=All Things Bright and Beautiful|date=1973|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York}}</ref> They had two children: James Alexander (born 13 February 1943), who also became a veterinarian and was a partner in the practice, and Rosemary (born 1947), who became a doctor. \n\n[[File:Herriot sign 9667.jpg|thumb|upright|Wight's original practice at 23 Kirkgate, Thirsk]]\n\n[[File:James-Herriot-Surgery-Exterior-GCR 7884.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Herriot's former surgery|Wight's former surgery at 23 Kirkgate, [[Thirsk]]]]\n\nWight enlisted in the RAF in November 1942. He did well in his training, and was one of the first men in his regiment to fly solo. After undergoing surgery on an [[anal fistula]] in July 1943, he was deemed unfit to fly combat aircraft and was discharged as a [[leading aircraftman]]. He joined his wife at her parents' house, where she had lived since he left Thirsk. They lived there until the summer of 1945, when they moved back to 23 Kirkgate after Sinclair and his wife moved to another location. In May 1949, Wight obtained a full partnership with Sinclair.{{r|memoir|p=162}} In 1953, the family moved to a house on Topcliffe Road, Thirsk, opposite the secondary school.

At that time, books written by veterinary surgeons were considered advertisements of their services, so Wight took \"James Herriot\" as his pen name after seeing Scottish goalkeeper [[Jim Herriot]] play for [[Birmingham City F.C.]] in a televised game against [[Manchester United F.C.]]. ''If Only They Could Talk'' was published in the United Kingdom in 1970 by [[Michael Joseph Ltd]], but sales were slow until [[Thomas McCormack (writer)|Thomas McCormack]] of [[St. Martin's Press]] in New York City received a copy and arranged to have the first two books published as a single volume in the United States. Wight named the volume ''All Creatures Great and Small'' from the second line of the hymn \"[[All Things Bright and Beautiful]]\".{{r|memoir|p=271}} The resulting book was a huge success, spawning numerous sequels and movies and a television adaptation. \n\nWight's books are partially autobiographical, with many of the stories loosely based on real events or people. The stories are set in the fictional town of [[Darrowby]], which is a composite of Thirsk and its nearby market towns [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]], [[Leyburn]], and [[Middleham]].<ref>''James Herriot's Yorkshire'' (1979), James Herriot, St. Martin's</ref> Wight renamed Donald Sinclair and his brother [[Brian Sinclair (veterinary surgeon)|Brian]] as Siegfried and Tristan Farnon respectively, and used the name \"Helen Alderson\" for his wife Joan Danbury.  Wight's son James stated in his memoir that many of the stories which are set in the 1930s\u20131950s in the books were inspired by cases that Wight attended in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"memoir\" /> \n\nThe books also document a transitional period in Britain's veterinary profession. Agriculture was moving from the use of draught animals (primarily horses) to the use of mechanical tractors, and medical science was on the verge of discovering antibiotics and other drugs that eliminated many of the ancient remedies still in use. These and other sociological factors (such as increased affluence) prompted a large-scale shift in veterinary practice over the course of the 20th century. At the beginning of the century, virtually all of a veterinarian's time was spent working with large animals such as horses, cattle and other livestock. By 2000, the majority of vets practised mostly on dogs, cats, and other pets belonging to a population having a larger disposable income. Wight (as Herriot) occasionally steps out of his narrative to comment on the primitive state of veterinary medicine at the time of the story he is relating.<ref name=\"thelordgodmadethemall:caesarian\">{{cite book|last1=Herriot|first1=James|title=The Lord God Made Them All|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=62\u201376}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''If Only They Could Talk'', Wight wrote seven more books. In the United States, the first six books of the original series were thought too short to publish independently and were collected into omnibus volumes: the final two books were published separately. The last book of the series, ''Every Living Thing'', immediately went into the top 10 best-seller list in Britain and had an 865,000 copy first edition printing in the United States.<ref name=\"But it did happen to a vet\">Margolis, Jonathan (12 December 2002 ''Time Magazine''{{Failed verification|date=March 2012}}<!--no such issue date, no such title in the magazine's online article index--></ref> \n\n[[File:AllCreaturesGreatAndSmallSet-1-GCR 7908.JPG|thumb|Part of the [[BBC]] TV set for ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' on permanent display at the [[World of James Herriot]] museum in Thirsk, North Yorkshire]]\n\n==Film and television adaptions==\nWight's books have been adapted for film and television, including the 1975 film ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (film)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' followed by ''[[It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet]]'' in 1976, and the long-running [[BBC]] television series ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]''.

The original presenters were folk-singer [[Ralph McTell]], fresh from his stint on Granada's other children's series [[Alphabet Zoo]], and [[Danusia Harwood]].\n\nFrom about the middle of the second series, Harwood was replaced by [[Jacqueline Reddin]]. In the final series, the setting changed to the newly opened Tickle Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) studios. Reddin became the show's lead presenter and sang the theme song, after McTell returned to his recording career. She was joined by a [[puppet]] [[cat]] named Dexter, performed by [[John Eccleston]]. In this series, Jacqueline occasionally appeared as another character, movie star 'Gloria Glamorous'.\n\n== Format ==\n\nRalph and Danny (or Jacqui depending which series you were in) would be working in the shop when a local resident would come in and recount at length an incident in their week, accompanied with illustrations by [[Valerie Pye]]. A song, written and sung with guitar (and occasionally, piano) by McTell, would follow based around either the week's story or simply the visiting character. The three of them would also read aloud jokes from the 'Tickle Post', which were usually credited to have been submitted by children from various schools.\n\nPet-shop proprietor Bunny was played by [[Nerys Hughes]], McTell's co-presenter on [[Alphabet Zoo]] and several songs from the earlier series were reused in Tickle on the Tum, including \"Kenny the Kangaroo\" and \"Ollie the Otter\". Favourite characters amongst children were bumbling odd-job man Barney Bodger, Mike the Milkman and G.P. Dr Dimple, played by [[Bill Oddie]].\n\nWhen Danny was working at the shop, it was implied that she was just an assistant and Ralph was the proprietor. But during the Christmas Special from series 3, Ralph is shown returning from a music tour and mentions that the shop belongs to Jacqui now. Despite being twice as long as a regular episode, the Christmas special didn't feature any guests stars at all, but did feature an uncredited cameo by Jacqueline Reddin's baby daughter Jenna (as Farmer Field's youngest).\n\nThe original opening credit sequence, illustrated by Valerie Pye, featured several town inhabitants standing in front of the General Store. They were, from left to right: Farmer Field, Roland Crust, Lilly Lolly, Bobby Bins and Barney Bodger. When [[Billy Connoly]] (who played Bobby Bins) left after just two episodes, his character was replaced by the similar Tommy Tidy, played by [[Willie Rushton]]. Tommy's outfit was almost identical to that of Bobby, making it seem that the drawn figure in the opening credits represented Tommy Tidy instead of Bobby Bins.\n\n== Cast and Characters<ref>\"Tickle on the Tum \u2013 Stories and Songs\" Cassette inlay, St Michael, 1984.</ref><ref>\"Tickle on the Tum \u2013 The Complete Series One\" DVD inlay, Revelation Films, 2010.</ref> ==\n\n*Gary Ball (Tickle Rovers football team captain) \u2013 [[Brian Bovell]] (2 episodes, series 2\u20133)\n*Barney Bodger (builder) \u2013 [[Tim Healy (actor)|Tim Healy]] (13 episodes, series 1 to 4)\n*Bessie Bagwash (launderette owner) \u2013 [[Molly Sugden]] (9 episodes, series 2 to 4)\n*Bobby Binns (dustman) \u2013 [[Billy Connolly]] (2 episodes, series 1\u20132)\n*Bunny Brown (pet shop owner) \u2013 [[Nerys Hughes]] (4 episodes, series 2\u20133)\n*Connie Caper ([[Constable|WPC]]) \u2013 [[Joan Sims]] (8 episodes, series 1\u20133)\n*Mayor Choudhury (town mayor) \u2013 [[Zia Mohyeddin]] (4 episodes, series 4)\n*Mrs. Cravat \u2013 [[Barbara Lott]] (4 episodes, series 4)\n*Miss Dibbs (scout leader) \u2013 [[Patricia Brake]] (5 episodes, series 4)\n*Dora (school bus driver) \u2013 [[Penelope Keith]] (8 episodes, series 1 to 3)\n*Dr Dimple \u2013 [[Bill Oddie]] (12 episodes, series 1 to 4)\n*Farmer Field \u2013 [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]] (10 episodes, series 1 to 4)\n*Freddy the Fireman \u2013 [[Graham Stark]] (6 episodes, series 2 to 4)\n*Lily Lolly (Lollipop Lady) \u2013 [[Bertice Reading]] (2 episodes, series 1\u20132)\n*Mickey Moon (newspaper boy)- [[Adam Sunderland]] (2 episodes, series 2)\n*Mike the Milkman \u2013 [[Kenny Lynch]] (4 episodes, series 1\u20132)\n*Miss Marker (teacher) \u2013 [[Susan Wooldridge]] (7 episodes, series 1 to 3)\n*Roland Crust (baker) \u2013 [[Billy Dainty]] (3 episodes, series 1\u20132)\n*Tommy Tidy (dustman/inventor) \u2013 [[Willie Rushton]] (2 episodes, series 3)\n*Winnie Walker (postwoman) \u2013 [[Madge Hindle]] (4 episodes, series 1\u20132)\n*Willie Wok (chip shop owner) \u2013 [[Burt Kwouk]] (2 episodes, series 3)\n\n== Series Guide ==\n\n*Series 1: 18 editions 5 November 1984 \u2013 1 April 1985\n*Series 2: 31 editions 2 September 1985 \u2013 23 June 1986\n*Series 3: 30 editions 1 September 1986 \u2013 30 March 1987 (Including one 25 minute Christmas special)\n*Series 4: 39 editions 8 February 1988 \u2013 29 November 1988\n\nAlthough broadcast over 4 series, there were three main recording blocks of 39 episodes overseen by three different directors.

For example, take a [[triangle]] with coordinates {(2,&nbsp;1),&nbsp;(4,&nbsp;5),&nbsp;(7,&nbsp;8)}. Take the first ''x''-coordinate and multiply it by the second ''y''-value, then take the second ''x''-coordinate and multiply it by the third ''y''-value, and repeat as many times until it is done for all wanted points.

This formula is just the expansion of those given above for the case n = 3.

This method uses [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. As an example, choose the triangle with vertices (2,4), (3,\u22128), and (1,2). Then construct the following matrix by \u201cwalking around\u201d the triangle and ending with the initial point.<ref>IMSA JHMC Guide, Page. 10 \"Shoelace\" by Cindy Xi</ref>\n\n:: <math> \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 \\\\ 3 & -8 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nFirst, draw diagonal down and to the right slashes (as shown below),\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;[[File:ShoelaceMatrix2.GIF]]\nand multiply the two numbers connected by each slash, then add all the products: (2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;\u22128)&nbsp;+&nbsp;(3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2)&nbsp;+&nbsp;(1&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;4) = \u22126. Do the same thing with slashes diagonal down and to the left (shown below with downwards slashes):\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;[[File:ShoelaceMatrix3.GIF]]\n(4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3)&nbsp;+&nbsp;(\u22128&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;1)&nbsp;+&nbsp;(2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2) = 8. Then take the difference of these two numbers: |(\u22126&nbsp;)\u2212(&nbsp;8)| = 14. Halving this gives the area of the triangle: 7. Organizing the numbers like this makes the formula easier to recall and evaluate. With all the slashes drawn, the matrix loosely resembles a shoe with the laces done up, giving rise to the algorithm's name.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Planimeter]]\n*[[Pick's theorem]]\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KjG8Pg6LGk Mathologer video about Gauss' shoelace formula]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Area]]\n[[Category:Geometric algorithms]]\n[[Category:Surveying]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Shoelace3.png|thumb]]\n\nThe '''shoelace formula''' or '''shoelace algorithm''' (also known as '''[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]'s area formula''' and the '''[[surveying|surveyor]]'s formula'''<ref name=\"Braden\">{{cite journal|author=Bart Braden|title=The Surveyor's Area Formula|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=17|issue=4|year=1986|pages=326\u2013337|url=http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/pubs/Calc_Articles/ma063.pdf|doi=10.2307/2686282|jstor=2686282}}</ref>) is a mathematical [[algorithm]] to determine the [[area]] of a [[simple polygon]] whose vertices are described by their [[Cartesian coordinates]] in the plane.<ref name=\"mathreference\" /> The user [[Cross product|cross-multiplies]] corresponding coordinates to find the area encompassing the polygon, and subtracts it from the surrounding polygon to find the area of the polygon within.

This can be defined by this formula:<ref>{{cite book|title=Geometry for Enjoyment and Challenge|year=1991|publisher=McDougal Littell|isbn=0-86609-965-4|author=Richard Rhoad|edition=new|author2=George Milauskas|author3=Robert Whipple|pages=[https://archive.org/details/geometryforenjoy00geor/page/717 717\u2013718]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/geometryforenjoy00geor/page/717}}</ref>\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{A}_\\text{tri.} = {1 \\over 2}|x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_1 - x_2y_1 - x_3y_2 - x_1y_3| </math>\n\nfor ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''y''<sub>''i''</sub> representing each respective coordinate. This formula is just the expansion of those given above for the case n = 3. Using it, one can find that the area of the triangle equals one half of the [[absolute value]] of 10&nbsp;+&nbsp;32&nbsp;+&nbsp;7&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;4&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;35&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;16, which equals 3. The number of  variables depends on the number of sides of the [[polygon]]. For example, a [[pentagon]] will be defined up to ''x''<sub>5</sub> and ''y''<sub>5</sub>:\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{A}_\\text{pent.} = {1 \\over 2}|x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_5 + x_5y_1 - x_2y_1 - x_3y_2 - x_4y_3 - x_5y_4 - x_1y_5|</math>\n\nA [[quadrilateral]] will be defined up to ''x''<sub>4</sub> and ''y''<sub>4</sub>:\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{A}_\\text{quad.} = {1 \\over 2}|x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 +x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - x_2y_1 - x_3y_2 - x_4y_3 - x_1y_4| </math>\n\n==More complex example==\nConsider the polygon defined by the points (3,4), (5,11), (12,8), (9,5), and (5,6), and illustrated in the following diagram:\n\n[[File:polygon area formula (English).svg|Figure|Figure of this example]]\n\nThe area of this polygon is:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{A} & = {1 \\over 2}|3 \\times 11 + 5 \\times 8 + 12 \\times 5 + 9 \\times 6 + 5 \\times 4 \\\\\n& {} \\qquad {} - 4 \\times 5 - 11 \\times 12 - 8 \\times 9 - 5 \\times 5 - 6 \\times 3| \\\\[10pt]\n& = {60 \\over 2} = 30\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==Etymology==\n\n[[File:Shoelace3.png|thumb]]\n\nThe reason this formula is called the shoelace formula is because of a common method used to evaluate it. This method uses [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. As an example, choose the triangle with vertices (2,4), (3,\u22128), and (1,2). Then construct the following matrix by \u201cwalking around\u201d the triangle and ending with the initial point.<ref>IMSA JHMC Guide, Page. 10 \"Shoelace\" by Cindy Xi</ref>\n\n:: <math> \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 \\\\ 3 & -8 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nFirst, draw diagonal down and to the right slashes (as shown below),\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;[[File:ShoelaceMatrix2.GIF]]\nand multiply the two numbers connected by each slash, then add all the products: (2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;\u22128)&nbsp;+&nbsp;(3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2)&nbsp;+&nbsp;(1&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;4) = \u22126. Do the same thing with slashes diagonal down and to the left (shown below with downwards slashes):\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;[[File:ShoelaceMatrix3.GIF]]\n(4&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3)&nbsp;+&nbsp;(\u22128&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;1)&nbsp;+&nbsp;(2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2) = 8. Then take the difference of these two numbers: |(\u22126&nbsp;)\u2212(&nbsp;8)| = 14. Halving this gives the area of the triangle: 7. Organizing the numbers like this makes the formula easier to recall and evaluate. With all the slashes drawn, the matrix loosely resembles a shoe with the laces done up, giving rise to the algorithm's name.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Planimeter]]\n*[[Pick's theorem]]\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KjG8Pg6LGk Mathologer video about Gauss' shoelace formula]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Area]]\n[[Category:Geometric algorithms]]\n[[Category:Surveying]]\n", "name_user": "Trang Oul", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMore complex example:comma", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula"}

For example, he conducts his own surveillance of Lonnie Rodiger, a young pedophile whom he correctly suspected of murdering young boys, including the younger brother of his high school girlfriend Allie. In the [[Chicago P.D. (season 2)#ep22|season 2 crossover]] with ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', when Will was called in for questioning by Sergeant Benson from the NYPD SVU and Voight as Will knew a victim, Halstead storms into Voight's office and tells them that they will get a written statement from Will and nothing more. Likewise, in season 6, he disobeyed Voight's order to stay on desk duty upon hearing that the fire his father died in was an arson and continued to pursue the case by himself.\n\nIn the pilot episode, it is established that Halstead had been partnered with [[Erin Lindsay]] for the past month and they share a close relationship, which has evolved into a more intimate relationship at various times (which they have had to keep secret) but prevented from going any further due to Voight's dislike of \"in-house romances\". She tries to set him up on dates with her friends in the first several episodes of season 1 but soon realizes that she has feelings for him.

She rescues him in the nick of time and decides to return to Intelligence, where she is again partnered with Halstead. They reconnect and rekindle their relationship. In the episode \"You Never Know Who's Who\", they go public for the first time by openly kissing while hanging out at Molly's.<ref name=\"YouNeverKnow\"/> They generally maintain a professional front when at work; Burgess once told Lindsay that she \"[forgets] sometimes that you and Jay are dating, 'cause you guys make it look so easy'\".<ref name=\"IfWeWereNormal\">{{Cite episode|title=If We Were Normal|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

At the end of the episode \"Fork in the Road\", he was seen making a call to Lindsay to propose to her but it was seen that she did not answer the call. It is later revealed that she was leaving for New York City after a series of incidents from the episode essentially led to her accepting a job there and escape further scrutiny from the CPD.\n\nIn season 5 premiere \"Reform\", he is partnered with Hailey Upton and their partnership continues to be rocky. He is a subject in an investigation and scrutiny from public when a drug deal went wrong. When a young girl was shot during the ordeal (and eventually died at Chicago Med), later on showed that the bullet came from his gun.\n\nIn \"Care Under Fire\", it became known that he is still having nightmares about his tours in Afghanistan. He went undercover to infiltrate a kidnapping crew composed of military veterans and struck up a friendship with Luis Vega, his \"target\", due to their shared background as former Rangers who had been deployed to Afghanistan. When the target is killed, his flashbacks came up causing him to dangerously come close to shooting Upton. During the episode, he gets into a relationship with Camila Vega, Luis's sister. He continues to pose as Ryan and does not reveal his true identity to her.<ref name=\"S05E07\"/>\n\nIn \"Rabbit Hole\", the relationship between Halstead and his new girlfriend Camila takes a dramatic turn when he unintentionally gets himself in the middle of a drug operation and a murder of an undercover DEA agent. He later finds out that Camila is a person of interest. But later in the investigation, she confesses that she was recruiting people to become drug dealers. When Voight sees that Halstead was acting strange, he asks him if he was in a relationship with her, he lied and denied it. But when the sting in getting the murderer to confess falls apart, his colleagues rushes in the garage and as she was getting arrested, she realizes that he was a cop. As she was sitting in a jail cell, Upton convinces Camila to not see Halstead again and to not speak of their relationship to anyone or face spending years in prison. In the following episode \"Confidential\", he was placed on desk duty by Voight and was ordered to see a psychiatrist. He eventually returned to the field and admitted to Upton in the episode \"Chasing Monsters\" that he found therapy helpful and was finally addressing his PTSD.\n\nAfter a rocky start to his new partnership with Upton in season 5, the duo have since become close friends and confidants, often supporting one another after difficult cases.\n\nIn \"Endings\", after his father was declared brain dead, he investigated who the person responsible for the fire. During the investigation, it became known that Daniel Mendoza, a drug cartel member, was the one responsible. When attempting to take his brother Juan Mendoza, into custody, he almost gets into an altercation with him only for Upton and Ruzek to stop him. Voight benches Halstead due to his personal connection to the case. Jay is so enraged by this that he insults Upton's dad, saying she's projecting her own father issues. Upton, being tired of him using her as a punching bag, demanded to hand the keys to her. He calls Severide to give him a radio and a ride. He then takes a radio from a uniformed officer and chases after Daniel on foot, he was shot and wounded by Mendoza who was attempting to evade police. He, in return, shot and killed him. Voight berates him for going against his orders and that their conversation is not over.\n\nIn the season 6 episode \"Trigger\", he was visibly affected by the fact that a fellow veteran would frame a local [[imam]] and kill innocent people in a deluded quest to prove that the imam was financially supporting terrorist activity; for the first time on the show, Halstead spoke at length about his time in the military and commented that he had learned to live with his PTSD and move on with life, unlike the perpetrator.<ref name=\"Trigger\"/>\n\nIn \"Outrage\", while working undercover in a drug bust, it went sideways when the team identified the suspect as Matthew Garrett, a perp who Halstead thought was in prison. Jay tried to bail before any trouble started, but Garrett had also recognize him and publicly called him out, leading to a brief confrontation. As he left the club, Jay described the guy as \u201cthe devil.\u201d A paperwork SNAFU led to Garrett getting a huge payoff for wrongful arrest, and now he was using it to fund his drug operation. Halstead particularly hated him because Garrett killed a 17-year-old girl. With Halstead benched by Voight over an official complaint against him, they went ahead of the drug bust. Instead of Garrett, his two henchmen were there. Upon finding out the location, Halstead was the first person through the warehouse door and found Garrett shot in the neck. He died shortly thereafter, leaving Jay without the location of the murdered girl's body. When investigated by Internal Affairs, Voight instructed Halstead to lie and say Garrett died before he got there, instead of in front of him. Kelton along with everyone, was convinced that Halstead was the prime suspect in his murder. Voight goes to his old friend, former Detective Gus for answers, while there, he confesses to murder and tells to look the other way. When he couldn't, he gives him \"some time alone\" in which he committed suicide and Halstead was off the hook.\n\n====Crossovers====\nHalstead first appeared on ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' as a recurring character before becoming a main character on ''[[Chicago PD (TV series)|Chicago PD]]''. Within the [[Chicago (franchise)|''Chicago'' franchise]], the character has crossed-over to ''Fire'' and ''Med'' as part of the CPD investigation. He also appeared on ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' to assist with cross-jurisdiction cases.\n\nThe character was introduced in season 2 as a regular customer at Molly's, a bar jointly run by paramedic [[Gabriela Dawson]] and her firefighter colleagues. He had fallen for Gabby but she breaks up with him upon finding out he was a \"henchman\" of Arthur, a local thug who had threatened to burn down Molly's. Although her brother [[Antonio Dawson|Antonio]] tells her that Halstead was actually a cop, Gabby decides to end their relationship, as she had felt betrayed even though she understood that Halstead could not blow his cover. They part on friendly terms after Halstead successfully arrests Arthur and taking a bullet to his shoulder in the process. As a result, he opts out of undercover work and joins Antonio in the Intelligence Unit.<ref name=\"Joyriding\">{{cite episode |title=Joyriding|episodelink=Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep30|series=Chicago Fire|serieslink=Chicago Fire (TV series)|network=[[NBC]]|airdate=November 12, 2013|season=2|number=6}}</ref>\n\nHalstead also appeared in later in the season as the lead detective of a murder case involving Gabby's colleague at Firehouse 51. One of [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Kelly Severide|Lieutenant Severide]]'s men Jeff Clarke was a suspect when the ex-lover of his wife was found dead. The ex-lover turned out to be a loanshark who repeatedly harassed the Clarkes to the point where Clarke has verbally threatened him and had gone to his house with a sniper rifle intending to kill him. Clarke, an [[Iraq]] veteran, later admitted that he tried to protect his wife because she had been there for him when he came home from his deployment, to which Halstead replied that he understood and could sympathize.\n\nHalstead was a central character in the 2018 crossovers with ''Chicago Fire'' and ''Chicago Med''.<ref name=\"Endings\"/> Firehouse 51 firefighters were called to the apartment building where his father Pat lives. Pat eventually died at Chicago Medical Center of complications from his injuries.

Ruzek is a police officer in the intelligence unit of the [[Chicago Police Department]]. He has also made recurring appearances in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]''.\n\nRuzek's parents divorced when he was a child, and he would split time between his father in [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]] and mother in [[Canaryville]]. His father, Bob Ruzek ([[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]]), better known as \"Disco Bob\", is a longtime patrol officer with the 26th District who had served with both [[Henry \"Hank\" Voight|Voight]] and Olinsky.<ref name=\"DiscoBob\"/> Little is known about Ruzek's background as he rarely talks about his personal life. In season 5, he is blackmailed by Denny Woods into spying on the team in order to save himself and his sister from prison, and his nephew from going to foster care.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Ruzek was still in the academy and about to graduate when he was handpicked by [[#Alvin Olinsky|Detective Alvin Olinsky]] for an undercover assignment. The first season sees him trying to adjust to his new role in the intelligence unit. Although he was warmly welcomed by the team, his impulsive behavior has occasionally landed him into trouble with Voight and Olinsky and irked his more senior colleagues. His naivet\u00e9 becomes apparent during his first stakeout, when he repeatedly looks at his phone and makes bathroom breaks. Olinsky temporarily had him transferred to uniformed patrol duty as a warning.<ref name=\"DifferentMistakes\"/> Over time, he begins to settle in and becomes more mature and less impetuous. In the season 3 episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 3)#ep43|Climbing into Bed]]\", Ruzek has his badge temporarily revoked for going undercover without authorization. Platt reluctantly pulls some strings to lighten his punishment and Voight assures her that Ruzek was worth the risk. He strikes up a friendship with [[#Kevin Atwater|Officer Kevin Atwater]], who transfers to Intelligence from patrol in season 2, and they often banter with one another.\n\nIn season 1, Ruzek was engaged to a woman named Wendy. They are shown to have a close and playful relationship, sending racy photos of each other back and forth. He tries to keep his professional and private lives separate but has difficulty doing so. He tells her that he was assigned to a desk job at district headquarters, which she eventually discovers is not true after he was shot.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=At Least It's Justice|episodelink=|series=Chicago P.D.|serieslink=Chicago P.D. (TV series)|airdate=April 2, 2014|season=1|number=10}}</ref> That relationship fell apart, partly due his job and partly to his growing infatuation with patrol officer [[#Kim Burgess|Kim Burgess]]. After Wendy calls off their engagement, Ruzek and Burgess pursue a romantic relationship.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=A Beautiful Friendship|episodelink=|series=Chicago P.D.|serieslink=Chicago P.D.

It gradually becomes apparent to Burgess that Ruzek had commitment issues. She begins to doubt him after learning that he had an ex-fianc\u00e9e before Wendy. At the end of \"[[Chicago P.D. (Season 3)#ep50|Looking Out for Stateville]],\" she calls off the engagement in the same placed he proposed, leaving them both devastated. When Burgess and her partner [[#Sean Roman|Sean Roman]] appear to be flirting, he becomes jealous and their friendship becomes strained.<ref name=\"IfWeWereNormal\"/>\n\nIn season 3, it was revealed that Ruzek still loves Kim and wants nothing more than resume his relationship with her.\n\nDuring a shootout with Jacob Sims, Adam is shot in the chest. The injury is not severe as his Kevlar vest deflected most of the shot.\n\nIn middle of season 4, Ruzek returns from an undercover job, hoping his job with intelligence is still open, but when he was gone his spot got taken by a guy named Kenny Rixton. Ruzek then talks to Voight about his old spot in Intelligence and if he can get it back. Voight cannot give Ruzek his old spot so he had to work in Uniform. Ruzek is cleaning his locker when Rixton tells him that he is transferring to a newly formed Narcotics unit. Ruzek then gets his job back in Intelligence, but does not get back together with Kim.\n\nIn the season 5 premiere \"Reform\", he appears to be more aggressive with the public, and when Atwater explains to him about the interactions between police and black men. He shrugged off by explain the problems with [[political correctness]].\n\nIn \"Snitch\", his aggressive behavior takes a toll when he punches a suspect and Upton manages to get him out of the situation; he comes briefly under investigation by Internal Affairs but it is dropped when Upton convinces the mother of the suspect's child to get him to withdraw the complaint.\n\nIn \"Fallen\", Ruzek was recruited by Lieutenant Denny Woods, after Woods finds evidence that he deletes information that his sister was charged in a DUI while his nephew was sitting in the car with her. Woods uses it to blackmail Ruzek into getting incriminating evidence to take Voight down.\n\nIn \"Care Under Fire\", Ruzek uploads video of Halstead, while undercover, in a bar fight. He gives it to Woods during a disclosed meeting.\n\nIn \"Monster\", he gets Voight on video taking money from a crime scene without putting it into evidence. Ruzek intends to give it to Woods but when he meets with Woods, he refuses to give him the video because of loyalty towards Voight. Olinsky persuades Ruzek to go with him to meet a CI, but instead drives him to meet with Voight, who has discovered that Ruzek was the mole.\n\nIn \"Rabbit Hole\", Ruzek tries to explain the situation to Voight but is cut short. While Voight cannot do anything about the threatened charges against Ruzek, he conspires with Ruzek to take down Woods. When Ruzek meets with Woods, Woods shoves him onto the car, accusing him of undermining Wood's credibility, since the money actually was put into evidence by Voight, unknown to Ruzek. When this meeting was over, it was revealed Voight was there watching it go down.\n\nAt the end of \"Confidential\", after apologizing about the way he treated Burgess during his relationship with her, they end up having a one-night stand.\n\nIn \"Homecoming\", Ruzek found out that Olinsky had died from his injuries sustained from the stabbing; he supports Voight's actions by trying to block Antonio from intervening in Voight's beating of the killer. He is also present when Voight beats one of the co-conspirators to force him to give the name of who was in charge.\n\nIn \"New Normal\", with Voight suspended, Antonio was put in charge of the unit, Ruzek begins to butt heads with Dawson. Ruzek was getting in touch with Voight for assistance when the investigation into bad drugs was getting nowhere but dead bodies at every turn. He screams at Antonio for Voight not being there. Later, both Ruzek and Dawson have opposing views on good police work to the point of getting into a violent brawl in a dope lab.\n\nIn \"Bad Boys\", he starts a relationship with Hailey Upton, while keeping it a secret from others. In \"Sacrifice\", Upton ended the relationship with him citing their own careers.\n\nIn \"Fathers and Sons\", while Ruzek working undercover in an investigation of a drug dealing ring that involves the brutal death of a young drug mule, he finds out that his father, Disco Bob, is also involved. So the next morning he visits his father's house for a meeting of the minds. Bob says he's just \u201cgetting paid\u201d and there's nothing else his son needs to know about, but wants his name kept out of the report. Upon this discovery, Upton demands that he either tells Voight about his father's involvement or she will. Ruzek chooses the first option and tries to convince Voight that his father is clean. Voight appears skeptical, telling his subordinate that they're going to follow the facts, no matter where that takes them. Bob accidentally stumbles into the drug deal, which incites a shootout that gets him wounded and blows everyone's cover. Ruzek visits his dad in the hospital and demands to know why he didn't get out when he was warned to. Bob admits that he took the Scorpion Club job because he's broke, thanks to \u201csome bad investments.\u201d He gets teary-eyed as he apologizes for messing up the case and wanting to try and help his son. Voight confirms that Bob was innocent and says that since he \u201cwas working undercover with us\u201d to cover him.\n\nIn \"Descent\", after Voight and Ruzek capture Jason Rizzo, a drug dealer/rapist responsible for kidnapping Antonio's daughter, they let Antonio beat up the suspect to the point that he was pushed to his death. In \"Brotherhood\", upon learning of Antonio's addiction in \"Descent\", he covers for him at the same time when the OID was investigating about the events that transpired, infuriating Voight to point of almost getting into altercation with him. In \"Reckoning\", during a meeting with Platt, Voight, and Antonio, they learn that Internal Affairs had taken over the investigation. When he gets called in by Internal Affairs Detective David Heller, he sticks to his story of what had happened, despite the fact that the detective had already known that Antonio was responsible. He almost gets to altercation with Voight, with Voight citing that he is not Alvin Olinsky. At the end, Trudy walks into the unit, saying IAD is there to arrest Adam, but she will take him down to save him the scene, while everyone is opposed to the outcome. Adam appreciates them wanting to come down but doesn't want them to. Everyone is upset, but Antonio remains mum. Trudy walks Adam out, who touches the door; telling him to do more than keep his head down especially if he ends up in General Population, She tries to keep talking but Adam kisses her, saying he will be all right. Heller arrests him and escorts him into the car. Adam goes through the booking process as Antonio sits in the car, popping a pill. Adam sits in the holding cell as the barred door slams shut.\n\nIn \"Doubt\", Ruzek has been stripped of his police powers and he is awaiting trial. However, in \"Assets\", Ruzek's case was dismissed by a favor pulled by Voight, which grants Ruzek his position in Intelligence once again; this event fortifies his loyalty to the latter.\n\n====Crossovers====\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep51|The Nuclear Option]]\" (September 30, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep65|I Am The Apocalypse]]\" (April 7, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep78|Short and Fat]]\" (December 8, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep79|The Beating Heart]]\" (January 5, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep83|All Hard Parts]]\" (February 9, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 6)#ep127|Hiding Not Seeking]]\" (March 8, 2018)\n* ''Chicago Med'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Med (season 4)#ep79|Tell Me the Truth]]\" (April 3, 2019)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 7)#ep156|Until the Weather Breaks]]\" (April 24, 2019)\n\n===Kevin Atwater===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Kevin Atwater\n| image_size         = 250\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

Both Atwater and Burgess were constant targets of [[Trudy Platt|Desk Sergeant Platt]]'s sarcasm. There was a running gag where Platt would assign them a different squad car if they talked back to her sarcastic remarks and mishaps would take place. In \"Thirty Balloons\", after going above and beyond in a hoarder deal, he and Burgess are given a new patrol car the district was given. They are told to keep it in mint condition since Commander Perry is going to drive it in a parade. However, when dealing with a drug mule, the mirror was wrecked when the drug mule tackled Atwater.

During the investigation, it was found that he was killed in jail by another inmate and the charges was dropped. Peter Stone apologizes to him in court room for rushing to judgement.\n\nIn \"Big Friends, Big Enemies\", Burgess spots Atwater's younger brother, Jordan, while out visiting potential shooters and targets. Ever since, he keeps a close eye on him to see if he does not follow the wrong path.\n\nIn \"Snitch\", it is known that his little brother, Jordan, was born on October 18, 2002 when he, Burgess, and his friends were celebrating his 15th birthday and Atwater keeps a close relationship with the people in his community. During the investigation into the murder of a mini-mart owner, Roland, Atwater finds out that his brother was involved when he witnessed the murder and confronts him. He identified a gang banger named Curtis as the murder suspect and saw him throw the murder weapon in the nearby dumpster. Following a foot chase, Atwater eventually tracks down Curtis in an alley at gunpoint. Atwater encourages Curtis to go for his gun, which would give him a reason to shoot him, and Voight even suggests that Curtis could go for a second weapon on his ankle. But Atwater, in the end, does not pull the trigger and takes him in custody. In \"Home\", after his sister was attacked for the events that happened in \"Snitch\", he decides to let them move to Texas to ensure their safety. He still keeps in contact with them and misses them dearly.\n\nIn \"Captive\", in the middle of [[Trudy Platt]]'s birthday karaoke party he receives a phone call in which prompts him to leave Molly's to check up on an anonymous person.

When Platt checks his phone, and gets the address of the tossed hours, which is in the name of Joe Baker \u2014 a known drug dealer who has also missing. He was found chained to the ground in the abandoned church when Hailey finds a video on social media of Joe getting assaulted. When Atwater and Joe connect, it was revealed that seven years ago his son Ronnie Baker attempted to rob a store and murdered a clerk in the process after he gives chase and when he refuses to comply orders to surrender, he points his gun to Atwater, and he manages to shoot and kill him. Later found that Joe's sister Michelle had stayed in touch with him and told him to check on her brother. It was also revealed that the city of Chicago had paid Joe $20,000 in settlement which proves his doubt of Atwater's story. Atwater tearfully insists that he thinks about Joe's son every night before he goes to bed \u2014 but he also thinks about the clerk who Joe's son robbed, too. His captors were from a drug gang, Billy and Reimundo Morales who had accused them both of taking his drugs a few weeks earlier. And when Joe in revenge tries to his captors about his real identity, Atwater not only says he's a drug dealer, but claims he's the one who stole the cocaine to begin with. He ended up getting drilled in the leg by a power drill by Morales. Prior to the kidnapping, a girl named Elisa was brought in for questioning in which she confesses that she had drugged Joe and brought him to Morales. With one of the men shot dead by Antonio, Atwater manages to get himself and Joe to escape and eventually get into a fight with Morales for the gun. Joe comes to the rescue by shooting Morales with the service weapon he took off Atwater, that was knocked away in the fight. As soon as it over, Joe puts the gun to Atwater's head and demands to know the full story of his son's shooting. Atwater trying to convince Joe to put the gun down, because he sees the rest of Intelligence coming into the room, and did not want him to die, too. Joe drops the weapon and gets carried to the hospital. Atwater asks him to drug charges against him only to found out by Voight that Joe's friend Calvin Hill had stolen the drugs and set him up. Kevin tells Joe that his son's last words were about not getting on his knees for anyone, in which the same words that Joe put into his son's head. Atwater ends up consoling him.\n\nIn \"Trigger\", while working under undercover in the mosque to investigate a bombing at an Army's recruitment office, he was mistaken to be one of the combatants and was almost subjected to an enhanced interrogation not before Voight and FBI Agent William Graff stormed and Graff offering to apologize for his actions.\n\nIn \"[[Chicago P.D.

While he and Daryl are in Daryl's car, they are pulled over by CPD Officers Tom Doyle and Jim Harper. During the stop, Doyle is overly aggressive with Atwater and Daryl, going as far saying racial slurs at them and drawing his gun, despite both of them being unarmed. They are arrested by the two officers on suspicion of robbery, but Daryl is shot and killed by Officer Doyle. Atwater is conflicted about what to say to Internal Affairs and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, but it is revealed that Daryl did go for Officer Doyle's gun. Voight tells him to do what he thinks is right, as to remember that he gets paid to be a cop, not to change the world. It is revealed that Atwater told the Civilian Office of Police Accountability that it was a clean shooting, clearing Doyle. Atwater meets with Doyle in a bar with the intent to fight him, doing so. He and Doyle fight, and it ends with Atwater putting his gun against Doyle's head, doing what Doyle did to him at the traffic stop.\n\nIn \"[[Chicago P.D.

While coming from a gun deal, Doyle stops a black man who he believes to be carrying a suspicious bag, and pursues him into a building, resulting in the deaths of the man and Doyle at the hands of two gang members. Atwater becomes conflicted since Doyle had no probable cause to stop the man and the gang members in the building who shot Doyle shot him in self defense since he was waving his service weapon around. Atwater proceeds to report that Doyle had no probable cause to stop the man, holding the knowledge that a wrongful death lawsuit of the man Doyle pursued will be initiated, a deep Internal Affairs investigation on Atwater and Doyle will occur, the city being sued for millions, and the family of Doyle (a third generation cop) as well as fellow officers who were his friends heavily monitoring and threatening him. At the end of the episode, Voight tells Atwater that he and Intelligence will support Atwater's decision before Atwater heads home to find multiple officers staking out his house.   \n\n====Crossovers====\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" (May 15, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep25|A Problem House]]\" (September 24, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep26|Prove It]]\" (October 1, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep37|Tonight's the Night]]\" (January 21, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep44|A Dark Day]]\" (April 29, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep49|Just Drive the Truck]]\" (October 7, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep58|Ambush Predator]]\" (January 13, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep78|Short and Fat]]\" (December 8, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep88|I Will Be Walking]]\" (April 19, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Justice'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Justice#Season 1 (2017)|Uncertainty Principle]]\" (March 5, 2017)\n* ''Chicago Justice'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Justice#Season 1 (2017)|Drill]]\" (April 23, 2017)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 7)#ep141|This Isn't Charity]]\" (October 17, 2018)\n\n===Kim Burgess===\n{{Main|Kim Burgess}}\n\n===Sean Roman===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Sean Roman\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

Before joining the force, Olinsky served in the [[United States Army]] and was at one time stationed in [[Caserma Ederle|Vicenza]], Italy with the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team]]. Olinsky mentions in \"Called in Dead\" that he has 8 confirmed kills in the line of duty. He is one of two military veterans in the Intelligence Unit \u2013 the other being [[Jay Halstead]], an Afghanistan veteran \u2013 and the duo sometimes exchange banter about each other's service.\n\nIn season 1, Olinsky becomes estranged from his wife, who made him move into the garage for some time, before husband and wife eventually reconciled and he is allowed to move back into the house.<ref name=\"CalledInDead\"/> When Lexi is falsely accused of possessing marijuana, Olinsky is quick to help his daughter out. Even though she is suspended from school, the two have a father/daughter dance in the garage. When an ill-fated party ends in a gang member's shooting death, Lexi is the only witness. Olinsky tries to prevent Lexi from becoming a witness as it would endanger her life. However, when the shooter refuses to confess, Lexi volunteers. In the season 4 three-show crossover starting with the ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 5)#ep107|Deathtrap]]\", Lexi is killed in a fire which the CFD later determined to be arson. In \"Emotional Proximity\", when the suspect is in custody, him along with Voight made up a lie on the police report that was stated that he had confessed to them. In [[Chicago Justice]] premiere \"Fake\", ASA Peter Stone rebutted that statement in court when Voight had to testify. The case was closed resulting in the arsonist being found guilty of first degree murder. Olinsky returns to work in the next episode.<ref name=\"S04E17\"/>\n\nIn \"You Never Know Who's Who\", during the investigation in the murder of a former CIA agent, he worked undercover as a contact from CIA headquarters. He was shot and wounded when one of the suspect recognized that his identity was false. The suspect was later shot and killed by Antonio.\n\nOlinsky has a long history with Voight having been partnered with him in a gang unit years earlier. Olinsky's partner was killed by a man named Browning and Olinsky and Voight \"took him for a boat ride\".\n\nAlthough usually calm and reserved he has been shown to have a temper and is not above using questionable tactics to bring a suspect to justice.\n\nBecause Olinsky's desk is behind Halstead and Atwater, there is a running gag where Voight and the rest of the unit would miss him entering the room. Voight would brief the team and tell them to pass on the information to Olinsky \"when he gets here\", only for Olinsky to roll out on his chair and say \"Here\".\n\nIn \"Breaking Point\", he was taken into custody for questioning by Internal Affairs when his DNA came up on the body of Kevin Bingham, killer of Hank Voight's son Justin. When the detectives asked him about his DNA, he requested a lawyer. Lieutenant Denny Woods tries to get information from him in order to put Voight in jail, by offering him immunity. But he leaves his office, turning down the offer. With possibility that he might get arrested, he has a temptation to either betray Voight's loyalty or taking the deal.\n\nIn \"Payback\", he and Voight got tip on who the witness was following from Voight's favor to the Ivory Tower, a junkie named Ruben who tried to break into Olinsky's car a while back. He gives Voight the witness's address, and Voight telling him to not get involved. Voight asks Olinsky about his retirement papers being filed. Olinsky then claims he's not retiring; he just wants to use the paperwork as a flare to see if Internal Affairs will make a move. Voight then admits he's not going to be able to bend Ruben, because he's a recovering addict who is turning his life around. At the end, from an \"anonymous\" tip made to Narcotics, Ruben gets arrested with drugs that were planted on him by Olinsky. He maintained his innocence in front of his wife while Olinsky, watches from his car across the street thus damaging the witness's credibility. In \"Saved\", he revealed that the witness, Ruben, was later released due to lack of evidence. In \"Allegiance\", he was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of Kevin Bingham that was convened on \"Saved\" and was arrested by two Internal Affairs detectives in front of his fellow detectives. At the end, he was stabbed in prison by an inmate. In \"Homecoming\", he was soon discovered by corrections officers and rushed to the hospital but died as a result of his injuries. As the investigation into murder goes forward, it was revealed to be a hit by a drug runner for the Cali Cartel that Olinsky was trying to take down while he was in a DEA task force who arrested his brother. His brother ended up killed in prison, and a corrections officer that confided in him was also in on the hit.\n\n====Crossovers====\nLike many ''Chicago P.D.'' characters, Olinsky has appeared in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]''. He was the handler of Leon Cruz, younger brother of CFD firefighter [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Joe Cruz|Joe Cruz]], and was assigned to make sure Leon, who was undercover in a gang, was safe.

As a young girl, her father, the owner of a diner, was attacked and robbed by an unknown shooter. After being threatened by the robber, Hailey spent the night at the desk of Trudy Platt when she was a detective in the Robbery-Homicide division. Platt made her feel safe as her father recovered from the attack and inspired Hailey to become a cop. It is revealed that she was meritoriously promoted to Detective after a year-long undercover assignment. She attended the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nIn season 5, Upton is partnered with [[#Jay Halstead|Jay Halstead]]. The partnership between the two was initially rocky during the first half of the season as Halstead had been getting over the departure of his ex-girlfriend and former partner [[Erin Lindsay]]. They gradually become good friends and confidants, indicated by the fact that it was to her that Halstead finally opened up about his PTSD.\n\nIn \"Snitch\", when she sees Ruzek assaulting a suspect in public, she manages to pull Ruzek aside and get him in the car. And when he was investigated by Internal Affair by what had happened, Ruzek accuses her of going to Internal Affairs, it was later revealed she manages to convince the suspect's child mother to have him drop the charges.\n\nIn \"Fallen\", she was partnered with Vice Sergeant Sean McGrady, who has problems with her. During the search of Quinton Kane, a drug dealer with a likely connection to the murder of a family, he returns to help with the investigation. But when Upton goes to meet with McGrady, he ends up dead and Voight chastizes Upton for letting McGrady come to the scene alone. She's thrown, explaining that she had told him to wait for her and that she was actually ten minutes ahead of the time they had planned to meet, but Voight blows her off. As a result, the officers including his former partner and the McGrady's widow and family ending up turning their backs on her. During the investigation, Upton calls for a private meeting with Voight and shows him a sign-in sheet with McGrady's signature that proves McGrady was in Chicago PD's lab, where a vial of Quinton Kane's blood was kept but is now missing. Upton believes McGrady framed Kane for murder when he actually killed himself to escape his mounting debt. Voight apologizes and then tells her that if she come forward with the truth, and asks her if she wants to tarnish McGrady's legacy and ruin his family over the \u201cjackass\u201d that was a suspect in the family's murder. So, she agrees to stay quiet about what had actually happened. In \"Confidential\", she and Burgess butts heads about how to handle confidential informants when Burgess's confidential information informs them about a dead body, in which Burgess does not believe but Upton decides to investigate. It turns out that she was right and it leads to an sex trafficking, and the informant comes up dead. Upton goes to her CI and she does not push the informant further citing that the informant has a family. Burgess had a problem with how she handled the situation.\n\nIn \"Ghosts\", when a drug bust goes awry, she recognizes that one of the victims was someone that she knows from her undercover assignment prior to joining Intelligence. She suspects that the man she was undercover busting, Ron Booth, is back in business. He immediately becomes the prime suspect and Upton suggests that she goes back undercover to get into his warehouse. Booth still knows her as an Iowa girl named \"Kelly\". It turned personal when she also suspects that he killed her former partner. It was revealed that while working undercover on the night of New Year's Eve, at a party that Booth hosted, he drunkenly tried to rape her. She got away from him before he could, and her former partner got her to the hospital. He then got obsessive over her when he asks \"Ryan\" (undercover Halstead) that if he slept with her and cuts ties with him. When Voight tells her to stop the investigation, she disobeyed his orders and agrees to meet with him without Halstead knowing. After the meeting, Halstead confronts her for being \"too emotional\" with this case. During the meeting with Booth at a parking lot, he checks Upton to see if she was wearing a wire but instead groping her. Booth's nephew got nervous when Halstead starts to make his move and draws his gun, but gets shot dead by Halstead. With the chaos, Booth runs to the stairwell with Upton giving chase and the two end up fighting to gain control. Upton ends up getting the other hand, and beats Booth, and demands that he admit to the murder of her former partner. He does not, so she contemplates shooting him before Halstead arrives to stop her. At the end of the episode, Halstead goes to Upton's apartment to console her.\n\nIn \"Bad Boys\", she and Ruzek begin a relationship but keep it secret from the other members in Intelligence. They break up in \"Sacrifice\" due to their careers.\n\nIn \"Informant\", her informant is murdered in front of her and it is implied that Voight's CI Darius Walker murdered him to avoid being identified as a confidential informant after accidentally being spotted by Upton's informant. Upton proceeds to avenge his death after implying Walker was the one responsible for setting up the deaths of gang members and cops in a drug deal while asking questions about said crime.<ref name=\"The Devil You Know\">{{cite episode |title=The Devil You Know|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

He is first mentioned in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' when Chief Boden's firefighters rescue a boy and his father who were in a near fatal accident caused by Justin's drunk driving. After finding out that the boy was now a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]], a furious Lieutenant [[Matthew Casey]], whose truck company had responded to the call, files a complaint and is threatened by Detective Voight into retracting his statement. The incident would lead to a long-running grudge match between the two. Justin had other run-ins with the law and did a short stint in prison. His father and god-sister Erin Lindsay have tried to set him straight to no avail. Eventually his father forces him to enlist in the U.S. Army to learn discipline and avoid gangs and the bad influence of his recently released former cellmate. After Justin's departure, Voight is accosted by Justin's girlfriend Olive Morgan as she had not heard from the latter for some time (she presumably did not know Voight had forced Justin to enlist on the spot). Upon learning that Olive was pregnant with Justin's child, Voight reaches out to her. Olive is coerced into luring Voight out by vengeful criminals and nearly dies. She and the baby survive the attack. Justin briefly returns to Chicago on leave after hearing about the incident and assures his father that he will declare Olive as his dependent and have her move in with him.

The two of them form a friendship and Lindsay becomes a surrogate older sister to her, likely because of Lindsay's own similar experience. Nadia begins working as an administrative assistant at CPD to gain experience as preparation to enter the police academy. Sergeant Platt also took her under her wing and would give her tips on how to pass her interviews and study for the written exam. In \"The Number of Rats\", Nadia was kidnapped from Chicago by a serial killer named Gregory Yates ([[Dallas Roberts]]) and found raped and murdered in New York in \"[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 16)|Daydream Believer]]\".  She was posthumously honored alongside the fallen officers of the 21st District, including Detective Julia Willhite and Sheldon Jin.\n* Sergeant Edwin Stillwell ([[Ian Bohen]]) is Voight's new [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] handler after Gradishar leaves her position. It is revealed that he assigned Detective Mia Sumner to Intelligence to spy on Voight, and that he blackmailed Sheldon Jin into spying on the Intelligence Unit, particularly Voight. He is arrested in 'Call It Macaroni' for the murder of Sheldon Jin.  \n* Detective Mia Sumner ([[Sydney Tamiia Poitier]]) is a detective assigned to the Intelligence Unit to replace Jules Willhite. She is reassigned to Narcotics in 'The Docks' after it is revealed she is in contact with Voight's IA handler.   \n* Commander Fischer ([[Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)|Kevin J.

His appearances are often met with tension from Voight and the rest of the unit. He is blunt and has no qualms about stepping on Voight's toes, compared to the firm but more diplomatic style of Perry.\n* Greg \"Mouse\" Gerwitz (Samuel Hunt) is the Intelligence Unit's new tech analyst. After Jin was murdered, the team had no one handling the technical aspects and duties were split between Atwater and Ruzek, both of whom detested working behind the desk or with anything technical. He served in the Rangers alongside Halstead and did two tours in Afghanistan, in the [[Korangal Valley]].<ref name=\"ActualPhysicalViolence\"/><ref name=\"CasesThatNeed\"/> During his interview with Sergeant Platt, he mentioned that in Afghanistan, he and Halstead were in the lead Humvee of a convoy when they were bombed.

However they eventually find out that he left the Gang Unit as he had refused to take part in an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|IAD]] investigation into a payback beating he did not participate in but was privy of. He opted for a transfer rather than rat out his colleagues when IAD offered him a deal in exchange for information.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Seven Indictments|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

He is introduced in \"Grasping for Salvation\" as a lieutenant in the Organized Crime Bureau, where he is questioned about his involvement in a murder case 17 years earlier that he and Voight worked when new evidence pops up. He later attempts to coerce Voight to stay away from reinvestigating the murder, certain that they got the right man. It is revealed that Woods' CI was the person who actually committed the murder, and that Woods had told his CI to say that a man who Woods had targeted multiple times over the years had done it. He is stripped of his police powers by the Superintendent as a result, and all of his previous cases were investigated to check if they were by the book. He returns in \"Reform\", now as an independent auditor for the CPD. His first case is investigating Halstead following a shooting which led to the death of a little girl. It is revealed that Halstead shot a gang member first, and that the bullet went through the gang member, through a wood door, and then hit the little girl. Despite this, Woods continues to go after Halstead until Voight works out a side deal with Alderman Ray Price ([[Wendell Pierce]]). In \"Fallen\", he blackmails Adam Ruzek into getting incriminating evidence to take Voight down after Ruzek is caught deleting information on a DUI charge his sister received while his nephew was in the car. He receives a video of Halstead in a bar fight while undercover, but he does not bite and asks for more. He is arrested in \"Homecoming\" after he is caught bribing a witness into admitting that she saw Voight with his son's killer the night he died. It is revealed that Voight had set him up with the witness, and then proceeded to turn the recording of him bribing her over to Internal Affairs.  \n* Deputy Superintendent Katherine Brennan ([[Anne Heche]]) is the second in command of the Chicago Police Department and Brian Kelton's number two. She is introduced in 'Bad Boys' where Voight goes to her to exonerate Olinsky after his death. She resigns in 'Confession', where it is revealed that Kelton blackmailed her into taking the fall for his wrongdoings. In 'Reckoning', she gives Voight the name of a drug dealer associated with Kelton as Intelligence looked to take him down. But, in 'Doubt' she reveals herself to be the murderer of Kelton, and is eventually arrested by Halstead and Upton.\n* Superintendent Brian Kelton ([[John C. McGinley]]) was the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department and the new mayor of Chicago. It is revealed in 'The Forgotten', that when Kelton was a commander in 2016, he covered up a serial killer's murders in order to keep his stats intact. He sent a homicide detective in to jam up Intelligence in the search for the serial killer, which led to the death of Voight's CI. Voight then proceeds to give Kelton's mayoral candidate Ray Price evidence that Kelton did cover up the murders. It is revealed later than if Kelton were to win the mayoral race, he would disband the Intelligence Unit. In 'Reckoning', it is revealed he won the mayoral race by a landslide, due to his top opponent being arrested for murder. However, he is killed by Brennan in his house only hours after being voted as the next Mayor of Chicago.\n* Superintendent Jason Crawford ([[Paul Adelstein]]) is the interim Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department following the murder of Brian Kelton.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2476643/chicago-pd-adds-prison-break-vet-to-fill-void-left-by-jon-seda|title=Chicago P.D. Adds Prison Break Vet To Fill Void Left By Jon Seda|date=2019-07-17|website=CINEMABLEND|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> He is introduced in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep130|Assets]]\", where Voight makes an off the books deal to list Darius Walker as a confidential informant in exchange for the obstruction charges against [[List of Chicago P.D. characters#Adam Ruzek|Adam Ruzek]] being dismissed. He is shown to be a proponent of smart technology in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep134|False Positive]]\", giving Intelligence a beta version of facial recognition software in order to find the killer of 2 kids who were in the crossfire of a drug deal gone wrong. The software backfires when it identifies the wrong suspect and the suspect is killed in county jail, and Voight and Crawford are forced to cover it up by framing the wrong suspect and handing off the actual killer to the gang that got robbed. He returns in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep140|The Devil You Know]]\" when Voight comes to him about an Intelligence case where three highly decorated police officers are behind a number of illegal drug deals, only for the officers to be executed by Darius Walker in order to cover up his involvement in it. Crawford and Voight proceed to cover up the crime scene to make it look like the officers died as heroes as opposed to corrupt cops.\n\n===Criminals and informants===\n* Andres Diaz, aka Pulpo (English: \"The Octopus\") (Arturo del Puerto) is a drug lord and criminal, so nicknamed because he \"had [his] hands everywhere\". He has dual American and Colombian citizenship and was said to work for a cartel in [[Medell\u00edn]]. In the series pilot \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep1|Stepping Stone]]\", Pulpo is the main person of interest in Voight and the Intelligence Unit's investigations after they discover two dead drug dealers who were beheaded and had their heads displayed prominently nearby.\n* Maurice Owens (David Aron Damane) is head of a local gang and one of Voight's informants. He was arrested by patrol officers who witnessed him dealing drugs but Voight bails him out because of his value as an informant. Through Maurice's tip, Voight was able to get a lead on Pulpo in season 1. He also appeared on ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' in the episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" and provided Voight with some information about a possible suspect involved in the fire at led to [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Hallie Thomas|Dr. Hallie Thomas]]' death. As of season 3, according to Voight, he is in prison.<ref name=\"CasesThatNeed\"/>\n* Lonnie Rodiger (Matthew Sherbach) was a young pedophile who was suspected of murdering several boys, including Ben Corson, the younger brother of [[#Jay Halstead|Detective Halstead]]'s high school sweetheart, some years ago. Halstead would park his car outside the Rodiger home in plain view every year on Ben's death anniversary to make his point to Lonnie that he had not forgotten about Ben and the other murder victims, prompting Lonnie's father Phil to file a [[restraining order]] against Halstead and Voight to give Halstead a stern warning to back off before things get out of control. Lonnie was found dead in the episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep10|At Least It's Justice]]\". Halstead was the prime suspect but was exonerated when Phil confessed to killing his son in a fit of rage upon discovering incriminating photos on Lonnie's computer.\n* Gregory Yates (n\u00e9 Williams) ([[Dallas Roberts]]) was a [[sociopath]]ic serial killer who targeted women. He was said to responsible for several unsolved murders in New York. A notable aspect of his crimes was his usage of sadistic torture methods with the intention of letting his victims die slow and painful deaths. His last victim prior to his arrest by the Chicago PD Intelligence Unit was Nadia Decotis. In season 3 he escapes police custody and goes on a rampage while on his mission for revenge.\n\n* Darius Walker ([[Michael Beach]]) was a drug kingpin who Intelligence targeted to get in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep130|Assets]]\". He's arrested when he's caught while in the process of completing a drug deal with his supplier. Due to his presence in the community and his ability to keep his subordinates disciplined, Voight goes to Superintendent Crawford to approve a deal where they keep Walker on the streets as a cooperating defendant to Intelligence while also getting the obstruction charges against Ruzek dropped. In \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep135|Informant]]\", Voight goes to Walker to help Intelligence find who supplied their victim with fentanyl that led to his overdose. When one of Upton's CIs accidentally spots Walker inside the 21st District, it is implied that Walker orchestrated the murder of her CI in order to prevent word going out he was a CI. He is killed in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep140|The Devil You Know]]\" when Upton outs him as a snitch to avenge the death of her CI and the deaths of three police officers who were stealing drugs from the evidence lockup.\n\n===Other===\n* Steve Kot (Chris Agos) is an Assistant State's Attorney who often prosecutes perpetrators arrested by the Intelligence Unit and sometimes gives them advice on legal matters regarding their cases. In season 2 he crosses paths with Intelligence and was the prosecutor of notorious [[Polish-American organized crime|Polish mobster]] Oscar Bembenek, getting a successful conviction. His sixteen-year-old daughter Dora was shot execution-style in broad daylight as part of Bembenek's plot to seek revenge on those he held responsible for his imprisonment.<ref name=\"TheWeighStation\"/> The character has also crossed over to ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]''.\n* Ray Price ([[Wendell Pierce]]) is an alderman who collaborated with Voight on occasion. He is introduced in \"Reform\", where he proceeds to go after Halstead after the accidental shooting of a little girl. He and Voight come to terms on a deal later, where Price will lay off of Halstead while Voight will release a gang member who was thought to be a lookout, who is actually revealed to be the mastermind of the gang. He returns in \"Fallen\", where he and Voight conspire to keep quiet about how the murder of CPD Vice Sergeant Sean McGrady by drug dealer and suspected murderer Quinton Kane is actually a suicide to free McGrady of his mounting debt. In \"Politics\", he asks that Voight to get him crime scene pictures of a Congressman who was a person of interest in the murder of a prostitute who was later cleared. Voight initially refuses, citing the Congressman's support of the CPD and his stellar reputation, but Price responds by threatening to reveal the true cause of Sgt. McGrady's death. Voight then proceeds to give him the photos. He returns in \"Night in Chicago\", talking to Kevin Atwater about what Atwater the night an unarmed African-American was shot by Chicago police officers during a traffic stop. He enters the Chicago mayoral race in \"Good Men\", and is the top opponent against Brian Kelton. He tries to convince Voight to get into politics, and Voight is initially hesitant. Following the death of Voight's CI, caused by the coverup of Superintendent Kelton, Voight gives Price evidence that incriminates Kelton in the cover-up of the murders of a serial killer. In \"Pain Killer\", Price is shot by a sniper and thought to be an assassination attempt initially. It is later revealed that the Voight was the intended target of the sniper. In \"This City\", he and Voight work as peacemakers to attempt to end a gang war that has killed innocent people. In \"What Could Have Been\", Price is at the top of the polls in the mayoral race, but is arrested for the murder of Kelton's top political consultant and [[Kim Burgess|Kim Burgess']] boyfriend, taking the fall for his wife, who killed him to cover-up the drug overdose of a college student caused by drugs that were given to her by the Prices's daughter.\n* Blair Williams ([[Charles Michael Davis]]) was a political consultant who worked on Brian Kelton's mayoral campaign. Originally from Connecticut, he was arrested when he was 17 for possession of drugs that belonged to his father. He attended [[Princeton University]], majoring in political science. He had a fling with [[Kim Burgess]] during his time in Chicago, and was planning on moving to Chicago to be with her. He is killed in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 6)#ep125|What Could Have Been]]\" by Alicia Price in an attempt to cover-up the death of a woman who overdosed on drugs given to her by Price's daughter, Jasmine. Alicia's husband, Ray takes the fall for her in exchange for a favorable deal.\n\n===Minor characters===\n<!--characters who appear in less than 4 episodes but have a significant storyline, or future recurring role...-->\n* FBI Agent Troy Kivisto (Himself) - Enters the sphere in season 5, portraying the cooperation the FBI Chicago Division has gained working with the Chicago Police Department.  He brings to the set his vast \"real-life\" military and law enforcement background, including his years working undercover in a task force, as a supervisor, as well as participating in numerous Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) cases with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Illinois State Police (ISP).    \n* Detective Julia Willhite ([[Melissa Sagemiller]]) was the partner of [[Antonio Dawson]]. She appeared in both ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' (1 episode) and ''Chicago P.D.''. The character was killed in the premiere of ''Chicago P.D.'' and was the catalyst for Detective Voight's feud with Lieutenant Belden. She was declared [[Dead on arrival|DOA]] after Belden's decision to withhold information backfires and she and Dawson walk into a trap as a result. Her husband Dr. Alec Willhite (Erik Hellman) has also appeared in several episodes of both ''Fire'' and ''P.D.''. The couple have two children.\n* Lieutenant Bruce Belden ([[Kurt Naebig]]) was from the Violent Crimes Unit and Voight's nemesis. In the show's premiere, he withheld information from Voight's team, leading Detectives Willhite and Dawson to walk into a trap and Willhite was killed as a result. Voight blamed Belden for her death. Belden frequently butt heads with Voight over the Pulpo case. It is revealed that Pulpo had played on Belden's over-zealousness to play \"by the book\" and contradict Voight at any given chance. He is murdered during Pulpo's escape from police custody.\n* Charlie Pugliese ([[Billy Wirth]]) is a former associate of [[Erin Lindsay]] who became a person of interest during an investigation. Voight rescued her from Charlie and she has thus far refused to disclose what really happened, even telling Halstead that he would not want to know the full story. Based on the brief but tense conversations between her and Charlie, it is presumed that he may have taken her in when she was living on the streets and forced her to commit crimes in exchange for food and shelter.\n* Teddy Courtney ([[Lou Taylor Pucci]]) is the half-brother of Erin Lindsay and son of Bunny. He and Lindsay were once close but lost contact after he \"disappeared\" from home (Bunny assumed he ran away). A photo of him was found in the basement of a house fire which [[Kelly Severide|Lieutenant Severide]] and 51 had responded to. Severide saw the victim clutching a box of pictures and handed it to Voight's team. While sifting through the photos, Lindsay discovers one of a young Teddy. In a three-way crossover (see \"[[Chicago Crossover]]\"), Intelligence and [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s Detective Benson and her [[Law & Order:Special Victims Unit|SVU]] team investigate a highly sophisticated pedophile ring-cum-child trafficking syndicate that has operated out of Chicago and New York City for many years. Teddy is found in New York City where he is now a male prostitute. His testimony would lead to the shutting down of the ring.\n\n==Crossover characters==\n<!--characters who have made 4 or more appearances-->\n\n===''Chicago Fire''===\n{{Main|List of Chicago Fire characters}}\n* Gabriela \"Gabby\" Dawson ([[Monica Raymund]]) is the younger sister of [[Antonio Dawson]].

In season 1 he sometimes rubbed his superior Detective Sergeant Hank Voight the wrong way for questioning the latter's actions.

For example, he conducts his own surveillance of Lonnie Rodiger, a young pedophile whom he correctly suspected of murdering young boys, including the younger brother of his high school girlfriend Allie. In the [[Chicago P.D. (season 2)#ep22|season 2 crossover]] with ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', when Will was called in for questioning by Sergeant Benson from the NYPD SVU and Voight as Will knew a victim, Halstead storms into Voight's office and tells them that they will get a written statement from Will and nothing more. Likewise, in season 6, he disobeyed Voight's order to stay on desk duty upon hearing that the fire his father died in was an arson and continued to pursue the case by himself.\n\nIn the pilot episode, it is established that Halstead had been partnered with [[Erin Lindsay]] for the past month and they share a close relationship, which has evolved into a more intimate relationship at various times (which they have had to keep secret) but prevented from going any further due to Voight's dislike of \"in-house romances\". She tries to set him up on dates with her friends in the first several episodes of season 1 but soon realizes that she has feelings for him. He was presumably the first person Lindsay had confided her past to, in full detail.

She rescues him in the nick of time and decides to return to Intelligence, where she is again partnered with Halstead. They reconnect and rekindle their relationship. In the episode \"You Never Know Who's Who\", they go public for the first time by openly kissing while hanging out at Molly's.<ref name=\"YouNeverKnow\"/> They generally maintain a professional front when at work; Burgess once told Lindsay that she \"[forgets] sometimes that you and Jay are dating, 'cause you guys make it look so easy'\".<ref name=\"IfWeWereNormal\">{{Cite episode|title=If We Were Normal|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

At the end of the episode \"Fork in the Road\", he was seen making a call to Lindsay to propose to her but it was seen that she did not answer the call. It is later revealed that she was leaving for New York City after a series of incidents from the episode essentially led to her accepting a job there and escape further scrutiny from the CPD.\n\nIn season 5 premiere \"Reform\", he is partnered with Hailey Upton and their partnership continues to be rocky. He is a subject in an investigation and scrutiny from public when a drug deal went wrong. When a young girl was shot during the ordeal (and eventually died at Chicago Med), later on showed that the bullet came from his gun.\n\nIn \"Care Under Fire\", it became known that he is still having nightmares about his tours in Afghanistan. He went undercover to infiltrate a kidnapping crew composed of military veterans and struck up a friendship with Luis Vega, his \"target\", due to their shared background as former Rangers who had been deployed to Afghanistan. When the target is killed, his flashbacks came up causing him to dangerously come close to shooting Upton. During the episode, he gets into a relationship with Camila Vega, Luis's sister. He continues to pose as Ryan and does not reveal his true identity to her.<ref name=\"S05E07\"/>\n\nIn \"Rabbit Hole\", the relationship between Halstead and his new girlfriend Camila takes a dramatic turn when he unintentionally gets himself in the middle of a drug operation and a murder of an undercover DEA agent. He later finds out that Camila is a person of interest. But later in the investigation, she confesses that she was recruiting people to become drug dealers. When Voight sees that Halstead was acting strange, he asks him if he was in a relationship with her, he lied and denied it. But when the sting in getting the murderer to confess falls apart, his colleagues rushes in the garage and as she was getting arrested, she realizes that he was a cop. As she was sitting in a jail cell, Upton convinces Camila to not see Halstead again and to not speak of their relationship to anyone or face spending years in prison. In the following episode \"Confidential\", he was placed on desk duty by Voight and was ordered to see a psychiatrist. He eventually returned to the field and admitted to Upton in the episode \"Chasing Monsters\" that he found therapy helpful and was finally addressing his PTSD.\n\nAfter a rocky start to his new partnership with Upton in season 5, the duo have since become close friends and confidants, often supporting one another after difficult cases.\n\nIn \"Endings\", after his father was declared brain dead, he investigated who the person responsible for the fire. During the investigation, it became known that Daniel Mendoza, a drug cartel member, was the one responsible. When attempting to take his brother Juan Mendoza, into custody, he almost gets into an altercation with him only for Upton and Ruzek to stop him. Voight benches Halstead due to his personal connection to the case. Jay is so enraged by this that he insults Upton's dad, saying she's projecting her own father issues. Upton, being tired of him using her as a punching bag, demanded to hand the keys to her. He calls Severide to give him a radio and a ride. He then takes a radio from a uniformed officer and chases after Daniel on foot, he was shot and wounded by Mendoza who was attempting to evade police. He, in return, shot and killed him. Voight berates him for going against his orders and that their conversation is not over.\n\nIn the season 6 episode \"Trigger\", he was visibly affected by the fact that a fellow veteran would frame a local [[imam]] and kill innocent people in a deluded quest to prove that the imam was financially supporting terrorist activity; for the first time on the show, Halstead spoke at length about his time in the military and commented that he had learned to live with his PTSD and move on with life, unlike the perpetrator.<ref name=\"Trigger\"/>\n\nIn \"Outrage\", while working undercover in a drug bust, it went sideways when the team identified the suspect as Matthew Garrett, a perp who Halstead thought was in prison. Jay tried to bail before any trouble started, but Garrett had also recognize him and publicly called him out, leading to a brief confrontation. As he left the club, Jay described the guy as \u201cthe devil.\u201d A paperwork SNAFU led to Garrett getting a huge payoff for wrongful arrest, and now he was using it to fund his drug operation. Halstead particularly hated him because Garrett killed a 17-year-old girl. With Halstead benched by Voight over an official complaint against him, they went ahead of the drug bust. Instead of Garrett, his two henchmen were there. Upon finding out the location, Halstead was the first person through the warehouse door and found Garrett shot in the neck. He died shortly thereafter, leaving Jay without the location of the murdered girl's body. When investigated by Internal Affairs, Voight instructed Halstead to lie and say Garrett died before he got there, instead of in front of him. Kelton along with everyone, was convinced that Halstead was the prime suspect in his murder. Voight goes to his old friend, former Detective Gus for answers, while there, he confesses to murder and tells to look the other way. When he couldn't, he gives him \"some time alone\" in which he committed suicide and Halstead was off the hook.\n\n====Crossovers====\nHalstead first appeared on ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' as a recurring character before becoming a main character on ''[[Chicago PD (TV series)|Chicago PD]]''. Within the [[Chicago (franchise)|''Chicago'' franchise]], the character has crossed-over to ''Fire'' and ''Med'' as part of the CPD investigation. He also appeared on ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' to assist with cross-jurisdiction cases.\n\nThe character was introduced in season 2 as a regular customer at Molly's, a bar jointly run by paramedic [[Gabriela Dawson]] and her firefighter colleagues. He had fallen for Gabby but she breaks up with him upon finding out he was a \"henchman\" of Arthur, a local thug who had threatened to burn down Molly's. Although her brother [[Antonio Dawson|Antonio]] tells her that Halstead was actually a cop, Gabby decides to end their relationship, as she had felt betrayed even though she understood that Halstead could not blow his cover. They part on friendly terms after Halstead successfully arrests Arthur and taking a bullet to his shoulder in the process. As a result, he opts out of undercover work and joins Antonio in the Intelligence Unit.<ref name=\"Joyriding\">{{cite episode |title=Joyriding|episodelink=Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep30|series=Chicago Fire|serieslink=Chicago Fire (TV series)|network=[[NBC]]|airdate=November 12, 2013|season=2|number=6}}</ref>\n\nHalstead also appeared in later in the season as the lead detective of a murder case involving Gabby's colleague at Firehouse 51. One of [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Kelly Severide|Lieutenant Severide]]'s men Jeff Clarke was a suspect when the ex-lover of his wife was found dead. The ex-lover turned out to be a loanshark who repeatedly harassed the Clarkes to the point where Clarke has verbally threatened him and had gone to his house with a sniper rifle intending to kill him. Clarke, an [[Iraq]] veteran, later admitted that he tried to protect his wife because she had been there for him when he came home from his deployment, to which Halstead replied that he understood and could sympathize.\n\nHalstead was a central character in the 2018 crossovers with ''Chicago Fire'' and ''Chicago Med''.<ref name=\"Endings\"/> Firehouse 51 firefighters were called to the apartment building where his father Pat lives. Pat eventually died at Chicago Medical Center of complications from his injuries. Unlike Will, who had reconciled with their father in the ''Med'' episode \"[[Chicago Med (season 2)#ep38|Generation Gap]]\", Jay never did and only found out the truth after sifting through his father's belongings and finding a picture of him during his graduation from the CPD academy.\n\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep25|A Problem House]]\" (September 24, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep26|Prove It]]\" (October 1, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep27|Defcon 1]]\" (October 8, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep28|A Nuisance Call]]\" (October 15, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep29|A Power Move]]\" (October 22, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep30|Joyriding]]\" (November 12, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep35|Shoved in My Face]]\" (January 7, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep44|A Dark Day (1)]]\" (April 29, 2014)\n* ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'': \"[[Chicago Crossover]]\" (November 12, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep55|Arrest in Transit]]\" (November 25, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep57|Let Him Die]]\" (January 6, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'': \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep65|I Am The Apocalypse]]\" (April 7, 2015)\n* ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'': \"[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 16)#ep363|Daydream Believer]]\" (April 29, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Med'': \"[[Chicago Med (season 1)#ep4|Mistaken]]\" (December 8, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Med'': \"[[Chicago Med (season 1)#ep5|Malignant]]\" (January 5, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Med'': \"[[Chicago Med (season 2)#ep26|Free Will]]\" (November 10, 2016)\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThese are the medals fictionally worn by Halstead.<ref name=\"FortyCaliber\"/>\n\n{| style=\"width=100%;\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Personal decorations'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=1|type=oak|name=Army Achievement Medal ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Achievement Medal#Army|Army Achievement Medal]], w/1 bronze oak leaf cluster (2nd award)\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Unit awards'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=2|type=oak|name=Presidential Unit Citation ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]], w/2 bronze oak leaf clusters (3rd award)\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=3|type=oak|name=Valorous Unit Award ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Valorous Unit Award]], w/3 bronze oak leaf clusters (4th award)\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Service Awards'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|name=Army Good Conduct ribbon|width=60}}\n|[[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Army Good Conduct Medal]]\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Campaign and service medals'''\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=National Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[National Defense Service Medal]]\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=Afghanistan Campaign ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Afghanistan Campaign Medal]], w/1 bronze service star (2nd award)\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal]]\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Global War on Terrorism Service ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Global War on Terrorism Service Medal]]\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Service and training awards'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Army Service Ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Army Service Ribbon]]\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Army Overseas Service Ribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Overseas Service Ribbon]]\n|}\n|valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Other accoutrements'''\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:Combat Infantry Badge.svg|100px]]\n|[[Combat Infantryman Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:US Army Airborne basic parachutist badge.gif|100px]]\n|[[Parachutist Badge (United States)|Parachutist Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:ArmyQualExpert.JPG|100px]]\n|[[Marksmanship Badge (United States)|Army Expert Marksmanship Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:75th Ranger Regiment CSIB.svg|100px]]\n|[[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]] [[Combat Service Identification Badge]]\n|-\n| align=center | [[File:Ranger Tab.svg|100px]]\n|[[Ranger tab]]\n|}\n|}\n\n===Adam Ruzek===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Adam Ruzek\n| image_size         = 250\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

In season 5, he is blackmailed by Denny Woods into spying on the team in order to save himself and his sister from prison, and his nephew from going to foster care.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Ruzek was still in the academy and about to graduate when he was handpicked by [[#Alvin Olinsky|Detective Alvin Olinsky]] for an undercover assignment. The first season sees him trying to adjust to his new role in the intelligence unit. Although he was warmly welcomed by the team, his impulsive behavior has occasionally landed him into trouble with Voight and Olinsky and irked his more senior colleagues. His naivet\u00e9 becomes apparent during his first stakeout, when he repeatedly looks at his phone and makes bathroom breaks. Olinsky temporarily had him transferred to uniformed patrol duty as a warning.<ref name=\"DifferentMistakes\"/> Over time, he begins to settle in and becomes more mature and less impetuous. In the season 3 episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 3)#ep43|Climbing into Bed]]\", Ruzek has his badge temporarily revoked for going undercover without authorization. Platt reluctantly pulls some strings to lighten his punishment and Voight assures her that Ruzek was worth the risk. He strikes up a friendship with [[#Kevin Atwater|Officer Kevin Atwater]], who transfers to Intelligence from patrol in season 2, and they often banter with one another.\n\nIn season 1, Ruzek was engaged to a woman named Wendy. They are shown to have a close and playful relationship, sending racy photos of each other back and forth. He tries to keep his professional and private lives separate but has difficulty doing so. He tells her that he was assigned to a desk job at district headquarters, which she eventually discovers is not true after he was shot.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=At Least It's Justice|episodelink=|series=Chicago P.D.|serieslink=Chicago P.D.

It gradually becomes apparent to Burgess that Ruzek had commitment issues. She begins to doubt him after learning that he had an ex-fianc\u00e9e before Wendy. At the end of \"[[Chicago P.D. (Season 3)#ep50|Looking Out for Stateville]],\" she calls off the engagement in the same placed he proposed, leaving them both devastated. When Burgess and her partner [[#Sean Roman|Sean Roman]] appear to be flirting, he becomes jealous and their friendship becomes strained.<ref name=\"IfWeWereNormal\"/>\n\nIn season 3, it was revealed that Ruzek still loves Kim and wants nothing more than resume his relationship with her.\n\nDuring a shootout with Jacob Sims, Adam is shot in the chest. The injury is not severe as his Kevlar vest deflected most of the shot.\n\nIn middle of season 4, Ruzek returns from an undercover job, hoping his job with intelligence is still open, but when he was gone his spot got taken by a guy named Kenny Rixton. Ruzek then talks to Voight about his old spot in Intelligence and if he can get it back. Voight cannot give Ruzek his old spot so he had to work in Uniform. Ruzek is cleaning his locker when Rixton tells him that he is transferring to a newly formed Narcotics unit. Ruzek then gets his job back in Intelligence, but does not get back together with Kim.\n\nIn the season 5 premiere \"Reform\", he appears to be more aggressive with the public, and when Atwater explains to him about the interactions between police and black men. He shrugged off by explain the problems with [[political correctness]].\n\nIn \"Snitch\", his aggressive behavior takes a toll when he punches a suspect and Upton manages to get him out of the situation; he comes briefly under investigation by Internal Affairs but it is dropped when Upton convinces the mother of the suspect's child to get him to withdraw the complaint.\n\nIn \"Fallen\", Ruzek was recruited by Lieutenant Denny Woods, after Woods finds evidence that he deletes information that his sister was charged in a DUI while his nephew was sitting in the car with her. Woods uses it to blackmail Ruzek into getting incriminating evidence to take Voight down.\n\nIn \"Care Under Fire\", Ruzek uploads video of Halstead, while undercover, in a bar fight. He gives it to Woods during a disclosed meeting.\n\nIn \"Monster\", he gets Voight on video taking money from a crime scene without putting it into evidence. Ruzek intends to give it to Woods but when he meets with Woods, he refuses to give him the video because of loyalty towards Voight. Olinsky persuades Ruzek to go with him to meet a CI, but instead drives him to meet with Voight, who has discovered that Ruzek was the mole.\n\nIn \"Rabbit Hole\", Ruzek tries to explain the situation to Voight but is cut short. While Voight cannot do anything about the threatened charges against Ruzek, he conspires with Ruzek to take down Woods. When Ruzek meets with Woods, Woods shoves him onto the car, accusing him of undermining Wood's credibility, since the money actually was put into evidence by Voight, unknown to Ruzek. When this meeting was over, it was revealed Voight was there watching it go down.\n\nAt the end of \"Confidential\", after apologizing about the way he treated Burgess during his relationship with her, they end up having a one-night stand.\n\nIn \"Homecoming\", Ruzek found out that Olinsky had died from his injuries sustained from the stabbing; he supports Voight's actions by trying to block Antonio from intervening in Voight's beating of the killer. He is also present when Voight beats one of the co-conspirators to force him to give the name of who was in charge.\n\nIn \"New Normal\", with Voight suspended, Antonio was put in charge of the unit, Ruzek begins to butt heads with Dawson. Ruzek was getting in touch with Voight for assistance when the investigation into bad drugs was getting nowhere but dead bodies at every turn. He screams at Antonio for Voight not being there. Later, both Ruzek and Dawson have opposing views on good police work to the point of getting into a violent brawl in a dope lab.\n\nIn \"Bad Boys\", he starts a relationship with Hailey Upton, while keeping it a secret from others. In \"Sacrifice\", Upton ended the relationship with him citing their own careers.\n\nIn \"Fathers and Sons\", while Ruzek working undercover in an investigation of a drug dealing ring that involves the brutal death of a young drug mule, he finds out that his father, Disco Bob, is also involved. So the next morning he visits his father's house for a meeting of the minds. Bob says he's just \u201cgetting paid\u201d and there's nothing else his son needs to know about, but wants his name kept out of the report. Upon this discovery, Upton demands that he either tells Voight about his father's involvement or she will. Ruzek chooses the first option and tries to convince Voight that his father is clean. Voight appears skeptical, telling his subordinate that they're going to follow the facts, no matter where that takes them. Bob accidentally stumbles into the drug deal, which incites a shootout that gets him wounded and blows everyone's cover. Ruzek visits his dad in the hospital and demands to know why he didn't get out when he was warned to. Bob admits that he took the Scorpion Club job because he's broke, thanks to \u201csome bad investments.\u201d He gets teary-eyed as he apologizes for messing up the case and wanting to try and help his son. Voight confirms that Bob was innocent and says that since he \u201cwas working undercover with us\u201d to cover him.\n\nIn \"Descent\", after Voight and Ruzek capture Jason Rizzo, a drug dealer/rapist responsible for kidnapping Antonio's daughter, they let Antonio beat up the suspect to the point that he was pushed to his death. In \"Brotherhood\", upon learning of Antonio's addiction in \"Descent\", he covers for him at the same time when the OID was investigating about the events that transpired, infuriating Voight to point of almost getting into altercation with him. In \"Reckoning\", during a meeting with Platt, Voight, and Antonio, they learn that Internal Affairs had taken over the investigation. When he gets called in by Internal Affairs Detective David Heller, he sticks to his story of what had happened, despite the fact that the detective had already known that Antonio was responsible. He almost gets to altercation with Voight, with Voight citing that he is not Alvin Olinsky. At the end, Trudy walks into the unit, saying IAD is there to arrest Adam, but she will take him down to save him the scene, while everyone is opposed to the outcome. Adam appreciates them wanting to come down but doesn't want them to. Everyone is upset, but Antonio remains mum. Trudy walks Adam out, who touches the door; telling him to do more than keep his head down especially if he ends up in General Population, She tries to keep talking but Adam kisses her, saying he will be all right. Heller arrests him and escorts him into the car. Adam goes through the booking process as Antonio sits in the car, popping a pill. Adam sits in the holding cell as the barred door slams shut.\n\nIn \"Doubt\", Ruzek has been stripped of his police powers and he is awaiting trial. However, in \"Assets\", Ruzek's case was dismissed by a favor pulled by Voight, which grants Ruzek his position in Intelligence once again; this event fortifies his loyalty to the latter.\n\n====Crossovers====\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep51|The Nuclear Option]]\" (September 30, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep65|I Am The Apocalypse]]\" (April 7, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep78|Short and Fat]]\" (December 8, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep79|The Beating Heart]]\" (January 5, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep83|All Hard Parts]]\" (February 9, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 6)#ep127|Hiding Not Seeking]]\" (March 8, 2018)\n* ''Chicago Med'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Med (season 4)#ep79|Tell Me the Truth]]\" (April 3, 2019)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 7)#ep156|Until the Weather Breaks]]\" (April 24, 2019)\n\n===Kevin Atwater===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Kevin Atwater\n| image_size         = 250\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

Both Atwater and Burgess were constant targets of [[Trudy Platt|Desk Sergeant Platt]]'s sarcasm. There was a running gag where Platt would assign them a different squad car if they talked back to her sarcastic remarks and mishaps would take place. In \"Thirty Balloons\", after going above and beyond in a hoarder deal, he and Burgess are given a new patrol car the district was given. They are told to keep it in mint condition since Commander Perry is going to drive it in a parade. However, when dealing with a drug mule, the mirror was wrecked when the drug mule tackled Atwater.

During the investigation, it was found that he was killed in jail by another inmate and the charges was dropped. Peter Stone apologizes to him in court room for rushing to judgement.\n\nIn \"Big Friends, Big Enemies\", Burgess spots Atwater's younger brother, Jordan, while out visiting potential shooters and targets. Ever since, he keeps a close eye on him to see if he does not follow the wrong path.\n\nIn \"Snitch\", it is known that his little brother, Jordan, was born on October 18, 2002 when he, Burgess, and his friends were celebrating his 15th birthday and Atwater keeps a close relationship with the people in his community. During the investigation into the murder of a mini-mart owner, Roland, Atwater finds out that his brother was involved when he witnessed the murder and confronts him. He identified a gang banger named Curtis as the murder suspect and saw him throw the murder weapon in the nearby dumpster. Following a foot chase, Atwater eventually tracks down Curtis in an alley at gunpoint. Atwater encourages Curtis to go for his gun, which would give him a reason to shoot him, and Voight even suggests that Curtis could go for a second weapon on his ankle. But Atwater, in the end, does not pull the trigger and takes him in custody. In \"Home\", after his sister was attacked for the events that happened in \"Snitch\", he decides to let them move to Texas to ensure their safety. He still keeps in contact with them and misses them dearly.\n\nIn \"Captive\", in the middle of [[Trudy Platt]]'s birthday karaoke party he receives a phone call in which prompts him to leave Molly's to check up on an anonymous person. Only to find out the person's house had been broken into, and another person holds Atwater at gunpoint and knocks him unconscious in which he ditches his badge. When Platt checks his phone, and gets the address of the tossed hours, which is in the name of Joe Baker \u2014 a known drug dealer who has also missing. He was found chained to the ground in the abandoned church when Hailey finds a video on social media of Joe getting assaulted. When Atwater and Joe connect, it was revealed that seven years ago his son Ronnie Baker attempted to rob a store and murdered a clerk in the process after he gives chase and when he refuses to comply orders to surrender, he points his gun to Atwater, and he manages to shoot and kill him. Later found that Joe's sister Michelle had stayed in touch with him and told him to check on her brother. It was also revealed that the city of Chicago had paid Joe $20,000 in settlement which proves his doubt of Atwater's story. Atwater tearfully insists that he thinks about Joe's son every night before he goes to bed \u2014 but he also thinks about the clerk who Joe's son robbed, too. His captors were from a drug gang, Billy and Reimundo Morales who had accused them both of taking his drugs a few weeks earlier. And when Joe in revenge tries to his captors about his real identity, Atwater not only says he's a drug dealer, but claims he's the one who stole the cocaine to begin with. He ended up getting drilled in the leg by a power drill by Morales. Prior to the kidnapping, a girl named Elisa was brought in for questioning in which she confesses that she had drugged Joe and brought him to Morales. With one of the men shot dead by Antonio, Atwater manages to get himself and Joe to escape and eventually get into a fight with Morales for the gun. Joe comes to the rescue by shooting Morales with the service weapon he took off Atwater, that was knocked away in the fight. As soon as it over, Joe puts the gun to Atwater's head and demands to know the full story of his son's shooting. Atwater trying to convince Joe to put the gun down, because he sees the rest of Intelligence coming into the room, and did not want him to die, too. Joe drops the weapon and gets carried to the hospital. Atwater asks him to drug charges against him only to found out by Voight that Joe's friend Calvin Hill had stolen the drugs and set him up. Kevin tells Joe that his son's last words were about not getting on his knees for anyone, in which the same words that Joe put into his son's head. Atwater ends up consoling him.\n\nIn \"Trigger\", while working under undercover in the mosque to investigate a bombing at an Army's recruitment office, he was mistaken to be one of the combatants and was almost subjected to an enhanced interrogation not before Voight and FBI Agent William Graff stormed and Graff offering to apologize for his actions.\n\nIn \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 6)#ep119|Night in Chicago]]\", Atwater goes undercover and befriends a criminal named Daryl Ingram in order to take down the head of a criminal enterprise. While he and Daryl are in Daryl's car, they are pulled over by CPD Officers Tom Doyle and Jim Harper. During the stop, Doyle is overly aggressive with Atwater and Daryl, going as far saying racial slurs at them and drawing his gun, despite both of them being unarmed. They are arrested by the two officers on suspicion of robbery, but Daryl is shot and killed by Officer Doyle. Atwater is conflicted about what to say to Internal Affairs and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, but it is revealed that Daryl did go for Officer Doyle's gun. Voight tells him to do what he thinks is right, as to remember that he gets paid to be a cop, not to change the world. It is revealed that Atwater told the Civilian Office of Police Accountability that it was a clean shooting, clearing Doyle. Atwater meets with Doyle in a bar with the intent to fight him, doing so. He and Doyle fight, and it ends with Atwater putting his gun against Doyle's head, doing what Doyle did to him at the traffic stop.\n\nIn \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep148|Silence of the Night]]\", Atwater is forced to pair up with Doyle, who was promoted to detective in Area South since the events of \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 6)#ep119|Night in Chicago]]\" to bring down a biker who was selling guns. While coming from a gun deal, Doyle stops a black man who he believes to be carrying a suspicious bag, and pursues him into a building, resulting in the deaths of the man and Doyle at the hands of two gang members. Atwater becomes conflicted since Doyle had no probable cause to stop the man and the gang members in the building who shot Doyle shot him in self defense since he was waving his service weapon around. Atwater proceeds to report that Doyle had no probable cause to stop the man, holding the knowledge that a wrongful death lawsuit of the man Doyle pursued will be initiated, a deep Internal Affairs investigation on Atwater and Doyle will occur, the city being sued for millions, and the family of Doyle (a third generation cop) as well as fellow officers who were his friends heavily monitoring and threatening him. At the end of the episode, Voight tells Atwater that he and Intelligence will support Atwater's decision before Atwater heads home to find multiple officers staking out his house.   \n\n====Crossovers====\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" (May 15, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep25|A Problem House]]\" (September 24, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep26|Prove It]]\" (October 1, 2013)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep37|Tonight's the Night]]\" (January 21, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 2)#ep44|A Dark Day]]\" (April 29, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep49|Just Drive the Truck]]\" (October 7, 2014)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 3)#ep58|Ambush Predator]]\" (January 13, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep78|Short and Fat]]\" (December 8, 2015)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep88|I Will Be Walking]]\" (April 19, 2016)\n* ''Chicago Justice'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Justice#Season 1 (2017)|Uncertainty Principle]]\" (March 5, 2017)\n* ''Chicago Justice'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Justice#Season 1 (2017)|Drill]]\" (April 23, 2017)\n* ''Chicago Fire'' \u2013 \"[[Chicago Fire (season 7)#ep141|This Isn't Charity]]\" (October 17, 2018)\n\n===Kim Burgess===\n{{Main|Kim Burgess}}\n\n===Sean Roman===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Sean Roman\n| first              = '''''[[Chicago P.D.

As the desk sergeant, she is the immediate superior of the district's patrol officers. She was previously a training officer ([[Antonio Dawson]] was one of her trainees during his days walking the beat) and had passed the detective's exam twice but had to take a desk job after being shot. She is known for her sarcasm and deadpan humor. She sometimes comes off as cold and heartless, however, she deeply cares for the officers under her command and is shown to go to great lengths to defend them. This is greatly shown when an officer she assigned to guard duty is murdered execution-style by a criminal, she feels very guilty but is moved when many officers show up at the district to support the grieving family. At the beginning of season 1, she often tries to bully Officer [[Kim Burgess]] into running errands for her. When Burgess finally tells her off, Platt intentionally assigns Burgess and partner [[Kevin Atwater]] to a smelly squad car for the day. Burgess's new partner [[Sean Roman]] once called Platt a \"pain in the ass\".<ref name=\"ChickenDynamiteChainsaw\"/>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep11|Turn the Light Off]]\", it is revealed that Platt comes from a wealthy family. Her family disapproved of her decision to become a police officer. Every now and then, she would bring a \"fianc\u00e9\" to convince her father to continue subsidizing her lifestyle that exceeds her police officer salary. She convinces [[Adam Ruzek]] to play the fianc\u00e9 and Ruzek takes the opportunity to eat at an expensive restaurant. She also has history with Voight and Olinsky; she once told Antonio that Voight is the best cop in the city, they hold a close working friendship, and despite Olinsky being her subordinate he is allowed to call her by her first name.\n\nPlatt meets firefighter Randy \"Mouch\" McHolland at Chief Boden's wedding at Firehouse 51 and strike up a friendship almost immediately. He eventually proposes marriage and Platt is sure her dad will spare no cost for his daughter's wedding. Their wedding plans are thrown off course when her father reveals that he was bankrupt due to bad deals and investments gone wrong, meaning that she would have to rely on her own finances. It is also implied that while Platt is financially independent, she has long relied on her family's money as back-up and now has to scale back her lifestyle due to her meager salary. They eventually marry in an intimate ceremony at Molly's in the ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 4)#ep87|On the Warpath]]\" and had their honeymoon in 'God's Country', the [[Dells of the Wisconsin River|Wisconsin Dells]].<ref name=\"DuffelBag\">{{Cite episode|title=In a Duffel Bag|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

Platt leaves the restaurant so she can be back in time to meet her husband for end of shift. As Platt unlocks her car door, she is struck in the head and repeatedly beaten. The assailant escapes with her handgun, and neighbors realize she is lying on the ground, they call 911 and she manages to tell them that the guy has her gun and she is a cop. Mouch arrives and he wants to know who did this to her. He cannot recall where she said she was going. They question him if it is possible that she was with another guy. She refers to her father as a \"hardass\" when she escorts the suspect's nephew on a date to meet with him. When Ruzek and Olinsky caught a break with regards to Platt's father, Robert Platt, they break down his door only to find him on the ground dead with multiple gunshot wounds. During the investigation, it was revealed that he was beat up in order to get information on Platt's whereabouts. It was revealed that his much younger girlfriend, Natalie, along with her boyfriend, Leonard, were in on a scam to steal his money. But she wanted Platt dead because she was suspicious of her and had her boyfriend commit the attack only to complicate it even further when she was not killed. When Burgess gives an update on her case, and asks Platt about the car, Trust lies by denying she knew whose car it was. The car belongs to Wade McGregor, who also worked for Platt's father. When [[Erin Lindsay]] arrives at the hospital with the file to find both Platt and her hospital detail officer gone. Lindsay calls Voight and tells him she's gone. Trudy arrives in her dad's office and gets a gun, after she grabs Wade McGregor's name off the [[Rolodex]]. She also smashes a display case and takes a golden shovel out of it. Platt now knows who they are after. Voight says we need to  bring her in quietly, and they need to find both before someone gets killed. Wade McGregor is packed up and ready to go, when he turns around to see Trudy standing with her gun drawn. She picks up her other gun and says \u201cThanks\u201d. She throws handcuffs at him. Platt brings McGregor to a vacant building, where she says she knows about him cutting corners on her dad's buildings and that he was selling cocaine and laundered proceeds to his job sites. He says her dad robbed him blind.  Platt wants to know what her father's last words were, McGregor says he does not remember. She puts a rag in his mouth and duct tapes it shut. The next thing we see is Platt cleaning up in the bathroom, with her gun in her hand. She comes out to Voight telling her they need to talk. Voight yells back that she is not him. She breaks down in his arms and cries out that he killed her dad. At the end of the episode, Platt is back in the hospital resting and her husband, Mouch, is there.\n\nIn \"Fagin\", Hailey Upton asks if she had remember her but she did not remember. But later on, she remembers that on February 9, 2003 Platt answered a call at a diner, where a guy came in and pistol whipped the owner when he was closing up, almost killing him{{emdash}}all for $272.57. Platt remembers she was working in the robbery/homicide department at the time.\n \nIn \"Captive\", it is implied that her birthday is on January 17 when her colleagues threw her a karaoke birthday party.\n\nIn \"Profiles\", while being interviewed on live TV by a news anchor, she was injured by a bombing in a TV studio that was later revealed, meant for the deceased anchor.

Before joining the force, Olinsky served in the [[United States Army]] and was at one time stationed in [[Caserma Ederle|Vicenza]], Italy with the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team]]. Olinsky mentions in \"Called in Dead\" that he has 8 confirmed kills in the line of duty. He is one of two military veterans in the Intelligence Unit \u2013 the other being [[Jay Halstead]], an Afghanistan veteran \u2013 and the duo sometimes exchange banter about each other's service.\n\nIn season 1, Olinsky becomes estranged from his wife, who made him move into the garage for some time, before husband and wife eventually reconciled and he is allowed to move back into the house.<ref name=\"CalledInDead\"/> When Lexi is falsely accused of possessing marijuana, Olinsky is quick to help his daughter out. Even though she is suspended from school, the two have a father/daughter dance in the garage. When an ill-fated party ends in a gang member's shooting death, Lexi is the only witness. Olinsky tries to prevent Lexi from becoming a witness as it would endanger her life. However, when the shooter refuses to confess, Lexi volunteers. In the season 4 three-show crossover starting with the ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 5)#ep107|Deathtrap]]\", Lexi is killed in a fire which the CFD later determined to be arson. In \"Emotional Proximity\", when the suspect is in custody, him along with Voight made up a lie on the police report that was stated that he had confessed to them. In [[Chicago Justice]] premiere \"Fake\", ASA Peter Stone rebutted that statement in court when Voight had to testify. The case was closed resulting in the arsonist being found guilty of first degree murder. Olinsky returns to work in the next episode.<ref name=\"S04E17\"/>\n\nIn \"You Never Know Who's Who\", during the investigation in the murder of a former CIA agent, he worked undercover as a contact from CIA headquarters. He was shot and wounded when one of the suspect recognized that his identity was false. The suspect was later shot and killed by Antonio.\n\nOlinsky has a long history with Voight having been partnered with him in a gang unit years earlier. Olinsky's partner was killed by a man named Browning and Olinsky and Voight \"took him for a boat ride\".\n\nAlthough usually calm and reserved he has been shown to have a temper and is not above using questionable tactics to bring a suspect to justice.\n\nBecause Olinsky's desk is behind Halstead and Atwater, there is a running gag where Voight and the rest of the unit would miss him entering the room. Voight would brief the team and tell them to pass on the information to Olinsky \"when he gets here\", only for Olinsky to roll out on his chair and say \"Here\".\n\nIn \"Breaking Point\", he was taken into custody for questioning by Internal Affairs when his DNA came up on the body of Kevin Bingham, killer of Hank Voight's son Justin. When the detectives asked him about his DNA, he requested a lawyer. Lieutenant Denny Woods tries to get information from him in order to put Voight in jail, by offering him immunity. But he leaves his office, turning down the offer. With possibility that he might get arrested, he has a temptation to either betray Voight's loyalty or taking the deal.\n\nIn \"Payback\", he and Voight got tip on who the witness was following from Voight's favor to the Ivory Tower, a junkie named Ruben who tried to break into Olinsky's car a while back. He gives Voight the witness's address, and Voight telling him to not get involved. Voight asks Olinsky about his retirement papers being filed. Olinsky then claims he's not retiring; he just wants to use the paperwork as a flare to see if Internal Affairs will make a move. Voight then admits he's not going to be able to bend Ruben, because he's a recovering addict who is turning his life around. At the end, from an \"anonymous\" tip made to Narcotics, Ruben gets arrested with drugs that were planted on him by Olinsky. He maintained his innocence in front of his wife while Olinsky, watches from his car across the street thus damaging the witness's credibility. In \"Saved\", he revealed that the witness, Ruben, was later released due to lack of evidence. In \"Allegiance\", he was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of Kevin Bingham that was convened on \"Saved\" and was arrested by two Internal Affairs detectives in front of his fellow detectives. At the end, he was stabbed in prison by an inmate. In \"Homecoming\", he was soon discovered by corrections officers and rushed to the hospital but died as a result of his injuries. As the investigation into murder goes forward, it was revealed to be a hit by a drug runner for the Cali Cartel that Olinsky was trying to take down while he was in a DEA task force who arrested his brother. His brother ended up killed in prison, and a corrections officer that confided in him was also in on the hit.\n\n====Crossovers====\nLike many ''Chicago P.D.'' characters, Olinsky has appeared in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]''. He was the handler of Leon Cruz, younger brother of CFD firefighter [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Joe Cruz|Joe Cruz]], and was assigned to make sure Leon, who was undercover in a gang, was safe.

As a young girl, her father, the owner of a diner, was attacked and robbed by an unknown shooter. After being threatened by the robber, Hailey spent the night at the desk of Trudy Platt when she was a detective in the Robbery-Homicide division. Platt made her feel safe as her father recovered from the attack and inspired Hailey to become a cop. It is revealed that she was meritoriously promoted to Detective after a year-long undercover assignment. She attended the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nIn season 5, Upton is partnered with [[#Jay Halstead|Jay Halstead]]. The partnership between the two was initially rocky during the first half of the season as Halstead had been getting over the departure of his ex-girlfriend and former partner [[Erin Lindsay]]. They gradually become good friends and confidants, indicated by the fact that it was to her that Halstead finally opened up about his PTSD.\n\nIn \"Snitch\", when she sees Ruzek assaulting a suspect in public, she manages to pull Ruzek aside and get him in the car. And when he was investigated by Internal Affair by what had happened, Ruzek accuses her of going to Internal Affairs, it was later revealed she manages to convince the suspect's child mother to have him drop the charges.\n\nIn \"Fallen\", she was partnered with Vice Sergeant Sean McGrady, who has problems with her. During the search of Quinton Kane, a drug dealer with a likely connection to the murder of a family, he returns to help with the investigation. But when Upton goes to meet with McGrady, he ends up dead and Voight chastizes Upton for letting McGrady come to the scene alone. She's thrown, explaining that she had told him to wait for her and that she was actually ten minutes ahead of the time they had planned to meet, but Voight blows her off. As a result, the officers including his former partner and the McGrady's widow and family ending up turning their backs on her. During the investigation, Upton calls for a private meeting with Voight and shows him a sign-in sheet with McGrady's signature that proves McGrady was in Chicago PD's lab, where a vial of Quinton Kane's blood was kept but is now missing. Upton believes McGrady framed Kane for murder when he actually killed himself to escape his mounting debt. Voight apologizes and then tells her that if she come forward with the truth, and asks her if she wants to tarnish McGrady's legacy and ruin his family over the \u201cjackass\u201d that was a suspect in the family's murder. So, she agrees to stay quiet about what had actually happened. In \"Confidential\", she and Burgess butts heads about how to handle confidential informants when Burgess's confidential information informs them about a dead body, in which Burgess does not believe but Upton decides to investigate. It turns out that she was right and it leads to an sex trafficking, and the informant comes up dead. Upton goes to her CI and she does not push the informant further citing that the informant has a family. Burgess had a problem with how she handled the situation.\n\nIn \"Ghosts\", when a drug bust goes awry, she recognizes that one of the victims was someone that she knows from her undercover assignment prior to joining Intelligence. She suspects that the man she was undercover busting, Ron Booth, is back in business. He immediately becomes the prime suspect and Upton suggests that she goes back undercover to get into his warehouse. Booth still knows her as an Iowa girl named \"Kelly\". It turned personal when she also suspects that he killed her former partner. It was revealed that while working undercover on the night of New Year's Eve, at a party that Booth hosted, he drunkenly tried to rape her. She got away from him before he could, and her former partner got her to the hospital. He then got obsessive over her when he asks \"Ryan\" (undercover Halstead) that if he slept with her and cuts ties with him. When Voight tells her to stop the investigation, she disobeyed his orders and agrees to meet with him without Halstead knowing. After the meeting, Halstead confronts her for being \"too emotional\" with this case. During the meeting with Booth at a parking lot, he checks Upton to see if she was wearing a wire but instead groping her. Booth's nephew got nervous when Halstead starts to make his move and draws his gun, but gets shot dead by Halstead. With the chaos, Booth runs to the stairwell with Upton giving chase and the two end up fighting to gain control. Upton ends up getting the other hand, and beats Booth, and demands that he admit to the murder of her former partner. He does not, so she contemplates shooting him before Halstead arrives to stop her. At the end of the episode, Halstead goes to Upton's apartment to console her.\n\nIn \"Bad Boys\", she and Ruzek begin a relationship but keep it secret from the other members in Intelligence. They break up in \"Sacrifice\" due to their careers.\n\nIn \"Informant\", her informant is murdered in front of her and it is implied that Voight's CI Darius Walker murdered him to avoid being identified as a confidential informant after accidentally being spotted by Upton's informant.

When Atwater tries to set up a deal with her, it is later revealed that she's a CPD officer working in an undercover operations unit. She is assigned to Intelligence in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep131|Familia]]\", where her pursuit of a carjacker ends in the carjacker's death and Intelligence assigned the case, much to Voight's dismay. \n\nIt is revealed that she lived in 32 different foster homes growing up and that she was homeless at the time when she joined Intelligence before living with [[List of Chicago P.D. characters#Hailey Upton|Hailey Upton]]. \n\n{{-}}\n\n==Recurring==\n\n===Family members===\n* Justin Voight ([[Josh Segarra]]) was the son of Detective Sergeant [[Henry \"Hank\" Voight]] and his late wife Camille. He was one of fraternal twins; his twin sister was [[stillborn]].<ref name=\"DuffelBag\"/> Father and son have a strained relationship due to Justin frequently getting into trouble. He is first mentioned in ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' when Chief Boden's firefighters rescue a boy and his father who were in a near fatal accident caused by Justin's drunk driving. After finding out that the boy was now a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]], a furious Lieutenant [[Matthew Casey]], whose truck company had responded to the call, files a complaint and is threatened by Detective Voight into retracting his statement. The incident would lead to a long-running grudge match between the two. Justin had other run-ins with the law and did a short stint in prison. His father and god-sister Erin Lindsay have tried to set him straight to no avail. Eventually his father forces him to enlist in the U.S. Army to learn discipline and avoid gangs and the bad influence of his recently released former cellmate. After Justin's departure, Voight is accosted by Justin's girlfriend Olive Morgan as she had not heard from the latter for some time (she presumably did not know Voight had forced Justin to enlist on the spot). Upon learning that Olive was pregnant with Justin's child, Voight reaches out to her. Olive is coerced into luring Voight out by vengeful criminals and nearly dies. She and the baby survive the attack. Justin briefly returns to Chicago on leave after hearing about the incident and assures his father that he will declare Olive as his dependent and have her move in with him. Voight gives him Camille's ring for whenever Justin intends to \"[make] an honest woman of her\". In season 3 it is revealed that Olive gave birth to a boy named Daniel<ref name=\"ActualPhysicalViolence\">{{Cite episode|title=Actual Physical Violence|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

He never regained consciousness and is taken off life support with consent from his father.\n* Lexi Olinsky (Alina Jenine Taber) was the daughter of Detective Alvin Olinsky. In \"Now Is Always Temporary\", she is suspended by her school after they find joints in her locker. It is later revealed that she was holding for her boyfriend, and that Olinsky had managed to get the truth out of the boyfriend. In \"A  Material Witness\", she is the sole witness in a gang shooting and testifies against the suspect despite her father's and the Intelligence Unit's advice to not testify to avoid being targeted. She dies in \"Emotional Proximity\" after suffering serious injuries in a warehouse fire that was arson. \n* Barbara \"Bunny\" Fletcher<ref name=\"ActualPhysicalViolence\"/> ([[Markie Post]]) is the biological mother of Detective Erin Lindsay. She is a former drug addict who was negligent of her daughter. Lindsay was eventually rescued by Detective Hank Voight, but not before dabbling in petty crime and being arrested five times. In season 1, Bunny tries to reconnect with her daughter and ask for her forgiveness but Lindsay does not trust her anymore following years of disappointment and false hope. Bunny had another child Teddy Courtney, after her relationship/marriage with Lindsay's biological father ended. In season 3, Lindsay mentions her dumping her fifth husband.\n\n===Police officers and CPD employees===\n* Commander Ronald \"Ron\" Perry ([[Robert Wisdom|Robert Ray Wisdom]]) is the Commanding Officer of the 21st District until his retirement in 2014.  He had \"six hundred reasons why he did not want [Voight] to run Intelligence, but one reason why\"<ref>{{Cite episode |title=8:30&nbsp;pm (2) |episodelink= |series=Chicago P.D. |serieslink=Chicago P.D.

He is killed by a group of rogue cops in \"Born into Bad News\".\n* Sergeant Erica Gradishar ([[Robin Weigert]]) is Voight's handler from [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]]. She is portrayed to be a pencil-pushing climber keen on using Voight and other uniformed officers to further her own career. She was furious upon finding out that Commander Perry had chosen Voight over Lieutenant Belden from Violent Crimes to be promoted to head the Intelligence Unit. After hitting a brick wall with Voight, she then tries to talk [[Antonio Dawson]] into \"spying\" on Voight but her plan backfires as Dawson had a grudge against her. She had investigated Dawson's former partner Sean Patterson over a minor incident of the wrong paperwork being filed but because of her, what should have been a minor infraction taken care of in-house turned into a full blown investigation resulting in Patterson being fired and his pension withheld; Patterson committed suicide a year later.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Price We Pay|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

The two of them form a friendship and Lindsay becomes a surrogate older sister to her, likely because of Lindsay's own similar experience. Nadia begins working as an administrative assistant at CPD to gain experience as preparation to enter the police academy. Sergeant Platt also took her under her wing and would give her tips on how to pass her interviews and study for the written exam. In \"The Number of Rats\", Nadia was kidnapped from Chicago by a serial killer named Gregory Yates ([[Dallas Roberts]]) and found raped and murdered in New York in \"[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (season 16)|Daydream Believer]]\".  She was posthumously honored alongside the fallen officers of the 21st District, including Detective Julia Willhite and Sheldon Jin.\n* Sergeant Edwin Stillwell ([[Ian Bohen]]) is Voight's new [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] handler after Gradishar leaves her position. It is revealed that he assigned Detective Mia Sumner to Intelligence to spy on Voight, and that he blackmailed Sheldon Jin into spying on the Intelligence Unit, particularly Voight. He is arrested in 'Call It Macaroni' for the murder of Sheldon Jin.  \n* Detective Mia Sumner ([[Sydney Tamiia Poitier]]) is a detective assigned to the Intelligence Unit to replace Jules Willhite. She is reassigned to Narcotics in 'The Docks' after it is revealed she is in contact with Voight's IA handler.   \n* Commander Fischer ([[Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)|Kevin J. O'Connor]]) is the new Commanding Officer of the 21st District who took over from Commander Perry after his retirement. His appearances are often met with tension from Voight and the rest of the unit. He is blunt and has no qualms about stepping on Voight's toes, compared to the firm but more diplomatic style of Perry.\n* Greg \"Mouse\" Gerwitz (Samuel Hunt) is the Intelligence Unit's new tech analyst. After Jin was murdered, the team had no one handling the technical aspects and duties were split between Atwater and Ruzek, both of whom detested working behind the desk or with anything technical. He served in the Rangers alongside Halstead and did two tours in Afghanistan, in the [[Korangal Valley]].<ref name=\"ActualPhysicalViolence\"/><ref name=\"CasesThatNeed\"/> During his interview with Sergeant Platt, he mentioned that in Afghanistan, he and Halstead were in the lead Humvee of a convoy when they were bombed. In season 2, the character exhibits signs of [[PTSD]], such as drifting off during a conversation, neglecting his personal appearance, the inability to look at anyone in the eye during a conversation and nervous twitches (restless fingers and stuttering). It is implied that he and Halstead supported one another during their difficult readjustment to civilian life.<ref name=\"S04E02\"/> While Halstead eventually found his calling with the [[Chicago Police Department]], Mouse bounced around from job to job before Halstead took him on as a [[confidential informant]]. Voight was initially hesitant to hire him due to his colorful past, which included sniffing [[nitrous oxide]] in college<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Knocked the Family Right Out|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

Based on her rank, it is presumed that she is likely the area deputy chief overseeing the area District 21 is located in.\n* Officer Julie Tay ([[Li Jun Li]]) is Burgess' partner during the first five episodes of season 4. Before becoming Burgess' partner she worked at the 'worst patrol' due to her Commander trying to bang her and her turning him down. She is sent back to this patrol in the fifth episode of season 4 when the Command found out about her new assignment.\n* Officer Mike Sorensen (Kevin Kane) is introduced in 'Some Friend' as Burgess' partner after Julie was reassigned. In '300,000 Likes', he gets into hot water for posting a video from his body cam of a traffic stop on his Facebook account. In 'A Shot Heard Around the World', he resigns from the force to avoid being shot by a sniper who is targeting police officers. \n* Chief Lugo ([[Esai Morales]]) is the chief of the Chicago Police Department's Organized Crime Bureau, which the Intelligence Unit is a part of. \n* Detective Kenny Rixton ([[Nick Wechsler (actor)|Nick Wechsler]]) was detailed to Intelligence from the Gang Unit as a temporary replacement for Ruzek, who had left for an unspecified undercover assignment. As his transfer was somewhat sudden and circumstances sketchy, the team regarded him with some suspicion. However they eventually find out that he left the Gang Unit as he had refused to take part in an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|IAD]] investigation into a payback beating he did not participate in but was privy of. He opted for a transfer rather than rat out his colleagues when IAD offered him a deal in exchange for information.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Seven Indictments|episodelink=Chicago P.D.

He is introduced in \"Grasping for Salvation\" as a lieutenant in the Organized Crime Bureau, where he is questioned about his involvement in a murder case 17 years earlier that he and Voight worked when new evidence pops up. He later attempts to coerce Voight to stay away from reinvestigating the murder, certain that they got the right man. It is revealed that Woods' CI was the person who actually committed the murder, and that Woods had told his CI to say that a man who Woods had targeted multiple times over the years had done it. He is stripped of his police powers by the Superintendent as a result, and all of his previous cases were investigated to check if they were by the book. He returns in \"Reform\", now as an independent auditor for the CPD. His first case is investigating Halstead following a shooting which led to the death of a little girl. It is revealed that Halstead shot a gang member first, and that the bullet went through the gang member, through a wood door, and then hit the little girl. Despite this, Woods continues to go after Halstead until Voight works out a side deal with Alderman Ray Price ([[Wendell Pierce]]). In \"Fallen\", he blackmails Adam Ruzek into getting incriminating evidence to take Voight down after Ruzek is caught deleting information on a DUI charge his sister received while his nephew was in the car. He receives a video of Halstead in a bar fight while undercover, but he does not bite and asks for more. He is arrested in \"Homecoming\" after he is caught bribing a witness into admitting that she saw Voight with his son's killer the night he died. It is revealed that Voight had set him up with the witness, and then proceeded to turn the recording of him bribing her over to Internal Affairs.  \n* Deputy Superintendent Katherine Brennan ([[Anne Heche]]) is the second in command of the Chicago Police Department and Brian Kelton's number two. She is introduced in 'Bad Boys' where Voight goes to her to exonerate Olinsky after his death. She resigns in 'Confession', where it is revealed that Kelton blackmailed her into taking the fall for his wrongdoings. In 'Reckoning', she gives Voight the name of a drug dealer associated with Kelton as Intelligence looked to take him down. But, in 'Doubt' she reveals herself to be the murderer of Kelton, and is eventually arrested by Halstead and Upton.\n* Superintendent Brian Kelton ([[John C. McGinley]]) was the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department and the new mayor of Chicago. It is revealed in 'The Forgotten', that when Kelton was a commander in 2016, he covered up a serial killer's murders in order to keep his stats intact. He sent a homicide detective in to jam up Intelligence in the search for the serial killer, which led to the death of Voight's CI. Voight then proceeds to give Kelton's mayoral candidate Ray Price evidence that Kelton did cover up the murders. It is revealed later than if Kelton were to win the mayoral race, he would disband the Intelligence Unit. In 'Reckoning', it is revealed he won the mayoral race by a landslide, due to his top opponent being arrested for murder. However, he is killed by Brennan in his house only hours after being voted as the next Mayor of Chicago.\n* Superintendent Jason Crawford ([[Paul Adelstein]]) is the interim Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department following the murder of Brian Kelton.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2476643/chicago-pd-adds-prison-break-vet-to-fill-void-left-by-jon-seda|title=Chicago P.D.

(season 7)#ep130|Assets]]\", where Voight makes an off the books deal to list Darius Walker as a confidential informant in exchange for the obstruction charges against [[List of Chicago P.D. characters#Adam Ruzek|Adam Ruzek]] being dismissed. He is shown to be a proponent of smart technology in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep134|False Positive]]\", giving Intelligence a beta version of facial recognition software in order to find the killer of 2 kids who were in the crossfire of a drug deal gone wrong. The software backfires when it identifies the wrong suspect and the suspect is killed in county jail, and Voight and Crawford are forced to cover it up by framing the wrong suspect and handing off the actual killer to the gang that got robbed. He returns in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep140|The Devil You Know]]\" when Voight comes to him about an Intelligence case where three highly decorated police officers are behind a number of illegal drug deals, only for the officers to be executed by Darius Walker in order to cover up his involvement in it. Crawford and Voight proceed to cover up the crime scene to make it look like the officers died as heroes as opposed to corrupt cops.\n\n===Criminals and informants===\n* Andres Diaz, aka Pulpo (English: \"The Octopus\") (Arturo del Puerto) is a drug lord and criminal, so nicknamed because he \"had [his] hands everywhere\". He has dual American and Colombian citizenship and was said to work for a cartel in [[Medell\u00edn]]. In the series pilot \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep1|Stepping Stone]]\", Pulpo is the main person of interest in Voight and the Intelligence Unit's investigations after they discover two dead drug dealers who were beheaded and had their heads displayed prominently nearby.\n* Maurice Owens (David Aron Damane) is head of a local gang and one of Voight's informants. He was arrested by patrol officers who witnessed him dealing drugs but Voight bails him out because of his value as an informant. Through Maurice's tip, Voight was able to get a lead on Pulpo in season 1. He also appeared on ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' in the episode \"[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]\" and provided Voight with some information about a possible suspect involved in the fire at led to [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Hallie Thomas|Dr. Hallie Thomas]]' death. As of season 3, according to Voight, he is in prison.<ref name=\"CasesThatNeed\"/>\n* Lonnie Rodiger (Matthew Sherbach) was a young pedophile who was suspected of murdering several boys, including Ben Corson, the younger brother of [[#Jay Halstead|Detective Halstead]]'s high school sweetheart, some years ago. Halstead would park his car outside the Rodiger home in plain view every year on Ben's death anniversary to make his point to Lonnie that he had not forgotten about Ben and the other murder victims, prompting Lonnie's father Phil to file a [[restraining order]] against Halstead and Voight to give Halstead a stern warning to back off before things get out of control. Lonnie was found dead in the episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep10|At Least It's Justice]]\". Halstead was the prime suspect but was exonerated when Phil confessed to killing his son in a fit of rage upon discovering incriminating photos on Lonnie's computer.\n* Gregory Yates (n\u00e9 Williams) ([[Dallas Roberts]]) was a [[sociopath]]ic serial killer who targeted women. He was said to responsible for several unsolved murders in New York. A notable aspect of his crimes was his usage of sadistic torture methods with the intention of letting his victims die slow and painful deaths. His last victim prior to his arrest by the Chicago PD Intelligence Unit was Nadia Decotis. In season 3 he escapes police custody and goes on a rampage while on his mission for revenge.\n\n* Darius Walker ([[Michael Beach]]) was a drug kingpin who Intelligence targeted to get in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep130|Assets]]\". He's arrested when he's caught while in the process of completing a drug deal with his supplier. Due to his presence in the community and his ability to keep his subordinates disciplined, Voight goes to Superintendent Crawford to approve a deal where they keep Walker on the streets as a cooperating defendant to Intelligence while also getting the obstruction charges against Ruzek dropped. In \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep135|Informant]]\", Voight goes to Walker to help Intelligence find who supplied their victim with fentanyl that led to his overdose. When one of Upton's CIs accidentally spots Walker inside the 21st District, it is implied that Walker orchestrated the murder of her CI in order to prevent word going out he was a CI. He is killed in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 7)#ep140|The Devil You Know]]\" when Upton outs him as a snitch to avenge the death of her CI and the deaths of three police officers who were stealing drugs from the evidence lockup.\n\n===Other===\n* Steve Kot (Chris Agos) is an Assistant State's Attorney who often prosecutes perpetrators arrested by the Intelligence Unit and sometimes gives them advice on legal matters regarding their cases. In season 2 he crosses paths with Intelligence and was the prosecutor of notorious [[Polish-American organized crime|Polish mobster]] Oscar Bembenek, getting a successful conviction. His sixteen-year-old daughter Dora was shot execution-style in broad daylight as part of Bembenek's plot to seek revenge on those he held responsible for his imprisonment.<ref name=\"TheWeighStation\"/> The character has also crossed over to ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]''.\n* Ray Price ([[Wendell Pierce]]) is an alderman who collaborated with Voight on occasion. He is introduced in \"Reform\", where he proceeds to go after Halstead after the accidental shooting of a little girl. He and Voight come to terms on a deal later, where Price will lay off of Halstead while Voight will release a gang member who was thought to be a lookout, who is actually revealed to be the mastermind of the gang. He returns in \"Fallen\", where he and Voight conspire to keep quiet about how the murder of CPD Vice Sergeant Sean McGrady by drug dealer and suspected murderer Quinton Kane is actually a suicide to free McGrady of his mounting debt. In \"Politics\", he asks that Voight to get him crime scene pictures of a Congressman who was a person of interest in the murder of a prostitute who was later cleared. Voight initially refuses, citing the Congressman's support of the CPD and his stellar reputation, but Price responds by threatening to reveal the true cause of Sgt. McGrady's death. Voight then proceeds to give him the photos. He returns in \"Night in Chicago\", talking to Kevin Atwater about what Atwater the night an unarmed African-American was shot by Chicago police officers during a traffic stop. He enters the Chicago mayoral race in \"Good Men\", and is the top opponent against Brian Kelton. He tries to convince Voight to get into politics, and Voight is initially hesitant. Following the death of Voight's CI, caused by the coverup of Superintendent Kelton, Voight gives Price evidence that incriminates Kelton in the cover-up of the murders of a serial killer. In \"Pain Killer\", Price is shot by a sniper and thought to be an assassination attempt initially. It is later revealed that the Voight was the intended target of the sniper. In \"This City\", he and Voight work as peacemakers to attempt to end a gang war that has killed innocent people. In \"What Could Have Been\", Price is at the top of the polls in the mayoral race, but is arrested for the murder of Kelton's top political consultant and [[Kim Burgess|Kim Burgess']] boyfriend, taking the fall for his wife, who killed him to cover-up the drug overdose of a college student caused by drugs that were given to her by the Prices's daughter.\n* Blair Williams ([[Charles Michael Davis]]) was a political consultant who worked on Brian Kelton's mayoral campaign. Originally from Connecticut, he was arrested when he was 17 for possession of drugs that belonged to his father. He attended [[Princeton University]], majoring in political science. He had a fling with [[Kim Burgess]] during his time in Chicago, and was planning on moving to Chicago to be with her. He is killed in \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 6)#ep125|What Could Have Been]]\" by Alicia Price in an attempt to cover-up the death of a woman who overdosed on drugs given to her by Price's daughter, Jasmine. Alicia's husband, Ray takes the fall for her in exchange for a favorable deal.\n\n===Minor characters===\n<!--characters who appear in less than 4 episodes but have a significant storyline, or future recurring role...-->\n* FBI Agent Troy Kivisto (Himself) - Enters the sphere in season 5, portraying the cooperation the FBI Chicago Division has gained working with the Chicago Police Department.  He brings to the set his vast \"real-life\" military and law enforcement background, including his years working undercover in a task force, as a supervisor, as well as participating in numerous Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) cases with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Illinois State Police (ISP).    \n* Detective Julia Willhite ([[Melissa Sagemiller]]) was the partner of [[Antonio Dawson]]. She appeared in both ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' (1 episode) and ''Chicago P.D.''. The character was killed in the premiere of ''Chicago P.D.'' and was the catalyst for Detective Voight's feud with Lieutenant Belden. She was declared [[Dead on arrival|DOA]] after Belden's decision to withhold information backfires and she and Dawson walk into a trap as a result. Her husband Dr. Alec Willhite (Erik Hellman) has also appeared in several episodes of both ''Fire'' and ''P.D.''. The couple have two children.\n* Lieutenant Bruce Belden ([[Kurt Naebig]]) was from the Violent Crimes Unit and Voight's nemesis. In the show's premiere, he withheld information from Voight's team, leading Detectives Willhite and Dawson to walk into a trap and Willhite was killed as a result. Voight blamed Belden for her death. Belden frequently butt heads with Voight over the Pulpo case. It is revealed that Pulpo had played on Belden's over-zealousness to play \"by the book\" and contradict Voight at any given chance. He is murdered during Pulpo's escape from police custody.\n* Charlie Pugliese ([[Billy Wirth]]) is a former associate of [[Erin Lindsay]] who became a person of interest during an investigation. Voight rescued her from Charlie and she has thus far refused to disclose what really happened, even telling Halstead that he would not want to know the full story. Based on the brief but tense conversations between her and Charlie, it is presumed that he may have taken her in when she was living on the streets and forced her to commit crimes in exchange for food and shelter.\n* Teddy Courtney ([[Lou Taylor Pucci]]) is the half-brother of Erin Lindsay and son of Bunny. He and Lindsay were once close but lost contact after he \"disappeared\" from home (Bunny assumed he ran away). A photo of him was found in the basement of a house fire which [[Kelly Severide|Lieutenant Severide]] and 51 had responded to. Severide saw the victim clutching a box of pictures and handed it to Voight's team. While sifting through the photos, Lindsay discovers one of a young Teddy. In a three-way crossover (see \"[[Chicago Crossover]]\"), Intelligence and [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s Detective Benson and her [[Law & Order:Special Victims Unit|SVU]] team investigate a highly sophisticated pedophile ring-cum-child trafficking syndicate that has operated out of Chicago and New York City for many years. Teddy is found in New York City where he is now a male prostitute. His testimony would lead to the shutting down of the ring.\n\n==Crossover characters==\n<!--characters who have made 4 or more appearances-->\n\n===''Chicago Fire''===\n{{Main|List of Chicago Fire characters}}\n* Gabriela \"Gabby\" Dawson ([[Monica Raymund]]) is the younger sister of [[Antonio Dawson]].

He largely appears in scenes at Molly's, where he serves drinks and chats with patrons.\n* Brian \"Otis\" Zvonecek ([[Yuri Sardarov]]) is a colleague of Gabby Dawson and Herrmann at 51 and an owner of Molly's. Like Dawson and Herrmann, his appearances are mainly confined to scenes at Molly's, when he chats with patrons while serving drinks. In the episode \"[[Chicago P.D. (season 1)#ep14|The Docks]]\" he helped Intelligence translate some Russian as the team was investigating some Russian mobsters who spoke no English.\n* Randy \"Mouch\" McHolland ([[Christian Stolte]]) is the husband of Sergeant Platt and a fellow firefighter of Gabby, Otis, and Herrmann at 51.

{"title_page": "Aspen anomaly", "text_new": "'''Aspen anomaly''' is a geological structure in [[Colorado, United States]]. It consists of a low-[[Seismic Velocity|seismic velocity]] anomaly in the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] which underpins the highest sector of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. \n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe Aspen anomaly is a [[seismic velocity]] anomaly in the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] beneath central [[Colorado]] (in the region of [[Aspen, Colorado]]<ref name=\"MorganQuane2010\" />),{{sfn|Dueker|Yuan|Zurek|2001|p=6}} which appears to reach down into the [[upper mantle]].<ref name=\"Coblentz2007\" /> [[Helium]] with [[isotope ratio]]s indicative of mantle origin emanates from the terrain above the anomaly.<ref name=\"Crossey2018\" /><ref name=\"Blair2011\" />\n\nThe Aspen anomaly coincides with the highest region of the [[Rocky Mountains]] (such as the [[San Juan Mountains]] and the [[Sawatch Range]]<ref name=\"Reiter2008\" />) and divergent [[drainage]]s ([[Arkansas River]], [[Colorado River]] and [[Gunnison River]]) which have cut deep gorges. This region underwent significant uplift during the [[Cenozoic]]<ref name=\"Coblentz2007\" /> starting from 10-5 million years ago and was subsequently eroded by the Colorado River.<ref name=\"Karlstrom2009\" /> Ongoing present-day uplift of the San Juan Mountains may be linked to the Aspen anomaly.<ref name=\"Blair2011\" /> \n\nRiver [[knickpoint]]s in [[Gore Canyon]] and [[Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park|Black Canyon]] may mark the point at which the rivers pass through the edge of the region above the anomaly.<ref name=\"Darling2008\" /> The Colorado River may be influenced by the anomaly all the way to [[Lee's Ferry|Lees Ferry, Arizona]].<ref name=\"Sandoval2005\" />\n\n[[Hot spring]]s and [[geyser]]s above the anomaly are a major source of [[carbon dioxide]] and other gases, some linked to [[chemolithotrophic]] bacterial communities.<ref name=\"Crossey2018\" /> [[Cenozoic]] volcanism is also associated with the anomaly,<ref name=\"MacCarthy2009\" /> such as potentially the Twin Lakes [[pluton]] close to [[Leadville, Colorado]].<ref name=\"Feldman2009\" />\n\n== Context ==\n\nIn [[seismic tomography]] images, the Aspen anomaly is characterized by a northwards tilted low seismic velocity anomaly.{{sfn|Dueker|Yuan|Zurek|2001|p=7}} The anomaly is one among several low velocity anomalies beneath the western United States, although unlike the others known as the Jemez, Yellowstone and St. George it does not have a northeastward [[Vertical_displacement|throw]].{{sfn|Dueker|Yuan|Zurek|2001|p=6}} Other structures that may be related to the Aspen anomaly are the [[Lester Mountain]] zone, the [[Colorado mineral belt]] and the [[Rio Grande Rift]].{{sfn|Karlstrom|Whitmeyer|Dueker|Williams|2005|p=425}} The Aspen anomaly has been compared with the [[Yellowstone hotspot]],<ref name=\"Coblentz2007\" /> but it lacks a volcanic [[caldera]] that Yellowstone has.<ref name=\"Blair2011\" />\n\n== Origin ==\n\nThe Aspen anomaly has been interpreted in several ways. \n* It may be a [[mantle plume]], but the steep tilt angle is unusual for a mantle plume.{{sfn|Dueker|Yuan|Zurek|2001|p=7}} \n* It may be a [[lithospheric]] melt zone, but the lithosphere is not thick enough to contain such a structure.{{sfn|Dueker|Yuan|Zurek|2001|p=8}}\n* It may be a [[Proterozoic]] structure, maybe the leftover of a [[subduction]] zone.{{sfn|Karlstrom|Whitmeyer|Dueker|Williams|2005|p=425}} Prolonged subduction would have enriched a segment of mantle with [[water]] and thus lowered its [[melting point]].{{sfn|Karlstrom|Whitmeyer|Dueker|Williams|2005|p=429}}\n* Shallower upwelling (such as [[Asthenosphere|asthenospheric]] upwelling), possibly linked with [[slab rollback]] or [[crust

There have been 36 specials produced, approximately one new special per year (twice per year before Monster9's bankruptcy, now reduced to once per year since 2012, then became twice again since 2017). The show is produced by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] and is one of the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of {{Nihongo|''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Muscle Ranking]]''|\u7b4b\u8089\u756a\u4ed8|Kinniku Banzuke}}, another sports entertainment competition, which aired on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] under the name ''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Unbeatable Banzuke]]''. Until the 10th competition, ''Sasuke'' was broadcast as a special part of ''Muscle Ranking'', but it became an independent program when ''Muscle Ranking'' was discontinued. The first competition was held indoors, marking the only time ''Sasuke'' did not take place outside. Competitions generally start in the daytime and continue until completed regardless of weather or darkness.<ref>Corkill, Edan, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20110930r1.html \"Average Joes become champions on 'Sasuke'\"]. ''[[Japan Times]]''. September 30, 2011. p. 15.</ref> After Monster9's bankruptcy in November 2011, all rights to the show fell completely into the hands of its broadcaster, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Following their acquisition of all rights to ''Sasuke'', TBS renamed the show '''''Sasuke Rising''''' for the 28th, 29th and 30th editions, but have since reverted to the original name. TBS has renamed the show once again, to '''''Sasuke Ninja Warrior''''' since the 35th edition. TBS changed the show's logo for the 36th edition.\n\nApplicants are interviewed or auditioned and trial rounds are held to test their physical ability until the field is narrowed to 100 competitors. ''Sasuke'' consists of four stages of increasing difficulty; competitors must complete a stage to advance. Before the 18th tournament, a 1,200-meter run was held in order to determine the competitors' starting positions. Each competition is taped prior to the air date, edited for time, and broadcast as a three-hour show. Exceptions may be made as in ''Sasuke'' 24's case should TBS decide the broadcast should go over three hours, but this is a rare exception.\n\nIn its 37 seasons, all four stages of the course were only completed a total of five times, by four different competitors. These were [[:ja:\u79cb\u5c71\u548c\u5f66|Kazuhiko Akiyama]]<ref>[http://www.neatorama.com/2007/01/16/makoto-nagano/] April 7, 2007</ref> in the 4th competition (1999), [[Makoto Nagano]] in the 17th competition (2006), [[Yuuji Urushihara]] in the 24th (2010) and 27th (2011) competitions,<ref>\"Yuuji Urushihara does it again\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWdY38IfTE] ''Youtube'', 11/6/2011</ref> and [[Yusuke Morimoto]] in the 31st competition (2015).\n\n===Popularity===\nThe popularity of ''Sasuke'' has led to the creation of a number of spin-off shows and international versions of the show. ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'', perhaps the most well-known spin-off, is a version of ''Sasuke'' restricted to female competitors with an emphasis on speed, balance, and stability.\n\n''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' is the United States version of the show. Originally integrated with ''Sasuke'' (with American finalists participating on the ''Sasuke'' course in Japan), it was at one point the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network's highest rated show.<ref>Levin, Gary.

December 7, 2010.</ref> As of season 4, ''American Ninja Warrior'''s popularity has allowed it to move to the [[NBC]] network and expand as a stand-alone spin-off with a full replica course in Las Vegas, although Americans have continued to enter ''Sasuke'' even after the inception of ''ANW''.\n\nOther international versions of the format have aired in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Sweden, Denmark, [[Ninja Warrior UK|United Kingdom]], Bahrain, China, [[Sasuke Ninja Warrior Indonesia|Indonesia]], Russia and Vietnam, with versions also launching in France ([[TF1]]), [[Ninja Warrior Germany|Germany]] ([[RTL Television|RTL]]), Italy (NOVE of [[Discovery Networks]]) in 2016, and Israel ([[Keshet Media Group]]) in 2018. An [[Australian Ninja Warrior|Australian version]] launched on [[Nine Network]] in July 2017. [[Netflix]] also started airing ''[[Ultimate Beastmaster]]'', broadcast in six different languages in 2017, a ''Sasuke'' inspired show.\n\n==Competitors==\nThe show hosts a broad spectrum of participants. While most are from Japan, national television personalities and Olympians from other countries, including the US, [[Bulgaria]], China and Korea, have taken part in the competition. Some of the more enthusiastic competitors dress up in costumes, bring props to the starting stage, or show off some of their talents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Sasuke All-Stars===\nThe Sasuke All-Stars were a group of six favored competitors, established by the TBS network, originally thought to be the most likely to clear all four stages. It included two of the men to complete the ''Sasuke'' course, Kazuhiko Akiyama (1999, 4th tournament) and Makoto Nagano (2006, 17th tournament). The membership of the All-Stars has remained unchanged despite other successful competitors in later tournaments, notably, Yuuji Urushihara who completed the course in the 24th and 27th tournaments. The All-Stars were officially 'retired' in the 28th tournament. Two of them continue to compete independently, and are now referred to as 'former All-Stars'.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe six consisted of:\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kazuhiko Akiyama|ja|3=\u79cb\u5c71\u548c\u5f66}}''', a crab fisherman and massage therapist.

There was a brief hiatus before the term was re-popularized in ''Sasuke'' 22 when Yuuji and Kanno made it to the Third Stage.  Membership in the New Stars has included the following:\n\n*'''Shunsuke Nagasaki''', a trampolinist.

He made his debut in ''Sasuke'' 14. He is the first to be called one of the \"Shin Sedai\" in ''Sasuke'' 17, however, he made his first Final Stage appearance in ''Sasuke'' 17 in 19 years, the second youngest to reach the Final Stage. He failed the First Stage in ''Sasuke'' 19; after that he didn't compete for six years. In 2012 he retired from athletics. He made his comeback on ''Sasuke'' 29, however he timed out on the Passing Wall. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He timed out in the Lumberjack Climb in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was all cut. He failed the Flying Bar in ''Sasuke'' 32 and failed it again in ''Sasuke'' 33. Surprisingly, he failed the Spider Walk in ''Sasuke'' 34. He failed the Spider Drop in ''Sasuke'' 35, the first time he failed the Second Stage for the two consecutive times. This meant that Nagasaki was eliminated at the Second Stage in consecutive tournaments for the first time. He failed the Dragon Glider in ''Sasuke'' 36.

In ''Sasuke'' 32, he was one of the notable competitors who failed on the new obstacle Double Pendulum when he failed the transition to the red sandbag. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he surprisingly failed Rolling Hill. He made a good transition from Quad Steps to the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance in the middle of the Rolling Hill. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he declared that if he failed the First Stage again, he would retire. Then the results show that he cleared the First Stage, but he struggled in Reverse Conveyor and timed out there. In ''Sasuke'' 35, he cleared the first few obstacles with ease, including the new Dragon Glider, but eventually timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe due to the reduced time limit and exhaustion. He finally made it to the Third Stage after 6 years in ''Sasuke'' 36, cleared the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, being the oldest to clear it, and also the oldest to attempt the next obstacle, the Vertical Limit, where he made it to the 3rd ledge before his grip gave out.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Urushihara's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| '''Competition'''\n|| '''Start position'''\n|| '''Obstacle'''\n|| '''Stage'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 21st\n|| 72\n|| Failed Flying Chute\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 22nd\n|| 77\n|| Failed G-Rope\n|| Final\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 23rd\n|| 99\n|| Failed Unstable Bridge\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 24th\n|| 93\n|| '''Kanzenseiha (3.57 seconds to spare)'''\n|| '''Final'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 25th\n| 100\n|| Failed Double Salmon Ladder\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 26th\n|| 100\n|| Failed Half-Pipe Attack\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 27th\n|| 99 \n|| '''Kanzenseiha (6.71 seconds to spare)''' \n|| '''Final'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 28th\n|| 88 \n|| Failed Crazy Cliffhanger\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 29th\n|| 99\n|| Failed Backstream\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 2993\n|| Failed Wall Lifting\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 99\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 89\n|| Failed Double Pendulum\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 89\n|| Failed Rolling Hill\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 99\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyor\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 95\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 95\n|| Failed Vertical Limit Kai\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 96\n|| Failed Pipe Slider\n|| Third\n|}\n\n*'''Hitoshi Kanno''', a janitorial worker/jewelry designer.

athletes====\n\nSeveral Japanese athletes have competed in ''Sasuke'' over the years, including professional team [[Team handball|handball]] player [[Daisuke Miyazaki]], who was featured in the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 26th competitions. In his debut, the 20th competition, he failed on the Halfpipe Attack. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 21, where he made it all the way to the Third Stage Devil Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he timed out on the Net Climb in Stage 1, and in ''Sasuke'' 26, he failed the First Stage's Rolling Escargot.\n\nSprinter [[Hisatsugu Suzuki]], who competed in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], appeared in the 13th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Cross Bridge.\n\nAnother competitor from the 1992 Olympics, gymnast [[Yoshiaki Hatakeda]], competed in the 6th tournament, making it all the way to Stage 3 before falling on the Cliff Hanger.\n\nAfter the 27th competition, three Japanese Olympians competed: [[Tomoko Hagiwara]], [[Koki Sakamoto]], and [[Daisuke Nakano]]. Hagiwara competed in the 28th competition, but she failed the Quintuple Step. She also competed in the 29th competition, but she failed the Hedgehog. Sakamoto competed in the 28th competition, wearing #95 (the highest number for non all-stars that tournament), but he timed out on the second Warped Wall. Nakano competed in the 29th competition, but he failed the Jump Hang Kai, while trying to grab both nets.\n\nPole Vaulter [[Seito Yamamoto]], who competed in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], [[2016 Summer Olympics]], and also [[2018 Asian Games]], appeared in the 35th and 36th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Dragon Glider twice.\n\n====American athletes====\nVarious American athletes, including Olympic [[gymnastics|gymnasts]] (and twin brothers) [[Paul Hamm|Paul]] and [[Morgan Hamm]], have competed in ''Sasuke''. Paul made it to the Second Stage in the 14th and 16th competitions but failed to make it further&nbsp;\u2013 in the 14th, he cleared Wall Lifting but forgot to hit the button at the end before time ran out, and in the 16th, he was eliminated by the Metal Spin. He competed in the 15th competition as well, but he failed to make it past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Morgan timed out in the First Stage before he could attempt the Rope Climb in the 14th competition, but he made it to the Third Stage in the 15th, failing on the Curtain Cling. In the 16th competition, he failed the First Stage's Warped Wall.\n\n[[Decathlon|Decathlete]] [[Paul Terek]] competed four times in total. He first appeared in the 17th competition, making it to the Third Stage before failing the Cliffhanger. The announcer pointed to his immense size (6 foot 3 and 215 pounds) as a barrier to his advancement. After earning the title of ''Pro Sportsman No. 1'' in 2007, Terek appeared in the 19th competition but failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider. He helped G4 oversee the 2nd ''American Ninja Challenge'' competition in early 2008, but he did not compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th competition due to his training for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (though he eventually had to drop out of the running for the Olympics after suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee). He made his return to ''Sasuke'' in the 22nd competition but failed on a new obstacle in the First Stage, the Slider Jump. He failed the same obstacle in ''Sasuke'' 24. In 2010, Paul Terek announced his retirement from international competition, so it is likely he will never compete again.\n\n[[Henry Cejudo]], gold medal-winning [[freestyle wrestling|wrestler]] at the [[2008 Olympic Games]] in Beijing, competed in the 21st competition, but failed the First Stage's Halfpipe Attack.\n\nLevi Meeuwenberg, a [[Freerunning|free runner]] from G4's ''American Ninja Challenge 2'', first competed in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he was one of only three people to clear the First Stage and the only person to clear the Second Stage. He cleared Stage 2 with a record time of 38.5 seconds left. He failed the Third Stage's Shin-Cliffhanger. In the 21st competition, he failed the Salmon Ladder in the Second Stage; in the 22nd, he failed the new Slider Jump; in the 23rd, he made it back to the Third Stage but failed the Shin-Cliffhanger again. He missed the 24th competition but returned for the 25th, where he failed the first obstacle of the Second Stage, the Slider Drop. However, he couldn't compete in the 26th competition after breaking his wrist while participating in ''[[Jump City: Seattle]]'', a televised professional parkour tournament.\n\nLevi did not compete in ''American Ninja Warrior'' 3 to try to earn a spot for ''Sasuke'' 27 because of a big movie scene that came up for him during the time of the tryouts.\n\nLevi however did compete ''American Ninja Warrior'' 4, however he failed the Quad Steps (Godantobi in Japanese), the very first obstacle. It was clear he was very tired as he had flown in from the Philippines hours beforehand and tried to rush.\n\nHe has not competed in ''American Ninja Warrior'' ever since. It is known that he stopped free running altogether, and became a farmer instead.<ref>{{cite web |title=About - Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |url=https://realeyeshomestead.com/about/ |website=Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n \nIn the four times he completed the First Stage, he had the fastest time out of everyone who finished Stage 1.\n\n=====Results=====\n*''Note: Does not include American Ninja Warrior results''\n*'''[[Morgan Hamm]]''', US Olympic Gymnast\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Hamm's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||14th\n||81\n||Failed Tarzan Jump\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||15th\n||93\n||Failed Curtain Cling\n||Third\n|}\n\n*'''[[Paul Hamm]]''', US Olympic Gymnast\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Hamm's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||14th\n||82\n||Failed Wall Lift<sup>\u2020</sup>\n||Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||15th\n||92\n||Failed Warped Wall\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||16th\n||94\n||Failed Metal Spin\n||Second\n|}\n\n\u2020&nbsp;- Hamm cleared the Second Stage with 0.1 seconds left, but walked through the gates without hitting the buzzer and as a result, was disqualified.\n\n*'''[[Paul Terek]]''', US Olympic Decathlete\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Terek's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||17th\n||86\n||Failed Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||18th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||19th\n||98\n||Failed Jumping Spider\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||20th\u201321st\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||22nd\n||98\n||Failed Slider Jump\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||23rd\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||24th\n||82\n||Failed Slider Jump\n||First\n|}\n\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Levi Meeuwenberg|ja|3=\u30ea\u30fc\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30fb\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30b0}}''', an American [[freerunning|freerunner]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Meeuwenberg's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||20th\n||1989\n||Failed Shin-Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||21st\n||99\n||Failed Salmon Ladder\n||Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||22nd\n||91\n||Failed Slider Jump\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||23rd\n||95\n||Failed Shin-Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||24th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||25th\n||48\n||Failed Slider Drop\n||Second\n|-\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||26th\u201336th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|}\n\n\u2020&nbsp;- Levi was supposed to compete in the 26th tournament, having earned a spot in the ''American Ninja Warrior'' preliminaries, but was ultimately unable to do so after breaking his wrist on ''[[Jump City: Seattle]]'', which occurred prior to the 26th tournament.

Unfortunately, he failed on the first ledge of the Vertical Limit, he managed to get hold of the ledge and made it halfway before falling in ''Sasuke'' 35.

In 2017, she became both the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') and Stage 2 at the original Mt. Midoriyama (''Sasuke'' 34).

During that competition he reached the Final Stage but became the first competitor to suffer a 15-second timeout on the initial Spider Climb portion, falling when it spread apart. Rain and a two-second late start also hurt his performance. He made it to the Third Stage three more times in competitions 12, 14, and 16, failing the Cliffhanger each time.

In the 7th competition, he was unable to beat the Rolling Log; In the 8th, he failed the Quintuple Step; In the 11th, he timed out on the Warped Wall.

In his first attempt in ''Sasuke'' 17, he cleared the First Stage but failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 18, he failed the Jumping Spider in the First Stage. After a two-tournament absence, he competed in ''Sasuke'' 21 and was one of only nine competitors to make it to the Second Stage, timing out on Wall Lifting. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he was one of four people to make it to the Third Stage, ultimately failing the Shin-Cliffhanger. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he made it to the Final Stage for the first time but timed out 19 meters away.

In ''Sasuke'' 25 and 26, Li finished first overall, becoming the only foreigner to have progressed further than any competitor in consecutive tournaments. After making it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger two times, it looked as if Li would go all the way in ''Sasuke'' 27. However, he shocked many when he failed the Step Slider in Stage 1. This was his earliest defeat ever, and first time failing Stage 1 since ''Sasuke'' 18. He failed the First Stage yet again in ''Sasuke'' 28, on the Spinning Bridge. He finally cleared the First Stage again in ''Sasuke'' 29, but timed out on the Passing Wall, on the Second Stage. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He decided to retire from ''Sasuke'' due to replacement by Taiwan representatives. Since ''Sasuke'' 31, his fellow Liao Long Zhun fully ruled the Taiwan representatives. He is also the only foreigner to clear Stage One six times in a row (''Sasuke'' 21\u201326).\n\n=====Results=====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+En-Chi's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||17th\n||92\n||Failed Metal Spin\n||Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||18th\n||26\n||Failed Jumping Spider\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||19th\u201320th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||21st\n||49\n||Failed Wall Lift\n||Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||22nd\n||79\n||Failed Shin-Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||23rd\n||94\n||Failed Metal Spin\n||Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||24th\n||92\n||Failed G-Rope\n||Final\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||25th\n||80\n||Failed Ultimate Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||26th\n||95\n||Failed Ultimate Cliffhanger  \n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||27th\n||97\n||Failed Step Slider\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||28th\n||83\n||Failed Spinning Bridge\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||29th\n||56\n||Failed Passing Wall\n||Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||30th\n||2990\n||Failed Crazy Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|}\n\n====Tahitian athletes====\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Ragivaru Anastase|ja|3=\u30e9\u30ae\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30fb\u30a2\u30ca\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba}}''', a Tahitian dance instructor, competed in ''Sasuke'' 31.

Another mixed martial artist, [[Sanae Kikuta]] competed in the 8th and 10th tournaments, where he fell off of the Rolling Log in the First Stage; in the 12th tournament, he fell on the Plank Bridge in the First Stage. Other K-1 fighters who have competed include Tatsuji (19th competition, failed the Jumping Spider), Yudai (20th competition, failed the Rokudantobi), [[Andy Ologun]] (18th competition, failed the Rope Glider; 20th competition, failed the Log Grip), [[Bobby Ologun]] (22nd competition, failed the Log Grip), [[Bernard Ackah]] (19th competition, failed the Jumping Spider), and [[Takeru Segawa]] has competed in four tournaments, failing the Hedgehog (30th), Warped Wall (31st), Tarzan Rope (32nd) when his foot touched the water, cleared the First Stage (33rd) but failed the Salmon Ladder Nobori, and Backstream (34th). He had a surprising fail on the modified Fish Bone (35th). [[Hirotaka Urabe]] has competed twice, failing the Rolling Hill (34th), Wing Slider (36th).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Takeru's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 2988\n|| Failed Hedgehog\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 83\n|| Failed Warped Wall\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 81\n|| Failed Tarzan Rope\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 81\n|| Failed Salmon Ladder Up\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 81\n|| Failed Backstream\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 90\n|| Failed Fishbone\n|| First\n|}\n\nFormer [[Pride Fighting Championships]] and [[Pancrase]] Japanese mixed martial artist and pro wrestler [[Ikuhisa Minowa]], competing in [[DREAM (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]] known as \"Minowaman\", was featured in the 26th competition wearing red wrestling tights, pads, and boots. He failed the second obstacle, \"Hazard Swing\" after jumping from the swing, and missing the rope on the platform, falling into the water below. He also competed in the 29th competition, but failed the first obstacle, the \"Long Jump\", where he landed feet first onto the sandbox and jumped backwards into the water. Japanese featherweight mixed martial artist from DREAM [[Hideo Tokoro]] (announced as a \"freelance fighter\") was featured right after Minowaman in the 26th competition where he failed to grab the rope to swing himself to the other side in the first obstacle \"Step Slider\".\n\nSeveral professional wrestlers have also competed, including [[Tiger Mask IV|Tiger Mask]], [[Masanori Murakawa|The Great Sasuke]] (referred to as ''Great Ninja Warrior'' in the US and UK versions), [[Minoru Suzuki]], [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]], [[Kota Ibushi]]  and [[Naohiro Hoshikawa]]. Suzuki and Tanahashi were the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship|Triple Crown Heavyweight]] and [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]], respectively, during their runs in the course.\n\n===Japanese entertainers===\nSeveral Japanese or Japan-based entertainers have taken part in ''Sasuke'', including action movie star [[Kane Kosugi]] and his brother Shane. Kane made the Third Stage in the 1st, 4th and 6th competitions, failing on the Pole Bridge, Cliffhanger and Body Prop, respectively. In the 7th competition, he made the Second Stage but failed the Spider Walk, his earliest exit from a competition. He reached the Final Stage in the 8th competition, becoming, alongside [[Yordan Yovchev]], the first foreigner to make it that far. Competing in heavy rain, Kane timed out on the Rope Climb; he has not competed since. Shane timed out on the Second Stage's Wall Lift in the 2nd competition, then failed the First Stage's Rolling Log in the 3rd competition. In the 4th, he came close to completing the First Stage but timed out on the Rope Climb. In the 6th and 7th competitions, he made it to the Third Stage, failing both times on the Body Prop. In the 8th competition, he failed to get past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Unlike his brother, Shane competed in the 9th competition, where he failed the Big Boulder in the First Stage.\n\nOther entertainers who have competed include {{Interlanguage link multi|Hiromichi Sato|ja|3=\u4f50\u85e4\u5f18\u9053}}, host of several [[NHK]] children's programs; Shigeyuki Nakamura, a champion of the Muscle Gym event in ''[[Kinniku Banzuke]]''; actor-singer Kazumi Morohoshi, a former member of the band Hikaru Genji who is now a solo artist; actor/announcer [[Kenjir\u014d Ishimaru]]; and actors Masaki Nomura and [[Sh\u014dei]]. Sato debuted in the 18th tournament and failed the First Stage's Flying Chute. In the 19th tournament, he failed the Log Grip. In the 20th competition, he timed out before he attempted the Tarzan Rope. In the 21st competition, he timed out on the Warped Wall. In the 22nd, Sato finally cleared the First Stage but failed the Metal Spin in the Second. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Metal Spin again. He missed ''Sasuke'' 25, but failed the Jumping Spider again in ''Sasuke'' 26. He missed ''Sasuke'' 27 and 28 but competed in 29, where he shocked the crowd by unexpectedly going out on the first obstacle, the Long Jump. Nakamura made it to the Third Stage in the 2nd competition, failing there on the Pipe Slider, but in the 6th competition he was eliminated by the First Stage's Jump Hang. Morohoshi debuted in the 20th tournament but failed the Log Grip in the First Stage. Ishimaru has never made it past the First Stage; his two closest attempts, in the 16th and 17th competitions, timed out on the Rope Climb. [[Sh\u014dei]] competed three times. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 6, and failed the Jump Hang when he tried to go under using only his arms. He timed out on the Rope Climb in Stage 1 in ''Sasuke'' 7. He finally made it past the First Stage and Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 8. He struggled in Stage 3 on the Propeller Bars, and failed the Body Prop.\n\nActor James Okada, a graduate from a martial arts academy, competed in the 6th and 7th competitions. In his first attempt, he failed the Jump Hang in the First Stage, but in the next tournament, he made it all the way to the Third, where he was defeated by the first obstacle, the Propeller Bars.\n\nActor and singer [[Tetsuji Sakakibara]] competed four times (23rd\u201326th tournaments) but never cleared the First Stage, failing on the Jumping Spider in the 23rd and 24th tournaments, the Jump Hang in the 25th tournament, and the Half-Pipe Attack in the 26th tournament.\n\nActor [[Ryosuke Yamamoto (actor)|Ryosuke Yamamoto]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 30 and ''Sasuke'' 31. He never completed the First Stage, failing in Jump Hang Kai in ''Sasuke'' 30. In ''Sasuke'' 31 he did slightly worse by failing the Orug\u014dru (also known as the Music Box) before he could reach the Jump Hang Kai again.\n\n[[Voice acting in Japan|Voice actress]] [[Tomoko Kaneda]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 31. She failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Her husband, [[Wataru Mori]], an actor, also competed in several competitions. Mori has competed since ''Sasuke'' 16; he failed Rolling Log. Then he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 21 and failed Jumping Spider. After an eight-year hiatus, he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 32; he timed out on the Lumberjack Climb. He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 33, where he completed the First Stage, and timed out at the Reverse Conveyor. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he surprisingly failed the last steps on the Quad Steps, his foot slipping to the left. He eventually timed out on the Warped Wall in ''Sasuke'' 35. In ''Sasuke'' 36, when he reach the Reverse Conveyor, he used his legs to support himself on the sides of the Conveyor. This is something which is against the rules and thus he was disqualified.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Mori's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 16th\n|| 64\n|| Failed Rolling Log\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 17th\u201320th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 21st\n|| 11\n|| Failed Jumping Spider\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 22nd\u201331st\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 82\n|| Failed Lumberjack Climb (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 83\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyor\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 90\n|| Failed Quad Steps\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 71\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 76\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyer (disqualified)\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 10\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|}\n\n[[Golden Bomber]] members {{Interlanguage link multi|Kenji Darvish|ja|3=\u6a3d\u7f8e\u9152\u7814\u4e8c}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Yutaka Kyan|ja|3=\u559c\u77e2\u6b66\u8c4a}} also competed in ''Sasuke'' 31. Kyan failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Darvish had previously competed in ''Sasuke'' 28 and 30 and failed the First Stage. In ''Sasuke'' 31, he finally completed the First Stage and failed the Cross Slider in the Second Stage. In ''Sasuke'' 32, Kyan did better on the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance on the new obstacle Tie Fighter. Darvish failed at the Tie Fighter when he lost his balance. In ''Sasuke'' 33, Darvish almost cleared the First Stage but shockingly failed the Lumberjack Climb with only several centimeters to finish the obstacle. Kyan failed Quad Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 34, Darvish made it to the 2nd Stage, but he struggled in the Reverse Conveyor. He made it to the Second Stage, he professed slightly further, timing out after lifting the first wall of the Wall Lifting, while Kyan failed the Dragon Glider in ''Sasuke'' 35.

Most of these compete for entertainment value and do not represent serious challenges&nbsp;\u2013 for example, Choshu's only accomplishment was being the first person to clear the Rope Glider in the 18th competition. However, some have seen success. Omori made it to the Final Stage three times in a row (1st\u20133rd competitions), a record that is shared with ''Sasuke'' all-star [[Makoto Nagano]], but since then he has not been able to clear the First Stage. Nakayama made it to the Second Stage in the 9th and 11th competitions; in the 9th, Nakayama failed the Spider Walk, and in the 11th, he missed hitting the Second Stage's final button by a split-second. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 27. He had footage showing himself training for the new course. He wore #30, and despite his training, he failed the Rolling Escargot when he could not get enough momentum to get the structure spinning, and fell into the water when trying to restart the obstacle. He got revenge on it in the 28th tournament, but timed out on the second Warped Wall. In the 29th tournament, he almost cleared the First Stage for the first time in 10 years, but ultimately, timed out at the top of the Rope Ladder. Recent comedians include [[Yoshio Kojima]], who competed in five competitions (22, 24, 26\u201328), where he failed at the Log Grip twice, Hazard Swing, Step Slider, and Rolling Escargot respectively. Funnyman [[Masumi Yagi]] was featured in the 26th competition but failed on the Step Slider. Cocky comedian [[Eiko Kano]] (aka \"Mr. Narcissus\") was featured in the 25th competition and failed at the Dome Steps, but got past the first obstacle in the 26th competition and failed at the Rolling Escargot.\n\nPenalty comedian{{clarify|reason=In English, penalties aren't funny.|date=June 2018}} {{Interlanguage link multi|Wakky|ja|3=\u30ef\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc}} competed nine times in ''Sasuke''. He debuted in ''Sasuke'' 20 and failed the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 21 and 22, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he got revenge on both the Jumping Spider and the Halfpipe Attack, only to fail the Slider Jump. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Halfpipe Attack again. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 27 and cleared the First Stage for the first time. In the Second Stage, he failed the Double Salmon Ladder. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he timed out on the Rope Ladder. He advanced to the Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 29 and 30, but failed the Swap Salmon Ladder.\n\n===Other notable competitors===\n65-year-old Minoru Kuramochi, known as \"the Octopus\" because he usually brings an octopus with him, is the owner of the Edokko Izakaya octopus bar in Tokyo and is one of the oldest competitors. He has competed several times, never making it very far into the First Stage. Despite this, he seems to be a fan favorite. In the 20th competition's preview special, he welcomed the G4 American Ninja Challengers to his bar, served them his special octopus meal, and showed off his physical skills to them. He is No. 4 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 26, where he managed to make it to the Rolling Escargot. He got further than in ''Sasuke'' 19, when he timed out on the Pole Maze.\n\nToyohisa Ijima, a martial arts dance instructor and former member of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], competed in the first several tournaments. He is known as the \"Japanese Bruce Lee\" because of his resemblance to the [[Bruce Lee|late action star]], which extends to dressing and acting like him. He has only made it past the First Stage in the 1st tournament; in the 11th tournament, he missed hitting the final button on the Rope Climb by a split second because he had wasted time posing for the crowd after completing each obstacle. He is No. 3 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll.\n\n46-year-old Katsuhide Torisawa is a former weightlifter who has competed in every single Shin-''Sasuke'' tournament (except ''Sasuke'' 22), starting with ''Sasuke'' 18. He always displays his strength before his run; he has brought a barbell and lifted it over his head multiple times, ripped off his shirt, and crushed an apple and full cans of beer with one hand, and also snapped a baseball bat in half. He has never cleared the First Stage.\n\n===Women in ''Sasuke''===\nThe first woman to have completed the First Stage is former ''[[Super Sentai]]'' stuntwoman [[Chie Tanabe|Chie Nishimura]], who did so in the 2nd tournament.<ref>In that tournament, her last name was listed as Tanabe because at the time she was single.</ref> She attempted the Second Stage's Spider Walk in a non-optimal fashion, because her legs were too short to reach across the obstacle the proper way, and failed. She also competed in ''Sasuke'' 3 but failed the Rolling Log. She hasn't competed in ''Sasuke'' since.\n\n[[:jp:\u904a\u4f50\u96c5\u7f8e|Masami Yusa]] (G4 mislists her first name as \"Miyabi\" in some tournaments), a [[Beach Flags (sport)|beach flags]] champion, has competed eight times. She debuted in ''Sasuke'' 6, but failed the Barrel Climb. In the ''Sasuke'' 13 trials, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang, although she timed out there. During the actual competition, she was able to grab on to the redesigned Jump Hang, but she misjudged her jump, slammed face-first onto the platform, and fell into the water; this failure earned her a \"Warrior Wipeout\" during G4's broadcasting of this tournament. In ''Sasuke'' 14, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang and the Crooked Wall in competition, but she ultimately timed out on the Warped Wall.\n\nAll three women who achieved ''kanzenseiha'' on ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'' ''(Women of Ninja Warrior)'', the female equivalent of ''Sasuke'', have also competed in ''Sasuke'' itself, though none have cleared Stage 1. All are also acrobats who worked with Muscle Musical.\n\n* Ayako Miyake, who achieved ''Kunoichi'' total victory three straight times ''(Kunoichi 4\u20136)'', has also competed in ''Sasuke'' twice, going out in Stage 1 both times \u2013 the Sandan Rolling Maruta in ''Sasuke'' 17 and the Jumping Spider in ''Sasuke'' 18.\n* ''Kunoichi 8'' champion Rie Komiya, who is a broadcaster and model as well as an acrobat, has competed several times. She first competed in ''Sasuke'' 22, where she was disqualified on the Jumping Spider for falling into the safety mat just after the trampoline. She got her revenge in ''Sasuke'' 23, but she fell on the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 24, she surprised many by failing the Log Grip. She did not compete in ''Sasuke'' 25, but did compete in ''Sasuke'' 26, and failed the Rolling Escargot and she competed again in ''Sasuke'' 27, where she failed the Rolling Escargot again.\n* Satomi Kadoi, the other ''Kunoichi 8'' champion, competed in ''Sasuke'' 27 and failed the Halfpipe Attack.\n\nAmerican gymnast [[Kacy Catanzaro]], who famously became the first woman in the world to clear both the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder during ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' qualifiers in Dallas in 2014, traveled to the original Mt. Midoriyama for ''Sasuke'' 32 and cleared the Warped Wall at the second attempt before narrowly timing out.\n\nAnother American woman and ''American Ninja Warrior'' standout, stuntwoman [[Jessie Graff]] \u2013 the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') \u2013 was one of the two invited US entrants including Drew Drechsel in ''Sasuke'' 34 the next year. She became only the second woman in ''Sasuke'' history after Nishimura to complete the First Stage, doing so with 14.5 seconds left on the clock (which would have been under the limit set for the male competitors as well; the female competitors were given an extra 10 seconds.) She then surprised everyone once again when she managed to complete Stage 2 with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, becoming the very first woman to ever clear the Second Stage in ''Sasuke''. In Stage 3, Graff started strongly, completing the first three obstacles in good form. However, despite her determination, she failed the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she attempted the first jump from the first to the second ledge and was unable to hold on. However, having impressed the onlookers, she was invited back for the following tournament. She did not return until Sasuke 37, however, but she went on to clear stage 1 and 2 again, becoming the only woman to reach stage 3 twice. She failed the first flip of the Cliffhanger Dimension, in the same place as Sasuke 34. '''''(insert list of runs here)'''''\n\nA Shinkin Bank employee who has been competed on ''Kunoichi'', {{Interlanguage link multi|Ayano Oshima|ja|3=\u5927\u5d8b\u3042\u3084\u306e}}, She first completed in ''Sasuke'' 31. Her run was digested, but it was shown that she had timed out as she was getting up the Warped Wall. Ayano once again returned for ''Sasuke'' 36. She was the first Japanese woman to ever clear the Dragon Glider. Although, she became to tired after finishing the tackle, and timed out at the Warped Wall.\n\n===American Ninja Challenges===\n{{Main|American Ninja Challenge}}\nIn fall 2007, the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network held a contest called the ''American Ninja Challenge'', whose grand prize was a trip to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 19th competition. Ten semifinalist videos were selected on August 3 via internet poll to determine three finalists who would appear on G4's ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' on August 28\u201330 to demonstrate their ''Ninja Warrior'' skills. On August 31, [[Michigan State University]] Economics student Colin Bell and the runner-up, [[Greenville, South Carolina]] native Brett Sims, were both selected, and they became the subjects of an hour-long G4 special on November 14 during G4's ''Ninjafest''. Ultimately, both Colin and Brett qualified for the course thanks to their impressive physical abilities, but they both failed the Jumping Spider.\n\nThe second contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 2'' on May 18, 2008. Levi Meeuwenberg of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and Brian Orosco of San Francisco, California were both chosen to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th tournament; both are [[Parkour|free runners]]. They competed alongside surprise guest Brett Sims, who was given the opportunity to return by G4. Sims failed the First Stage's Warped Wall, while Orosco failed the Flying Chute. Meeuwenberg, however, made it to the Third Stage before he ultimately failed the Shin-Cliffhanger. In that tournament, he was the last man standing.\n\nThe third contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 3'' on November 12, 2008. Viewers voted for their favorite competitors, the top three of whom would be flown to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 21st tournament. The winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and free runner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg&nbsp;\u2013 the first woman to qualify&nbsp;\u2013 of [[Valley Village, California]]. They joined ''American Ninja Challenge'' 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', [[Olivia Munn]] and [[Kevin Pereira]], to compete in ''Sasuke'' 21. In that tournament, Munn failed the Sextuple Step, while Pereira's run ended after his feet hit the water on the Log Grip; on the TBS broadcast, Munn's run was shown only in part while Pereira's run was cut completely. Romberg failed the Halfpipe Attack, while Witmer failed the Log Grip due to a severe [[ulnar nerve]] injury that he suffered while warming up. Orosco completed the First Stage with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock but failed the Second Stage's Salmon Ladder. Meeuwenberg cleared Stage 1 with the fastest time, with 21.5 seconds remaining, but similarly failed the Salmon Ladder.\n\nThe fourth contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2009 and aired on June 21, 2009 on G4 as part of ''Ninjafest 4''. The competitors' videos were judged by ''Attack of the Show''{{'s}} Olivia Munn. The winner, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], was joined by Munn and previous competitors Levi Meeuwenberg and Luci Romberg. Munn failed the new Circle Hammer in the First Stage; Romberg failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider; Campbell timed out on the final First Stage obstacle, the Rope Ladder, and later told the sideline reporter that he \"underestimated the cardio\" involved in the course. Meeuwenberg failed a new First Stage obstacle, the Slider Jump.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 [[Jessie Graff]] went on to compete in ''Sasuke'' 34, wearing number #87. She made an impressive mark becoming the second woman in the show's history to clear Stage 1. She also kept the streak going when she became the first woman ever to clear Stage 2. During her Stage 3 run she showed great upper body strength on the course, getting through the first three obstacles, she made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she failed the jump from the first ledge to the second ledge.\n\n==Results==\n{{main|List of Sasuke competitions}}\nThe following is a list of available information of people who achieved the best results in each competition and also the number of competitors who failed in the lower stages. Under each competition, the results are listed in order of best performance. Their names are listed along with their number (1\u2013100) from the competition, and the stage/obstacle they failed to complete (or Total Victory). In the 10th competition the number system ran from 901 to 1000 to indicate that 1000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and then ran from 1901 to 2000 in the 20th competition to indicate that 2000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and from 2901 to 3000 during the 30th competition to indicate roughly 3000 attempts on ''Sasuke''. All air dates are of the Japanese broadcast on TBS.\n\n=== ''Sasuke'' 1 ===\n{{See also|List of Sasuke competitions#1st competition}}\nAired: September 27, 1997\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible

The object is to hit the [[buzzer]] at the end of the course before the allotted time expires. If a competitor goes out of bounds or comes into contact with the water in any of the pits below the course, he or she is disqualified from the competition.\n\nTypically, 85 to 90 of the 100 original entrants are eliminated in this stage. However, in the 4th competition, a record 37 of the original 100 competitors made it past the First Stage. After the 4th, 17th, 24th, and 27th competition, the First Stage was thoroughly redesigned to be much more difficult and prevent large numbers of people from moving on. In fact, a G4 special inside the making of the 18th ''Sasuke'' competition revealed that the redesign of the First Stage for the 18th competition was done with the intention of seeing all 100 challengers fail it. This did not happen, however, and that has only spurred the production team on to make this and all stages to follow even harder.\n\nThat goal was almost met in the 19th competition, where much to everyone's surprise, only two competitors cleared the First Stage (neither of the two being ''Sasuke'' All-Stars), a record in ''Sasuke'' history. (The only time something similar has happened was in the first ''Kunoichi'', where again, only two competitors cleared the First Stage.) Executive producer Ushio Higuchi said in interviews later that even he was surprised at the results, anticipating that around 10 to 12 people would survive in spite of the production team's attempts at making the First Stage unbeatable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} Although the names of the obstacles were different from the second tournament, the obstacles were still the same.\n\n{{note|2|2}} TBS officially considers that they are two different obstacles as their two names \"{{lang|ja|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0}}\"(Free Climbing) and \"{{lang|ja|\ufffd?\u767b\u308a}}\"(Wall Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. However, ''Ninja Warrior'' has referred to the Free Climbing/Wall Climb combination as the \"Mountain Climb\" in subtitles.\n\n{{note|3|3}} This Hill Climb is completely different from the one that would later be replaced with the Warped Wall after the 4th competition.\n\n{{note|4|4}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Prism See-Saw\" is called the \"Prism Tilt\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Prism See-Saw.\"\n\n{{note|5|5}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Cross Bridge\" is called the \"Bridge of Blades\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Cross Bridge.\"\n\n{{note|6|6}} Although referred to as the Jump Hang, the obstacle in the 13th competition consisted of many ropes hanging vertically, completely different from the rope net used in all other competitions. Some call it the \"Rope Hang,\" but that name is erroneous.\n\n{{note|7|7}} The Rope Ladder's name and obstacle symbol was not shown in ''Ninja Warrior's'' obstacle chart in the 18th due to lack of room for TV screening. However, in the 19th they had the Rope Ladder and NOT the Tarzan Rope. The Japanese announcer still calls the last two obstacles by their official names.\n\n{{note|8|8}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Double Pendulum\" is called the \"Tic Toc\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|9|9}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', The X-Bridge is called the ''Bridge of Blades'' in subtitles just like the Cross Bridge.\n\n{{note|10|10}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Rolling Escargot\" is called the \"Rolling Snail\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|12|12}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Tackle\" is called the \"Triple Tackle\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|13|13}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"TIE Fighter\" is called the \"Prop Slider\" in the UK English dub due to not having the rights from [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] to use the name associated with the Star Wars fighter after which the obstacle was named.\n\n===Stage 2===\nThose with enough skill to complete Stage One then take on an even more grueling set of obstacles in Stage Two. 283 competitors have reached the Second Stage. Like Stage One, the obstacles alter throughout the competitions, but all hold to the same principle: if the competitor makes a single mistake they fall into the water below. The obstacles determine the time limit, and it is usually between 50 and 100 seconds.\n\nUnlike the First Stage, which has always required the competitors to hit a buzzer at the end of the course to stop the clock and pass the course, the Second Stage did not have a buzzer at its end until the 8th competition. Before then, the competitors simply walked through an open gate to stop the clock.  From the 8th competition onward, the buzzer opens the gate. If the competitor breaks the gate open without hitting the button, they are disqualified. In addition, the course judges can hold the gates closed if a competitor committed a foul earlier in the Second Stage that would result in their disqualification, such as using the Chain Reaction gloves on the Spider Walk as \"Mr. ''Sasuke''\" Katsumi Yamada had done in the 12th competition.\n\nOn average, 10 to 15 competitors attempt the Second Stage on each competition. A record 37 competitors attempted the Second Stage during the 4th competition. Also during the 4th competition, a record 11 competitors cleared the Second Stage. During the 5th competition, however, only three men made it to the Second Stage due to new, tougher obstacles in the First Stage. In the 19th competition, neither of the two qualified competitors cleared the circuit (a fall and a timeout on the Salmon Ladder), marking the earliest end of a ''Sasuke'' competition.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

\u2014 This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} The Moving Walls and Spider Climb are actually included in the Spider Walk, but TBS officially considers that they are three different areas as their three names \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30af}}\" (Spider Walk), \"{{lang|ja|\u52d5\u304f\u58c1}}\" (Moving Walls) and \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0}}\" (Spider Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. ''Ninja Warrior'' just sees them as a single obstacle and calls it \"Spider Walk\".\n\n{{note|2|2}} The onscreen Japanese graphics \"{{lang|ja|\u4e94\u9023\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc}}\" reveal this obstacle's official name as \"Five Continuous Hammers\". On ''Ninja Warrior'', this obstacle is referred to as the Hammer Dodge.\n\n{{note|3|3}} In those competitions there are two \"Moving Walls\" in the Spider Walk, but TBS does not officially call them independent obstacles, and just considered the whole Spider Walk as one obstacle only.\n\n{{note|4|4}} After the 27th tournament, there was one bridge (with four chains) instead of two.\n\n{{note|5|5}} The Rolling Log appeared in SASUKE 37 as the original first obstacle of Stage 2, but due to rain, it did not function correctly. The judges decided to start Stage 2 at the Salmon Ladder Ascent with a lowered time limit of 100 seconds.\n\n</div>\n\n===Third Stage===\nThe Third Stage has no time limit, allowing contestants to go at their own pace. Contestants are allowed a few seconds of rest between obstacles during which they can apply \"sticky spray\" to improve their grip. While the first two stages focus on speed and agility, this course almost exclusively tests one's upper body strength and stamina.\n\nOut of 3,000 total competitors and 283 Second Stage competitors, 139 have attempted the Third Stage. The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only six have passed it more than once, namely Akira Omori, Shingo Yamamoto, Makoto Nagano, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, and Yusuke Morimoto.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Each of these share a single, common goal: to scale the tower and reach the button at the top before time expires. If the competitor does not reach the top platform in time, the rope is cut and the competitor falls (they are caught by a safety line). Starting from the 18th competition, the rope is no longer cut. Reaching the top is referred to as ''kanzenseiha'' ({{lang|ja|\u5b8c\u5168\u5236\u8987}}), translated roughly as \"complete domination\", and rendered on ''Ninja Warrior'' as \"total victory\". The Final Stage's time limit is between 30 and 45 seconds.\n\nOf all the competitors to attempt to claim victory, only 24 have been admitted to the Final Stage, and only six of them have gotten there more than once (Akira Omori in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd competitions, Shingo Yamamoto in the 3rd and 7th, Makoto Nagano in the 11th, 12th, 13th, his victory in the 17th competition and in the 23rd competition, Yuuji Urushihara in the 22nd and his victories in the 24th competition and 27th, Ryo Matachi in the 27th competition and 30th, Yusuke Morimoto's victory in the 31st competition and in the 35th competition). Currently there are only four victors: Kazuhiko Akiyama defeated ''Sasuke'' in the 4th competition, Makoto Nagano in the 17th, Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th and in the 27th, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st.\n\nThe original Final Stage consisted of climbing a 15-meter (49&nbsp;ft) rope. The contestant must start climbing from a seated position.\n\nThe second version of the Final Stage was unveiled in the 7th competition, when Shingo Yamamoto became the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was increased to {{convert|22.5|m|ft}}.  It consists of a {{convert|12.5|m|ft}} Spider Climb followed by a {{convert|10|m|ft}} Rope Climb.  After 15 seconds, the walls of the Spider Climb spread apart. This ensnared [[Yordan Yovtchev]] during the 8th competition, when he failed to complete the Spider Climb before it began spreading, and fell off the tower.\n\nThe third version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 22nd competition, when Yuuji Urushihara was the first to try it. The height of the tower remained mostly the same as the second version of the Final Stage, but two new obstacles were used: a {{convert|13|m|ft|adj=on}} \"Heavenly Ladder\" and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} \"G Rope.\" The time limit was increased to 45 seconds, then reduced to 40 seconds in the 23rd competition. Competitors are not dropped due to the Heavenly Ladder being in the way.\n\nThe fourth version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 27th competition, when Ryo Matachi was the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was reduced to 20 meters and consisted of a 20-meter (66&nbsp;ft) Rope Climb similar to the first version of the Final Stage, but with a 5-meter height difference. The time limit stayed at 40 seconds. Unlike the first version of the Final Stage, competitors started at a standing position instead of a seated position.\n\nThe fifth version of the Final Stage was briefly seen in Stage 3 and in a trailer of ''Sasuke Rising''. Its design was similar to that of the fourth version of the Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb. Unlike its predecessor, this version is 4&nbsp;m taller, and the competitors would have likely climbed up the rope in a seated position. The time limit would have likely been 35 seconds, as Urushihara may have cleared this particular version with one second left. It was used for only one tournament.\n\nFor the sixth version, with the removal of the previous version of the Final Stage, it was not unusual to see a change similar to that of the 18\u201324 version from the Metal Ladder to the Heavenly Ladder. The previous Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb was thrown out all together and the return of the 7\u201317 Final Stage took its place. The Spider Walls seem to take up less space this time, and the Rope Climb appears to take up more. Nevertheless, the height of the tower has once again increased, this time to 24&nbsp;m. The Spider Climb (\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0) appears to be the same as its predecessor, at 12.5&nbsp;m, while the Rope Climb (\u7db1\u767b\u308a) was slightly modified in length at 11.5&nbsp;m from that of its original predecessor, at 10&nbsp;m. The time limit is likely to stay the same at 30 seconds, though a 35-second Final Stage is not out of the question.\n\nThe prize for completing the Final Stage was [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]2,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|2000000|JPN}}). The prize has now increased to [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]4,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|4000000|JPN}}) since the completion of the 17th tournament. In the 24th tournament a [[Nissan Fuga]] was also a prize if anyone could complete the Final Stage.\n\nTypically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all. However, both the 3rd and 24th competitions saw a record five competitors attempt the Final Stage. After the 4th competition, though, the Final Stage was only achieved on average every other tournament.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Each episode now lasts thirty minutes and it also includes some minor changes in the on-screen graphics. Throughout the episode, there's the \"Ninja Killer\" (for the obstacle that took out the most competitors) and \"Warrior Wipeout\" (honors the best wipeout) segments. The Japanese [[play-by-play]] commentary and interviews with the competitors have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], while the competitor profiles, [[Instant replay|replays]], and introductions were [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by [[voice actor]] [[Dave Wittenberg]].\n\nThe show became the highest rated program on the network since its debut. Aside from a few sporadic occurrences, reruns of ''Ninja Warrior'' stopped airing regularly sometime in December 2012 in wake of G4 slated to be rebranded as the [[Esquire Network]] on September 23, 2013. The last four episodes to air on G4 appeared as a two-hour block on April 10, 2013. It is unknown if ''Ninja Warrior'' would return to the network's schedule or if some other channel would acquire the series. Commercials on G4 show ''American Ninja Warrior'' to air on G4 in July, marking it the last program being advertised on the network as a G4 program, and not an Esquire channel presentation.\n\nAs of August 3, 2016, an article released by ''USA Today'' says that \"Esquire has obtained rights to 27 Ninja Warrior tournaments...along with all eight Kunoichi spinoff contests that feature only women contestants.\" and that they \"...will return as a 63 hour Labor Day weekend marathon (Sept. 3, 7 a.m. ET/PT) in Japanese, with English subtitles.\" Whether this is referring to the original broadcasts or the G4 broadcasts is unknown right now due to little notice, but it seems to lean toward the G4 broadcasts. They also stated that \"Additional newer tournaments of the series, never seen in the U.S., will debut next year.\" As of 2019, new episodes have not been shown on U.S. airwaves, and the 27th competition remains the most recent one to be aired in America.\n\n====''American Ninja Warrior''====\n\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior}}\nThe popularity of the ''American Ninja Challenge'' has led G4 to produce a version of the series featuring American contestants called ''American Ninja Warrior'', which is produced by Pilgrim Films and Television, Inc and is currently hosted by [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] and [[Matt Iseman]]. Auditions on G4's website ended on August 18, 2009. Open tryouts were held in Los Angeles on August 29 and 30, 2009, and were taped for the show, with ten finalists competing on the 23rd tournament of the original Ninja Warrior course in Japan in September 2009. The eight-episode series began airing on December 12, 2009.\n\nThe qualifying round consists of over 300 competitors, running an obstacle course strongly influenced by ''Sasuke''{{'s}} First Stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, a modified version of the Pipe Slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the Jumping Bars, and a Net Climb.\n\n''American Ninja Warrior'' aired only the American finalists during the ''Sasuke'' obstacle course. The Japanese competitors were later aired on April 10, 2010.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 2)|second season]] was cast on G4's website as of April 10, 2010 and aired in hour long specials starting December 8, 2010. The top 10 contestants would participate in ''Sasuke'' 26. Three episodes were run for the first two weeks. The first three episodes covered the opening round of the competition; the fourth covered the semifinals.  This was followed by four days of a \"boot camp\" where the fifteen winners of the semifinals were divided into three five-man teams and put through several different Pressure Challenges, with the losing team having to complete a punishment while the other two teams got extra training time on models of some of the ''Sasuke'' obstacles (The Warped Wall, Double Salmon Ladder, Balance Tank, and Circle Slider).  The teams would then run through a grouping of the obstacles with some sort of hindrance (usually carrying something heavy between obstacles). The teams with the worst time would be forced to send two members to an elimination challenge, with the losing person forced to leave.\n\nAfter boot camp, the ten final winners traveled to the ''Sasuke'' course to compete. Once again, only the American competitors were aired during the special, with the rest of the ''Sasuke'' competition to air later. The most successful of the American competitors in the past, Levi Meeuwenberg, withdrew from the competition due to a fractured wrist, giving his spot to Adam LaPlante. Five members failed in the First Stage: Patrick Cusic and former ''[[American Gladiators (1989 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' champion and gladiator [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]] both fell from the new Rolling Escargot obstacle, LaPlante fell on the Halfpipe Attack and Adam Truesdell fell from the Giant Swing, a new variation of the Jump Hang, the only one out of all 100 competitors to do so in the whole tournament. In addition, veteran Shane Daniels once again timed out on the Cargo Net. In the Second Stage, four of the remaining five cleared, while Travis Furlanic fell on the Balance Tank, an obstacle he struggled on during boot camp. In the Third Stage, Paul Kasemir failed the Doorknob Grasper. Brent Steffensen made it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger before falling into the water. [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], despite having the fastest times of all the competitors to compete (finishing the Second Stage with over 24 seconds left) failed at the Ultimate Cliffhanger as well. Brian Orosco fell at the very first obstacle, the Roulette Cylinder, which he had passed easily in the previous competition. While the $250,000 prize went unclaimed, ''Sasuke'' 26 was the start of a successful showing by a collection of American competitors.\n\nThe [[American Ninja Warrior (season 3)|third season of ''American Ninja Warrior'']] debuted on July 31 on G4, again with 300 competitors at the tryouts in Venice Beach. While many top competitors were absent including Levi Meeuwenberg, Rich King and Luci Romberg, a talented crop of new competitors took their place including Denver Broncos wide receiver Matt Willis, who finished the course but did not qualify for boot camp. Other notable competitors who failed to advance to boot camp included two-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Shane Daniels, season two veterans [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]], Adam Truesdell, Adam LaPlante and Patrick Cusic, top first round qualifiers from the previous season Trevor Vaughn and David Money, and former world freerunning champion Tim Shieff. In addition, professional freerunner and ''[[Survivor: China]]'' competitor Michael \"Frosti\" Zernow ranked in the top fifteen and was invited to boot camp, but injured himself and was replaced with fellow ''Jump City: Seattle'' competitor Jake Smith. Other competitors from ''Jump City'' who advanced to boot camp also included Brian Orasco, Drew Dreschel and David \"Young Flip\" Rodriguez. The level of competition in boot camp was noticeably higher in the third season, as competitors were only given one attempt at each obstacle in challenges, leading to a large increase in time penalties. Promising competitors Dustin Rocho, Brandon Douglass, Alan {{Not a typo|Connealy}}, second-seeded qualifier Chris Wilczewski and five-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Brian Orosco all saw their ''Sasuke'' dreams come to an end at boot camp.\n\nOf the ten who advanced to ''Sasuke'', nine easily cleared the First Stage. The only exception was Dreschel, who injured his knee landing on the Halfpipe Attack, and despite a valiant attempt at the Warped Wall, was unable to put any weight on his leg and stated on his Facebook that he will not be available for ''Sasuke'' 28. The high hopes of the remaining nine took a major hit in the Second Stage, as five more were eliminated including Rodriguez on the Slider Drop, Smith on the Double Salmon Ladder, and newcomer Travis Rosen and veterans Travis Furlanic and Brent Steffensen on the Metal Spin. The remaining four competitors made it to the Third Stage only to be outdone by the Ultimate Cliffhanger. Ryan Stratis failed to make the fourth ledge while James McGrath and fan favorite Paul Kasemir failed the transition to the fifth ledge. The last competitor, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]] almost made it through the entire obstacle but on the final ledge his grip gave out. Even though no one earned a $500,000 [[K-Swiss]] Endorsement Deal, the competitors at ''Sasuke'' 27 were by far the strongest group of Americans to date. The final episode of the third season aired on NBC on August 29, 2011 as a two-hour special in prime-time.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 4)|fourth season]] of the program began airing on May 20, 2012 and the show aired on both G4 and NBC for the Regionals and the Championship with the grand prize of $500,000 and the coveted ''American Ninja Warrior'' title. The entire format was changed as well&nbsp;\u2013 regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired and the Mt. Midoriyama course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple Steps and the Warped Wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midoriyama.\n\nThe show returned for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 5)|fifth season]] on July 1, 2013 in the same format. This season, if a contestant were to finish the course, that player would be guaranteed a spot in the next round. The show returned once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 6)|sixth season]] on May 25, 2014 on both NBC and [[Esquire Network]] with the same rules as in previous seasons. NBC has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 7)|seventh season]] in 2015 with the grand prize now doubled to $1,000,000. So far, it has produced, among other things, the endorsement of Makoto Nagano, the first American to complete the Ultimate Cliffhanger (Brent Steffensen in 2012), the first woman to complete the Salmon Ladder (Kacy Catanzaro in 2014), the first woman to complete the Jumping Spider (Meagan Martin, also in 2014), the first two Americans to achieve Total Victory (Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten on the same night in 2015) and the first female to complete Stage 1 of Mt. Midoriyama in Las Vegas (Jessie Graff in 2016, who also became the first female to complete Stage 2 of the original Mt. Midoriyama in 2017 during ''Sasuke'' 34.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sirsvk1OSg Jessie Graff \u2013 ''Sasuke'' 34 Stage 2] YouTube</ref>) The network has renewed the show once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 8)|eighth season]] in 2016 with new qualifying cities including [[Los Angeles]] and [[Oklahoma City]]. The network has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 9)|ninth season]] in 2017 with three new cities: [[San Antonio]], [[Daytona Beach]], and [[Cleveland]]. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 10)|tenth season]] of the show began airing on May 30, 2018 with returning cities and a $10,000 bonus for finishing the Mega Warped Wall. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 11)|eleventh season]] began airing on May 29, 2019 with two new cities ([[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Cincinnati]]), a chance to go directly to Las Vegas with the Speed Pass in the Power Tower duel between the two fastest players, and a new co-host, [[Zuri Hall]]. In addition, Drew Drechsel became the third person to achieve Total Victory at the end of the season.\n\n=====''USA vs Japan''=====\n{{hatnote|Full details in the [[American Ninja Warrior#USA vs Japan|American Ninja Warrior]] article}}\n\nIn 2014, the first ''Sasuke''-based team competition was started, pitting five ''Sasuke'' All-Stars and New Stars representing Japan against five ''American Ninja Warrior'' stars representing the United States in what was dubbed by some as the inaugural ''Sasuke''/''Ninja Warrior'' world championship. The first meeting took place at the Mt. Midoriyama reconstruction in Las Vegas and was first broadcast in America on January 13, 2014 on NBC, with a second meeting already scheduled for the original Mt. Midoriyama in [[Aoba-ku, Yokohama|Aoba-ku]] in 2015.\n\nAt the first match in Las Vegas, Team Japan was composed of Shingo Yamamoto, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, Hitoshi Kanno and Kazuma Asa from ''Sasuke'', while Team USA was composed of Brent Steffensen, Paul Kasemir, James McGrath, Travis Rosen and Brian Arnold from ''American Ninja Warrior''. The match was composed of four rounds&nbsp;\u2013 one on each stage, with each round being a best-of-five of one-on-one races and each competitor running once per stage until the stage outcome was decided. Stage 1 was worth one point, Stage 2 worth two points and Stage 3 worth three, with the tiebreaker being the Final Stage tower. Despite the Japanese boasting superior experience and pedigrees (no Team USA member had completed Stage 3, either in Yokohama or Las Vegas), the Americans pulled off a stunning 6\u20130 win that included only one Japanese one-on-one race win (Matachi against Arnold on Stage 3.)\n\n=====''American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja''=====\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja}}\n\nWith the success of ''American Ninja Warrior'', Esquire Network announced a spin-off to the series called ''Team Ninja Warrior'' on October 9, 2015. The spin-off consists of 24 teams of three members featuring past and current ''ANW'' contestants from the first seven seasons. The series began airing on January 19, 2016 and is hosted by Akbar Gbaja-Biamila and Matt Iseman with sideline reporter Alex Curry.\n\n''College Madness'' features college teams in a five-week competition. The second season began airing on November 22, 2016 with Iseman and Biama as hosts and ''ANW'' season six contestant [[Kacy Catanzaro]] as the sideline reporter.\n\n[[USA Network|USA]] renewed the show for its second full season.\n\nIn 2018 the network renamed the show to ''American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja'' with Iseman, Biama, and Curry as hosts and new teams for its third season.\n\n===== ''American Ninja Warrior Junior'' =====\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior Junior}}\nOn May 2, 2018, [[Universal Kids]] announced a second spin-off called ''American Ninja Warrior Junior''. The spin-off consists of 192 kids from across America as they compete head to head in three different age brackets: 9-10, 11-12, and 13\u201314 years old. Each bracket will be mentored by All-Star Ninja Mentors: Drew Dreschel, Barclay Stockett, Kevin Bull, Natalie Duran, Najee Richardson and Meagan Martin. The series began airing on October 13, 2018, with Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila, joined by Olympic gold medalist Laurie Hernandez as hosts.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe American-edited ''Ninja Warrior'' episodes are broadcast in the United Kingdom on [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge]]. The show has been re-edited to remove the subtitles from the footage of the competitors taking part in the stages, but retain them for contestant interviews. The \"Ninja Killer\" and \"Warrior Wipeout\" sections remain, but there is only one advertisement break halfway through the show.\n\nThe show was voiced-over by [[Stuart Hall (presenter)|Stuart Hall]] for its first three series, aired between 2007 and 2008. In the fourth UK series, aired in 2011, Jim North took over as the voice-over. Challenge has now removed Hall's commentary from the first three series, following his imprisonment in June 2013, and re-dubbed them with new commentary by North. As of July 2012, all American edited episodes, covering all tournaments up to ''Sasuke'' 27, had aired in the UK. A new run of edited episodes airing in March 2016 was produced in the UK for Challenge, covering the ''Sasuke Rising'' tournaments, once again voiced by North. Another run of brand new edited episodes airing in June 2018 was again produced in the UK for Challenge, covering ''Sasuke'' tournaments 31\u201334, also voiced by North.\n\n====''Ninja Warrior UK''====\n{{main|Ninja Warrior UK}}\nIt was announced on 22 December 2014 that a UK remake of the format, similar to that of the American version, would be aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 2015.

Following their acquisition of all rights to ''Sasuke'', TBS renamed the show '''''Sasuke Rising''''' for the 28th, 29th and 30th editions, but have since reverted to the original name. TBS has renamed the show once again, to '''''Sasuke Ninja Warrior''''' since the 35th edition. TBS changed the show's logo for the 36th edition.\n\nApplicants are interviewed or auditioned and trial rounds are held to test their physical ability until the field is narrowed to 100 competitors. ''Sasuke'' consists of four stages of increasing difficulty; competitors must complete a stage to advance. Before the 18th tournament, a 1,200-meter run was held in order to determine the competitors' starting positions. Each competition is taped prior to the air date, edited for time, and broadcast as a three-hour show. Exceptions may be made as in ''Sasuke'' 24's case should TBS decide the broadcast should go over three hours, but this is a rare exception.\n\nIn its 37 seasons, all four stages of the course were only completed a total of five times, by four different competitors. These were [[:ja:\u79cb\u5c71\u548c\u5f66|Kazuhiko Akiyama]]<ref>[http://www.neatorama.com/2007/01/16/makoto-nagano/] April 7, 2007</ref> in the 4th competition (1999), [[Makoto Nagano]] in the 17th competition (2006), [[Yuuji Urushihara]] in the 24th (2010) and 27th (2011) competitions,<ref>\"Yuuji Urushihara does it again\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWdY38IfTE] ''Youtube'', 11/6/2011</ref> and [[Yusuke Morimoto]] in the 31st competition (2015).\n\n===Popularity===\nThe popularity of ''Sasuke'' has led to the creation of a number of spin-off shows and international versions of the show. ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'', perhaps the most well-known spin-off, is a version of ''Sasuke'' restricted to female competitors with an emphasis on speed, balance, and stability.\n\n''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' is the United States version of the show. Originally integrated with ''Sasuke'' (with American finalists participating on the ''Sasuke'' course in Japan), it was at one point the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network's highest rated show.<ref>Levin, Gary. [https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-12-07-ninja07_ST_N.htm \"Americans latch onto G4's intense 'Ninja Warrior'\"]. ''[[USA Today]]''. December 7, 2010.</ref> As of season 4, ''American Ninja Warrior'''s popularity has allowed it to move to the [[NBC]] network and expand as a stand-alone spin-off with a full replica course in Las Vegas, although Americans have continued to enter ''Sasuke'' even after the inception of ''ANW''.\n\nOther international versions of the format have aired in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Sweden, Denmark, [[Ninja Warrior UK|United Kingdom]], Bahrain, China, [[Sasuke Ninja Warrior Indonesia|Indonesia]], Russia and Vietnam, with versions also launching in France ([[TF1]]), [[Ninja Warrior Germany|Germany]] ([[RTL Television|RTL]]), Italy (NOVE of [[Discovery Networks]]) in 2016, and Israel ([[Keshet Media Group]]) in 2018. An [[Australian Ninja Warrior|Australian version]] launched on [[Nine Network]] in July 2017. [[Netflix]] also started airing ''[[Ultimate Beastmaster]]'', broadcast in six different languages in 2017, a ''Sasuke'' inspired show.\n\n==Competitors==\nThe show hosts a broad spectrum of participants. While most are from Japan, national television personalities and Olympians from other countries, including the US, [[Bulgaria]], China and Korea, have taken part in the competition. Some of the more enthusiastic competitors dress up in costumes, bring props to the starting stage, or show off some of their talents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Sasuke All-Stars===\nThe Sasuke All-Stars were a group of six favored competitors, established by the TBS network, originally thought to be the most likely to clear all four stages. It included two of the men to complete the ''Sasuke'' course, Kazuhiko Akiyama (1999, 4th tournament) and Makoto Nagano (2006, 17th tournament). The membership of the All-Stars has remained unchanged despite other successful competitors in later tournaments, notably, Yuuji Urushihara who completed the course in the 24th and 27th tournaments. The All-Stars were officially 'retired' in the 28th tournament. Two of them continue to compete independently, and are now referred to as 'former All-Stars'.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe six consisted of:\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kazuhiko Akiyama|ja|3=\u79cb\u5c71\u548c\u5f66}}''', a crab fisherman and massage therapist.

There was a brief hiatus before the term was re-popularized in ''Sasuke'' 22 when Yuuji and Kanno made it to the Third Stage.  Membership in the New Stars has included the following:\n\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Shunsuke Nagasaki|ja|3=\u9577\u5d0e\u5cfb\u4f91}}''', a trampolinist. He is considered one of the most promising of recent competitors.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} This skilled trampolinist, who is called \"Prince of the Trampoline\", has won several medals in the Trampoline World Cups and Doha Asian Games. He made his debut in ''Sasuke'' 14. He is the first to be called one of the \"Shin Sedai\" in ''Sasuke'' 17, however, he made his first Final Stage appearance in ''Sasuke'' 17 in 19 years, the second youngest to reach the Final Stage. He failed the First Stage in ''Sasuke'' 19; after that he didn't compete for six years. In 2012 he retired from athletics. He made his comeback on ''Sasuke'' 29, however he timed out on the Passing Wall. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He timed out in the Lumberjack Climb in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was all cut. He failed the Flying Bar in ''Sasuke'' 32 and failed it again in ''Sasuke'' 33. Surprisingly, he failed the Spider Walk in ''Sasuke'' 34. He failed the Spider Drop in ''Sasuke'' 35, the first time he failed the Second Stage for the two consecutive times. This meant that Nagasaki was eliminated at the Second Stage in consecutive tournaments for the first time. He failed the Dragon Glider in ''Sasuke'' 36. As of 2018, Nagasaki has completed the First Stage eleven times (five consecutively), the Second Stage seven times (four consecutively), and the Third Stage once.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Nagasaki's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 14th\n|| 67\n||Failed Wall Lifting\n||Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 15th\n|| 65\n||Failed Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 16th\n|| 89\n||Failed Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 17th\n|| 87\n||Failed Rope Climb\n||Final\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 18th\n|| 97\n||Failed Shin-Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 19th\n|| 97\n||Failed Flying Chute\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 20th\u201328th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 29th\n|| 93\n|| Failed Wall Lift\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 2986\n||Failed Crazy Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 88\n||Failed Lumberjack Climb (time out)\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 87\n||Failed Flying Bar\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 98\n|| Failed Flying Bar\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 95\n|| Failed Spider Walk\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 92\n|| Failed Spider Drop\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 94\n|| Failed Dragon Glider\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 80\n|| Failed Altered Fish Bone\n|| First\n|}\n\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Yuuji Urushihara|ja|3=\u6f06\u539f\u88d5\u6cbb}}''', a [[shoe]] salesman, an Unlimited Cliffer member No. 3.{{clarify|date=May 2017}} He spent upwards of five years trying to qualify through the ''Sasuke'' Trials. Finally, he qualified for ''Sasuke'' 21, and in the next tournament became the first competitor to reach Shin-''Sasuke''{{'s}} Final Stage. He got his Final Stage attempt in ''Sasuke'' 22, but he failed it close to the button. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he became the third person to achieve Kanzenseiha, and in ''Sasuke'' 27, he went on to become the only person to achieve it twice. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he failed the Crazy Cliffhanger. In ''Sasuke'' 29, he failed the Backstream. In ''Sasuke'' 30, he timed out on the Wall Lifting. In ''Sasuke'' 31, he took more time to clear the Tackle and timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe. In ''Sasuke'' 32, he was one of the notable competitors who failed on the new obstacle Double Pendulum when he failed the transition to the red sandbag. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he surprisingly failed Rolling Hill. He made a good transition from Quad Steps to the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance in the middle of the Rolling Hill. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he declared that if he failed the First Stage again, he would retire. Then the results show that he cleared the First Stage, but he struggled in Reverse Conveyor and timed out there. In ''Sasuke'' 35, he cleared the first few obstacles with ease, including the new Dragon Glider, but eventually timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe due to the reduced time limit and exhaustion. He finally made it to the Third Stage after 6 years in ''Sasuke'' 36, cleared the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, being the oldest to clear it, and also the oldest to attempt the next obstacle, the Vertical Limit, where he made it to the 3rd ledge before his grip gave out.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Urushihara's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| '''Competition'''\n|| '''Start position'''\n|| '''Obstacle'''\n|| '''Stage'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 21st\n|| 72\n|| Failed Flying Chute\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 22nd\n|| 77\n|| Failed G-Rope\n|| Final\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 23rd\n|| 99\n|| Failed Unstable Bridge\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 24th\n|| 93\n|| '''Kanzenseiha (3.57 seconds to spare)'''\n|| '''Final'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 25th\n| 100\n|| Failed Double Salmon Ladder\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 26th\n|| 100\n|| Failed Half-Pipe Attack\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 27th\n|| 99 \n|| '''Kanzenseiha (6.71 seconds to spare)''' \n|| '''Final'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 28th\n|| 88 \n|| Failed Crazy Cliffhanger\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 29th\n|| 99\n|| Failed Backstream\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 2993\n|| Failed Wall Lifting\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 99\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 89\n|| Failed Double Pendulum\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 89\n|| Failed Rolling Hill\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 99\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyor\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 95\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 95\n|| Failed Vertical Limit Kai\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 96\n|| Failed Pipe Slider\n|| Third\n|}\n\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Hitoshi Kanno|ja|3=\u83c5\u91ce\u4ec1\u5fd7}}''', a janitorial worker/jewelry designer.

He competed five times. He competed since ''Sasuke'' 16 but his run was all cut. After a seven-year hiatus, he competed in ''Sasuke'' 28, he failed the Spin Bridge and the second wall of the Ni Ren Soritatsu Kabe in ''Sasuke'' 30. He also competed in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was completely cut. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 32 wearing number 66, and completed the First Stage for the first time with just 2.12 seconds remaining. He then went on to clear the Second Stage, becoming one of eight to do so, with 9.59 seconds remaining. However, his first attempt on the Third Stage was a struggle. On the first transition of the Drum Hopper he slipped and nearly fell, and only just managed to reposition himself, while the other transitions showed signs of unease. His strength was sapped for the next obstacle, the Flying Bar, where he failed the first transition after the bar did not reach the second set of rungs. In his fluff piece for ''Sasuke'' 32, it was falsely stated that he had failed the First Stage four times, when in fact he had competed for the first time in four tournaments beforehand. In ''Sasuke'' 33, his run was digested but he failed the Double Pendulum. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he failed the Sidewinder Kai. He was unable to repeat his performance from the previous tournament as he had a surprising fall on the Fish Bone in ''Sasuke'' 35. He managed to clear the Warped Wall but he timed out on the top of the wall before reaching the button in ''Sasuke'' 36.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Suzuki's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 16th\n|| ?\n||Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 17th\u201327th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 28th\n|| 24\n||Failed Spin Bridge\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 29th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 2943\n||Failed Double Warped Wall (time out)\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 65\n||Failed Orugoru\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 66\n||Failed Flying Bar\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 93\n|| Failed Double Pendulum\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 84\n|| Failed Sidewinder Kai\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 94\n|| Failed Fishbone\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 82\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 75\n|| Failed Spider Walk\n|| Second\n|}\n\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Hiroyuki Asaoka|ja|3=\u671d\u5ca1\u5f18\u884c}}''', a former elementary school teacher turned illustrator.

athletes====\n\nSeveral Japanese athletes have competed in ''Sasuke'' over the years, including professional team [[Team handball|handball]] player [[Daisuke Miyazaki]], who was featured in the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 26th competitions. In his debut, the 20th competition, he failed on the Halfpipe Attack. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 21, where he made it all the way to the Third Stage Devil Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he timed out on the Net Climb in Stage 1, and in ''Sasuke'' 26, he failed the First Stage's Rolling Escargot.\n\nSprinter [[Hisatsugu Suzuki]], who competed in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], appeared in the 13th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Cross Bridge.\n\nAnother competitor from the 1992 Olympics, gymnast [[Yoshiaki Hatakeda]], competed in the 6th tournament, making it all the way to Stage 3 before falling on the Cliff Hanger.\n\nAfter the 27th competition, three Japanese Olympians competed: [[Tomoko Hagiwara]], [[Koki Sakamoto]], and [[Daisuke Nakano]]. Hagiwara competed in the 28th competition, but she failed the Quintuple Step. She also competed in the 29th competition, but she failed the Hedgehog. Sakamoto competed in the 28th competition, wearing #95 (the highest number for non all-stars that tournament), but he timed out on the second Warped Wall. Nakano competed in the 29th competition, but he failed the Jump Hang Kai, while trying to grab both nets.\n\nPole Vaulter [[Seito Yamamoto]], who competed in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], [[2016 Summer Olympics]], and also [[2018 Asian Games]], appeared in the 35th and 36th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Dragon Glider twice.\n\n====American athletes====\nVarious American athletes, including Olympic [[gymnastics|gymnasts]] (and twin brothers) [[Paul Hamm|Paul]] and [[Morgan Hamm]], have competed in ''Sasuke''. Paul made it to the Second Stage in the 14th and 16th competitions but failed to make it further&nbsp;\u2013 in the 14th, he cleared Wall Lifting but forgot to hit the button at the end before time ran out, and in the 16th, he was eliminated by the Metal Spin. He competed in the 15th competition as well, but he failed to make it past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Morgan timed out in the First Stage before he could attempt the Rope Climb in the 14th competition, but he made it to the Third Stage in the 15th, failing on the Curtain Cling. In the 16th competition, he failed the First Stage's Warped Wall.\n\n[[Decathlon|Decathlete]] [[Paul Terek]] competed four times in total. He first appeared in the 17th competition, making it to the Third Stage before failing the Cliffhanger. The announcer pointed to his immense size (6 foot 3 and 215 pounds) as a barrier to his advancement. After earning the title of ''Pro Sportsman No. 1'' in 2007, Terek appeared in the 19th competition but failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider. He helped G4 oversee the 2nd ''American Ninja Challenge'' competition in early 2008, but he did not compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th competition due to his training for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (though he eventually had to drop out of the running for the Olympics after suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee). He made his return to ''Sasuke'' in the 22nd competition but failed on a new obstacle in the First Stage, the Slider Jump. He failed the same obstacle in ''Sasuke'' 24. In 2010, Paul Terek announced his retirement from international competition, so it is likely he will never compete again.\n\n[[Henry Cejudo]], gold medal-winning [[freestyle wrestling|wrestler]] at the [[2008 Olympic Games]] in Beijing, competed in the 21st competition, but failed the First Stage's Halfpipe Attack.\n\nLevi Meeuwenberg, a [[Freerunning|free runner]] from G4's ''American Ninja Challenge 2'', first competed in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he was one of only three people to clear the First Stage and the only person to clear the Second Stage. He cleared Stage 2 with a record time of 38.5 seconds left. He failed the Third Stage's Shin-Cliffhanger. In the 21st competition, he failed the Salmon Ladder in the Second Stage; in the 22nd, he failed the new Slider Jump; in the 23rd, he made it back to the Third Stage but failed the Shin-Cliffhanger again. He missed the 24th competition but returned for the 25th, where he failed the first obstacle of the Second Stage, the Slider Drop.

Nakamura made it to the Third Stage in the 2nd competition, failing there on the Pipe Slider, but in the 6th competition he was eliminated by the First Stage's Jump Hang. Morohoshi debuted in the 20th tournament but failed the Log Grip in the First Stage. Ishimaru has never made it past the First Stage; his two closest attempts, in the 16th and 17th competitions, timed out on the Rope Climb. [[Sh\u014dei]] competed three times. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 6, and failed the Jump Hang when he tried to go under using only his arms. He timed out on the Rope Climb in Stage 1 in ''Sasuke'' 7. He finally made it past the First Stage and Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 8. He struggled in Stage 3 on the Propeller Bars, and failed the Body Prop.\n\nActor James Okada, a graduate from a martial arts academy, competed in the 6th and 7th competitions. In his first attempt, he failed the Jump Hang in the First Stage, but in the next tournament, he made it all the way to the Third, where he was defeated by the first obstacle, the Propeller Bars.\n\nActor and singer [[Tetsuji Sakakibara]] competed four times (23rd\u201326th tournaments) but never cleared the First Stage, failing on the Jumping Spider in the 23rd and 24th tournaments, the Jump Hang in the 25th tournament, and the Half-Pipe Attack in the 26th tournament.\n\nActor [[Ryosuke Yamamoto (actor)|Ryosuke Yamamoto]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 30 and ''Sasuke'' 31. He never completed the First Stage, failing in Jump Hang Kai in ''Sasuke'' 30. In ''Sasuke'' 31 he did slightly worse by failing the Orug\u014dru (also known as the Music Box) before he could reach the Jump Hang Kai again.\n\n[[Voice acting in Japan|Voice actress]] [[Tomoko Kaneda]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 31. She failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Her husband, [[Wataru Mori]], an actor, also competed in several competitions. Mori has competed since ''Sasuke'' 16; he failed Rolling Log. Then he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 21 and failed Jumping Spider. After an eight-year hiatus, he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 32; he timed out on the Lumberjack Climb. He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 33, where he completed the First Stage, and timed out at the Reverse Conveyor. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he surprisingly failed the last steps on the Quad Steps, his foot slipping to the left. He eventually timed out on the Warped Wall in ''Sasuke'' 35. In ''Sasuke'' 36, when he reach the Reverse Conveyor, he used his legs to support himself on the sides of the Conveyor.

In ''Sasuke'' 34, Darvish made it to the 2nd Stage, but he struggled in the Reverse Conveyor. He made it to the Second Stage, he professed slightly further, timing out after lifting the first wall of the Wall Lifting, while Kyan failed the Dragon Glider in ''Sasuke'' 35. Darvish finally made to the Third Stage, he failed the transition to the Sidewinder Kai while Kyan failed the Dragon Glider in ''Sasuke'' 36.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Darvish's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 28th\n|| 31\n|| Failed Rolling Escargot\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 29th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 2979\n|| Failed Lumberjack Climb\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 82\n|| Failed Cross Slider\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 91\n|| Failed Tie Fighter\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 82\n|| Failed Lumberjack Climb\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 89\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyor\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 96\n|| Failed Wall Lifting (time out)\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 98\n|| Failed Sidewinder Kai\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 97\n|| Failed Dragon Glider\n|| First\n|}\n\n[[Model (person)|Model]] [[Shimon Okura]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 30.

Most of these compete for entertainment value and do not represent serious challenges&nbsp;\u2013 for example, Choshu's only accomplishment was being the first person to clear the Rope Glider in the 18th competition. However, some have seen success. Omori made it to the Final Stage three times in a row (1st\u20133rd competitions), a record that is shared with ''Sasuke'' all-star [[Makoto Nagano]], but since then he has not been able to clear the First Stage. Nakayama made it to the Second Stage in the 9th and 11th competitions; in the 9th, Nakayama failed the Spider Walk, and in the 11th, he missed hitting the Second Stage's final button by a split-second. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 27. He had footage showing himself training for the new course. He wore #30, and despite his training, he failed the Rolling Escargot when he could not get enough momentum to get the structure spinning, and fell into the water when trying to restart the obstacle. He got revenge on it in the 28th tournament, but timed out on the second Warped Wall. In the 29th tournament, he almost cleared the First Stage for the first time in 10 years, but ultimately, timed out at the top of the Rope Ladder. Recent comedians include [[Yoshio Kojima]], who competed in five competitions (22, 24, 26\u201328), where he failed at the Log Grip twice, Hazard Swing, Step Slider, and Rolling Escargot respectively. Funnyman [[Masumi Yagi]] was featured in the 26th competition but failed on the Step Slider. Cocky comedian [[Eiko Kano]] (aka \"Mr. Narcissus\") was featured in the 25th competition and failed at the Dome Steps, but got past the first obstacle in the 26th competition and failed at the Rolling Escargot.\n\nPenalty comedian{{clarify|reason=In English, penalties aren't funny.|date=June 2018}} {{Interlanguage link multi|Wakky|ja|3=\u30ef\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc}} competed nine times in ''Sasuke''. He debuted in ''Sasuke'' 20 and failed the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 21 and 22, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he got revenge on both the Jumping Spider and the Halfpipe Attack, only to fail the Slider Jump. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Halfpipe Attack again. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 27 and cleared the First Stage for the first time. In the Second Stage, he failed the Double Salmon Ladder. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he timed out on the Rope Ladder. He advanced to the Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 29 and 30, but failed the Swap Salmon Ladder.\n\n===Other notable competitors===\n65-year-old Minoru Kuramochi, known as \"the Octopus\" because he usually brings an octopus with him, is the owner of the Edokko Izakaya octopus bar in Tokyo and is one of the oldest competitors. He has competed several times, never making it very far into the First Stage. Despite this, he seems to be a fan favorite. In the 20th competition's preview special, he welcomed the G4 American Ninja Challengers to his bar, served them his special octopus meal, and showed off his physical skills to them. He is No. 4 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 26, where he managed to make it to the Rolling Escargot. He got further than in ''Sasuke'' 19, when he timed out on the Pole Maze.\n\nToyohisa Ijima, a martial arts dance instructor and former member of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], competed in the first several tournaments. He is known as the \"Japanese Bruce Lee\" because of his resemblance to the [[Bruce Lee|late action star]], which extends to dressing and acting like him. He has only made it past the First Stage in the 1st tournament; in the 11th tournament, he missed hitting the final button on the Rope Climb by a split second because he had wasted time posing for the crowd after completing each obstacle. He is No. 3 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll.\n\n46-year-old Katsuhide Torisawa is a former weightlifter who has competed in every single Shin-''Sasuke'' tournament (except ''Sasuke'' 22), starting with ''Sasuke'' 18. He always displays his strength before his run; he has brought a barbell and lifted it over his head multiple times, ripped off his shirt, and crushed an apple and full cans of beer with one hand, and also snapped a baseball bat in half. He has never cleared the First Stage.\n\n===Women in ''Sasuke''===\nThe first woman to have completed the First Stage is former ''[[Super Sentai]]'' stuntwoman [[Chie Tanabe|Chie Nishimura]], who did so in the 2nd tournament.<ref>In that tournament, her last name was listed as Tanabe because at the time she was single.</ref> She attempted the Second Stage's Spider Walk in a non-optimal fashion, because her legs were too short to reach across the obstacle the proper way, and failed. She also competed in ''Sasuke'' 3 but failed the Rolling Log. She hasn't competed in ''Sasuke'' since.\n\n[[:jp:\u904a\u4f50\u96c5\u7f8e|Masami Yusa]] (G4 mislists her first name as \"Miyabi\" in some tournaments), a [[Beach Flags (sport)|beach flags]] champion, has competed eight times. She debuted in ''Sasuke'' 6, but failed the Barrel Climb. In the ''Sasuke'' 13 trials, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang, although she timed out there. During the actual competition, she was able to grab on to the redesigned Jump Hang, but she misjudged her jump, slammed face-first onto the platform, and fell into the water; this failure earned her a \"Warrior Wipeout\" during G4's broadcasting of this tournament. In ''Sasuke'' 14, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang and the Crooked Wall in competition, but she ultimately timed out on the Warped Wall.\n\nAll three women who achieved ''kanzenseiha'' on ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'' ''(Women of Ninja Warrior)'', the female equivalent of ''Sasuke'', have also competed in ''Sasuke'' itself, though none have cleared Stage 1. All are also acrobats who worked with Muscle Musical.\n\n* Ayako Miyake, who achieved ''Kunoichi'' total victory three straight times ''(Kunoichi 4\u20136)'', has also competed in ''Sasuke'' twice, going out in Stage 1 both times \u2013 the Sandan Rolling Maruta in ''Sasuke'' 17 and the Jumping Spider in ''Sasuke'' 18.\n* ''Kunoichi 8'' champion Rie Komiya, who is a broadcaster and model as well as an acrobat, has competed several times. She first competed in ''Sasuke'' 22, where she was disqualified on the Jumping Spider for falling into the safety mat just after the trampoline. She got her revenge in ''Sasuke'' 23, but she fell on the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 24, she surprised many by failing the Log Grip. She did not compete in ''Sasuke'' 25, but did compete in ''Sasuke'' 26, and failed the Rolling Escargot and she competed again in ''Sasuke'' 27, where she failed the Rolling Escargot again.\n* Satomi Kadoi, the other ''Kunoichi 8'' champion, competed in ''Sasuke'' 27 and failed the Halfpipe Attack.\n\nAmerican gymnast [[Kacy Catanzaro]], who famously became the first woman in the world to clear both the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder during ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' qualifiers in Dallas in 2014, traveled to the original Mt. Midoriyama for ''Sasuke'' 32 and cleared the Warped Wall at the second attempt before narrowly timing out.\n\nAnother American woman and ''American Ninja Warrior'' standout, stuntwoman [[Jessie Graff]] \u2013 the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') \u2013 was one of the two invited US entrants including Drew Drechsel in ''Sasuke'' 34 the next year. She became only the second woman in ''Sasuke'' history after Nishimura to complete the First Stage, doing so with 14.5 seconds left on the clock (which would have been under the limit set for the male competitors as well; the female competitors were given an extra 10 seconds.) She then surprised everyone once again when she managed to complete Stage 2 with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, becoming the very first woman to ever clear the Second Stage in ''Sasuke''. In Stage 3, Graff started strongly, completing the first three obstacles in good form. However, despite her determination, she failed the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she attempted the first jump from the first to the second ledge and was unable to hold on. However, having impressed the onlookers, she was invited back for the following tournament. She did not return until Sasuke 37, however, but she went on to clear stage 1 and 2 again, becoming the only woman to reach stage 3 twice. She failed the first flip of the Cliffhanger Dimension, in the same place as Sasuke 34. '''''(insert list of runs here)'''''\n\nA Shinkin Bank employee who has been competed on ''Kunoichi'', {{Interlanguage link multi|Ayano Oshima|ja|3=\u5927\u5d8b\u3042\u3084\u306e}}, She first completed in ''Sasuke'' 31. Her run was digested, but it was shown that she had timed out as she was getting up the Warped Wall. Ayano once again returned for ''Sasuke'' 36. She was the first Japanese woman to ever clear the Dragon Glider. Although, she became to tired after finishing the tackle, and timed out at the Warped Wall.\n\n===American Ninja Challenges===\n{{Main|American Ninja Challenge}}\nIn fall 2007, the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network held a contest called the ''American Ninja Challenge'', whose grand prize was a trip to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 19th competition. Ten semifinalist videos were selected on August 3 via internet poll to determine three finalists who would appear on G4's ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' on August 28\u201330 to demonstrate their ''Ninja Warrior'' skills. On August 31, [[Michigan State University]] Economics student Colin Bell and the runner-up, [[Greenville, South Carolina]] native Brett Sims, were both selected, and they became the subjects of an hour-long G4 special on November 14 during G4's ''Ninjafest''. Ultimately, both Colin and Brett qualified for the course thanks to their impressive physical abilities, but they both failed the Jumping Spider.\n\nThe second contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 2'' on May 18, 2008. Levi Meeuwenberg of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and Brian Orosco of San Francisco, California were both chosen to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th tournament; both are [[Parkour|free runners]]. They competed alongside surprise guest Brett Sims, who was given the opportunity to return by G4. Sims failed the First Stage's Warped Wall, while Orosco failed the Flying Chute. Meeuwenberg, however, made it to the Third Stage before he ultimately failed the Shin-Cliffhanger. In that tournament, he was the last man standing.\n\nThe third contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 3'' on November 12, 2008. Viewers voted for their favorite competitors, the top three of whom would be flown to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 21st tournament. The winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and free runner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg&nbsp;\u2013 the first woman to qualify&nbsp;\u2013 of [[Valley Village, California]]. They joined ''American Ninja Challenge'' 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', [[Olivia Munn]] and [[Kevin Pereira]], to compete in ''Sasuke'' 21. In that tournament, Munn failed the Sextuple Step, while Pereira's run ended after his feet hit the water on the Log Grip; on the TBS broadcast, Munn's run was shown only in part while Pereira's run was cut completely. Romberg failed the Halfpipe Attack, while Witmer failed the Log Grip due to a severe [[ulnar nerve]] injury that he suffered while warming up. Orosco completed the First Stage with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock but failed the Second Stage's Salmon Ladder. Meeuwenberg cleared Stage 1 with the fastest time, with 21.5 seconds remaining, but similarly failed the Salmon Ladder.\n\nThe fourth contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2009 and aired on June 21, 2009 on G4 as part of ''Ninjafest 4''. The competitors' videos were judged by ''Attack of the Show''{{'s}} Olivia Munn. The winner, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], was joined by Munn and previous competitors Levi Meeuwenberg and Luci Romberg. Munn failed the new Circle Hammer in the First Stage; Romberg failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider; Campbell timed out on the final First Stage obstacle, the Rope Ladder, and later told the sideline reporter that he \"underestimated the cardio\" involved in the course. Meeuwenberg failed a new First Stage obstacle, the Slider Jump.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 [[Jessie Graff]] went on to compete in ''Sasuke'' 34, wearing number #87. She made an impressive mark becoming the second woman in the show's history to clear Stage 1. She also kept the streak going when she became the first woman ever to clear Stage 2. During her Stage 3 run she showed great upper body strength on the course, getting through the first three obstacles, she made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she failed the jump from the first ledge to the second ledge.\n\n==Results==\n{{main|List of Sasuke competitions}}\nThe following is a list of available information of people who achieved the best results in each competition and also the number of competitors who failed in the lower stages. Under each competition, the results are listed in order of best performance. Their names are listed along with their number (1\u2013100) from the competition, and the stage/obstacle they failed to complete (or Total Victory). In the 10th competition the number system ran from 901 to 1000 to indicate that 1000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and then ran from 1901 to 2000 in the 20th competition to indicate that 2000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and from 2901 to 3000 during the 30th competition to indicate roughly 3000 attempts on ''Sasuke''. All air dates are of the Japanese broadcast on TBS.\n\n=== ''Sasuke'' 1 ===\n{{See also|List of Sasuke competitions#1st competition}}\nAired: September 27, 1997\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible

The object is to hit the [[buzzer]] at the end of the course before the allotted time expires. If a competitor goes out of bounds or comes into contact with the water in any of the pits below the course, he or she is disqualified from the competition.\n\nTypically, 85 to 90 of the 100 original entrants are eliminated in this stage. However, in the 4th competition, a record 37 of the original 100 competitors made it past the First Stage. After the 4th, 17th, 24th, and 27th competition, the First Stage was thoroughly redesigned to be much more difficult and prevent large numbers of people from moving on. In fact, a G4 special inside the making of the 18th ''Sasuke'' competition revealed that the redesign of the First Stage for the 18th competition was done with the intention of seeing all 100 challengers fail it. This did not happen, however, and that has only spurred the production team on to make this and all stages to follow even harder.\n\nThat goal was almost met in the 19th competition, where much to everyone's surprise, only two competitors cleared the First Stage (neither of the two being ''Sasuke'' All-Stars), a record in ''Sasuke'' history. (The only time something similar has happened was in the first ''Kunoichi'', where again, only two competitors cleared the First Stage.) Executive producer Ushio Higuchi said in interviews later that even he was surprised at the results, anticipating that around 10 to 12 people would survive in spite of the production team's attempts at making the First Stage unbeatable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} Although the names of the obstacles were different from the second tournament, the obstacles were still the same.\n\n{{note|2|2}} TBS officially considers that they are two different obstacles as their two names \"{{lang|ja|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0}}\"(Free Climbing) and \"{{lang|ja|\ufffd?\u767b\u308a}}\"(Wall Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. However, ''Ninja Warrior'' has referred to the Free Climbing/Wall Climb combination as the \"Mountain Climb\" in subtitles.\n\n{{note|3|3}} This Hill Climb is completely different from the one that would later be replaced with the Warped Wall after the 4th competition.\n\n{{note|4|4}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Prism See-Saw\" is called the \"Prism Tilt\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Prism See-Saw.\"\n\n{{note|5|5}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Cross Bridge\" is called the \"Bridge of Blades\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Cross Bridge.\"\n\n{{note|6|6}} Although referred to as the Jump Hang, the obstacle in the 13th competition consisted of many ropes hanging vertically, completely different from the rope net used in all other competitions. Some call it the \"Rope Hang,\" but that name is erroneous.\n\n{{note|7|7}} The Rope Ladder's name and obstacle symbol was not shown in ''Ninja Warrior's'' obstacle chart in the 18th due to lack of room for TV screening. However, in the 19th they had the Rope Ladder and NOT the Tarzan Rope. The Japanese announcer still calls the last two obstacles by their official names.\n\n{{note|8|8}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Double Pendulum\" is called the \"Tic Toc\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|9|9}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', The X-Bridge is called the ''Bridge of Blades'' in subtitles just like the Cross Bridge.\n\n{{note|10|10}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Rolling Escargot\" is called the \"Rolling Snail\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|12|12}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Tackle\" is called the \"Triple Tackle\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|13|13}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"TIE Fighter\" is called the \"Prop Slider\" in the UK English dub due to not having the rights from [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] to use the name associated with the Star Wars fighter after which the obstacle was named.\n\n===Stage 2===\nThose with enough skill to complete Stage One then take on an even more grueling set of obstacles in Stage Two. 283 competitors have reached the Second Stage. Like Stage One, the obstacles alter throughout the competitions, but all hold to the same principle: if the competitor makes a single mistake they fall into the water below. The obstacles determine the time limit, and it is usually between 50 and 100 seconds.\n\nUnlike the First Stage, which has always required the competitors to hit a buzzer at the end of the course to stop the clock and pass the course, the Second Stage did not have a buzzer at its end until the 8th competition. Before then, the competitors simply walked through an open gate to stop the clock.  From the 8th competition onward, the buzzer opens the gate. If the competitor breaks the gate open without hitting the button, they are disqualified. In addition, the course judges can hold the gates closed if a competitor committed a foul earlier in the Second Stage that would result in their disqualification, such as using the Chain Reaction gloves on the Spider Walk as \"Mr. ''Sasuke''\" Katsumi Yamada had done in the 12th competition.\n\nOn average, 10 to 15 competitors attempt the Second Stage on each competition. A record 37 competitors attempted the Second Stage during the 4th competition. Also during the 4th competition, a record 11 competitors cleared the Second Stage. During the 5th competition, however, only three men made it to the Second Stage due to new, tougher obstacles in the First Stage. In the 19th competition, neither of the two qualified competitors cleared the circuit (a fall and a timeout on the Salmon Ladder), marking the earliest end of a ''Sasuke'' competition.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

\u2014 This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} The Moving Walls and Spider Climb are actually included in the Spider Walk, but TBS officially considers that they are three different areas as their three names \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30af}}\" (Spider Walk), \"{{lang|ja|\u52d5\u304f\u58c1}}\" (Moving Walls) and \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0}}\" (Spider Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. ''Ninja Warrior'' just sees them as a single obstacle and calls it \"Spider Walk\".\n\n{{note|2|2}} The onscreen Japanese graphics \"{{lang|ja|\u4e94\u9023\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc}}\" reveal this obstacle's official name as \"Five Continuous Hammers\". On ''Ninja Warrior'', this obstacle is referred to as the Hammer Dodge.\n\n{{note|3|3}} In those competitions there are two \"Moving Walls\" in the Spider Walk, but TBS does not officially call them independent obstacles, and just considered the whole Spider Walk as one obstacle only.\n\n{{note|4|4}} After the 27th tournament, there was one bridge (with four chains) instead of two.\n\n{{note|5|5}} The Rolling Log appeared in SASUKE 37 as the original first obstacle of Stage 2, but due to rain, it did not function correctly. The judges decided to start Stage 2 at the Salmon Ladder Ascent with a lowered time limit of 100 seconds.\n\n</div>\n\n===Third Stage===\nThe Third Stage has no time limit, allowing contestants to go at their own pace. Contestants are allowed a few seconds of rest between obstacles during which they can apply \"sticky spray\" to improve their grip. While the first two stages focus on speed and agility, this course almost exclusively tests one's upper body strength and stamina.\n\nOut of 3,000 total competitors and 283 Second Stage competitors, 139 have attempted the Third Stage. The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only six have passed it more than once, namely Akira Omori, Shingo Yamamoto, Makoto Nagano, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, and Yusuke Morimoto.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Each of these share a single, common goal: to scale the tower and reach the button at the top before time expires. If the competitor does not reach the top platform in time, the rope is cut and the competitor falls (they are caught by a safety line). Starting from the 18th competition, the rope is no longer cut. Reaching the top is referred to as ''kanzenseiha'' ({{lang|ja|\u5b8c\u5168\u5236\u8987}}), translated roughly as \"complete domination\", and rendered on ''Ninja Warrior'' as \"total victory\". The Final Stage's time limit is between 30 and 45 seconds.\n\nOf all the competitors to attempt to claim victory, only 24 have been admitted to the Final Stage, and only six of them have gotten there more than once (Akira Omori in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd competitions, Shingo Yamamoto in the 3rd and 7th, Makoto Nagano in the 11th, 12th, 13th, his victory in the 17th competition and in the 23rd competition, Yuuji Urushihara in the 22nd and his victories in the 24th competition and 27th, Ryo Matachi in the 27th competition and 30th, Yusuke Morimoto's victory in the 31st competition and in the 35th competition). Currently there are only four victors: Kazuhiko Akiyama defeated ''Sasuke'' in the 4th competition, Makoto Nagano in the 17th, Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th and in the 27th, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st.\n\nThe original Final Stage consisted of climbing a 15-meter (49&nbsp;ft) rope. The contestant must start climbing from a seated position.\n\nThe second version of the Final Stage was unveiled in the 7th competition, when Shingo Yamamoto became the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was increased to {{convert|22.5|m|ft}}.  It consists of a {{convert|12.5|m|ft}} Spider Climb followed by a {{convert|10|m|ft}} Rope Climb.  After 15 seconds, the walls of the Spider Climb spread apart. This ensnared [[Yordan Yovtchev]] during the 8th competition, when he failed to complete the Spider Climb before it began spreading, and fell off the tower.\n\nThe third version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 22nd competition, when Yuuji Urushihara was the first to try it. The height of the tower remained mostly the same as the second version of the Final Stage, but two new obstacles were used: a {{convert|13|m|ft|adj=on}} \"Heavenly Ladder\" and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} \"G Rope.\" The time limit was increased to 45 seconds, then reduced to 40 seconds in the 23rd competition. Competitors are not dropped due to the Heavenly Ladder being in the way.\n\nThe fourth version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 27th competition, when Ryo Matachi was the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was reduced to 20 meters and consisted of a 20-meter (66&nbsp;ft) Rope Climb similar to the first version of the Final Stage, but with a 5-meter height difference. The time limit stayed at 40 seconds. Unlike the first version of the Final Stage, competitors started at a standing position instead of a seated position.\n\nThe fifth version of the Final Stage was briefly seen in Stage 3 and in a trailer of ''Sasuke Rising''. Its design was similar to that of the fourth version of the Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb. Unlike its predecessor, this version is 4&nbsp;m taller, and the competitors would have likely climbed up the rope in a seated position. The time limit would have likely been 35 seconds, as Urushihara may have cleared this particular version with one second left. It was used for only one tournament.\n\nFor the sixth version, with the removal of the previous version of the Final Stage, it was not unusual to see a change similar to that of the 18\u201324 version from the Metal Ladder to the Heavenly Ladder. The previous Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb was thrown out all together and the return of the 7\u201317 Final Stage took its place. The Spider Walls seem to take up less space this time, and the Rope Climb appears to take up more. Nevertheless, the height of the tower has once again increased, this time to 24&nbsp;m. The Spider Climb (\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0) appears to be the same as its predecessor, at 12.5&nbsp;m, while the Rope Climb (\u7db1\u767b\u308a) was slightly modified in length at 11.5&nbsp;m from that of its original predecessor, at 10&nbsp;m. The time limit is likely to stay the same at 30 seconds, though a 35-second Final Stage is not out of the question.\n\nThe prize for completing the Final Stage was [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]2,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|2000000|JPN}}). The prize has now increased to [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]4,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|4000000|JPN}}) since the completion of the 17th tournament. In the 24th tournament a [[Nissan Fuga]] was also a prize if anyone could complete the Final Stage.\n\nTypically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all. However, both the 3rd and 24th competitions saw a record five competitors attempt the Final Stage. After the 4th competition, though, the Final Stage was only achieved on average every other tournament.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Each episode now lasts thirty minutes and it also includes some minor changes in the on-screen graphics. Throughout the episode, there's the \"Ninja Killer\" (for the obstacle that took out the most competitors) and \"Warrior Wipeout\" (honors the best wipeout) segments. The Japanese [[play-by-play]] commentary and interviews with the competitors have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], while the competitor profiles, [[Instant replay|replays]], and introductions were [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by [[voice actor]] [[Dave Wittenberg]].\n\nThe show became the highest rated program on the network since its debut. Aside from a few sporadic occurrences, reruns of ''Ninja Warrior'' stopped airing regularly sometime in December 2012 in wake of G4 slated to be rebranded as the [[Esquire Network]] on September 23, 2013. The last four episodes to air on G4 appeared as a two-hour block on April 10, 2013. It is unknown if ''Ninja Warrior'' would return to the network's schedule or if some other channel would acquire the series. Commercials on G4 show ''American Ninja Warrior'' to air on G4 in July, marking it the last program being advertised on the network as a G4 program, and not an Esquire channel presentation.\n\nAs of August 3, 2016, an article released by ''USA Today'' says that \"Esquire has obtained rights to 27 Ninja Warrior tournaments...along with all eight Kunoichi spinoff contests that feature only women contestants.\" and that they \"...will return as a 63 hour Labor Day weekend marathon (Sept. 3, 7 a.m. ET/PT) in Japanese, with English subtitles.\" Whether this is referring to the original broadcasts or the G4 broadcasts is unknown right now due to little notice, but it seems to lean toward the G4 broadcasts. They also stated that \"Additional newer tournaments of the series, never seen in the U.S., will debut next year.\" As of 2019, new episodes have not been shown on U.S. airwaves, and the 27th competition remains the most recent one to be aired in America.\n\n====''American Ninja Warrior''====\n\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior}}\nThe popularity of the ''American Ninja Challenge'' has led G4 to produce a version of the series featuring American contestants called ''American Ninja Warrior'', which is produced by Pilgrim Films and Television, Inc and is currently hosted by [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] and [[Matt Iseman]]. Auditions on G4's website ended on August 18, 2009. Open tryouts were held in Los Angeles on August 29 and 30, 2009, and were taped for the show, with ten finalists competing on the 23rd tournament of the original Ninja Warrior course in Japan in September 2009. The eight-episode series began airing on December 12, 2009.\n\nThe qualifying round consists of over 300 competitors, running an obstacle course strongly influenced by ''Sasuke''{{'s}} First Stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, a modified version of the Pipe Slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the Jumping Bars, and a Net Climb.\n\n''American Ninja Warrior'' aired only the American finalists during the ''Sasuke'' obstacle course. The Japanese competitors were later aired on April 10, 2010.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 2)|second season]] was cast on G4's website as of April 10, 2010 and aired in hour long specials starting December 8, 2010. The top 10 contestants would participate in ''Sasuke'' 26. Three episodes were run for the first two weeks. The first three episodes covered the opening round of the competition; the fourth covered the semifinals.  This was followed by four days of a \"boot camp\" where the fifteen winners of the semifinals were divided into three five-man teams and put through several different Pressure Challenges, with the losing team having to complete a punishment while the other two teams got extra training time on models of some of the ''Sasuke'' obstacles (The Warped Wall, Double Salmon Ladder, Balance Tank, and Circle Slider).  The teams would then run through a grouping of the obstacles with some sort of hindrance (usually carrying something heavy between obstacles). The teams with the worst time would be forced to send two members to an elimination challenge, with the losing person forced to leave.\n\nAfter boot camp, the ten final winners traveled to the ''Sasuke'' course to compete. Once again, only the American competitors were aired during the special, with the rest of the ''Sasuke'' competition to air later. The most successful of the American competitors in the past, Levi Meeuwenberg, withdrew from the competition due to a fractured wrist, giving his spot to Adam LaPlante. Five members failed in the First Stage: Patrick Cusic and former ''[[American Gladiators (1989 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' champion and gladiator [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]] both fell from the new Rolling Escargot obstacle, LaPlante fell on the Halfpipe Attack and Adam Truesdell fell from the Giant Swing, a new variation of the Jump Hang, the only one out of all 100 competitors to do so in the whole tournament. In addition, veteran Shane Daniels once again timed out on the Cargo Net. In the Second Stage, four of the remaining five cleared, while Travis Furlanic fell on the Balance Tank, an obstacle he struggled on during boot camp. In the Third Stage, Paul Kasemir failed the Doorknob Grasper. Brent Steffensen made it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger before falling into the water. [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], despite having the fastest times of all the competitors to compete (finishing the Second Stage with over 24 seconds left) failed at the Ultimate Cliffhanger as well. Brian Orosco fell at the very first obstacle, the Roulette Cylinder, which he had passed easily in the previous competition. While the $250,000 prize went unclaimed, ''Sasuke'' 26 was the start of a successful showing by a collection of American competitors.\n\nThe [[American Ninja Warrior (season 3)|third season of ''American Ninja Warrior'']] debuted on July 31 on G4, again with 300 competitors at the tryouts in Venice Beach. While many top competitors were absent including Levi Meeuwenberg, Rich King and Luci Romberg, a talented crop of new competitors took their place including Denver Broncos wide receiver Matt Willis, who finished the course but did not qualify for boot camp. Other notable competitors who failed to advance to boot camp included two-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Shane Daniels, season two veterans [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]], Adam Truesdell, Adam LaPlante and Patrick Cusic, top first round qualifiers from the previous season Trevor Vaughn and David Money, and former world freerunning champion Tim Shieff. In addition, professional freerunner and ''[[Survivor: China]]'' competitor Michael \"Frosti\" Zernow ranked in the top fifteen and was invited to boot camp, but injured himself and was replaced with fellow ''Jump City: Seattle'' competitor Jake Smith. Other competitors from ''Jump City'' who advanced to boot camp also included Brian Orasco, Drew Dreschel and David \"Young Flip\" Rodriguez. The level of competition in boot camp was noticeably higher in the third season, as competitors were only given one attempt at each obstacle in challenges, leading to a large increase in time penalties. Promising competitors Dustin Rocho, Brandon Douglass, Alan {{Not a typo|Connealy}}, second-seeded qualifier Chris Wilczewski and five-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Brian Orosco all saw their ''Sasuke'' dreams come to an end at boot camp.\n\nOf the ten who advanced to ''Sasuke'', nine easily cleared the First Stage. The only exception was Dreschel, who injured his knee landing on the Halfpipe Attack, and despite a valiant attempt at the Warped Wall, was unable to put any weight on his leg and stated on his Facebook that he will not be available for ''Sasuke'' 28. The high hopes of the remaining nine took a major hit in the Second Stage, as five more were eliminated including Rodriguez on the Slider Drop, Smith on the Double Salmon Ladder, and newcomer Travis Rosen and veterans Travis Furlanic and Brent Steffensen on the Metal Spin. The remaining four competitors made it to the Third Stage only to be outdone by the Ultimate Cliffhanger. Ryan Stratis failed to make the fourth ledge while James McGrath and fan favorite Paul Kasemir failed the transition to the fifth ledge. The last competitor, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]] almost made it through the entire obstacle but on the final ledge his grip gave out. Even though no one earned a $500,000 [[K-Swiss]] Endorsement Deal, the competitors at ''Sasuke'' 27 were by far the strongest group of Americans to date. The final episode of the third season aired on NBC on August 29, 2011 as a two-hour special in prime-time.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 4)|fourth season]] of the program began airing on May 20, 2012 and the show aired on both G4 and NBC for the Regionals and the Championship with the grand prize of $500,000 and the coveted ''American Ninja Warrior'' title. The entire format was changed as well&nbsp;\u2013 regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired and the Mt. Midoriyama course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple Steps and the Warped Wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midoriyama.\n\nThe show returned for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 5)|fifth season]] on July 1, 2013 in the same format. This season, if a contestant were to finish the course, that player would be guaranteed a spot in the next round. The show returned once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 6)|sixth season]] on May 25, 2014 on both NBC and [[Esquire Network]] with the same rules as in previous seasons. NBC has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 7)|seventh season]] in 2015 with the grand prize now doubled to $1,000,000. So far, it has produced, among other things, the endorsement of Makoto Nagano, the first American to complete the Ultimate Cliffhanger (Brent Steffensen in 2012), the first woman to complete the Salmon Ladder (Kacy Catanzaro in 2014), the first woman to complete the Jumping Spider (Meagan Martin, also in 2014), the first two Americans to achieve Total Victory (Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten on the same night in 2015) and the first female to complete Stage 1 of Mt. Midoriyama in Las Vegas (Jessie Graff in 2016, who also became the first female to complete Stage 2 of the original Mt. Midoriyama in 2017 during ''Sasuke'' 34.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sirsvk1OSg Jessie Graff \u2013 ''Sasuke'' 34 Stage 2] YouTube</ref>) The network has renewed the show once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 8)|eighth season]] in 2016 with new qualifying cities including [[Los Angeles]] and [[Oklahoma City]]. The network has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 9)|ninth season]] in 2017 with three new cities: [[San Antonio]], [[Daytona Beach]], and [[Cleveland]]. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 10)|tenth season]] of the show began airing on May 30, 2018 with returning cities and a $10,000 bonus for finishing the Mega Warped Wall. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 11)|eleventh season]] began airing on May 29, 2019 with two new cities ([[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Cincinnati]]), a chance to go directly to Las Vegas with the Speed Pass in the Power Tower duel between the two fastest players, and a new co-host, [[Zuri Hall]]. In addition, Drew Drechsel became the third person to achieve Total Victory at the end of the season.\n\n=====''USA vs Japan''=====\n{{hatnote|Full details in the [[American Ninja Warrior#USA vs Japan|American Ninja Warrior]] article}}\n\nIn 2014, the first ''Sasuke''-based team competition was started, pitting five ''Sasuke'' All-Stars and New Stars representing Japan against five ''American Ninja Warrior'' stars representing the United States in what was dubbed by some as the inaugural ''Sasuke''/''Ninja Warrior'' world championship. The first meeting took place at the Mt. Midoriyama reconstruction in Las Vegas and was first broadcast in America on January 13, 2014 on NBC, with a second meeting already scheduled for the original Mt. Midoriyama in [[Aoba-ku, Yokohama|Aoba-ku]] in 2015.\n\nAt the first match in Las Vegas, Team Japan was composed of Shingo Yamamoto, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, Hitoshi Kanno and Kazuma Asa from ''Sasuke'', while Team USA was composed of Brent Steffensen, Paul Kasemir, James McGrath, Travis Rosen and Brian Arnold from ''American Ninja Warrior''. The match was composed of four rounds&nbsp;\u2013 one on each stage, with each round being a best-of-five of one-on-one races and each competitor running once per stage until the stage outcome was decided. Stage 1 was worth one point, Stage 2 worth two points and Stage 3 worth three, with the tiebreaker being the Final Stage tower. Despite the Japanese boasting superior experience and pedigrees (no Team USA member had completed Stage 3, either in Yokohama or Las Vegas), the Americans pulled off a stunning 6\u20130 win that included only one Japanese one-on-one race win (Matachi against Arnold on Stage 3.)\n\n=====''American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja''=====\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja}}\n\nWith the success of ''American Ninja Warrior'', Esquire Network announced a spin-off to the series called ''Team Ninja Warrior'' on October 9, 2015.

In the fourth UK series, aired in 2011, Jim North took over as the voice-over.
