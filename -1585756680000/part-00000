Vernadsky University|Tavrida University]], which was founded on 10 May 1918. R. I. Gelvig was the first rector of the University and the dean of medical faculty at the same time. The first graduation of doctors had taken place in 1922; totally 523 doctors have been graduated during the faculty's existence. In 1925 the University was reorganized as a Pedagogian Institute and the Medical faculty was liquidated.\n\nDue to development of Crimea as a health resort, it was decided in 1930 to organize higher medical school here. The solemn opening of the Crimean Medical Institute (which consisted of one Treatment-and-prophylactic faculty only) has taken place on 1 April 1931. The first graduation (97 students) occurred on 17 February 1936. The second faculty, that is Pediatric, was organized in 1938. In 1939 the Treatment-and-prophylactic faculty was renamed into the Medical one.\n\nIn the time of the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]], the University continued working in evacuation (at first in [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], then in [[Jambul]], [[Vladikavkaz|Orjonikidze]], [[Baku]], [[Krasnovodsk]], [[Kyzylorda]]). In sum, since June 1941 till July 1944 the Institute prepared 850 doctors. In the spring of 1944 the institute returned to Simferopol.\n\nIn 1951 S. I. Georgievsky was appointed a director (subsequently a rector) of the institute (the university carries his name now). In the fifties the material base of the Institute was considerably expanded. Since 1961 the Institute begins preparation of medical shots for the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. In 1970 new rector, professor V. I. Zyablov was appointed. In 1978 a new faculty (Stomatologic) was opened. In 1979 the faculty of Postgraduating Studies was launched. In 1981 the Institute was decorated with [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]]. In the late eighties the Crimean medical institute was included into 3 top medical high schools of the ussr.<ref>[http://www-ki.rada.crimea.ua/nomera/2006/192/vuz.html The article in the newspaper \"Crimean News\", dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the CSMU] (in Russian)</ref> In 1989 professor I.

For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called \"gender medicine\", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for >60% of the individuals studied.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847\u2013851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley|url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/69202/3/69202.pdf}}</ref> The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients.

These can be of several types, including direct and indirect, direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome (due to the [[SRY gene]]), and indirect being characteristics influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression, although the deviations in more complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. {{synthesis inline span|For example, most [[males]] are taller than most [[females]],<ref name=\"Gustafsson\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253\u2013266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}</ref> but an individual female could be Shorter than an individual male.

This research employs experimental tests of [[cognition]], which take a variety of forms. Tests focus on possible differences in areas such as [[IQ]], spatial reasoning, [[aggression]], [[emotion]], and brain structure and function.\n\nChromosomal makeup is important in human psychology.

The research focused on cognitive variables (for example, reading comprehension, mathematics), communication (for example, talkativeness, facial expressions), social and personality (for example, aggression, sexuality), psychological well-being, and motor behaviors. Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% of gender differences were small or close to zero. A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences.

An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated.

For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called \"gender medicine\", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for >60% of the individuals studied.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847\u2013851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley|url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/69202/3/69202.pdf}}</ref> The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients.

These can be of several types, including direct and indirect, direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome (due to the [[SRY gene]]), and indirect being characteristics influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression, although the deviations in more complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. {{synthesis inline span|For example, most [[males]] are taller than most [[females]],<ref name=\"Gustafsson\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253\u2013266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}</ref> but an individual female could be taller than an individual male.

Some differing explanations include men's [[evolutionary]] tendency toward risk and violent behavior, sex differences in activity, [[social support]], and [[gender inequality]].\n\nDespite the difficulty of interpreting them, [[crime statistics]] may provide a way to investigate such a relationship from a gender differences perspective. An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated. Moreover, some studies show that men can have an overwhelming bias against reporting themselves to be the victims of a crime (particularly when victimized by a woman), and some studies have argued that men reporting [[intimate partner violence]] find disadvantageous biases in law enforcement.<ref>\"[M]en who are involved in disputes with their partners, whether as alleged victims or as alleged offenders or both, are disadvantaged and treated less favorably than women by the law-enforcement system at almost every step.\" Brown, G.
