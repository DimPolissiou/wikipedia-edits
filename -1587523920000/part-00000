St. David CSS is located in [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Ontario]] and is a member of the [[Waterloo Catholic District School Board]]. Its building is the oldest secondary school building in the board.  Historically it was a junior high school, instructing students from grades 7 to 10. St. David received full funding from the Ontario [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ministry of Education]] in 1985, when the school changed its educational focus to students in grades 9 to [[Ontario Academic Credit|OAC]]. Since the OAC year of secondary school was phased out of Ontario schools in the 2002-2003 school year, St. David CSS now teaches grades 9 through to 12. At present (2011) St. David educates 1045 students. St. David is named after [[St David]], a 6th-century saint.\nSince 2003, St.David has seen continued expansion, including: a Hospitality and Foods professional kitchen, the addition of four new classrooms, renovated Science classrooms, a Hairstyling and Aesthetics lab, upgrades to the triple gymnasium, and the addition of a world-class track & field facility complete with an artificial turf field.\n\n== Staff and administration ==\nAs of March 2016, St. David's principal is John Dietrich, with Daniel Hutter and Jacqueline Wettlaufer as [[Vice principal|vice-principals]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wcdsb.ca/schools/schools_sda.html |title=Our Schools - St. David Catholic Secondary |work=wcdsb.ca|author= Waterloo Catholic District School Board|year=2011 |accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs of April 2020, St. David's principal is Glenda Leusink, with Michael Ambeau and Kevin Hinsperger as [[Vice principal|vice-principals]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wcdsb.ca/schools/schools_sda.html |title=Our Schools - St. David Catholic Secondary |work=wcdsb.ca|author= Waterloo Catholic District School Board|year=2011 |accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe school also has approximately 84 full-time teaching staff.\n\n== Uniform policy (2001 - 2002) ==\nAs with the other secondary schools in the Waterloo Catholic District School Board, St. David requires all students to wear a [[uniform]] every day, except for the occasional dress-down day (known to staff and students as \"Civies Day\"). During the 2001 - 2002 school year, this policy required all students to have [[Tennis shirt|golf]] and [[dress shirt]]s tucked into their pants at all times, on the basis that untucked shirts did not convey the proper sense of respect for the school.<ref>http://www.wcdsb.edu.on.ca/ap_memos/PDF/APC005.pdf</ref>\n\nDuring the last two weeks of June 2002, the administration of St. David made a public announcement that any student in violation of the uniform rules would be [[Suspension (school punishment)|suspended]] for one day. In Ontario, any disciplinary action of this type is listed on an [[student record|Ontario student record]], which may adversely affect a student's chances of acceptance to [[post-secondary education]]. Ontario student records also are investigated by teachers when reviewing students enrolled for classes, and by staff at other schools in the event a student applies for a transfer.\n\nNo prior violations of the rules were taken into account with this policy. Suspension, as a punishment, is typically given for much more serious academic and criminal offences. However, the provincial [[Safe Schools Act]] allows discretionary one-day suspensions for minor infractions of school policies and procedures.

St. David CSS is located in [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Ontario]] and is a member of the [[Waterloo Catholic District School Board]]. Its building is the oldest secondary school building in the board.  Historically it was a junior high school, instructing students from grades 7 to 10. St. David received full funding from the Ontario [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ministry of Education]] in 1985, when the school changed its educational focus to students in grades 9 to [[Ontario Academic Credit|OAC]]. Since the OAC year of secondary school was phased out of Ontario schools in the 2002-2003 school year, St. David CSS now teaches grades 9 through to 12. At present (2011) St. David educates 1045 students. St. David is named after [[St David]], a 6th-century saint.\n\n== Staff and administration ==\nAs of March 2016, St. David's principal is John Dietrich, with Daniel Hutter and Jacqueline Wettlaufer as [[Vice principal|vice-principals]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wcdsb.ca/schools/schools_sda.html |title=Our Schools - St. David Catholic Secondary |work=wcdsb.ca|author= Waterloo Catholic District School Board|year=2011 |accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe school also has approximately 84 full-time teaching staff.\n\n== Uniform policy (2001 - 2002) ==\nAs with the other secondary schools in the Waterloo Catholic District School Board, St. David requires all students to wear a [[uniform]] every day, except for the occasional dress-down day (known to staff and students as \"Civies Day\"). During the 2001 - 2002 school year, this policy required all students to have [[Tennis shirt|golf]] and [[dress shirt]]s tucked into their pants at all times, on the basis that untucked shirts did not convey the proper sense of respect for the school.<ref>http://www.wcdsb.edu.on.ca/ap_memos/PDF/APC005.pdf</ref>\n\nDuring the last two weeks of June 2002, the administration of St. David made a public announcement that any student in violation of the uniform rules would be [[Suspension (school punishment)|suspended]] for one day. In Ontario, any disciplinary action of this type is listed on an [[student record|Ontario student record]], which may adversely affect a student's chances of acceptance to [[post-secondary education]]. Ontario student records also are investigated by teachers when reviewing students enrolled for classes, and by staff at other schools in the event a student applies for a transfer.\n\nNo prior violations of the rules were taken into account with this policy. Suspension, as a punishment, is typically given for much more serious academic and criminal offences. However, the provincial [[Safe Schools Act]] allows discretionary one-day suspensions for minor infractions of school policies and procedures. These suspensions cannot be formally challenged, as the Safe Schools Act does not allow for appeals of one day suspensions.<ref>http://www.wcdsb.edu.on.ca/ap_memos/PDF/APC012.pdf</ref> Nevertheless, the consequence would add to a student's record, causing any subsequent offenses within five years to be judged more harshly.<ref>http://www.wcdsb.edu.on.ca/info/safe/disciplinary_actions.html</ref>\n\nThe \"tucked-in shirt\" rule, though, was short-lived as at the beginning of the 2002 - 2003 school year, the policy was revised to eliminate the requirement of golf shirts being tucked in.\n\n[[File:St David HS Waterloo.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Luca Congi]], kicker/punter for the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]].

In 1930 he wrote two summary books that helped define color theory.<ref name=ency2/>\n\n===Memory===\nM\u00fcller's studies were most prominent in memory. He studied indistinct and distinct images effect on memory. He theorized that thinking of indistinct images made memorization and learning more effective. He agreed with the [[University of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg school]] on indistinct images but felt to be better understood, a study of distinct images was needed.<ref name=learning/> M\u00fcller did memory research with Gottfried R\u00fcckle, a doctorate of mathematics student at G\u00f6ttingen, who was described as a memory prodigy.<ref name=ency2/> His research with R\u00fcckle was on his extraordinary memory through the presentation of experimental results on the role of grouping in learning.<ref name=learning/>\n\nM\u00fcller and his student Alfons Pilzecker are credited with the term \"consolidirung\" (consolidation).<ref name=learning/> This terms means that learning doesn't automatically create permanent, consolidated memories, they take time to be permanently learned or consolidated.

M\u00fcller and Pilzecker quantified the amount of learning by measuring the percentage correct.<ref name=learning/> Some of the participants in their experiment said that occasionally the nonsense syllables would come to mind between training sessions even when they were trying to suppress it, they called this [[perseveration]].<ref name=learning/>\n\n====Retroactive interference====\nM\u00fcller formulated and tested the theory of retroactive interference. Retroactive Interference is when unrelated material makes it difficult to learn new material. M\u00fcller and his student Pilzecker studied this by presenting participants with a list of syllables for 6 minutes and then presented three landscape paintings and the participants were asked to describe them. Then the participants were tested on how much they remembered from the list. The control list was presented with no distractions from the landscape paintings and ability to remember what was on the control list was higher than the list paired with the paintings. This supported retroactive interference, the information from the paintings made it more difficult to remember the syllables from the first list.<ref name=learning/>\n\n==Works==\n* ''Zur Theorie der sinnlichen Aufmerksamkeit'' (\"On the theory of sensory awareness,\" 1873)\n* ''Zur Grundlegung der Psychophysik'' (\"On foundations for psychophysics,\" 1878)\n* ''Zur Theorie der Muskelcontraction'' (\"On the theory of muscle contractions,\" 1891)\n* ''Zur Analyse der Unterschiedsempfindlichkeit'', with L.

But, as foreign companies, like Germany's [[Bertelsmann Music Group]], or BMG\u2014the major label parenting, for instance, [[Arista Records]], offering distribution to [[Bad Boy Entertainment]]\u2014were delivering even more gangsta rap, Time Warner alleged itself targeted by political opportunists.

Harris notes that [[Tha Dogg Pound]] saw its October 1995 or debut album, ''[[Dogg Food]]'', \"delayed, as sharesholders of their parent record company, Interscope/Time Warner, had decided that they would protest the lyrical content of the album\". Harris claims that, \"coupled with the shareholder's protest, Suge Knight's incarceration, Snoop Dogg's exit, and Tupac Shakur's death ended the label's hold on the hip-hop scene\". As Harris concedes, \"the album did enjoy high sales\". But in Harris's estimation, \"this was the last high-selling album released on Death Row in the 1990s\". On the contrary, Death Row's last such album, released months later, February 1996, was 2Pac's juggernaut ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. Merely, by two years later, [[Daz Dillinger|Daz]], or half of Tha Dogg Pound, was the last high-selling artist still with Death Row [Strauss, ''NYT'', 1998].
