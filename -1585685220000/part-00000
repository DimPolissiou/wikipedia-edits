Most cases are mild, but rarely the condition is severe and can lead to serious illness or death.<ref name=JOGC>{{cite journal |first1=Doron |last1=Shmorgun |first2=Paul |last2=Claman |title=The diagnosis and management of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome |journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1156\u201362 |year=2011 |pmid=22082791 |url=http://jogc.ca/abstracts/full/201111_SOGCClinicalPracticeGuidelines_1.pdf |doi=10.1016/s1701-2163(16)35085-x}}</ref>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSymptoms are set into 3 categories: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild symptoms include abdominal bloating and feeling of fullness, nausea, diarrhea, and slight weight gain. Moderate symptoms include excessive weight gain (weight gain of greater than 2 pounds per day), increased abdominal girth, vomiting, diarrhea, darker urine, decreased urine output, excessive thirst, and skin and/or hair feeling dry (in addition to mild symptoms). Severe symptoms are fullness/bloating above the waist, shortness of breath, pleural effusion, urination significantly darker or has ceased, calf and chest pains, marked abdominal bloating or distention, and lower abdominal pains (in addition to mild and moderate symptoms).\n\n===Complications===\nOHSS may be complicated by [[ovarian torsion]], [[ovarian rupture]], venous thromboembolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, electrolytes imbalance, [[thrombophlebitis]] and [[chronic kidney disease]]. Symptoms generally resolve in 1 to 2 weeks, but will be more severe and persist longer if pregnancy occurs.  This is due to [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) from the pregnancy acting on the [[corpus luteum]] in the ovaries in sustaining the pregnancy before the [[placenta]] has fully developed. Typically, even in severe OHSS with a developing pregnancy, the duration does not exceed the first trimester.\n\n==Cause==\nSporadic OHSS is very rare, and may have a genetic component. [[Clomifene|Clomifene citrate]] therapy can occasionally lead to OHSS, but the vast majority of cases develop after use of [[gonadotropin]] therapy (with administration of [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]]), such as [[Pergonal]], and administration of [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] to [[Ovulation induction#final maturation|induce final oocyte maturation]] and/or trigger [[oocyte release]], often in conjunction with [[in vitro fertilisation|IVF]]. The frequency varies and depends on a woman's risk factors, management, and methods of surveillance. About 5% of treated women may encounter moderate to severe OHSS.  Risk factors include polycystic ovary syndrome, young age, low BMI, high antral follicle count, the development of many ovarian follicles under stimulation, extreme elevated serum estradiol concentrations, the use of hCG for final oocyte maturation and/or release, the continued use of hCG for luteal support, and the occurrence of a pregnancy (resulting in hCG production).\n\nMortality is low, but several fatal cases have been reported.\n\n===Medications===\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome is particularly associated with injection of a hormone called [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) which is used for [[Ovulation induction#final maturation|inducing final oocyte maturation]] and/or [[triggering oocyte release]]. The risk is further increased by multiple doses of hCG after ovulation and if the procedure results in pregnancy.<ref name=medlineplus>[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007294.htm Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome] Updated by: Linda J. Vorvick and Susan Storck Update. Also reviewed by David Zieve. Date: 7/27/2009</ref>\n\nUsing a [[GnRH agonist]] instead of hCG for inducing final oocyte maturation and/or release results in an elimination of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but a slight decrease of the delivery rate of approximately 6%.<ref name=Humaidan2011>{{cite journal |last1=Humaidan |first1=P. |last2=Kol |first2=S. |last3=Papanikolaou |first3=E. |title=GnRH agonist for triggering of final oocyte maturation: time for a change of practice? |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=510\u201324 |year=2011 |pmid=21450755 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmr008 }}</ref>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nOHSS has been characterized by the presence of multiple luteinized cysts within the [[ovaries]] leading to ovarian enlargement and secondary complications, but that definition includes almost all women undergoing ovarian stimulation. The central feature of clinically significant OHSS is the development of vascular hyperpermeability and the resulting shift of fluids into the third space.\n\nAs hCG causes the ovary to undergo extensive luteinization, large amounts of [[estrogens]], [[progesterone]], and local [[cytokines]] are released. It is almost certain that [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) is a key substance that induces vascular hyperpermeability, making local [[capillaries]] \"leaky\", leading to a shift of fluids from the intravascular system to the abdominal and pleural cavity.  Supraphysiologic production of VEGF from many follicles under the prolonged effect of hCG appears to be the specific key process underlying OHSS. Thus, while the woman accumulates fluid in the third space, primarily in the form of [[ascites]], she actually becomes [[hypovolemic]] and is at risk for respiratory, circulatory (such as arterial thromboembolism since blood is now thicker), and renal problems. Women who are pregnant sustain the ovarian luteinization process through the production of hCG.\n\nAvoiding OHSS typically requires interrupting the pathological sequence, such as avoiding the use of hCG.  One alternative is to use a GnRH agonist instead of hCG.  While this has been repeatedly shown to \"virtually eliminate\" OHSS risk, there is some controversy regarding the effect on pregnancy rates if a fresh non-donor embryo transfer is attempted, almost certainly due to a luteal phase defect.  There is no dispute that the GnRH agonist trigger is effective for oocyte donors and for embryo banking (cryopreservation) cycles.\n\n==Classification==\nOHSS is divided into the categories mild, moderate, severe, and critical.<ref name=JOGC/>\nIn mild forms of OHSS the ovaries are enlarged (5\u201312&nbsp;cm)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Textbook of Assisted Reproductive Techniques, Laboratory and Clinical Perspectives, edited by David K.

Early OHSS develops before [[pregnancy]] testing and late OHSS is seen in early pregnancy.\n\nCriteria for severe OHSS include enlarged ovary, ascites, hematocrit > 45%, WBC > 15,000, oliguria, creatinine 1.0-1.5&nbsp;mg/dl, creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min, liver dysfunction, and anasarca.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Critical OHSS includes enlarged ovary, tense ascites with hydrothorax and pericardial effusion, hematocrit > 55%, WBC > 25,000, oligoanuria, creatinine > 1.6&nbsp;mg/dl, creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, [[kidney failure]], thromboembolic phenomena, and [[ARDS]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n| \n[[File:Vaginal ultrasonography in OHSS - sagittal.png|thumb|left|240px]]\n[[File:Vaginal ultrasonography in mild ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome - sagittal.jpg|thumb|right|430px]]\n[[Vaginal ultrasonography]] in the [[sagittal plane]] in a woman with mild OHSS, showing a 33&nbsp;mm wide [[anechogenic]] area behind the uterus in the [[recto-uterine pouch]], which means there was [[ascites]], that is, free fluid in the [[peritoneal cavity]].

Conception can cause mild OHSS to worsen in severity.\n\nModerate OHSS is treated with bed rest, fluids, and close monitoring of labs such as electrolytes and blood counts. Ultrasound may be used to monitor the size of ovarian follicles. Depending on the situation, a physician may closely monitor a women's fluid intake and output on an outpatient basis, looking for increased discrepancy in fluid balance (over 1 liter discrepancy is cause for concern). Resolution of the syndrome is measured by decreasing size of the follicular cysts on 2 consecutive ultrasounds.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1343572|Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome|treatment}}</ref>\n\nAspiration of accumulated fluid (ascites) from the abdominal/pleural cavity may be necessary, as well as opioids for the pain. If the OHSS develops within an IVF protocol, it can be prudent to postpone transfer of the pre-embryos since establishment of pregnancy can lengthen the recovery time or contribute to a more severe course. Over time, if carefully monitored, the condition will naturally reverse to normal&nbsp;\u2013 so treatment is typically supportive, although a woman may need to be treated or hospitalized for pain, paracentesis, and/or intravenous hydration.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Delvigne A, Rozenberg S | title = Epidemiology and prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS): a review | journal = Hum Reprod Update | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 559\u201377 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12498425 | url=http://humupd.oupjournals.org/cgi/reprint/8/6/559 | format=PDF | doi = 10.1093/humupd/8.6.559}}\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Delvigne A, Rozenberg S | title = Review of clinical course and treatment of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) | journal = Hum Reprod Update | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 77\u201396 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12638783 | url=http://humupd.oupjournals.org/cgi/reprint/9/1/77 | format=PDF | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmg005}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 32038\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|N|98|1|n|80}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|xxx}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = 608115\n| MedlinePlus     = 007294\n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = \n| SNOMED CT       = 129635004\n| Orphanet        = 64739\n}}\n{{Diseases of the pelvis, genitals and breasts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome}}\n[[Category:Fertility medicine]]\n[[Category:Noninflammatory disorders of female genital tract]]\n[[Category:Syndromes in females]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome\n| synonyms        = \n| image           = \n| caption         = \n| pronounce       = \n| field           = [[Gynecology]]\n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome''' ('''OHSS''') is a medical condition that can occur in some women who take [[fertility medication]] to stimulate egg growth, and in other women in very rare cases.

Date: 7/27/2009</ref>\n\nUsing a [[GnRH agonist]] instead of hCG for inducing final oocyte maturation and/or release results in an elimination of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but a slight decrease of the delivery rate of approximately 6%.<ref name=Humaidan2011>{{cite journal |last1=Humaidan |first1=P. |last2=Kol |first2=S. |last3=Papanikolaou |first3=E. |title=GnRH agonist for triggering of final oocyte maturation: time for a change of practice? |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=510\u201324 |year=2011 |pmid=21450755 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmr008 }}</ref>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nOHSS has been characterized by the presence of multiple luteinized cysts within the [[ovaries]] leading to ovarian enlargement and secondary complications, but that definition includes almost all women undergoing ovarian stimulation. The central feature of clinically significant OHSS is the development of vascular hyperpermeability and the resulting shift of fluids into the third space.\n\nAs hCG causes the ovary to undergo extensive luteinization, large amounts of [[estrogens]], [[progesterone]], and local [[cytokines]] are released. It is almost certain that [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) is a key substance that induces vascular hyperpermeability, making local [[capillaries]] \"leaky\", leading to a shift of fluids from the intravascular system to the abdominal and pleural cavity.  Supraphysiologic production of VEGF from many follicles under the prolonged effect of hCG appears to be the specific key process underlying OHSS. Thus, while the woman accumulates fluid in the third space, primarily in the form of [[ascites]], she actually becomes [[hypovolemic]] and is at risk for respiratory, circulatory (such as arterial thromboembolism since blood is now thicker), and renal problems. Women who are pregnant sustain the ovarian luteinization process through the production of hCG.\n\nAvoiding OHSS typically requires interrupting the pathological sequence, such as avoiding the use of hCG.  One alternative is to use a GnRH agonist instead of hCG.  While this has been repeatedly shown to \"virtually eliminate\" OHSS risk, there is some controversy regarding the effect on pregnancy rates if a fresh non-donor embryo transfer is attempted, almost certainly due to a luteal phase defect.  There is no dispute that the GnRH agonist trigger is effective for oocyte donors and for embryo banking (cryopreservation) cycles.\n\n==Classification==\nOHSS is divided into the categories mild, moderate, severe, and critical.<ref name=JOGC/>\nIn mild forms of OHSS the ovaries are enlarged (5\u201312&nbsp;cm)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Textbook of Assisted Reproductive Techniques, Laboratory and Clinical Perspectives, edited by David K.

Early OHSS develops before [[pregnancy]] testing and late OHSS is seen in early pregnancy.\n\nCriteria for severe OHSS include enlarged ovary, ascites, hematocrit > 45%, WBC > 15,000, oliguria, creatinine 1.0-1.5&nbsp;mg/dl, creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min, liver dysfunction, and anasarca.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Critical OHSS includes enlarged ovary, tense ascites with hydrothorax and pericardial effusion, hematocrit > 55%, WBC > 25,000, oligoanuria, creatinine > 1.6&nbsp;mg/dl, creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, [[kidney failure]], thromboembolic phenomena, and [[ARDS]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n| \n[[File:Vaginal ultrasonography in OHSS - sagittal.png|thumb|left|240px]]\n[[File:Vaginal ultrasonography in mild ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome - sagittal.jpg|thumb|right|430px]]\n[[Vaginal ultrasonography]] in the [[sagittal plane]] in a woman with mild OHSS, showing a 33&nbsp;mm wide [[anechogenic]] area behind the uterus in the [[recto-uterine pouch]], which means there was [[ascites]], that is, free fluid in the [[peritoneal cavity]].

Conception can cause mild OHSS to worsen in severity.\n\nModerate OHSS is treated with bed rest, fluids, and close monitoring of labs such as electrolytes and blood counts. Ultrasound may be used to monitor the size of ovarian follicles. Depending on the situation, a physician may closely monitor a women's fluid intake and output on an outpatient basis, looking for increased discrepancy in fluid balance (over 1 liter discrepancy is cause for concern). Resolution of the syndrome is measured by decreasing size of the follicular cysts on 2 consecutive ultrasounds.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1343572|Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome|treatment}}</ref>\n\nAspiration of accumulated fluid (ascites) from the abdominal/pleural cavity may be necessary, as well as opioids for the pain. If the OHSS develops within an IVF protocol, it can be prudent to postpone transfer of the pre-embryos since establishment of pregnancy can lengthen the recovery time or contribute to a more severe course. Over time, if carefully monitored, the condition will naturally reverse to normal&nbsp;\u2013 so treatment is typically supportive, although a woman may need to be treated or hospitalized for pain, paracentesis, and/or intravenous hydration.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Delvigne A, Rozenberg S | title = Epidemiology and prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS): a review | journal = Hum Reprod Update | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 559\u201377 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12498425 | url=http://humupd.oupjournals.org/cgi/reprint/8/6/559 | format=PDF | doi = 10.1093/humupd/8.6.559}}\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Delvigne A, Rozenberg S | title = Review of clinical course and treatment of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) | journal = Hum Reprod Update | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 77\u201396 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12638783 | url=http://humupd.oupjournals.org/cgi/reprint/9/1/77 | format=PDF | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmg005}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 32038 \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|N|98|1|n|80}} \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|xxx}} \n|  ICDO           =  \n|  OMIM           =  \n|  MedlinePlus    = 007294 \n|  eMedicineSubj  =  \n|  eMedicineTopic =  \n|  MeshID         = \n}}\n{{Diseases of the pelvis, genitals and breasts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome}}\n[[Category:Fertility medicine]]\n[[Category:Noninflammatory disorders of female genital tract]]\n[[Category:Syndromes in females]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation_syndrome"}

As available evidence for all comparisons are very low in certainty, any results interpreted should accommodate for this factor too.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bulsara VM, Worthington HV, Glenny AM, Clarkson JE, Conway DI, Macluskey M | title = Interventions for the treatment of oral and oropharyngeal cancers: surgical treatment | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD006205 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30582609 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006205.pub4 | editor-last = Cochrane Oral Health Group }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Head and neck cancer]]\n*[[Cancer of the larynx]]\n*[[Thyroid cancer]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|C01}}, {{ICD10|C02.4}}, {{ICD10|C05.1}}, {{ICD10|C09}}, {{ICD10|C10}}\n| ICD9            = \n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = \n| DiseasesDB      = \n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = \n| GeneReviewsNBK  = \n| GeneReviewsName = \n| NORD            = \n| GARDNum         = \n| GARDName        = \n| Orphanet        = \n| AO              = \n| RP              = \n| WO              = \n| NCI             =\n}}\n\n{{Tumors of lip, oral cavity and pharynx}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oral And Maxillofacial Surgery}}\n[[Category:Otorhinolaryngology]]\n[[Category:Head and neck cancer]]\n", "name_user": "Boghog", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oropharyngeal_cancer"}
