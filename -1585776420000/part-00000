Hill]] bought the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] in 1879 and accepted the task of completing the line from [[Crookston, Minnesota|Crookston]] to the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]], a French-Canadian man founded a town named Louisa, after the French king, in the path of the railroad. However, Hill's company located the new railroad town just south of the Louisa property line and named it Argyle. The early settlement included many French-Canadians. Other settlers included immigrants from England, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Scotland, and Germany. The early townspeople and businessmen were always anxious to make Argyle an attractive community to the region. Today the community still boasts of several businesses, which draw customers from the regional area. Because of threats of flooding, a dike was built on the Middle River which is a branch of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] in 1988.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.00|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref> The city is conveniently located 40 miles from both [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]] and [[Thief River Falls, Minnesota]]. Argyle is also located 130 miles from [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] and 360 miles from [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. The relatively flat area around Argyle is good for farming.\n\n===Climate===\nDue to its location in the [[Great Plains]] and its distance from both mountains and oceans, the city has an extreme continental climate. This type of climate is distinguished by four very distinct seasons and great variation in temperatures over very short periods of time. As there are no nearby mountain ranges or bodies of water to ameliorate the climatic conditions, Argyle lies exposed to numerous weather systems including bitterly cold Arctic high pressure systems. The city is known for its long, cold, and snowy winters. In sharp contrast, summers are warm to hot and often quite humid with frequent thunderstorms.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 306\n|1900= 829\n|1910= 744\n|1920= 956\n|1930= 700\n|1940= 857\n|1950= 846\n|1960= 789\n|1970= 739\n|1980= 741\n|1990= 636\n|2000= 656\n|2010= 639\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=646\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|author=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 9, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> of 2010, there were 639 people, 261 households, and 175 families residing in the city.

The first school was started in May 1880. The first teacher was Miss Mary Dion and there were 18 people in that school. The new brick school was built and opened in 1905. Elementary wing and library was added in 1969. In 1974 a special election was held to get bonds for the construction and equipment for a new physical education facility.\n\nThe schools in Argyle and nearby [[Stephen, Minnesota|Stephen]] began to share faculty in the early 1980s. The positions of Counselor, Learning Disabled Instructor and Speech were the first positions to be shared. Many more positions were shared. In the 1989\u201390 school year the school boards of both districts began meeting. Two public meetings in both communities were held in 1990 to begin the discussion of sharing the school districts. Ever since the meeting on January 30, 1996, the Stephen Tiger and the Argyle Eagle became united as one creating the Stephen/Argyle Central STORM. Stephen/Argyle is widely known for its high school football program, which won its first state championship in 1999 then 5 State Championships in a row from years 2003-2007 and again in 2009.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ci.argyle.mn.us/ Argyle official website]\n\n{{Marshall County, Minnesota}}\n\n{{coord|48|19|58|N|96|49|15|W|type:city_region:US-MN|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Cities in Marshall County, Minnesota]]\n[[Category:French-Canadian American history]]\n[[Category:French-Canadian culture in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1879]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|City in Minnesota, United States}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name            = Argyle\n|settlement_type          = [[City]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    = Small town living with big city access.\n|image_skyline            = \n|imagesize                = \n|image_caption            = \n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               = \n|image_map                = Marshall_County_Minnesota_Incorporated_and_Unincorporated_areas_Argyle_Highlighted.svg\n|mapsize                  = 250px\n|map_caption              = Location in [[Minnesota]]\n|image_map1               = \n|mapsize1                 = \n|map_caption1             = \n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in Minnesota|County]]\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_name1        = [[Minnesota]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Marshall County, Minnesota|Marshall]]\n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = [[Mayor]]\n|leader_name              = Robert Clausen\n|established_title2       = Incorporated\n|established_date         = \n|established_date2        = 1883\n|area_magnitude           = \n|area_total_sq_mi         = 1.51\n|area_footnotes           = <ref name=\"CenPopGazetteer2016\">{{cite web|title=2017 U.S. Gazetteer Files|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2017_Gazetteer/2017_gaz_place_27.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=Jan 2, 2019}}</ref>\n|area_total_km2           = 3.91\n|area_land_sq_mi          = 1.51\n|area_land_km2            = 3.91\n|area_water_sq_mi         = 0.00\n|area_water_km2           = 0.00\n|area_urban_sq_mi         = \n|area_urban_km2           = \n|area_metro_sq_mi         = \n|area_metro_km2           = \n|population_as_of         = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n|population_est           = 646\n|pop_est_as_of            = 2018\n|population_footnotes     = <ref name =\"FactFinder\"/>\n|population_total         = 639\n|population_metro         = \n|population_urban         = \n|population_density_km2   = 164.34\n|population_density_sq_mi = 425.73\n|population_blank1_title  = \n|population_blank1        = \n|timezone                 = [[Central Time Zone|CST]]\n|utc_offset               = -6\n|timezone_DST             = [[North American Central Time Zone|CDT]]\n|utc_offset_DST           = -5\n|coordinates              = {{coord|48|19|58|N|96|49|15|W|region:US-MN|display=inline}}\n|elevation_m              = 258\n|elevation_ft             = 846\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]\n|postal_code              = 56713\n|area_code                = [[Area code 218|218]]\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = 27-02134\n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = 0639435<ref name=\"GR3\">{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=US Board on Geographic Names|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2007-10-25}}</ref>\n|website                  = http://www.ci.argyle.mn.us/\n|footnotes                = \n|pop_est_footnotes = <ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n|unit_pref = Imperial\n}}\n\n'''Argyle''' is a city in [[Marshall County, Minnesota|Marshall County]], [[Minnesota]], United States, along the [[Middle River (Minnesota)|Middle River]].

In sharp contrast, summers are warm to hot and often quite humid with frequent thunderstorms.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 306\n|1900= 829\n|1910= 744\n|1920= 956\n|1930= 700\n|1940= 857\n|1950= 846\n|1960= 789\n|1970= 739\n|1980= 741\n|1990= 636\n|2000= 656\n|2010= 639\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=646\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|author=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 9, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> of 2010, there were 639 people, 261 households, and 175 families residing in the city.

The first school was started in May 1880. The first teacher was Miss Mary Dion and there were 18 people in that school. The new brick school was built and opened in 1905. Elementary wing and library was added in 1969. In 1974 a special election was held to get bonds for the construction and equipment for a new physical education facility.\n\nThe schools in Argyle and nearby [[Stephen, Minnesota|Stephen]] began to share faculty in the early 1980s. The positions of Counselor, Learning Disabled Instructor and Speech were the first positions to be shared. Many more positions were shared. In the 1989-90 school year the school boards of both districts began meeting. Two public meetings in both communities were held in 1990 to begin the discussion of sharing the school districts. Ever since the meeting on January 30, 1996, the Stephen Tiger and the Argyle Eagle became united as one creating the Stephen/Argyle Central STORM. Stephen/Argyle is widely known for its high school football program, which won its first state championship in 1999 then 5 State Championships in a row from years 2003-2007 and again in 2009.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ci.argyle.mn.us/ Argyle official website]\n\n{{Marshall County, Minnesota}}\n\n{{coord|48|19|58|N|96|49|15|W|type:city_region:US-MN|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Cities in Marshall County, Minnesota]]\n[[Category:French-Canadian American history]]\n[[Category:French-Canadian culture in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1879]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEducation:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1989-90 \u2192 1989\u201390", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyle,_Minnesota"}

The most popular one maintains that the name of the city is a remainder from the [[Pelasgians|Pelasgian]] language, i.e. the one used by the people who first settled in the area, in which Argos meant \"plain\". Alternatively, the name is associated with Argos, the third king of the city in ancient times, who renamed it after himself, thus replacing its older name Phoronikon Astu (\u03a6\u03bf\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd \u0386\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5, \"city of [[Phoroneus]]\"). It is also believed that \"Argos\" is linked to the word \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 (arg\u00f3s), which meant \"white\"; possibly, this had to do with the visual impression given of the argolic plain during harvest time. According to [[Strabo]], the name could have even originated from the word \u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \"field\" by [[metathesis (linguistics)|antimetathesis]] of the consonants.<ref name=\"Argo2010\">{{cite web|author1=Athanasios Vercetis|author2=Stavroula Petraki|script-title=el:\u03a3\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u03a1\u0393\u039f\u039b\u0399\u039a\u0397 \u0391\u03a1\u03a7\u0395\u0399\u0391\u039a\u0397 \u0392\u0399\u0392\u039b\u0399\u039f\u0398\u0397\u039a\u0397 \u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u03a1\u0399\u0391\u03a3 \u039a\u0391\u0399 \u03a0\u039f\u039b\u0399\u03a4\u0399\u03a3\u039c\u039f\u03a5|url=https://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2010/09/27|website=argolikivivliothiki.gr|publisher=Argolikos Archival Library of History and Culture|accessdate=5 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205054313/https://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2010/09/27/|archivedate=February 5, 2018|language=Greek|date=2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\n[[File:Argos,_Triobol,_c.270-250_BC,_HGC_5-670.jpg|left|thumb|Triobol of Argos, minted between 270 and 250 BC.

The most celebrated members were [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]]. As a strategic location on the fertile plain of Argolis, Argos was a major stronghold during the Mycenaean era. In [[classical antiquity|classical times]] Argos was a powerful rival of [[Sparta]] for dominance over the Peloponnese, but was eventually shunned by other Greek city-states after remaining neutral during the [[Greco-Persian Wars]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=John|title=Dictionary of the Classical World|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280146-3|page=66}}</ref> \n[[File:Argos Heraion Plain.jpg|thumb|left|The Heraion of Argos]]\n[[File:Ancient Argos - Theatre 2.jpg|thumb|240px|View of the [[Argos Theater|ancient theatre]]]]\n[[File:Ancient peloponnese.svg|thumb|200px|Ancient Peloponnese]]\n[[File:Ancient Regions Peloponnese.png|thumb|200px|Ancient regions of Peloponnese (southern mainland Greece).]]\n\nThere is evidence of continuous settlement in the area starting with a village about 7000 years ago in the late [[Neolithic]], located on the foot of Aspida hill.<ref name=\"Bolender2010\"/>{{rp|124-}} Since that time, Argos has been continually inhabited at the same geographical location. Its creation is attributed to [[Phoroneus]], with its first name having been Phoronicon Asty, or the city of Phoroneus. The historical presence of the Pelasgian Greeks in the area can be witnessed in the linguistic remainders that survive up to today, such as the very name of the city and \"Larisa\", the name of the city's castle located on the hill of the name.<ref name=\"kastra.eu\">http://www.kastra.eu/castlegr.php?kastro=argos</ref>\n\nThe city is located at a rather propitious area, among [[Nemea]], [[Corinth]] and [[Arcadia]]. It also benefitted from its proximity to lake [[Lerna]], which, at the time, was at a distance of one kilometre from the south end of Argos.\n\nArgos was a major stronghold of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times, and along with the neighbouring acropolis of [[Mycenae]] and [[Tiryns]] became a very early settlement because of its commanding positions in the midst of the fertile plain of Argolis.\n\n===Archaic Argos===\n\nArgos experienced its greatest period of expansion and power under the energetic 7th century BC ruler King [[Pheidon]]. Under Pheidon, Argos regained sway over the cities of the [[Argolid]] and challenged [[Sparta]]\u2019s dominance of the Peloponnese. Spartan dominance is thought to have been interrupted following the [[Battle of Hysiae (c.669 BC)|Battle of Hyssiae]] in 669-668 BC, in which Argive troops defeated the Spartans in a hoplite battle.<ref>Mackil, Emily, Tyrants in Seventh Century Greece, Lecture, September 20, 2018</ref> During the time of its greatest power, the city boasted a pottery and bronze sculpturing school, pottery workshops, tanneries and clothes producers. Moreover, at least 25 celebrations took place in the city, in addition to a regular local products exhibition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://argolika.gr/index.php/2014-25-96-44-85-11/2013-44-34-89-23-12/2013-10-18-08-30-27/5330-methysoi-kleftes-sykofantes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225040259/http://argolika.gr/index.php/2014-25-96-44-85-11/2013-44-34-89-23-12/2013-10-18-08-30-27/5330-methysoi-kleftes-sykofantes |archivedate=2015-02-25 }}</ref> A sanctuary dedicated to Hera was also found at the same spot where the monastery of Panagia Katekrymeni is located today. Pheidon also extended Argive influence throughout Greece, taking control of the Olympic Games away from the citizens of Elis and appointing himself organizer during his reign. Pheidon is also thought to have introduced reforms for standard weight and measures in Argos, a theory further reinforced with the unearthing of six \"spits\" of iron in an Argive Heraion, possibly remainders of a dedication from Pheidon.\n\n===Classical Argos===\n\nIn 494 BC, Argos suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of its regional rival, Sparta, at the Battle of Sepeia. Following this defeat, Herodotus tells us the city suffered a form of ''stasis''. The political chaos is thought to have resulted in a democratic transition in the city.<ref name=\"E. Robinson, 2011\">E. Robinson, ''Democracy Beyond Athens,'' Cambridge, 2011, 6-21.</ref> Argos did not participate in the Hellenic Alliance against the Persian Invasion of 480 BC. This resulted in a period of diplomatic isolation, although there is evidence of an Argive alliance with Tegea prior to 462 BC.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">2.\tKelly, Thomas. \"Argive Foreign Policy in the Fifth Century B.C.\" Classical Philology 69, no. 2 (1974): 81-99. http://www.jstor.org/stable/268729.</ref>\n\nIn 462 BC, Argos joined a tripartite alliance with Athens and Thessaly. This alliance was somewhat dysfunctional, however, and the Argives are only thought to have provided marginal contributions to the alliance at the Battle of Oenoe and Tanagra.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> For example, only 1,000 Argive hoplites are thought to have fought alongside the Athenians at the Battle of Tanagra. Following the allies' defeat at Tanagra in 457 BC, the alliance began to fall apart, resulting in its dissolution in 451 BC.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nArgos remained neutral or the ineffective ally of [[Athens]] during the Archidamian War between Sparta and Athens. Argos' neutrality resulted in a rise of its prestige among other Greek cities, and Argos used this political capital to organize and lead an alliance against Sparta and Athens in 421 BC.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> This alliance included Mantinea, Corinth, Elis, Thebes, Argos, and eventually Athens.  This alliance fell apart, however, after the allied loss at the Battle of Tegea in 418 BC.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> This defeat, combined with the raiding of the Argolid by the Epidaurians, resulted in political instability and an eventual oligarchic coup in 417 BC.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> Although democracy was restored within a year, Argos was left permanently weakened by this coup. This weakening led to a loss of power, which in turn led to the shift of commercial focus from the Ancient Agora to the eastern side of the city, delimited by Danaou and Agiou Konstadinou streets.\n\nArgos played a minor role in the [[Corinthian War]]s against Sparta, and for a short period of time considered uniting with Corinth to form an expanded Argolid state. For a brief period of time, the two poleis combined, but Corinth quickly rebelled against Argive domination, and Argos returned to its traditional boundaries. After this, Argos continued to remain a minor power in Greek affairs.\n\n===Democracy in Classical Argos===\n\nArgos was a democracy for most of the classical period, with only a brief hiatus between 418 and 416.<ref name=\"E. Robinson, 2011\"/> Democracy was first established after a disastrous defeat by the Spartans at the [[Battle of Sepeia]] in 494. So many Argives were killed in the battle that a revolution ensued, in which previously disenfranchised outsiders were included in the state for the first time.<ref>Hdt. 6.83; Arist. ''Pol.'' 13036-8</ref>\n\nArgive democracy included an Assembly (called the ''aliaia''), a Council (the ''bola''), and another body called 'The Eighty,' whose precise responsibilities are obscure. Magistrates served six-month terms of office, with few exceptions, and were audited at the end of their terms. There is some evidence that [[ostracism]] was practiced.<ref>E. Robinson, ''Democracy Beyond Athens,'' Cambridge, 2011, 10-18.</ref>\n\n===Roman, Byzantine, Crusader, Ottoman rule and independence===\n[[File:Argos09.jpg|thumb|The [[Larissa (Argolis)|castle]] on Larissa Hill.]]\nUnder Roman rule, Argos was part of the province of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]]. Under Byzantine rule it was part of the [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Hellas (theme)|Hellas]], and later of the theme of the [[Peloponnese (theme)|Peloponnese]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Fourth Crusade]], the Crusaders captured the castle built on Larisa Hill, the site of the ancient acropolis, and the area became part of the [[lordship of Argos and Nauplia]]. In 1388 it was sold to the [[Republic of Venice]], but was taken by the [[Despot of the Morea]] [[Theodore I Palaiologos]] before the Venetians could take control of the city; he sold it anyway to them in 1394. The Crusaders established a Latin bishopric. Venetian rule lasted until 1463, when the Ottomans captured the city.\n\nIn 1397, the Ottomans plundered Argos, carrying off much of the population,<ref name=\"Sutton\">Contingent countryside: settlement, economy, and land use in the southern Argolid since 1700  Authors Susan Buck Sutton, Keith W.

The Greek mahala was also called the \"quarter of the unfaithful of Archos town\" in Turkish documents, whereas Liepur mahala (the quarter of the rabbits) was composed mostly of [[Albania]]n emigrants and well-reputed families. Karamoutza mahala was home to the most prominent Turks and boasted a mosque (modern-day church of Agios Konstadinos), a Turkish cemetery, Ali Nakin Bei's [[seraglio|serail]], [[Turkish bath]]s and a Turkish school. It is also at this period when the open market of the city is first organised on the site north to Kapodistrias' barracks, at the same spot where it is held in modern times. A mosque would have existed there, too, according to the city planning most Ottoman cities followed.\n\nArgos grew exponentially during this time, with its sprawl being unregulated and without planning. As French explorer [[Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville|Pouqueville]] noted, \"its houses are not aligned, without order, scattered all over the place, divided by home gardens and uncultivated areas\". Liepur mahala appears to have been the most organised, having the best layout, while Bekir mahala and Karamoutza mahala were the most labyrinthine. However, all quarters shared the same type of streets; firstly, they all had main streets which were wide, busy and public roads meant to allow for communication between neighbourhoods (typical examples are, to a great extent, modern-day Korinthou, Nafpliou and Tripoleos streets). Secondary streets were also common in all four quarters since they lead to the interior of each mahala, having a semi-public character, whereas the third type of streets referred to dead-end private alleys used specifically by families to access their homes. Remnants of this city layout can be witnessed even today, as Argos still preserves several elements of this Ottoman type style, particularly with its long and complicated streets, its narrow alleys and its densely constructed houses.\n\n[[File:Veduta d'Argos - Coronelli Vincenzo - 1688.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of Argos by [[Vincenzo Coronelli]], 1688]]\n\nWith the exception of a period of [[Kingdom of the Morea|Venetian domination]] in 1687\u20131715, Argos remained in Ottoman hands until the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821, when wealthy Ottoman families moved to nearby [[Nafplio]] due to its stronger walling.\n\nAt that time, as part of the general uprising, many local governing bodies were formed in different parts of the country, and the \"Consulate of Argos\" was proclaimed on 28 March 1821, under the [[Peloponnesian Senate]]. It had a single head of state, Stamatellos Antonopoulos, styled \"[[Consul]]\", between 28 March and 26 May 1821.\n\nLater, Argos accepted the authority of the unified Provisional Government of the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus]], and eventually became part of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]]. With the coming of governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], the city underwent efforts of modernisation. Being an agricultural village, the need for urban planning was vital. For this reason, in 1828, Kapodistrias himself appointed mechanic Stamatis Voulgaris as the creator of a city plan which would offer Argos big streets, squares and public spaces. However, both Voulgaris and, later, French architect de Borroczun's plans were not well received by the locals, with the result that the former had to be revised by Zavos. Ultimately, none of the plans were fully implemented. Still, the structural characteristics of de Borroczun's plan can be found in the city today, despite obvious proof of pre-revolutionary layout, such as the unorganised urban sprawl testified in the area from Inachou street to the point where the railway tracks can be found today.\n\nAfter talks concerning the intentions of the Greek government to move the Greek capital from [[Nafplio]] to [[Athens]], discussions regarding the possibility of Argos also being a candidate as the potential new capital became more frequent, with supporters of the idea claiming that, unlike Athens, Argos was naturally protected by its position and benefited from a nearby port (Nafplio). Moreover, it was maintained that construction of public buildings would be difficult in Athens, given that most of the land was owned by the Greek church, meaning that a great deal of [[expropriation]] would have to take place. On the contrary, Argos did not face a similar problem, having large available areas for this purpose. In the end, the proposition of the Greek capital being moved to Argos was rejected by the father of [[Otto of Greece|king Otto]], [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig]], who insisted in making Athens the capital, something which eventually happened in 1834.<ref>https://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2009/02/20/%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82-%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CF%89%CF%82-%CF%80%CF%81%CF%89%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%8D%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%83%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%B7/</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\nThe [[mythological king]]s of Argos are (in order): [[Inachus]], [[Phoroneus]], [[Apis, king of Argos|Apis]], [[Argus (king of Argos)|Argus]], [[Criasus]], [[Phorbas (king of Argos)|Phorbas]],  [[Triopas (king of Argos)|Triopas]], [[Iasus (king of Argos)|Iasus]], [[Agenor of Argos|Agenor]], [[Crotopus]], [[Sthenelus]], [[Gelanor]] AKA [[Pelasgus#Son of Sthenelas|Pelasgus]], [[Danaus]], [[Lynceus]], [[Abas (son of Lynceus)|Abas]], [[Proetus (king of Argos and Tiryns)|Proetus]], [[Acrisius]], [[Perseus]], [[Megapenthes]], [[Argeus (king of Argos)|Argeus]] and [[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\nAn alternative version supplied by [[Tatian]] of the original 17 consecutive kings of Argos includes [[Apis (Greek mythology)|Apis]], Argios, Kriasos and [[Phorbas]] between Argus and Triopas, explaining the apparent unrelation of Triopas to Argus.<ref>James Cowles Prichard : ''An Analysis of the Egyptian Mythology''. 1819. p. 85</ref>\n\nThe city of Argos was believed to be the birthplace of the mythological character [[Perseus]], the son of the god [[Zeus]] and [[Dana\u00eb]], who was the daughter of the king of Argos, [[Acrisius]].\n\nAfter the original 17 kings of Argos, there were three kings ruling Argos at the same time (see [[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]]),{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} one descended from [[Bias (mythology)|Bias]], one from [[Melampus]], and one from [[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]]. Melampus was succeeded by his son [[Mantius]], then [[Oicles]], and [[Amphiaraus]], and his house of Melampus lasted down to the brothers [[Alcmaeon (mythology)|Alcmaeon]] and [[Amphilochus (brother of Alcmaeon)|Amphilochus]].\n\n[[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]] was succeeded by his son [[Alector]], and then [[Iphis#King of Argos|Iphis]]. Iphis left his kingdom to his nephew [[Sthenelus]], the son of his brother [[Capaneus]].\n\n[[Bias (mythology)|Bias]] was succeeded by his son [[Talaus]], and then by his son [[Adrastus]] who, with Amphiaraus, commanded the disastrous [[Seven Against Thebes]]. [[Adrastus]] bequeathed the kingdom to his son, [[Aegialeus (king of Argos)|Aegialeus]], who was subsequently killed in the war of the [[Epigoni]]. [[Diomedes]], grandson of Adrastus through his son-in-law Tydeus and daughter [[Deipyle]], replaced Aegialeus and was King of Argos during the Trojan war. This house lasted longer than those of [[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]] and [[Melampus]], and eventually the kingdom was reunited under its last member, Cyanippus, son of Aegialeus, soon after the exile of Diomedes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Ecclesiastical history==\nAfter Christianity became established in Argos, the first bishop documented in extant written records is Genethlius, who in 448 AD took part in the synod called by [[Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople]] that deposed [[Eutyches]] from his priestly office and [[excommunication|excommunicated]] him. The next bishop of Argos, Onesimus, was at the 451 [[Council of Chalcedon]]. His successor, Thales, was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of the [[Roman province]] of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Hellas]] sent in 458 to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian]] to protest about the killing of [[Proterius of Alexandria]].

Bonis Park is an essential green space of the city.\n\nCurrently, the most commercially active streets of the city are those surrounding the Agios Petros square (Kapodistriou, Danaou, Vassileos Konstantinou streets) as well as Korinthou street. The Pezodromi (Pedestrian Streets), i.e. the paved Michael Stamou, Tsaldari and Venizelou streets, are the most popular meeting point, encompassing a wide variety of shops and cafeterias.\n\n===Population===\nIn 700 BC there were at least 5,000 people living in the city.<ref>{{Google books |id=P43ChiFyVVEC |page=37 |title=Urbanism in the Preindustrial World: Cross-Cultural Approaches }}</ref> In the fourth century BC, the city was home to as many as 30,000 people.<ref>{{Google books |id=xEU4hqU-Op8C |page=124 |title=Geology and Settlement: Greco-Roman Patterns }}</ref>\nToday, according to the 2011 Greek census, the city has a population of 22,209.

Citrus fruits are the predominant crop, followed by olives and apricots.  The area is also famous for its local melon variety, Argos melons (or Argetiko). There is also important local production of dairy products, factories for fruits processing.\n\nConsiderable remains of the ancient and medieval city survive and are a popular tourist attraction.\n\n==Monuments==\nMost of Argos' historical and archaeological monuments are currently unused, abandoned, or only partially renovated:\n\n* The Larisa castle, built during [[prehistory|prehistoric time]], which has undergone several repairs and expansions since antiquity and played a significant historical role during the Venetian domination of Greece and the [[Greek War of Independence]].<ref name=\"kastra.eu\"/> It is located on top of the homonymous Larisa Hill, which also constitutes the highest spot of the city (289 m.). In ancient times, a castle was also found in neighbouring Aspida Hill. When connected with walls, these two castles fortified the city from enemy invasions. \n* The [[Argos Theater|Ancient theatre]], built in the 3rd century B.C with a capacity of 20,000 spectators, replaced an older neighbouring theatre of the 5th century BC and communicated with the Ancient Agora. It was visible from any part of the ancient city and the [[Argolic gulf]]. In 1829, it was used by [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] for the [[Fourth National Assembly at Argos|Fourth National Assembly]] of the new Hellenic State. Today, cultural events are held at its premises during the summer months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id%3D733 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221205533/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id=733 |archivedate=2015-02-21 }}</ref>\n* The Ancient Agora, adjacent to the Ancient theatre, which developed in the 6th century B.C., was located at the junction of the ancient roads coming from [[Corinth]], [[Heraion of Argos|Heraion]] and [[Tegea]].

Initially, it served as a [[court]] of ancient Argos, similar to [[Areopagus]] of [[Athens]]. According to mythology, it was at this area where [[Hypermnestra]], one of the 50 daughters of [[Danaus]], the first king of Argos, was tried. Later, under the reigns of [[Hadrian]], a [[fountain#ancient fountains|fountain]] was created to collect and circulate water coming from the Hadrianean aqueduct located in northern Argos. The site is connected via a paved path with the ancient theatre.<ref>http://argolikivivliothiki.gr/tag/%CE%B1%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CF%85%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%BF/</ref>\n* The Barracks of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]], a preservable building with a long history. Built in the 1690s during the Venetian domination of Greece, they initially served as a hospital run by the [[Sisters of Mercy]]. During the [[Ottoman Greece|Tourkokratia]], they served as a market and a post office. Later, in 1829, significant damage caused during the Greek revolution was repaired by Kapodistrias who turned the building into a [[cavalry]] barrack, a school (1893-1894), an exhibition space (1899), a shelter for Greek refugees displaced during the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] (since 1920) and an interrogation and torture space (during the [[Axis occupation of Greece|German occupation of Greece]]). In 1955\u201368, it was used by the army for the last time; it now accommodates the Byzantine Museum of Argos, local corporations and also serves as an exhibition space.<ref>http://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2008/10/24/%CF%83%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%84%CF%8E%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%82-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B4%CE%AF%CF%83%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B1-%E2%80%93-%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82/</ref>  \n* The Municipal Neoclassical Market building (unofficially the \"Kamares\", i.e. arches, from the arches that it boasts), built in 1889, which is located next to Dimokratias square, is one of the finest samples of modern Argos' masterly architecture, in [[Ernst Ziller]] style. The elongated, two corridor, preservable building accommodates small shops.<ref>http://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2011/11/16/%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AC-%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%82/</ref>\n* The Kapodistrian school, in central Argos. Built by architect Labros Zavos in 1830, as part of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias']] efforts to provide places of education to the Greek people, it could accommodate up to 300 students. However, technical difficulties led to its decay, until it was restored several times, the last of which being in 1932. Today, its neoclassical character is evident, with the building housing the 1st elementary school of the town.<ref>https://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2009/03/11/kapodistrian-school/</ref> \n* The old Town Hall, built during the time of Kapodistrias in 1830, which originally served as a [[Justice of the peace]], the Dimogerontia of Argos, an [[Carabinieri|Arm of Carabineers]] and a prison.

The Argos [[airport]], located in an homonymous area (Aerodromio) in the outskirts of the city is also worth mentioning. The area it covers was created in 1916-1917 and was greatly used during the [[Greco-Italian War]] and for the training of new Kaberos school aviators for the [[Hellenic Air Force Academy]].  It also constituted an important benchmark in the organization of the Greek air forces in southern [[Greece]]. Furthermore, the airport was used by the [[Germans]] for the release of their aerial troops during the [[Battle of Crete]]. It was last used as a landing/take off point for spray planes (for agricultural purposes in the olive tree cultivations) up until 1985.<ref>http://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2010/01/12/h-%CF%83%CF%87%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%AE-%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AC%CF%81%CF%89%CE%BD-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%B1%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B4%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%85/</ref>\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:Argos railway station.jpg|thumb|The railway station]]\nArgos is connected via regular bus services with neighbouring areas as well as [[Athens]].

The most popular one maintains that the name of the city is a remainder from the [[Pelasgians|Pelasgian]] language, i.e. the one used by the people who first settled in the area, in which Argos meant \"plain\". Alternatively, the name is associated with Argos, the third king of the city in ancient times, who renamed it after himself, thus replacing its older name Phoronikon Astu (\u03a6\u03bf\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd \u0386\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5, \"city of [[Phoroneus]]\"). It is also believed that \"Argos\" is linked to the word \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 (arg\u00f3s), which meant \"white\"; possibly, this had to do with the visual impression given of the argolic plain during harvest time. According to [[Strabo]], the name could have even originated from the word \u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \"field\" by [[metathesis (linguistics)|antimetathesis]] of the consonants.<ref name=\"Argo2010\">{{cite web|author1=Athanasios Vercetis|author2=Stavroula Petraki|script-title=el:\u03a3\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u03a1\u0393\u039f\u039b\u0399\u039a\u0397 \u0391\u03a1\u03a7\u0395\u0399\u0391\u039a\u0397 \u0392\u0399\u0392\u039b\u0399\u039f\u0398\u0397\u039a\u0397 \u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u03a1\u0399\u0391\u03a3 \u039a\u0391\u0399 \u03a0\u039f\u039b\u0399\u03a4\u0399\u03a3\u039c\u039f\u03a5|url=https://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2010/09/27|website=argolikivivliothiki.gr|publisher=Argolikos Archival Library of History and Culture|accessdate=5 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205054313/https://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2010/09/27/|archivedate=February 5, 2018|language=Greek|date=2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\n[[File:Argos,_Triobol,_c.270-250_BC,_HGC_5-670.jpg|left|thumb|Triobol of Argos, minted between 270 and 250 BC.

The most celebrated members were [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]]. As a strategic location on the fertile plain of Argolis, Argos was a major stronghold during the Mycenaean era. In [[classical antiquity|classical times]] Argos was a powerful rival of [[Sparta]] for dominance over the Peloponnese, but was eventually shunned by other Greek city-states after remaining neutral during the [[Greco-Persian Wars]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=John|title=Dictionary of the Classical World|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280146-3|page=66}}</ref> \n[[File:Argos Heraion Plain.jpg|thumb|left|The Heraion of Argos]]\n[[File:Ancient Argos - Theatre 2.jpg|thumb|240px|View of the [[Argos Theater|ancient theatre]]]]\n[[File:Ancient peloponnese.svg|thumb|200px|Ancient Peloponnese]]\n[[File:Ancient Regions Peloponnese.png|thumb|200px|Ancient regions of Peloponnese (southern mainland Greece).]]\n\nThere is evidence of continuous settlement in the area starting with a village about 7000 years ago in the late [[Neolithic]], located on the foot of Aspida hill.<ref name=\"Bolender2010\"/>{{rp|124-}} Since that time, Argos has been continually inhabited at the same geographical location. Its creation is attributed to [[Phoroneus]], with its first name having been Phoronicon Asty, or the city of Phoroneus. The historical presence of the Pelasgian Greeks in the area can be witnessed in the linguistic remainders that survive up to today, such as the very name of the city and \"Larisa\", the name of the city's castle located on the hill of the name.<ref name=\"kastra.eu\">http://www.kastra.eu/castlegr.php?kastro=argos</ref>\n\nThe city is located at a rather propitious area, among [[Nemea]], [[Corinth]] and [[Arcadia]]. It also benefitted from its proximity to lake [[Lerna]], which, at the time, was at a distance of one kilometre from the south end of Argos.\n\nArgos was a major stronghold of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times, and along with the neighbouring acropolis of [[Mycenae]] and [[Tiryns]] became a very early settlement because of its commanding positions in the midst of the fertile plain of Argolis.\n\n===Archaic Argos===\n\nArgos experienced its greatest period of expansion and power under the energetic 7th century BC ruler King [[Pheidon]]. Under Pheidon, Argos regained sway over the cities of the [[Argolid]] and challenged [[Sparta]]\u2019s dominance of the Peloponnese. Spartan dominance is thought to have been interrupted following the [[Battle of Hysiae (c.669 BC)|Battle of Hyssiae]] in 669-668 BC, in which Argive troops defeated the Spartans in a hoplite battle.<ref>Mackil, Emily, Tyrants in Seventh Century Greece, Lecture, September 20, 2018</ref> During the time of its greatest power, the city boasted a pottery and bronze sculpturing school, pottery workshops, tanneries and clothes producers. Moreover, at least 25 celebrations took place in the city, in addition to a regular local products exhibition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://argolika.gr/index.php/2014-25-96-44-85-11/2013-44-34-89-23-12/2013-10-18-08-30-27/5330-methysoi-kleftes-sykofantes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225040259/http://argolika.gr/index.php/2014-25-96-44-85-11/2013-44-34-89-23-12/2013-10-18-08-30-27/5330-methysoi-kleftes-sykofantes |archivedate=2015-02-25 }}</ref> A sanctuary dedicated to Hera was also found at the same spot where the monastery of Panagia Katekrymeni is located today. Pheidon also extended Argive influence throughout Greece, taking control of the Olympic Games away from the citizens of Elis and appointing himself organizer during his reign. Pheidon is also thought to have introduced reforms for standard weight and measures in Argos, a theory further reinforced with the unearthing of six \"spits\" of iron in an Argive Heraion, possibly remainders of a dedication from Pheidon.\n\n===Classical Argos===\n\nIn 494 BC, Argos suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of its regional rival, Sparta, at the Battle of Sepeia. Following this defeat, Herodotus tells us the city suffered a form of ''stasis''. The political chaos is thought to have resulted in a democratic transition in the city.<ref name=\"E. Robinson, 2011\">E. Robinson, ''Democracy Beyond Athens,'' Cambridge, 2011, 6-21.</ref> Argos did not participate in the Hellenic Alliance against the Persian Invasion of 480 BC. This resulted in a period of diplomatic isolation, although there is evidence of an Argive alliance with Tegea prior to 462 BC.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">2.\tKelly, Thomas. \"Argive Foreign Policy in the Fifth Century B.C.\" Classical Philology 69, no. 2 (1974): 81-99. http://www.jstor.org/stable/268729.</ref>\n\nIn 462 BC, Argos joined a tripartite alliance with Athens and Thessaly. This alliance was somewhat dysfunctional, however, and the Argives are only thought to have provided marginal contributions to the alliance at the Battle of Oenoe and Tanagra.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> For example, only 1,000 Argive hoplites are thought to have fought alongside the Athenians at the Battle of Tanagra. Following the allies' defeat at Tanagra in 457 BC, the alliance began to fall apart, resulting in its dissolution in 451 BC.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/>\n\nArgos remained neutral or the ineffective ally of [[Athens]] during the Archidamian War between Sparta and Athens. Argos' neutrality resulted in a rise of its prestige among other Greek cities, and Argos used this political capital to organize and lead an alliance against Sparta and Athens in 421 BC.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> This alliance included Mantinea, Corinth, Elis, Thebes, Argos, and eventually Athens.  This alliance fell apart, however, after the allied loss at the Battle of Tegea in 418 BC.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> This defeat, combined with the raiding of the Argolid by the Epidaurians, resulted in political instability and an eventual oligarchic coup in 417 BC.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> Although democracy was restored within a year, Argos was left permanently weakened by this coup. This weakening led to a loss of power, which in turn led to the shift of commercial focus from the Ancient Agora to the eastern side of the city, delimited by Danaou and Agiou Konstadinou streets.\n\nArgos played a minor role in the [[Corinthian War]]s against Sparta, and for a short period of time considered uniting with Corinth to form an expanded Argolid state. For a brief period of time, the two poleis combined, but Corinth quickly rebelled against Argive domination, and Argos returned to its traditional boundaries. After this, Argos continued to remain a minor power in Greek affairs.\n\n===Democracy in Classical Argos===\n\nArgos was a democracy for most of the classical period, with only a brief hiatus between 418 and 416.<ref name=\"E. Robinson, 2011\"/> Democracy was first established after a disastrous defeat by the Spartans at the [[Battle of Sepeia]] in 494. So many Argives were killed in the battle that a revolution ensued, in which previously disenfranchised outsiders were included in the state for the first time.<ref>Hdt. 6.83; Arist. ''Pol.'' 13036-8</ref>\n\nArgive democracy included an Assembly (called the ''aliaia''), a Council (the ''bola''), and another body called 'The Eighty,' whose precise responsibilities are obscure. Magistrates served six-month terms of office, with few exceptions, and were audited at the end of their terms. There is some evidence that [[ostracism]] was practiced.<ref>E. Robinson, ''Democracy Beyond Athens,'' Cambridge, 2011, 10-18.</ref>\n\n===Roman, Byzantine, Crusader, Ottoman rule and independence===\n[[File:Argos09.jpg|thumb|The [[Larissa (Argolis)|castle]] on Larissa Hill.]]\nUnder Roman rule, Argos was part of the province of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]]. Under Byzantine rule it was part of the [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Hellas (theme)|Hellas]], and later of the theme of the [[Peloponnese (theme)|Peloponnese]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Fourth Crusade]], the Crusaders captured the castle built on Larisa Hill, the site of the ancient acropolis, and the area became part of the [[lordship of Argos and Nauplia]]. In 1388 it was sold to the [[Republic of Venice]], but was taken by the [[Despot of the Morea]] [[Theodore I Palaiologos]] before the Venetians could take control of the city; he sold it anyway to them in 1394. The Crusaders established a Latin bishopric. Venetian rule lasted until 1463, when the Ottomans captured the city.\n\nIn 1397, the Ottomans plundered Argos, carrying off much of the population,<ref name=\"Sutton\">Contingent countryside: settlement, economy, and land use in the southern Argolid since 1700  Authors Susan Buck Sutton, Keith W.

The Greek mahala was also called the \"quarter of the unfaithful of Archos town\" in Turkish documents, whereas Liepur mahala (the quarter of the rabbits) was composed mostly of [[Albania]]n emigrants and well-reputed families. Karamoutza mahala was home to the most prominent Turks and boasted a mosque (modern-day church of Agios Konstadinos), a Turkish cemetery, Ali Nakin Bei's [[seraglio|serail]], [[Turkish bath]]s and a Turkish school. It is also at this period when the open market of the city is first organised on the site north to Kapodistrias' barracks, at the same spot where it is held in modern times. A mosque would have existed there, too, according to the city planning most Ottoman cities followed.\n\nArgos grew exponentially during this time, with its sprawl being unregulated and without planning. As French explorer [[Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville|Pouqueville]] noted, \"its houses are not aligned, without order, scattered all over the place, divided by home gardens and uncultivated areas\". Liepur mahala appears to have been the most organised, having the best layout, while Bekir mahala and Karamoutza mahala were the most labyrinthine. However, all quarters shared the same type of streets; firstly, they all had main streets which were wide, busy and public roads meant to allow for communication between neighbourhoods (typical examples are, to a great extent, modern-day Korinthou, Nafpliou and Tripoleos streets). Secondary streets were also common in all four quarters since they lead to the interior of each mahala, having a semi-public character, whereas the third type of streets referred to dead-end private alleys used specifically by families to access their homes. Remnants of this city layout can be witnessed even today, as Argos still preserves several elements of this Ottoman type style, particularly with its long and complicated streets, its narrow alleys and its densely constructed houses.\n\n[[File:Veduta d'Argos - Coronelli Vincenzo - 1688.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of Argos by [[Vincenzo Coronelli]], 1688]]\n\nWith the exception of a period of [[Kingdom of the Morea|Venetian domination]] in 1687\u20131715, Argos remained in Ottoman hands until the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821, when wealthy Ottoman families moved to nearby [[Nafplio]] due to its stronger walling.\n\nAt that time, as part of the general uprising, many local governing bodies were formed in different parts of the country, and the \"Consulate of Argos\" was proclaimed on 28 March 1821, under the [[Peloponnesian Senate]]. It had a single head of state, Stamatellos Antonopoulos, styled \"[[Consul]]\", between 28 March and 26 May 1821.\n\nLater, Argos accepted the authority of the unified Provisional Government of the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus]], and eventually became part of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]]. With the coming of governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], the city underwent efforts of modernisation. Being an agricultural village, the need for urban planning was vital. For this reason, in 1828, Kapodistrias himself appointed mechanic Stamatis Voulgaris as the creator of a city plan which would offer Argos big streets, squares and public spaces. However, both Voulgaris and, later, French architect de Borroczun's plans were not well received by the locals, with the result that the former had to be revised by Zavos. Ultimately, none of the plans were fully implemented. Still, the structural characteristics of de Borroczun's plan can be found in the city today, despite obvious proof of pre-revolutionary layout, such as the unorganised urban sprawl testified in the area from Inachou street to the point where the railway tracks can be found today.\n\nAfter talks concerning the intentions of the Greek government to move the Greek capital from [[Nafplio]] to [[Athens]], discussions regarding the possibility of Argos also being a candidate as the potential new capital became more frequent, with supporters of the idea claiming that, unlike Athens, Argos was naturally protected by its position and benefited from a nearby port (Nafplio). Moreover, it was maintained that construction of public buildings would be difficult in Athens, given that most of the land was owned by the Greek church, meaning that a great deal of [[expropriation]] would have to take place. On the contrary, Argos did not face a similar problem, having large available areas for this purpose. In the end, the proposition of the Greek capital being moved to Argos was rejected by the father of [[Otto of Greece|king Otto]], [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig]], who insisted in making Athens the capital, something which eventually happened in 1834.<ref>https://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2009/02/20/%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82-%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CF%89%CF%82-%CF%80%CF%81%CF%89%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%8D%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%83%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%B7/</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\nThe [[mythological king]]s of Argos are (in order): [[Inachus]], [[Phoroneus]], [[Apis, king of Argos|Apis]], [[Argus (king of Argos)|Argus]], [[Criasus]], [[Phorbas (king of Argos)|Phorbas]],  [[Triopas (king of Argos)|Triopas]], [[Iasus (king of Argos)|Iasus]], [[Agenor of Argos|Agenor]], [[Crotopus]], [[Sthenelus]], [[Gelanor]] AKA [[Pelasgus#Son of Sthenelas|Pelasgus]], [[Danaus]], [[Lynceus]], [[Abas (son of Lynceus)|Abas]], [[Proetus (king of Argos and Tiryns)|Proetus]], [[Acrisius]], [[Perseus]], [[Megapenthes]], [[Argeus (king of Argos)|Argeus]] and [[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\nAn alternative version supplied by [[Tatian]] of the original 17 consecutive kings of Argos includes [[Apis (Greek mythology)|Apis]], Argios, Kriasos and [[Phorbas]] between Argus and Triopas, explaining the apparent unrelation of Triopas to Argus.<ref>James Cowles Prichard : ''An Analysis of the Egyptian Mythology''. 1819. p. 85</ref>\n\nThe city of Argos was believed to be the birthplace of the mythological character [[Perseus]], the son of the god [[Zeus]] and [[Dana\u00eb]], who was the daughter of the king of Argos, [[Acrisius]].\n\nAfter the original 17 kings of Argos, there were three kings ruling Argos at the same time (see [[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]]),{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} one descended from [[Bias (mythology)|Bias]], one from [[Melampus]], and one from [[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]]. Melampus was succeeded by his son [[Mantius]], then [[Oicles]], and [[Amphiaraus]], and his house of Melampus lasted down to the brothers [[Alcmaeon (mythology)|Alcmaeon]] and [[Amphilochus (brother of Alcmaeon)|Amphilochus]].\n\n[[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]] was succeeded by his son [[Alector]], and then [[Iphis#King of Argos|Iphis]]. Iphis left his kingdom to his nephew [[Sthenelus]], the son of his brother [[Capaneus]].\n\n[[Bias (mythology)|Bias]] was succeeded by his son [[Talaus]], and then by his son [[Adrastus]] who, with Amphiaraus, commanded the disastrous [[Seven Against Thebes]]. [[Adrastus]] bequeathed the kingdom to his son, [[Aegialeus (king of Argos)|Aegialeus]], who was subsequently killed in the war of the [[Epigoni]]. [[Diomedes]], grandson of Adrastus through his son-in-law Tydeus and daughter [[Deipyle]], replaced Aegialeus and was King of Argos during the Trojan war. This house lasted longer than those of [[Anaxagoras (mythology)|Anaxagoras]] and [[Melampus]], and eventually the kingdom was reunited under its last member, Cyanippus, son of Aegialeus, soon after the exile of Diomedes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Ecclesiastical history==\nAfter Christianity became established in Argos, the first bishop documented in extant written records is Genethlius, who in 448 AD took part in the synod called by [[Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople]] that deposed [[Eutyches]] from his priestly office and [[excommunication|excommunicated]] him. The next bishop of Argos, Onesimus, was at the 451 [[Council of Chalcedon]]. His successor, Thales, was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of the [[Roman province]] of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Hellas]] sent in 458 to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian]] to protest about the killing of [[Proterius of Alexandria]].

Bonis Park is an essential green space of the city.\n\nCurrently, the most commercially active streets of the city are those surrounding the Agios Petros square (Kapodistriou, Danaou, Vassileos Konstantinou streets) as well as Korinthou street. The Pezodromi (Pedestrian Streets), i.e. the paved Michael Stamou, Tsaldari and Venizelou streets, are the most popular meeting point, encompassing a wide variety of shops and cafeterias.\n\n===Population===\nIn 700 BC there were at least 5,000 people living in the city.<ref>{{Google books |id=P43ChiFyVVEC |page=37 |title=Urbanism in the Preindustrial World: Cross-Cultural Approaches }}</ref> In the fourth century BC, the city was home to as many as 30,000 people.<ref>{{Google books |id=xEU4hqU-Op8C |page=124 |title=Geology and Settlement: Greco-Roman Patterns }}</ref>\nToday, according to the 2011 Greek census, the city has a population of 22,209.

Citrus fruits are the predominant crop, followed by olives and apricots.  The area is also famous for its local melon variety, Argos melons (or Argetiko). There is also important local production of dairy products, factories for fruits processing.\n\nConsiderable remains of the ancient and medieval city survive and are a popular tourist attraction.\n\n==Monuments==\nMost of Argos' historical and archaeological monuments are currently unused, abandoned, or only partially renovated:\n\n* The Larisa castle, built during [[prehistory|prehistoric time]], which has undergone several repairs and expansions since antiquity and played a significant historical role during the Venetian domination of Greece and the [[Greek War of Independence]].<ref name=\"kastra.eu\"/> It is located on top of the homonymous Larisa Hill, which also constitutes the highest spot of the city (289 m.). In ancient times, a castle was also found in neighbouring Aspida Hill. When connected with walls, these two castles fortified the city from enemy invasions. \n* The [[Argos Theater|Ancient theatre]], built in the 3rd century B.C with a capacity of 20,000 spectators, replaced an older neighbouring theatre of the 5th century BC and communicated with the Ancient Agora. It was visible from any part of the ancient city and the [[Argolic gulf]]. In 1829, it was used by [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] for the [[Fourth National Assembly at Argos|Fourth National Assembly]] of the new Hellenic State. Today, cultural events are held at its premises during the summer months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id%3D733 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221205533/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id=733 |archivedate=2015-02-21 }}</ref>\n* The Ancient Agora, adjacent to the Ancient theatre, which developed in the 6th century B.C., was located at the junction of the ancient roads coming from [[Corinth]], [[Heraion of Argos|Heraion]] and [[Tegea]].

Initially, it served as a [[court]] of ancient Argos, similar to [[Areopagus]] of [[Athens]]. According to mythology, it was at this area where [[Hypermnestra]], one of the 50 daughters of [[Danaus]], the first king of Argos, was tried. Later, under the reigns of [[Hadrian]], a [[fountain#ancient fountains|fountain]] was created to collect and circulate water coming from the Hadrianean aqueduct located in northern Argos. The site is connected via a paved path with the ancient theatre.<ref>http://argolikivivliothiki.gr/tag/%CE%B1%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CF%85%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%BF/</ref>\n* The Barracks of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]], a preservable building with a long history. Built in the 1690s during the Venetian domination of Greece, they initially served as a hospital run by the [[Sisters of Mercy]]. During the [[Ottoman Greece|Tourkokratia]], they served as a market and a post office. Later, in 1829, significant damage caused during the Greek revolution was repaired by Kapodistrias who turned the building into a [[cavalry]] barrack, a school (1893-1894), an exhibition space (1899), a shelter for Greek refugees displaced during the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] (since 1920) and an interrogation and torture space (during the [[Axis occupation of Greece|German occupation of Greece]]). In 1955-68, it was used by the army for the last time; it now accommodates the Byzantine Museum of Argos, local corporations and also serves as an exhibition space.<ref>http://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2008/10/24/%CF%83%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%84%CF%8E%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%82-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B4%CE%AF%CF%83%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B1-%E2%80%93-%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82/</ref>  \n* The Municipal Neoclassical Market building (unofficially the \"Kamares\", i.e. arches, from the arches that it boasts), built in 1889, which is located next to Dimokratias square, is one of the finest samples of modern Argos' masterly architecture, in [[Ernst Ziller]] style.

Built by architect Labros Zavos in 1830, as part of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias']] efforts to provide places of education to the Greek people, it could accommodate up to 300 students. However, technical difficulties led to its decay, until it was restored several times, the last of which being in 1932. Today, its neoclassical character is evident, with the building housing the 1st elementary school of the town.<ref>https://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2009/03/11/kapodistrian-school/</ref> \n* The old Town Hall, built during the time of Kapodistrias in 1830, which originally served as a [[Justice of the peace]], the Dimogerontia of Argos, an [[Carabinieri|Arm of Carabineers]] and a prison.

The Argos [[airport]], located in an homonymous area (Aerodromio) in the outskirts of the city is also worth mentioning. The area it covers was created in 1916-1917 and was greatly used during the [[Greco-Italian War]] and for the training of new Kaberos school aviators for the [[Hellenic Air Force Academy]].  It also constituted an important benchmark in the organization of the Greek air forces in southern [[Greece]]. Furthermore, the airport was used by the [[Germans]] for the release of their aerial troops during the [[Battle of Crete]]. It was last used as a landing/take off point for spray planes (for agricultural purposes in the olive tree cultivations) up until 1985.<ref>http://argolikivivliothiki.gr/2010/01/12/h-%CF%83%CF%87%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%AE-%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AC%CF%81%CF%89%CE%BD-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%B1%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B4%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%85/</ref>\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:Argos railway station.jpg|thumb|The railway station]]\nArgos is connected via regular bus services with neighbouring areas as well as [[Athens]].

It is often seen as the greatest club in the world and often seen as the biggest club in the Midlands, especially over derby and leicester! Founded in 1865, Forest are now considered the oldest [[English football league system|football league]] club in England after the relegation of [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] to the [[National League (English football)|National League]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/efl-confirm-nottingham-forest-now-2850883|title=Forest are now League's oldest club, not Stoke|last=Leach|first=Tom|date=2019-05-09|website=nottinghampost|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> Since 1898 Forest have played their home matches at the [[City Ground]]. They currently compete in the [[EFL Championship]], the second tier of the [[English football league system]].\n\nForest have won one [[List of English football champions|League title]], two [[FA Cup]]s, four [[Football League Cup|League Cups]], one [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]], two [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]], and one [[UEFA Super Cup]]. The club has competed in the top two tiers of English football since their admission to the Football League, except for five seasons spent in the third tier. Their most successful period was under the management of [[Brian Clough]] and [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nIn Clough's last decade at the club, Forest won the [[1989 Football League Cup Final|1989]] and [[1990 Football League Cup Final|1990]] League Cups and were losing finalists in the [[1991 FA Cup Final]], before relegation from the [[Premier League]] in [[1992\u201393 Premier League|1993]]. Upon an immediate return Forest finished third in the Premier League in [[1994\u201395 Premier League|1995]], before the club suffered relegation again in [[1996\u201397 Premier League|1997]] and, after a brief return, once more in [[1998\u201399 Premier League|1999]]. Forest have not been back in the Premier League since.\n\nForest contest the [[Nottingham derby]] with city rivals Notts County, however as Forest have predominantly played in higher leagues than their neighbours fixtures between the two clubs have been rare in recent history. As such their main rivalry is with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], and matches between the two clubs are known as the [[Derby County F.C.\u2013Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry|East Midlands derby]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Nottingham Forest F.C.}}\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1865 a group of [[shinty]] players met at the Clinton Arms on Nottingham's Shakespeare Street. J. S. Scrimshaw's proposal to play association football instead was agreed and Nottingham Forest Football Club was formed. It was agreed at the same meeting that the club would purchase twelve tasselled caps coloured '[[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] Red' (named after the leader of the [[Redshirts (Italy)|Italian 'Redshirts']] fighters). Thus the club's official colours were established. Forest's first ever official game was played against [[Notts County]] taking place on 22 March 1866.<ref name=nffchist>{{cite web|url=https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/club/history-landing-page/history-of-nffc/|title=History of NFFC |publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C.}}</ref>\n\nIn their early years Forest were a [[multi-sports club]].

In [[1886 in football (soccer)|1886]], Forest donated a set of football kits to help Arsenal establish themselves \u2013 the North London team still wear red. Forest also donated shirts to Everton and helped secure a site to play on for Brighton.\n\nIn 1878\u201379 season Forest entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time. Forest beat Notts County 3\u20131 in the first round at Beeston Cricket Ground before eventually losing 2\u20131 to Old Etonians in the semi-final.<ref name=nffchist/>\n\nForest's application was rejected to join the [[Football League]] at its formation in 1888.<ref name=nffchist/> Forest instead joined the [[Football Alliance]] in [[1889 in football (soccer)|1889]].\n\nThey won the competition in [[1892 in football (soccer)|1892]] before then entering the [[Football League]].<ref name=\"nffchist\" /> That season they reached and lost in an FA Cup semi-final for the fourth time to date. This time it was to [[West Bromwich Albion]] after a replay.\n\n[[File:1898team.jpg|thumb|right|The 1898 Cup-winning squad]]\nForest's first FA Cup semi-final win was at the fifth attempt, the [[1897\u201398 FA Cup]] 2\u20130 replay win against Southampton.

They finished fourth in the [[1900\u201301 Football League]] followed with fifth place the season after. The club then started to slide down the table. Forest were relegated for the first time in 1905\u201306. [[Grenville Morris]] had his first of five seasons as the club's highest scorer en route to becoming the all-time club highest goalscorer with 213 goals.\n\nPromotion as champions was immediate in 1906\u201307. They were relegated a second time to the Second Division in 1911 and had to seek re-election in 1914 after finishing bottom of that tier. As [[World War One]] approached they were in serious financial trouble. The outbreak of The Great War along with the benevolence of the committee members mitigated the club going under.<ref name=nffchist/>\n\nIn 1919, the [[Football League First Division]] was to be expanded from twenty clubs to twenty-two in time for the [[1919\u201320 Football League]]: Forest were one of eight clubs to campaign for entry but received only three votes.

They survived each of the first two seasons back in the top flight by one position. In the third season after promotion they were relegated as the division's bottom club in 1924\u201325.

Forest had been on top until that point. Luton though gradually took control of the match with [[Dave Pacey]] scoring midway through the second half.

At this time, clubs identified themselves more by their headgear than their shirts and a dozen red caps with tassels were duly purchased, making Forest the first club to 'officially' wear red, a colour that has since been adopted by a significant number of others. Forest is the reason behind [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s choice of red, having donated a full set of red kits following Arsenal's foundation in 1886.

Prior to moving to the City Ground, Forest played their home games at [[Forest Recreation Ground]], then [[Trent Bridge]], and finally the purpose-built [[Town Ground (Nottingham)|Town Ground]]. Since 1994 the City Ground has been all-seater, a preparation that was made in time for the ground to be a venue for [[Euro 96]], and currently has a capacity of 30,445.\n\nThe City Ground is 300 yards away from [[Notts County Football Club|Notts County's]] [[Meadow Lane]] stadium on the opposite side of the Trent, meaning the two grounds are the closest professional football stadia geographically in England. In 1898 the City Ground was within the boundaries of [[Nottingham]], which had been given [[city status in the UK|city status]] the year before and gave rise to the name of the stadium, however a boundary change in the 1950s means that the City Ground now stands just outside of the city's boundaries in the town of West Bridgford.\n\nOn 28 February 2019 Nottingham Forest announced plans to redevelop the City Ground and surrounding area, including the \"creation of a new, world-class Peter Taylor Stand\". It is expected this will increase the capacity of the stadium to 38,000, making it the largest football stadium in the [[East Midlands]]. The club are hopeful that building work can begin at the end of the [[2019-20 Nottingham Forest F.C. season|2019-20 season]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Major stadium redevelopment to go ahead at Nottingham Forest|url=https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/2019/february/major-stadium-redevelopment-to-go-ahead-at-nottingham-forest/|publisher=Nottingham Forest Football Club|date=28 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Ground history ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#d00; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"|Period\n! style=\"background:#d00; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"|Ground\n! style=\"background:#d00; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"|Location\n|-\n|1865 \u2013 1878\n| [[Forest Recreation Ground]]\n|Gregory Boulevard\n|-\n|1879 \u2013 1880\n|[[Castle Ground]] \n|The Meadows\n|-\n|1880 \u2013 1882\n|[[Trent Bridge Cricket Ground]]\n|West Bridgford\n|-\n|1882 \u2013 1885 \n|[[Parkside Ground (Nottingham)|Parkside Ground]]\n|Derby Road\n|-\n|1885 \u2013 1890\n|[[Gregory Ground (Nottingham)|Gregory Ground]]\n|Lenton Boulevard\n|-\n|1890 \u2013 1898\n|[[Town Ground (Nottingham)|Town Ground]]\n|The Meadows\n|-\n|1898 \u2013\n|[[City Ground]]\n|West Bridgford\n|-\n|}\n\n==Local rivals, derbies and supporters==\n{{main|Nottingham derby|Derby County F.C.\u2013Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry{{!}}East Midlands derby|Leicester City F.C.\u2013Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry}}\nWhilst [[Notts County]] is the closest professional football club geographically, Forest have remained at least one division higher since the 1994\u201395 season and the club's fiercest rivalry is with Derby County, located 14 miles away.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballpools.com/football-fever/rivalries-11to15.html |title=Positions 11 \u2013 15 &#124; Football Rivalries Report 2008 |publisher=Footballpools.com |accessdate=24 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427101741/http://www.footballpools.com/football-fever/rivalries-11to15.html |archivedate=27 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The two clubs contest the [[Derby County F.C.\u2013Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry|East Midlands derby]], a fixture which has taken on even greater significance since the inception of the [[Brian Clough Trophy]] in 2007.\n[[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] are Forest's other East Midlands rival due to the close proximity of the two cities.\n\nForest's other regional rival is [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], based in the neighbouring county of [[South Yorkshire]], a rivalry which has roots in the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|UK miners' strike of 1984\u201385]] when the miners of South Yorkshire walked out on long strikes but some Nottinghamshire miners, who insisted on holding a ballot, continued to work.

Founded in 1865, Forest are now considered the oldest [[English football league system|football league]] club in England after the relegation of [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] to the [[National League (English football)|National League]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/efl-confirm-nottingham-forest-now-2850883|title=Forest are now League's oldest club, not Stoke|last=Leach|first=Tom|date=2019-05-09|website=nottinghampost|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> Since 1898 Forest have played their home matches at the [[City Ground]]. They currently compete in the [[EFL Championship]], the second tier of the [[English football league system]].\n\nForest have won one [[List of English football champions|League title]], two [[FA Cup]]s, four [[Football League Cup|League Cups]], one [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]], two [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]], and one [[UEFA Super Cup]]. The club has competed in the top two tiers of English football since their admission to the Football League, except for five seasons spent in the third tier. Their most successful period was under the management of [[Brian Clough]] and [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nIn Clough's last decade at the club, Forest won the [[1989 Football League Cup Final|1989]] and [[1990 Football League Cup Final|1990]] League Cups and were losing finalists in the [[1991 FA Cup Final]], before relegation from the [[Premier League]] in [[1992\u201393 Premier League|1993]]. Upon an immediate return Forest finished third in the Premier League in [[1994\u201395 Premier League|1995]], before the club suffered relegation again in [[1996\u201397 Premier League|1997]] and, after a brief return, once more in [[1998\u201399 Premier League|1999]]. Forest have not been back in the Premier League since.\n\nForest contest the [[Nottingham derby]] with city rivals Notts County, however as Forest have predominantly played in higher leagues than their neighbours fixtures between the two clubs have been rare in recent history. As such their main rivalry is with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], and matches between the two clubs are known as the [[Derby County F.C.\u2013Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry|East Midlands derby]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Nottingham Forest F.C.}}\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1865 a group of [[shinty]] players met at the Clinton Arms on Nottingham's Shakespeare Street. J. S. Scrimshaw's proposal to play association football instead was agreed and Nottingham Forest Football Club was formed.

In 1898 the City Ground was within the boundaries of [[Nottingham]], which had been given [[city status in the UK|city status]] the year before and gave rise to the name of the stadium, however a boundary change in the 1950s means that the City Ground now stands just outside of the city's boundaries in the town of West Bridgford.\n\nOn 28 February 2019 Nottingham Forest announced plans to redevelop the City Ground and surrounding area, including the \"creation of a new, world-class Peter Taylor Stand\". It is expected this will increase the capacity of the stadium to 38,000, making it the largest football stadium in the [[East Midlands]]. The club are hopeful that building work can begin at the end of the [[2019-20 Nottingham Forest F.C. season|2019-20 season]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Major stadium redevelopment to go ahead at Nottingham Forest|url=https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/2019/february/major-stadium-redevelopment-to-go-ahead-at-nottingham-forest/|publisher=Nottingham Forest Football Club|date=28 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Ground history ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#d00; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"|Period\n! style=\"background:#d00; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"|Ground\n! style=\"background:#d00; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"|Location\n|-\n|1865 \u2013 1878\n| [[Forest Recreation Ground]]\n|Gregory Boulevard\n|-\n|1879 \u2013 1880\n|[[Castle Ground]] \n|The Meadows\n|-\n|1880 \u2013 1882\n|[[Trent Bridge Cricket Ground]]\n|West Bridgford\n|-\n|1882 \u2013 1885 \n|[[Parkside Ground (Nottingham)|Parkside Ground]]\n|Derby Road\n|-\n|1885 \u2013 1890\n|[[Gregory Ground (Nottingham)|Gregory Ground]]\n|Lenton Boulevard\n|-\n|1890 \u2013 1898\n|[[Town Ground (Nottingham)|Town Ground]]\n|The Meadows\n|-\n|1898 \u2013\n|[[City Ground]]\n|West Bridgford\n|-\n|}\n\n==Local rivals, derbies and supporters==\n{{main|Nottingham derby|Derby County F.C.\u2013Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry{{!}}East Midlands derby|Leicester City F.C.\u2013Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry}}\nWhilst [[Notts County]] is the closest professional football club geographically, Forest have remained at least one division higher since the 1994\u201395 season and the club's fiercest rivalry is with Derby County, located 14 miles away.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballpools.com/football-fever/rivalries-11to15.html |title=Positions 11 \u2013 15 &#124; Football Rivalries Report 2008 |publisher=Footballpools.com |accessdate=24 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427101741/http://www.footballpools.com/football-fever/rivalries-11to15.html |archivedate=27 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The two clubs contest the [[Derby County F.C.\u2013Nottingham Forest F.C. rivalry|East Midlands derby]], a fixture which has taken on even greater significance since the inception of the [[Brian Clough Trophy]] in 2007.\n[[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] are Forest's other East Midlands rival due to the close proximity of the two cities.\n\nForest's other regional rival is [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], based in the neighbouring county of [[South Yorkshire]], a rivalry which has roots in the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|UK miners' strike of 1984\u201385]] when the miners of South Yorkshire walked out on long strikes but some Nottinghamshire miners, who insisted on holding a ballot, continued to work.

{"title_page": "History of Argentine nationality", "text_new": "{{History of Argentina}}\nIdeas and practices of nationality and citizenship in the Republic of [[Argentina]] (and before that, in the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] and the [[Inca]] Empire) have changed with distinct periods of its history, including but not limited to periods of indigenous, colonial, republican, and military rule. \n\nThese periods, in which political rights were often denied to both citizens and non-citizens, encouraged the development of resistance movements. This history of resistance and fighting for political rights is deeply imbedded in the modern Argentine notion of citizenship.\n\n== Inca nationality ==\nThe [[Inca]] Empire was a conglomeration of conquered ethnic groups - ''etn\u00edas'' - ruled by ethnic Inca from the Cuzco-Lake Titicaca Basin in what is now central Peru. They called their empire ''Tiwantinsuyu,'' meaning \"four corners.\" Modern northern and western Argentina was a part of Kollasuyu.<ref name=\"Daltroy\">D'Altroy, Terence N. ''The Incas.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003 (87-88).</ref> The Inca elite imposed their own institutions on conquered territories, while at the same time incorporating local customs on a case-by-case basis. Because the Argentine portion of Kollasuyu was on the edge of the empire the communities there had even more local autonomy than elsewhere in the empire, but were still subject to Inca protection and duties through the [[Mita (Inca)|mita]] system of reciprocity. At the same time, Inca statebuilding was based on the threat of violence.<ref>Morris, Craig. \u201cInka Strategies of Incorporation and Governance.\u201d In Archaic States, ed. Gary m. Feinman and Joycee Marcus, pp293-309. School of American Research, Santa Fe, New Mexico.</ref> \nThis interplay of threat and promise, combined with the ethnic diversity of the conquered groups, created an Inca citizenship that was not ethnic but territorial and administrative, and based on a reciprocal relationship of rights and duties. Though citizens were ultimately loyal to their particular ''etn\u00edas'' and communities ([[ayllu]]s), the Inca Empire's formal structures were a clear and unifying presence, even at its edges.\n\n===Mita===\n{{Main|Mita (Inca)}}\nThe Inca state functioned through a complex system of labour extraction and tribute which consolidated their power over conquered regions. This tribute always took the form of people and their time, and was couched in kinship terms.\nCensuses were conducted using the [[quipu]], and individual ethnic groups were assigned unique goods and public services to provide as their tax. In return, citizens received immediate rewards (like feasts), as well as the promise that their [[ayllu]]s would be provided  protection from enemies and food if, for example, their harvests failed.<ref>D'Altroy, 268/280.</ref>\n\n===Other expressions of Inca presence===\n* The spoken language of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] was the official spoken language of all governance (the Inca had no written language), and became a symbol of Inca presence through contact with officials and the renaming of local landmarks.<ref>D'Altroy, 47-48.</ref>\n* Imperial, administrative titles were given to local officials and ethnic/[[ayllu]] leaders, thus incorporating them into the empire's broader, administrative structure.<ref>D'Altroy, 177.</ref>\n* As mentioned, the Inca conducted detailed censuses using the [[quipu]]. Inclusion on the census made one, officially, an Inca subject.<ref>D'Altroy, 234-235.</ref>\n* The Inca resettled conquered peoples for a variety of administrative reasons. Often, the moving of these ''mitmaqkuna'' settlers was purely an expression of power over newly conquered subjects.<ref>D'Altroy, 248.</ref>\n\n== Colonisation and the Viceroyalty ==\nAfter being colonised by the Spanish, Argentina was made part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. In 1776 it became part of the new, and ultimately short-lived, [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]]. Throughout Spanish America, citizenship was both a legal and a social status that was implicit rather than formal, and largely informed by one's racial and class background. As in the Inca Empire, the colonising power's concepts were combined with the unique dictates of the situation in the colony itself.\n\n===Vecindad===\n{{Main|Vecino}}\n''Vecino'' was the blanket term for community member in Spain and colonial and independent Spanish America, and is rather more extensive than the modern \"citizen\", implying ownership of property and respectability. The criteria for being a ''vecino'' were never defined in legislation, but rather conceived of as a natural, general rule.<ref>Herzog, Tamar. ''Defining Nations: Immigrants and Citizens in Early Modern Spain and Spanish America.\" New Haven & London: Yale University Press, 2003, p. 7.</ref> It is a nuanced, personal status directly related to a person's standing within the community. Shaped by the conditions in the colony, the term took on a broader meaning in the Americas than it had in Spain itself, where citizenship and nationality were not concerns for most, and where the racial makeup was more homogenous.\n\n===Naturaleza===\n''Naturaleza,'' meaning \"naturaleness\" or \"nativeness,\" was a second term for citizenship in Spain and Spanish America. It usually applied to \"natives of the kingdoms of Spain,\" and was more closely linked to the Crown and subjecthood.<ref>Herzog, \"Defining Nations,\" 8.</ref> Like ''vecindad,'' ''naturaleza'' was never clearly defined in the law, and took on a broader meaning than in Spain itself.\n\n=== Casta system ===\nThe [[Casta]] system of racial classification was the foundation of social order, and thus rights, throughout Spanish America.\n\n[[Peninsulares]], [[Criollo (people)]]s, ''Indios'', and the growing group of mixed-race inhabitants (usually [[mestizos]]) all had different citizenship rights. ''Peninsulares'' had the full rights and privileges of ''naturaleza,'' and were the most esteemed in society and therefore were the ideal ''vecinos.'' ''Criollos'' were the most common in Buenos Aires, and were ''naturales'' and ''vecinos'' too, though with an implicitly lower status. ''Indios'' and ''mestizos'' were, initially, excluded from citizenship status entirely.<ref>Herzog, \"Defining Nations,\" 54.</ref>\n\n=== Immigration and the foreigner ===\nThe presence of non-Spanish Europeans in the Viceroyalties of Peru and Rio de La Plata was, officially, illegal. Though \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d were not explicitly defined in the viceroyalties, Spanish law did differentiate between the two by granting privileges only to those considered members of the community. Because the concept of \u2018community\u2019 itself was poorly, if at all defined, non-members were deemed to be so on a case-by-case basis, based on community opinion and, where available, on precedent.\nIn order to become a member of the community, an outsider usually needed to prove that he was born in the territory, and culturally Spanish (Spanish speaking and writing, Catholic, etc.). In this way Spanish America tended towards jus soli (right by birthplace). Foreigners could apply to the ''audiencia'' for a license to remain in the viceroyalty, or they could apply to the Crown (through the [[Council of the Indies]]  for naturalization. The former did not grant the foreigner any rights, while the latter ''carta de naturaleza'' granted most rights afforded to other members (with some exceptions, including the right to own and operate a business).\nObtaining the  ''carta de naturaleza'' was a lengthier process requiring more proof of cultural Spanishness, and usually a monetary payment to a Crown office or official. It was considered a personal grant, and therefore a personal relationship with a Crown official was invaluable.\n<ref>Herzog, Tamar. \u201c\u2019A Stranger in a Strange Land\u2019: The Conversion of Foreigners into Members in Colonial Latin America,\u201d in ''Constructing collective identities and shaping public spheres: Latin American paths.'' Portland: Sussex Academic Press, 1998, pp.45-65.</ref>\n\n===Early Buenos Aires===\nColonial [[Buenos Aires]] was a relatively small frontier settlement threatened by the indigenous and Portuguese presence in the area, which gave the city's residents an especially acute sense of their Spanishness. To this end, city officials only allowed \"natives of the kingdoms of Spain\" (''naturales'') to become citizens. Only foreigners who could provide a useful service to the city and who were considered culturally Spanish were granted the status. These individuals were almost always of non-Spanish European ancestry, and where rarely (if ever) indigenous or African.<ref>Herzog, \"Defining Nations,\" 49-50.</ref> \nIn the 1610s, an oath for citizenship candidates was created that required them to possess a house and arms; however, the number of applicants dropped in subsequent years and the oath fell out of use.<ref>Herzog, \"Defining Nations,\" 50.</ref>\n\n===The Indians===\nBy the eighteenth century, Indians were receiving citizenship statuses of their own. Initially classified as members of indigenous communities by birth, this status helped determine their labour ([[repartimiento]]) and taxation (''tributo'') duties to the Crown.  Still, the terms ''vecino'' and ''naturaleza'' were never officially applied.<ref>Herzog, \"Defining Nations,\" 61.</ref>\n\n===Criollo versus Peninsular===\nThe implicit valuing of ''peninsulares'' over ''criollos'' in Spanish America was a key point of contention in the debates over independence, particularly in the highly-literate city of Buenos Aires. Though they legally belonged to the same kingdom as ''naturalezas'', only ''criollos'' had been born in the Americas (as ''vecinos''), and thus felt that they had a unique claim to the land, its administration, and the rights that would follow.<ref>Herzog, \"Defining Nations,\" 148-149.</ref>\n\n== Independence  and the new Republic ==\nThe Independence movement in Argentina was primarily ''criollo'' movement, and thus the citizenship laws made in its aftermath primarily affected the ''criollo'' population.\n( A notable exception: The [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII]], or Assembly of 1813, precursed the official [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]] in July 1816, but is the republic's first attempt at a constitution. Though the delegates could not agree on many major points, [[Freedom of Wombs]] was declared, giving freedom and citizenship to slaves' children born within the territory. It also states that the Argentine Indians were ruled by the Pampas in the 1800s.)\n\n=== Generation of 1830 ===\nLed by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], and [[Esteban Echeverria]] in response to the [[Juan Manuel de Rosas|Rosas]] administration, the Generation of 1830 proposed a new, modern Argentina built on economic partnerships with Europe and European immigrants. Sarmiento's \u201ccivilization or barbarism\u201d and Alberdi's \u201ccivil liberty for all, political liberty for a few\u201d and \"to rule is to populate\" characterize the society they envisioned \u2013 one of order and progress, in which those qualified to run the state were men of European intellectual tradition.<ref>Spektorowski, Alberto. \u201cCollective Identity and Democratic Construction: The Cases of Argentina and Uruguay,\u201d in ''Constructing collective identities and shaping public spheres: Latin American paths''. Portland: Sussex Academic Press, 1998, pp. 103-122.</ref> This more elitist approach to governance effectively proposed two tiers of citizenship.\n\n=== Exclusion in the \u201cNew Country\u201d ===\nNo matter how close economic and cultural ties were (or were desired to be) with Europe, political discourse in the mid-nineteenth century up to Peronism after the Second World War made Europeans the counterpoint \u201cother\u201d to Argentine collective identity. Argentina was developing on the same economically liberal  model as European powers (particularly Spain, Britain, and France), but improving on it.<ref>Waisman, Carlos H. \u201cThe Dynamics of National Identity Frames,\u201d in ''Constructing collective identities and shaping public spheres: Latin American paths''. Portland: Sussex Academic Press, 1998, pp. 147-167.</ref>\n\n=== Constitution of 1853 ===\nThe [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]], the new republic's first constitution, does not contain any explicit references to citizenship, though as a product of its framers liberal thought it is very universalist in spirit, speaking of broad, universal rights that apply to all men. This contrasts with the practice of ''vecindad'', which is by nature individual and nuanced.\n\n==Immigration in the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries==\n{{See also|Immigration to Argentina}}\n\nThe Constitution of 1853 did include a clause regarding immigration: \n\n{{quote|The Federal Government shall foster European immigration; and may not restrict, limit or burden with any tax whatsoever, the entry into the Argentine territory of foreigners who arrive for the purpose of tilling the soil, improving industries, and introducing and teaching arts and sciences.|<ref>Section 25, Constitution of the Argentine Nation, {{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129222250/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-29 }}.</ref>}}\n\nThis clause reflects the Generation of 1830's immigration policies. European immigrants, particularly those from developed Northern European countries, were meant to have a civilizing and modernizing effect on Argentine society, and to forge a new Argentine identity based on hard work, merit, and economic progress.\n\n===Populating the Interior===\nAlong with changing the demographic makeup of the country by increasing the number of Europeans, the immigration drives of the nineteenth and early twentieth century were meant to populate the Argentine interior which was, to this point{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}, largely undeveloped.\n\nThese two aims - Europeanization and population of the interior - combined in the [[Conquest of the Desert]], where the remaining indigenous groups of the [[pampas]], [[Andes]] valleys, and [[Patagonia]] were driven out or killed to make room for immigrant farmers. The indigenous were considered a problem, and not true Argentines in the new vision, and therefore had no citizenship rights in the first place.\n\n===Immigration Law===\n* ''Ley de Desembarco'' (Law of Disembarkment), 1872 \u2013 Containing the first legal definition of \u2018immigrant,\u2019 the law allowed inspection of ships to prevent the entry of those ill or otherwise unable to work. The bill did not pass the Committee on Legislation, but was reworked and included in an 1876 law after an outbreak of yellow fever on an immigrant ship spread throughout Buenos Aires.<ref>Castro, Donald S. The Development and Politics of Argentine Immigration Policy 1852-1914: To Govern Is To Populate. San Francisco: Mellen Research University Press, 1991: 80-81.</ref>\n*''Ley de Residencia'' (Law of Residence), 1902 - Legalised the expulsion of immigrants who \"compromise national security or disturb public order.\"\n*''Ley de Seguridad Social'' (Law of Social Security), 1910 \u2013 This law provided for the expulsion of anarchists and persons convicted of capital crimes in Argentina. It was also established for ship captains who allowed passengers to violate the law. It represents a further backlash against the immigration population.<ref>Castro, 250-251.</ref> Membership in the Argentine nation was still contingent on being useful to it.\n\n== Per\u00f3n and a new collective identity==\n[[Juan Peron|Juan Per\u00f3n]]\u2019s populist, participatory government encouraged a greater link between subject and state. His vision was inclusive and collective, based on the idea that all of Argentina needed to be involved in the project of national development. Ethnic, racial, or other national identities were made secondary to the new collective Argentine identity. He was the first to frame Argentine citizenship in terms of political rights, rather than community membership.<ref>Senkman, Leonardo. \u201cThe Transformation of Collective Identities: Immigrant Communities under the Populist Regimes Vargas and Peron,\u201d in ''Constructing collective identities and shaping public spheres: Latin American paths''. Portland: Sussex Academic Press, 1998, pp. 123-145.</ref>\n\n===Enfranchisement and political participation===\nPeron, with the influence of his wife [[Eva Peron]] (Evita), officially enfranchised women and involved the lower classes, particularly workers, in national politics for the first time. Through their social welfare programs, Peron and Evita became father and mother figures for the Argentine masses, building a collective national identity instead of a country of sovereign individuals.<ref>Taylor, Lucy. Citizenship, Participation and Democracy: Changing Dynamics in Chile and Argentina. New York: St Martin\u2019s Press, 1998: 35.</ref>\n\n===Building the collective identity===\nPeron built his new Argentine identity around its Hispanic and creole roots and the concept of the ''Madre Patria'' (motherland) to which one is always, and ultimately, loyal. Later, this Hispanic tradition was replaced by a Latin one in order to incorporate the large Italian immigrant community. Public holidays like the \u2018\u2019D\u00eda de la Raza\u2019\u2019 and new school textbooks glorified the conquest.\n\nHe also encouraged immigrant and minority groups, especially Jews, to participate in public life through labour unions, officially recognized cultural associations and wings of political parties.<ref>Senkman, 123-145.</ref>\n\nPeron's initially successful economic policy of [[Import substitution industrialization]] (ISI) also fostered national pride and a sense of independence.\n\n== Guerra Sucia and Military Rule==\nThe military juntas and the [[Dirty War|Guerra Sucia]] which followed Peron were exceptionally repressive, and the systematic targeting of ordinary citizens created a climate of fear and silence that was the opposite of the mass political participation of the Peron era. Still, they too built their governments around concepts of Argentine identity. The juntas attacked Peronism as a threat to the true capitalist Argentine values, conceiving a more, individualist, and exclusive model of citizenship<ref>Taylor, 44.</ref> in which only the qualified had the right to rule, and all others must trust their decisions. The collective Argentine identity was replaced with a more individualist, favour-based model, where the citizen's role was in service of the state rather than vice versa<ref>Taylor, 35 & 45.</ref>\n\n===Social movements===\nThough freedom of expression was nonexistent under the juntas and dissent was a punishable offence, a strong social movement grew out of the military rule. Though each group had its own concerns, most used the rhetoric of citizenship to fight for a return of their political rights. These human rights groups were eventually joined by women's groups and trade unions in early 1982, beginning the return to democracy and civilian rule.<ref>Taylor, 50-51</ref> By voicing their concerns in terms of citizenship rights, the dissent movement refashioned the model of the Argentine citizen into one of an active participator with high expectations, willing to make demands of his or her government.\n\n== Present day ==\nPresent day Argentine citizenship law is derived, in the most part, from the National Constitution. Until recently, in 1994, the document did not contain any definition of citizenship and the related rights; instead, clauses were worded in terms of \"residents\" and \"the people.\" The 'New Rights and Guarantees' section added in 1994 was a reaction to authoritarian rule, and clearly regulates Argentine political rights; however, the Constitution still does not contain a definition of citizenship itself.\n\n=== Relevant sections of the Constitution ===\n{{quote|The citizens of each province shall be entitled to all rights, privileges, and immunities inherent in the condition of citizen in the other provinces...|<ref name=\"Constitution\">Constitution of the Argentine Nation, {{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129222250/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-29 }}.</ref>}}\nIn this way, Argentina's federal system uses a version of the principle of [[comity]] to uphold provinces' rights, while still maintaining that Argentine citizenship is a national, pan-provincial status.\n{{quote|All the inhabitants of the Nation have the following rights according to the laws that rule their enforcement; namely: to work and run any legal industry; sell and trade; demand authorities; get in, stay, traverse and go out of the Argentine territory; make ideas public through the press with no prior censorship; use and dictate about own real estate; entire into associations with meaningful purposes; practice religion freely; teach and learn.|<ref name=\"Constitution\"/>}}\n*'''Section 14bis''' also includes a provision granting the benefits of social security, \"which shall be of an integral nature and may not be waived.\"<ref name=\"Constitution\"/>\nArgentina extends its civil rights to \"all inhabitants\" of the Nation, not just those with full citizenship status. (see \"section 20\" below) This provision was added in 1957, with the state taking responsibility for its inhabitants' well-being.<ref>Taylor, 65.</ref>\n{{quote|The Argentine Nation admits neither blood nor birth prerogatives: there are neither personal privileges nor titles of nobility. All its inhabitants are equal before the law, and admissible to employment without any other requirement than their ability. Equality is the basis of taxation and public burdens.|<ref name=\"Constitution\"/>}}\nThis section is a reaction to Spanish colonial rule, under which an individual's legal and practical rights were determined by their blood (both in terms of race and nobility).\nThe stipulation that \"equality is the basis of taxation and public burdens\" reflects that, in practice, Argentine citizenship flows from both rights and duties.\n{{quote|Foreigners enjoy within the territory of the Nation all the civil rights of citizens... They are not obliged to accept citizenship nor to pay extraordinary compulsory taxes. They may obtain naturalization papers residing two uninterrupted years in the Nation; but the authorities may shorten this term in favor of those so requesting it, alleging and proving services rendered to the Republic.<ref name=\"Constitution\"/>}}\n{{quote|Suffrage shall be universal, equal, secret and compulsory...}}\n\n=== Citizenship ===\nThe valid laws governing citizenship (Ley 346, Ley 23.059, and Decreto 3.213/84) set forth very simple requirements:\n\n(1) to be 18 years old;\n\n(2) to have been living in Argentina for 2 years; and\n\n(3) to apply for citizenship before a federal judge.\n\nAnd it can be denied if you:\n\n(1) have been in jail for more than 3 year in the last 5 years;\n\n(2) are under criminal prosecution;\n\n(3) do not have an honest way of income. To work without a legal permit is considered an honest way of living.\n\nDue to the fact that the citizenship law has existed unchanged since 1869 in its present form, the Supreme Court have issued many precedents on which there is a solution to almost every immigration situation an immigrant might face. Citizenship has been granted to immigrants who lacked legal residency or entered the country illegally, or even to immigrants with criminal records in exceptional cases.\n\nRecently, the Federal Chamber of Parana established that illegals doesn't exist in Argentina. Illegality is regarding actions that violates the criminal law. The violation of the immigration law is a simple administrative issue that can be healed applying for residency or citizenship.\n\nThe continuous 2 years means that you have your home in this country. Foreigners have the same civil rights than Argentines, among others, to travel. It means that the continuity of the 2 years doesn't mean that the solicitant cannot leave the country.\n\nFor historic reasons, federal courts are still reluctant to recognize the rights of \u00a8irregular\u00a8 immigrants, They usually request the following requirements related to the abolished law 21.795 (enacted in 1978 by Dictator Jorge Rafael Videla, was abolished in 1984 and Law 346 re-enacted):\n\n(1) Legal residency (2) Legal work (3) That you speak, read and write Spanish (4) That you renounce your native citizenship (5) DNI with permanent residency (6) Birth certificate apostilled and translated by public notary (7) Certificate of a clean criminal record from your home country (8) Certificate of a clean criminal record in Argentina (9) CUIT or CUIL number\n\n=== Documento Nacional de Identidad ===\nThe DNI is Argentina's Documento Nacional de Identidad, or National Identity Document. It is a small book of personal information that includes a unique number, used to obtain social services, to vote, in renting, opening bank accounts, etc.<ref>[http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/renaper/instructivo_nacionales.asp \"Instructivos par documentaci\u00f3n\" Ministerio del Interior] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022031600/http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/renaper/instructivo_nacionales.asp |date=2007-10-22 }} {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nNew residents are legally required to obtain a DNI within 90 days of arrival.<ref>\"To reside in Argentina,\" {{cite web |url=http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/renaper/instructivo_nacionales.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022031600/http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/renaper/instructivo_nacionales.asp |archivedate=2007-10-22 }}</ref>\n\n=== Elections ===\nAs mentioned in Section 37, Argentina enforces [[compulsory voting]] - it is both a right and a duty.\n\nThough non-citizens cannot vote in federal elections, some provinces allow non-citizen residents (those with DNIs) to vote in provincial and/or municipal elections:<ref>[http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/elecciones/electores/voto_ce.asp Direcci\u00f3n Nacional Electoral, Electores] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024144157/http://www.mininterior.gov.ar/elecciones/electores/voto_ce.asp |date=2007-10-24 }} {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n*[[Buenos Aires (province)]] - provincial and municipal\n*[[Buenos Aires]] (city)-  local only\n*[[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]] - municipal only, with DNI and four years' residence in Catamarca and having registered with the municipal authorities as a foreign voter\n*[[Misiones]] - provincial and municipal, having registered specially with and obtained a voters' card from the provincial authorities\n*[[Neuqu\u00e9n]] - provincial and municipal, having registered specially with provincial authorities\n*[[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] - municipal intendents and councilpersons only, having registered specially with municipal and provincial authorities\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Pre-Columbian]] America\n*[[Demographics of Argentina]]\n*[[Immigration to Argentina]]\n*[[History of the Jews in Argentina]]\n*[[Afro Argentine]]\n*[[Welsh settlement in Argentina]]\n*[[Asian-Argentines]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Argentine Nationality}}\n[[Category:History of nationality|Argentine]]\n[[Category:Social history of Argentina]]\n", "text_old": "{{History of Argentina}}\nIdeas and practices of nationality and citizenship in the Republic of [[Argentina]] (and before that, in the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] and the [[Inca]] Empire) have changed with distinct periods of its history, including but not limited to periods of indigenous, colonial, republican, and military rule. \n\nThese periods, in which political rights were often denied to both citizens and non-citizens, encouraged the development of resistance movements. This history of resistance and fighting for political rights is deeply imbedded in the modern Argentine notion of citizenship.\n\n== Inca nationality ==\nThe [[Inca]] Empire was a conglomeration of conquered ethnic groups - ''etn\u00edas'' - ruled by ethnic Inca from the Cuzco-Lake Titicaca Basin in what is now central Peru. They called their empire ''Tiwantinsuyu,'' meaning \"four corners.\" Modern northern and western Argentina was a part of Kollasuyu.<ref name=\"Daltroy\">D'Altroy, Terence N. ''The Incas.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003 (87-88).</ref> The Inca elite imposed their own institutions on conquered territories, while at the same time incorporating local customs on a case-by-case basis. Because the Argentine portion of Kollasuyu was on the edge of the empire the communities there had even more local autonomy than elsewhere in the empire, but were still subject to Inca protection and duties through the [[Mita (Inca)|mita]] system of reciprocity. At the same time, Inca statebuilding was based on the threat of violence.<ref>Morris, Craig. \u201cInka Strategies of Incorporation and Governance.\u201d In Archaic States, ed. Gary m. Feinman and Joycee Marcus, pp293-309. School of American Research, Santa Fe, New Mexico.</ref> \nThis interplay of threat and promise, combined with the ethnic diversity of the conquered groups, created an Inca citizenship that was not ethnic but territorial and administrative, and based on a reciprocal relationship of rights and duties. Though citizens were ultimately loyal to their particular ''etn\u00edas'' and communities ([[ayllu]]s), the Inca Empire's formal structures were a clear and unifying presence, even at its edges.\n\n===Mita===\n{{Main|Mita (Inca)}}\nThe Inca state functioned through a complex system of labour extraction and tribute which consolidated their power over conquered regions. This tribute always took the form of people and their time, and was couched in kinship terms.\nCensuses were conducted using the [[quipu]], and individual ethnic groups were assigned unique goods and public services to provide as their tax. In return, citizens received immediate rewards (like feasts), as well as the promise that their [[ayllu]]s would be provided  protection from enemies and food if, for example, their harvests failed.<ref>D'Altroy, 268/280.</ref>\n\n===Other expressions of Inca presence===\n* The spoken language of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] was the official spoken language of all governance (the Inca had no written language), and became a symbol of Inca presence through contact with officials and the renaming of local landmarks.<ref>D'Altroy, 47-48.</ref>\n* Imperial, administrative titles were given to local officials and ethnic/[[ayllu]] leaders, thus incorporating them into the empire's broader, administrative structure.<ref>D'Altroy, 177.</ref>\n* As mentioned, the Inca conducted detailed censuses using the [[quipu]]. Inclusion on the census made one, officially, an Inca subject.<ref>D'Altroy, 234-235.</ref>\n* The Inca resettled conquered peoples for a variety of administrative reasons. Often, the moving of these ''mitmaqkuna'' settlers was purely an expression of power over newly conquered subjects.<ref>D'Altroy, 248.</ref>\n\n== Colonisation and the Viceroyalty ==\nAfter being colonised by the Spanish, Argentina was made part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. In 1776 it became part of the new, and ultimately short-lived, [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]]. Throughout Spanish America, citizenship was both a legal and a social status that was implicit rather than formal, and largely informed by one's racial and class background. As in the Inca Empire, the colonising power's concepts were combined with the unique dictates of the situation in the colony itself.\n\n===Vecindad===\n{{Main|Vecino}}\n''Vecino'' was the blanket term for community member in Spain and colonial and independent Spanish America, and is rather more extensive than the modern \"citizen\", implying ownership of property and respectability. The criteria for being a ''vecino'' were never defined in legislation, but rather conceived of as a natural, general rule.<ref>Herzog, Tamar.

Though they legally belonged to the same kingdom as ''naturalezas'', only ''criollos'' had been born in the Americas (as ''vecinos''), and thus felt that they had a unique claim to the land, its administration, and the rights that would follow.<ref>Herzog, \"Defining Nations,\" 148-149.</ref>\n\n== Independence  and the new Republic ==\nThe Independence movement in Argentina was primarily ''criollo'' movement, and thus the citizenship laws made in its aftermath primarily affected the ''criollo'' population.\n( A notable exception: The [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII]], or Assembly of 1813, precursed the official [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]] in July 1816, but is the republic's first attempt at a constitution. Though the delegates could not agree on many major points, [[Freedom of Wombs]] was declared, giving freedom and citizenship to slaves' children born within the territory. It also states that the Argentine Indians were ruled by the Pampas in the 1800s.)\n\n=== Generation of 1830 ===\nLed by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], and [[Esteban Echeverria]] in response to the [[Juan Manuel de Rosas|Rosas]] administration, the Generation of 1830 proposed a new, modern Argentina built on economic partnerships with Europe and European immigrants. Sarmiento\u2019s \u201ccivilization or barbarism\u201d and Alberdi\u2019s \u201ccivil liberty for all, political liberty for a few\u201d and \"to rule is to populate\" characterize the society they envisioned \u2013 one of order and progress, in which those qualified to run the state were men of European intellectual tradition.<ref>Spektorowski, Alberto. \u201cCollective Identity and Democratic Construction: The Cases of Argentina and Uruguay,\u201d in ''Constructing collective identities and shaping public spheres: Latin American paths''. Portland: Sussex Academic Press, 1998, pp. 103-122.</ref> This more elitist approach to governance effectively proposed two tiers of citizenship.\n\n=== Exclusion in the \u201cNew Country\u201d ===\nNo matter how close economic and cultural ties were (or were desired to be) with Europe, political discourse in the mid-nineteenth century up to Peronism after the Second World War made Europeans the counterpoint \u201cother\u201d to Argentine collective identity. Argentina was developing on the same economically liberal  model as European powers (particularly Spain, Britain, and France), but improving on it.<ref>Waisman, Carlos H. \u201cThe Dynamics of National Identity Frames,\u201d in ''Constructing collective identities and shaping public spheres: Latin American paths''. Portland: Sussex Academic Press, 1998, pp. 147-167.</ref>\n\n=== Constitution of 1853 ===\nThe [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]], the new republic's first constitution, does not contain any explicit references to citizenship, though as a product of its framers liberal thought it is very universalist in spirit, speaking of broad, universal rights that apply to all men. This contrasts with the practice of ''vecindad'', which is by nature individual and nuanced.\n\n==Immigration in the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries==\n{{See also|Immigration to Argentina}}\n\nThe Constitution of 1853 did include a clause regarding immigration: \n\n{{quote|The Federal Government shall foster European immigration; and may not restrict, limit or burden with any tax whatsoever, the entry into the Argentine territory of foreigners who arrive for the purpose of tilling the soil, improving industries, and introducing and teaching arts and sciences.|<ref>Section 25, Constitution of the Argentine Nation, {{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129222250/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-29 }}.</ref>}}\n\nThis clause reflects the Generation of 1830's immigration policies. European immigrants, particularly those from developed Northern European countries, were meant to have a civilizing and modernizing effect on Argentine society, and to forge a new Argentine identity based on hard work, merit, and economic progress.\n\n===Populating the Interior===\nAlong with changing the demographic makeup of the country by increasing the number of Europeans, the immigration drives of the nineteenth and early twentieth century were meant to populate the Argentine interior which was, to this point{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}, largely undeveloped.\n\nThese two aims - Europeanization and population of the interior - combined in the [[Conquest of the Desert]], where the remaining indigenous groups of the [[pampas]], [[Andes]] valleys, and [[Patagonia]] were driven out or killed to make room for immigrant farmers. The indigenous were considered a problem, and not true Argentines in the new vision, and therefore had no citizenship rights in the first place.\n\n===Immigration Law===\n* ''Ley de Desembarco'' (Law of Disembarkment), 1872 \u2013 Containing the first legal definition of \u2018immigrant,\u2019 the law allowed inspection of ships to prevent the entry of those ill or otherwise unable to work. The bill did not pass the Committee on Legislation, but was reworked and included in an 1876 law after an outbreak of yellow fever on an immigrant ship spread throughout Buenos Aires.<ref>Castro, Donald S. The Development and Politics of Argentine Immigration Policy 1852-1914: To Govern Is To Populate. San Francisco: Mellen Research University Press, 1991: 80-81.</ref>\n*''Ley de Residencia'' (Law of Residence), 1902 - Legalised the expulsion of immigrants who \"compromise national security or disturb public order.\"\n*''Ley de Seguridad Social'' (Law of Social Security), 1910 \u2013 This law provided for the expulsion of anarchists and persons convicted of capital crimes in Argentina. It was also established for ship captains who allowed passengers to violate the law. It represents a further backlash against the immigration population.<ref>Castro, 250-251.</ref> Membership in the Argentine nation was still contingent on being useful to it.\n\n== Per\u00f3n and a new collective identity==\n[[Juan Peron|Juan Per\u00f3n]]\u2019s populist, participatory government encouraged a greater link between subject and state. His vision was inclusive and collective, based on the idea that all of Argentina needed to be involved in the project of national development. Ethnic, racial, or other national identities were made secondary to the new collective Argentine identity. He was the first to frame Argentine citizenship in terms of political rights, rather than community membership.<ref>Senkman, Leonardo. \u201cThe Transformation of Collective Identities: Immigrant Communities under the Populist Regimes Vargas and Peron,\u201d in ''Constructing collective identities and shaping public spheres: Latin American paths''. Portland: Sussex Academic Press, 1998, pp. 123-145.</ref>\n\n===Enfranchisement and political participation===\nPeron, with the influence of his wife [[Eva Peron]] (Evita), officially enfranchised women and involved the lower classes, particularly workers, in national politics for the first time. Through their social welfare programs, Peron and Evita became father and mother figures for the Argentine masses, building a collective national identity instead of a country of sovereign individuals.<ref>Taylor, Lucy. Citizenship, Participation and Democracy: Changing Dynamics in Chile and Argentina. New York: St Martin\u2019s Press, 1998: 35.</ref>\n\n===Building the collective identity===\nPeron built his new Argentine identity around its Hispanic and creole roots and the concept of the ''Madre Patria'' (motherland) to which one is always, and ultimately, loyal. Later, this Hispanic tradition was replaced by a Latin one in order to incorporate the large Italian immigrant community. Public holidays like the \u2018\u2019D\u00eda de la Raza\u2019\u2019 and new school textbooks glorified the conquest.\n\nHe also encouraged immigrant and minority groups, especially Jews, to participate in public life through labour unions, officially recognized cultural associations and wings of political parties.<ref>Senkman, 123-145.</ref>\n\nPeron's initially successful economic policy of [[Import substitution industrialization]] (ISI) also fostered national pride and a sense of independence.\n\n== Guerra Sucia and Military Rule==\nThe military juntas and the [[Dirty War|Guerra Sucia]] which followed Peron were exceptionally repressive, and the systematic targeting of ordinary citizens created a climate of fear and silence that was the opposite of the mass political participation of the Peron era. Still, they too built their governments around concepts of Argentine identity. The juntas attacked Peronism as a threat to the true capitalist Argentine values, conceiving a more, individualist, and exclusive model of citizenship<ref>Taylor, 44.</ref> in which only the qualified had the right to rule, and all others must trust their decisions. The collective Argentine identity was replaced with a more individualist, favour-based model, where the citizen's role was in service of the state rather than vice versa<ref>Taylor, 35 & 45.</ref>\n\n===Social movements===\nThough freedom of expression was nonexistent under the juntas and dissent was a punishable offence, a strong social movement grew out of the military rule. Though each group had its own concerns, most used the rhetoric of citizenship to fight for a return of their political rights. These human rights groups were eventually joined by women's groups and trade unions in early 1982, beginning the return to democracy and civilian rule.<ref>Taylor, 50-51</ref> By voicing their concerns in terms of citizenship rights, the dissent movement refashioned the model of the Argentine citizen into one of an active participator with high expectations, willing to make demands of his or her government.\n\n== Present day ==\nPresent day Argentine citizenship law is derived, in the most part, from the National Constitution. Until recently, in 1994, the document did not contain any definition of citizenship and the related rights; instead, clauses were worded in terms of \"residents\" and \"the people.\" The 'New Rights and Guarantees' section added in 1994 was a reaction to authoritarian rule, and clearly regulates Argentine political rights; however, the Constitution still does not contain a definition of citizenship itself.\n\n=== Relevant sections of the Constitution ===\n{{quote|The citizens of each province shall be entitled to all rights, privileges, and immunities inherent in the condition of citizen in the other provinces...|<ref name=\"Constitution\">Constitution of the Argentine Nation, {{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129222250/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/documentos/constitucion_ingles.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-29 }}.</ref>}}\nIn this way, Argentina's federal system uses a version of the principle of [[comity]] to uphold provinces' rights, while still maintaining that Argentine citizenship is a national, pan-provincial status.\n{{quote|All the inhabitants of the Nation have the following rights according to the laws that rule their enforcement; namely: to work and run any legal industry; sell and trade; demand authorities; get in, stay, traverse and go out of the Argentine territory; make ideas public through the press with no prior censorship; use and dictate about own real estate; entire into associations with meaningful purposes; practice religion freely; teach and learn.|<ref name=\"Constitution\"/>}}\n*'''Section 14bis''' also includes a provision granting the benefits of social security, \"which shall be of an integral nature and may not be waived.\"<ref name=\"Constitution\"/>\nArgentina extends its civil rights to \"all inhabitants\" of the Nation, not just those with full citizenship status. (see \"section 20\" below) This provision was added in 1957, with the state taking responsibility for its inhabitants' well-being.<ref>Taylor, 65.</ref>\n{{quote|The Argentine Nation admits neither blood nor birth prerogatives: there are neither personal privileges nor titles of nobility. All its inhabitants are equal before the law, and admissible to employment without any other requirement than their ability. Equality is the basis of taxation and public burdens.|<ref name=\"Constitution\"/>}}\nThis section is a reaction to Spanish colonial rule, under which an individual's legal and practical rights were determined by their blood (both in terms of race and nobility).\nThe stipulation that \"equality is the basis of taxation and public burdens\" reflects that, in practice, Argentine citizenship flows from both rights and duties.\n{{quote|Foreigners enjoy within the territory of the Nation all the civil rights of citizens... They are not obliged to accept citizenship nor to pay extraordinary compulsory taxes. They may obtain naturalization papers residing two uninterrupted years in the Nation; but the authorities may shorten this term in favor of those so requesting it, alleging and proving services rendered to the Republic.<ref name=\"Constitution\"/>}}\n{{quote|Suffrage shall be universal, equal, secret and compulsory...}}\n\n=== Citizenship ===\nThe valid laws governing citizenship (Ley 346, Ley 23.059, and Decreto 3.213/84) set forth very simple requirements:\n\n(1) to be 18 years old;\n\n(2) to have been living in Argentina for 2 years; and\n\n(3) to apply for citizenship before a federal judge.\n\nAnd it can be denied if you:\n\n(1) have been in jail for more than 3 year in the last 5 years;\n\n(2) are under criminal prosecution;\n\n(3) do not have an honest way of income. To work without a legal permit is considered an honest way of living.\n\nDue to the fact that the citizenship law has existed unchanged since 1869 in its present form, the Supreme Court have issued many precedents on which there is a solution to almost every immigration situation an immigrant might face. Citizenship has been granted to immigrants who lacked legal residency or entered the country illegally, or even to immigrants with criminal records in exceptional cases.\n\nRecently, the Federal Chamber of Parana established that illegals doesn't exist in Argentina. Illegality is regarding actions that violates the criminal law. The violation of the immigration law is a simple administrative issue that can be healed applying for residency or citizenship.\n\nThe continuous 2 years means that you have your home in this country. Foreigners have the same civil rights than Argentines, among others, to travel. It means that the continuity of the 2 years doesn't mean that the solicitant cannot leave the country.\n\nFor historic reasons, federal courts are still reluctant to recognize the rights of \u00a8irregular\u00a8 immigrants, They usually request the following requirements related to the abolished law 21.795 (enacted in 1978 by Dictator Jorge Rafael Videla, was abolished in 1984 and Law 346 re-enacted):\n\n(1) Legal residency (2) Legal work (3) That you speak, read and write Spanish (4) That you renounce your native citizenship (5) DNI with permanent residency (6) Birth certificate apostilled and translated by public notary (7) Certificate of a clean criminal record from your home country (8) Certificate of a clean criminal record in Argentina (9) CUIT or CUIL number\n\n=== Documento Nacional de Identidad ===\nThe DNI is Argentina's Documento Nacional de Identidad, or National Identity Document.

It also won the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], and Mendes won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn 6 April 1917, [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|aerial reconnaissance]] has observed that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], which has pulled back from a sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern [[French Third Republic|France]], is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new [[Hindenburg Line]], where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with [[artillery]]. In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Joseph tells Blake of his mission, and that his brother is dead, giving Joseph his brother's rings and dog tag. Joseph is distressed about his brother, but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Blake's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

She adds that the \"false heroics and filmmaking feats of wonder\" serve to provide an \"escape from the true carnage of the 'Great War'\", and that in reality the scale of the [[World War I casualties|casualties]] was such that the potential loss of 1,600 men would not have excited the response portrayed in the film.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/opinion/1917-movie-world-war-I.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 February 2020|first=Cathy|last=Tempelsman|accessdate=11 February 2020|title='1917' Turns a Horrific War Into an Uplifting Hero's Journey}}</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian Jeremy Banning, \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned. ...

In reality, the number of black soldiers serving in the [[British Army during World War I|British Army]] (rather than [[Colonial troops|colonial regiments]]) during World War I is unknown but is likely to have been negligible. The [[Devonshire Regiment]] was never brigaded with any West Indian or African units (it spent the war in [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]]). Over 15,000 men from the Caribbean enlisted, including black Caribbeans living in Britain, and by 1915 it was decided to group them together into a single regiment, named the [[British West Indies Regiment]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |title=Fact-checking 1917: how historically accurate is Sam Mendes's First World War film? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/1917-fact-checking-how-historically-accurate-sam-mendes-war-movie/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6RACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |title=Colonial Soldiers in Europe, 1914\u20131945: \"Aliens in Uniform\" in Wartime Societies |pages=97\u2013102|date=22 December 2015|website=|isbn=9781317330981|last1=Storm |first1=Eric |last2=Tuma |first2=Ali Al }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How accurate is Sam Mendes's film, 1917? |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-accurate-is-sam-mendess-film-1917-8mtbrbfkv |work=The Times |date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Indian [[Sikhs]] would have served in their own regiments as part of the [[British Indian Army]], not as individuals in the ranks of British regiments and Corps.

The film stars [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] and [[Dean-Charles Chapman]], with [[Mark Strong]], [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]], [[Richard Madden]], Claire Duburcq, [[Colin Firth]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] in supporting roles.

It also won the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], and Mendes won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn 6 April 1917, [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|aerial reconnaissance]] has observed that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], which has pulled back from a sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern [[French Third Republic|France]], is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new [[Hindenburg Line]], where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with [[artillery]]. In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Joseph tells Blake of his mission, and that his brother is dead, giving Joseph his brother's rings and dog tag. Joseph is distressed about his brother, but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Blake's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

In reality, the number of black soldiers serving in the [[British Army during World War I|British Army]] (rather than [[Colonial troops|colonial regiments]]) during World War I is unknown but is likely to have been negligible. The [[Devonshire Regiment]] was never brigaded with any West Indian or African units (it spent the war in [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]]).

{"title_page": "History of Argentina", "text_new": "{{History of Argentina}}\nThe '''history of Argentina''' can be divided into four main parts: the pre-Columbian time or early history (up to the sixteenth century), the colonial period (1530\u20131810), the period of nation-building (1810-1880), and the history of modern Argentina (from around 1880).\n\nPrehistory in the present territory of [[Argentina]] began with the first human settlements on the southern tip of [[Patagonia]] around 13,000 years ago. \n\nWritten history began with the arrival of Spanish chroniclers in the expedition of [[Juan D\u00edaz de Sol\u00eds]] in 1516 to the  [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], which marks the beginning of Spanish  occupation of this region.\n\nIn 1776 the [[Spanish Crown]] established the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], an umbrella of territories from which, with the [[May Revolution|Revolution of May 1810]], began a process of gradual formation of several independent states, including one called the [[United Provinces of R\u00edo de la Plata]]. With the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] on July 9, 1816 and the military defeat of the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1824, a federal state was formed in 1853\u20131861, known today as the [[Argentine Republic]].\n\n==Pre-Columbian era==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The [[Cueva de las Manos|Cave of the Hands]] in [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz Province]], with indigenous artwork dating from 13,000\u20139,000 years ago.\n| image2 = Pucar\u00e1 de Tilcara 01.JPG\n| width2 = 250\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = The fortification of ''[[Pucar\u00e1 de Tilcara]]'' in [[Jujuy Province]], part of the [[Inca Empire]].\n| footer = \n}}\nThe area now known as Argentina was relatively sparsely populated until the period of European colonization. The earliest traces of human life are dated from the [[Paleolithic]] period, and there are further signs in the [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]].<ref>Santill\u00e1n, p. 17</ref> However, large areas of the interior and Piedmont were apparently depopulated during an extensive dry period between 4000 and 2000 B.C.<ref>A Gil, M Z\u00e1rate & G Neme (2005), ''Mid-Holocene paleoenvironments and the archeological record of southern Mendoza, Argentina''. '''Quat. Intern.''' 132: 81-94.</ref>\n\nThe Uruguayan archaeologist Ra\u00fal Camp\u00e1 Soler divided the [[indigenous peoples in Argentina]] into three main groups: basic hunters and food gatherers, without the development of [[pottery]]; advanced gatherers and hunters; and basic farmers with pottery.<ref>Santill\u00e1n, p. 18-19</ref> The second group could be found in the [[pampas]] and south of [[Patagonia]], and the third one included the [[Charr\u00faa]] and [[Minuane]] and the [[Guaran\u00ed people|Guaran\u00ed]].\n\nThe major ethnic groups included the [[Selk'nam people|Onas]] at [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[Yaghan people|Y\u00e1mana]] at the archipelago between the [[Beagle Channel]] and [[Cape Horn]], [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] in the [[Patagonia]], many peoples at the literal, guaycur\u00faes and which is at Chaco. The Guaran\u00ed had expanded across large areas of South America, but settled in the northeastern provinces of Argentina.

In 1536 [[Pedro de Mendoza]] established a small settlement at the modern location of [[Buenos Aires]], which was abandoned in 1541.<ref name=\"Mitre, p. 8-9\">Mitre, p. 8-9</ref>\n\nA second one was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], and [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] in 1573 by [[Jer\u00f3nimo Luis de Cabrera]]. Those regions were part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], whose capital was Lima, and settlers arrived from that city. Unlike the other regions of South America, the colonization of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary was not influenced by any [[gold rush]], since it lacked any [[precious metal]]s to mine.<ref name=\"Mitre, p. 8-9\"/>\n\nThe natural ports on the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] [[estuary]] could not be used because all shipments were meant to be made through the port of [[Callao]] near [[Lima]], a condition that led to [[contraband]] becoming the normal means of commerce in cities such as [[Asunci\u00f3n]], [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Montevideo]].<ref>Abad de Santill\u00e1n, p. 391 {{Lang-es|Los ingleses tuvieron en las colonias espa\u00f1olas, a pesar del monopolio comercial metropolitano, fuertes intereses: el comercio il\u00edcito se aproximaba en su monto casi al valor del autorizado por Espa\u00f1a; el contrabando se convirti\u00f3 en un medio importante de vida para los propios colonos y tambi\u00e9n para los gobernantes encargados de reprimirlo.}}<br>\n{{Lang-en|The British had in the Spanish colonies, despite the metropolitan monopoly on commerce, strong interests: legal commerce had amounts near the value of that authorized by Spain; smuggling became an important way to survive for colonials themselves and also for the governors in charge of stopping it.}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish raised the status of this region by establishing the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] in 1776. This viceroyalty consisted of today's Argentina, [[Uruguay]], and [[Paraguay]], as well as much of present-day [[Bolivia]]. Buenos Aires, now holding the customs of the new political subdivision, became a flourishing port, as the revenues from the [[Potos\u00ed]], the increasing maritime activity in terms of goods rather than [[precious metal]]s, the production of [[cattle]] for the [[export]] of [[leather]] and other products, and other political reasons, made it gradually become one of the most important commercial centers of the region.\n\nThe viceroyalty was, however, short-lived due to lack of internal cohesion among its many regions and lack of Spanish support. Ships from Spain became scarce again after the Spanish defeat at the [[battle of Trafalgar]], that gave the British maritime supremacy. The British tried to [[British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata|invade]] Buenos Aires and Montevideo in 1806 and 1807, but were defeated both times by [[Santiago de Liniers]]. Those victories, achieved without help from mainland Spain, boosted the confidence of the city.<ref>Luna, ''Independencia...'', p. 28</ref>\n\nThe beginning of the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain and the capture of the Spanish king [[Ferdinand VII]] created great concern all around the viceroyalty. It was thought that, without a King, people in America should rule themselves. This idea led to multiple attempts to remove the local authorities at [[Chuquisaca Revolution|Chuquisaca]], [[La Paz revolution|La Paz]], Montevideo and [[Mutiny of \u00c1lzaga|Buenos Aires]], all of which were short-lived. A new successful attempt, the [[May Revolution]] of 1810, took place when it was reported that all of Spain, with the exception of C\u00e1diz and Le\u00f3n, had been conquered.\n\n==War of independence==\n{{Main|Argentine War of Independence}}\n{{See also|Primera Junta|Junta Grande|First Triumvirate (Argentina)|Second Triumvirate (Argentina)}}\n\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn (retrato, c.1828).jpg|thumb|alt=oil paining of Jose' e San Martin|Portrait of [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]].]]\nThe May Revolution ousted the viceroy. Other forms of government, such as a [[constitutional monarchy]] or a [[Regent|Regency]] were briefly considered. \nThe viceroyalty was also renamed, and it nominally became the [[United Provinces of South America|United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]]. However, the status of the different territories that had belonged to the viceroyalty changed many times during the course of the war, as some regions would remain loyal to their previous governors and others were captured or recaptured; later these would [[balkanize|split]] into several countries.\n\nThe first military campaigns against the royalists were waged by [[Manuel Belgrano]] and [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli]]. The [[Primera Junta]], after expanding to become the [[Junta Grande]], was replaced by the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|First Triumvirate]]. A [[Second Triumvirate (Argentina)|Second Triumvirate]] would replace it years later, calling for the [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|Assembly of year XIII]] that was meant to declare independence and write a [[constitution]]. However, it did not do either, and replaced the triumvirates with a single head of state office, the [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Supreme Director]].\n\nBy this time [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] arrived in Buenos Aires with other generals of the [[Peninsular War]]. They gave new strength to the Revolutionary war, which was marked by the defeat of Belgrano and Castelli and the royalist resistance at the Banda Oriental. Alvear took Montevideo, and San Mart\u00edn started a military campaign that would span an important part of the Spanish territories in America. He created the [[Army of the Andes]] in Mendoza and, with the help of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] and other Chileans, he made the [[Crossing of the Andes]] and liberated Chile. With the Chilean navy at his disposal, he moved to Peru, liberating that country as well. San Mart\u00edn met [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] at [[Guayaquil conference|Guayaquil]], and retired from action.\n\nA new assembly, the [[Congress of Tucum\u00e1n]], was called while San Mart\u00edn was preparing the crossing of the Andes. It finally [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Spain or any other foreign power. [[Bolivia]] declared itself independent in 1825, and [[Uruguay]] was created in 1828 as a result of the [[Cisplatine War]].\n\nThe United Kingdom officially recognized Argentine independence in 1825, with the signing of a ''Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation'' on February 2; the British [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in Buenos Aires, [[Woodbine Parish]], signed on behalf of his country. Spanish recognition of Argentine independence was not to come for several decades.\n\n== Historical map ==\nThe map below is based on a wide range of antique maps for the periods shown and is intended to give a broad idea of the changes in the State of Argentina in the nineteenth century.  The periods are broad and plus or minus about a decade around each date.  The hatched areas are disputed or subject to change during the period, the text in this article will explain these changes.

Unitarians thought that Buenos Aires should lead the less-developed provinces, as the head of a strong [[centralized government]]. Federalists thought instead that the country should be a [[federation]] of autonomous provinces, like the United States. During this period, the government would kidnap protestors, and torture them for information.\n\nDuring this period, the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata lacked a head of state, since the unitarian defeat at the [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|Battle of Cepeda]] had ended the authority of the Supreme Directors and the [[Argentine Constitution of 1819|1819 Constitution]]. There was a new attempt in 1826 to write a constitution, leading to the designation of [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] as [[President of Argentina]], but it was rejected by the provinces. Rivadavia resigned due to the poor management at the [[Cisplatine War]], and the 1826 constitution was repealed.\n\nDuring this time, the [[Governor of Buenos Aires Province|Governors of Buenos Aires Province]] received the power to manage the international relations of the confederation, including war and debt payment. The dominant figure of this period was the federalist [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], who is portrayed from different angles by the diverse historiographic flows in Argentina: liberal history usually considers him a dictator, while revisionists support him on the grounds of his defense of national sovereignty.<ref>{{Cite book\n|title= Historia de la Historiograf\u00eda Argentina\n|last= Devoto\n|first= Fernando\n |author2=Pagano, Nora\n|year= 2009\n|publisher= Editorial Sudamericana\n|location= Buenos Aires\n|isbn= 978-950-07-3076-1\n|page= 202\n}}</ref>\n\nHe ruled the province of Buenos Aires from 1829 to 1852, facing military threats from secession attempts, neighboring countries, and even European nations. Although Rosas was a Federalist, he kept the customs receipts of Buenos Aires under the exclusive control of the city, whereas the other provinces expected to have a part of the revenue. Rosas considered this a fair measure because only Buenos Aires was paying the [[external debt]] generated by the [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers]] loan to Rivadavia, the war of independence and the war against Brazil. He developed a paramilitary force of his own, the [[Sociedad Popular Restauradora|Popular Restorer Society]], commonly known as \"''Mazorca''\" (\"Corncob\").\n\nRosas' reluctance to call for a new assembly to write a constitution led General [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]] from [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre R\u00edos]] to turn against him. Urquiza defeated Rosas during the [[battle of Caseros]] and called for such an assembly. The [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]] is, with amendments, still in force to this day. The Constitution was not immediately accepted by Buenos Aires, which seceded from the Confederation; it rejoined a few years later. In 1862 [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] became the first president of the unified country.\n\n==Liberal Governments (1862\u20131880)==\n{{See also|Argentine Constitution of 1853|Conquest of the Desert|Generation of '80|South American dreadnought race}}\n\n[[File:Sarmiento (1873).jpg|thumb|alt=black and white photograph of President Domingo Faustino|President [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]].]]\nThe presidency of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] saw an economic improvement in Argentina, with agricultural modernization, foreign investment, new railroads and ports and a wave of immigration from Europe. Mitre also stabilized the political system by commanding federal interventions that defeated the personal armies of caudillos [[Chacho Pe\u00f1aloza]] and [[Juan S\u00e1a]]. Argentina joined Uruguay and Brazil against Paraguay in the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], which ended during Sarmiento's rule with the defeat of Paraguay and the annexation of part of its territory by Argentina.\n\nDespite victory in the war, Mitre's popularity declined severely because a broad section of the Argentine population was opposed to the war due to the alliance with Brazil (Argentina's historic rival) that took place during the war, and the betrayal of Paraguay (which had been until then one of the country's most important economic allies). One of the major hallmarks of Mitre's presidency was the \"Law of Compromise\", in which Buenos Aires joined the Argentine Republic and allowed the government to use the City of Buenos Aires as the center of government, but without federalizing the city and by reserving the right of the province of Buenos Aires to secede from the nation if conflict arose.\n\nIn 1868 Mitre was succeeded by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], who promoted public education, culture, [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] ; as well as the modernization of the [[Argentine Army|Army]] and the [[Argentine Navy|Navy]]. Sarmiento managed to defeat the last known caudillos and also dealt with the fallout of the Triple Alliance War, which included a decrease in national production due to the death of thousands of soldiers and an outbreak of diseases, such as [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]], brought by returning soldiers.\n\nIn 1874 [[Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda]] became president and ran into trouble when he had to deal with the economic depression left by the [[Panic of 1873]]. Most of these economic issues were solved when new land was opened for development after the expansion of national territory through the [[Conquest of the Desert]], led by his war minister [[Julio Argentino Roca]]. This military campaign took most of the territories under the control of natives, and reduced their population.\n\nIn 1880 a trade conflict caused turmoil in Buenos Aires, which led governor [[Carlos Tejedor (politician)|Carlos Tejedor]] to declare secession from the republic. Avellaneda denied them this right, breaking the Law of Compromise, and proceeded to send army troops led by Roca to take over the province. Tejedor's secession efforts were defeated and Buenos Aires joined the republic definitively, federalizing the city of Buenos Aires and handing it over to the government as the nation's capital city.\n\n==National Autonomist hegemony (1880\u20131916)==\n{{see also|Argentine\u2013Chilean naval arms race|South American dreadnought race}}\n[[File:Julio A Roca.jpg|thumb|200px|President [[Julio Argentino Roca]], the central political figure of the PAN Hegemony years.]]\n\nAfter his surge in popularity due to his successful desert campaign, Julio Roca was elected president in 1880 as the candidate for the [[National Autonomist Party]] (Partido Autonomista Nacional - PAN), a party that would remain in power until 1916. During his presidency, Roca created a net of political alliances and installed several measures that helped him retain almost absolute control of the Argentine political scene throughout the 1880s. This keen ability with political strategy earned him his nickname of \"''The Fox''\".\n\nThe country's economy benefited from a change from [[extensive farming]] to [[industrial agriculture]] and a huge [[Great European immigration wave to Argentina|European immigration]], but there wasn't yet a strong move towards [[industrialization]]. At that time, Argentina received some of the highest levels of foreign investment in Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In the midst of this economic expansion, the [[Argentine Law 1420|Law 1420 of Common Education]] of 1884 guaranteed universal, free, non-religious education to all children. This and other government policies were strongly opposed by the [[Roman Catholicism in Argentina|Roman Catholic Church in Argentina]], causing the [[Holy See]] to break off diplomatic relations with the country for several years and setting the stage for decades of continued [[Church\u2013state relations in Argentina|Church\u2013state strain]].\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Argentina temporarily resolved its border disputes with Chile with the [[Puna de Atacama dispute]] of 1899, the [[Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] and the [[1902 General Treaty of Arbitration]]. Roca's government and those that followed were aligned with the Argentine [[oligarchy]], especially the great land owners.\n[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA 1881.png|thumb|180px|left|Under General Roca, the [[Conquest of the Desert]] extended Argentine power into [[Patagonia]].]]\n\nIn 1888, [[Miguel Ju\u00e1rez Celman]] became president after Roca was constitutionally disqualified from re-election; Celman attempted to reduce Roca's control over the political scene, which earned him his predecessor's opposition. Roca led a great opposition movement against Celman, which coupled with the devastating effects that the [[Long Depression]] had on the Argentine economy, allowed the [[Civic Union (Argentina)|Civic opposition party]] to start a coup d'\u00e9tat which would be later known as the [[Revolution of the Park]]. The Revolution was led by the three main leaders of the Civic Union, [[Leandro Alem]], former president [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] and moderate socialist [[Juan B. Justo]]. Though it failed in its main goals, the revolution forced Ju\u00e1rez Celman's resignation and marked the decline of the [[Generation of '80]].\n\nIn 1891, Roca proposed that the Civic Union elect someone to be vice-president to his own presidency the next time elections came around. One group led by Mitre decided to take the deal, while another more intransigent group led by Alem was opposed. This eventually led to the split of the Civic Union into the [[National Civic Union (Argentina)]], led by Mitre, and the [[Radical Civic Union]], led by Alem. After this division occurred, Roca withdrew his offer, having completed his plan to divide the Civic Union and decrease their power. Alem would eventually commit suicide in 1896; control of the Radical Civic Union went to his nephew and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen]].\n\nAfter Celman's downfall, his vice-president [[Carlos Pellegrini]] took over and proceeded to resolve the economic crisis which afflicted the country, earning him the moniker of \"''The Storm Sailor''\". Fearing another wave of opposition from Roca like the one imposed on Celman, Pellegrini remained moderate in his presidency ending his predecessor's efforts to distance \"''The Fox''\" from political control. The following governments up until 1898 took similar measures and sided with Roca to avoid being politically chastised.\n\nIn 1898, Roca became president again in a politically unstable situation, with a large number of social conflicts that included massive strikes and anarchist subversion attempts. Roca handled most of these conflicts by having the police or the army crack down on protestors, rebels and suspected rebels. After the end of his second presidency, Roca fell ill and his role in political affairs began to decrease gradually until his death in late 1914.\n\nIn 1904, [[Alfredo Palacios]], a member of [[Juan B. Justo]]'s [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]] (founded in 1896), became the first Socialist deputy in Argentina, as a representative for the working-class neighborhood of [[La Boca]] in Buenos Aires. He helped create many laws, including the Ley Palacios against sexual exploitation, and others regulating [[labor laws|child and woman labor]], working hours and Sunday rest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nUni\u00f3n C\u00edvica Radical's 1893 and 1905 revolts, led by Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen, inflicted fear among the oligarchy of an increased social instability and a possible revolution. Being a progressive member of the PAN, [[Roque S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a]] recognized the need to satisfy the demand by public to maintain the existing regime. After being elected as President in 1910, he passed the [[S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a Law]] in 1912 which made the political vote mandatory, secret and universal among males aged eighteen or more. His intention was not to allow the transition of power to Uni\u00f3n C\u00edvica Radical but to increase public support for the PAN by enabling the universal electoral suffrage. However, the consequence was the opposite of what he intended to accomplish: The following election chose Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen as the president in 1916, and it ended the hegemony of the PAN.\n\n==Radical governments (1916\u201330)==\n{{Main|History of Argentina (1916\u201330)}}\n{{See also|Radical Civic Union}}\n\n[[File:Yrigoyen en ventanilla del ferrocarril viaje a Santa Fe campa\u00f1a electoral de 1926..jpg|thumb|President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen]].]]\nConservative forces dominated Argentine politics until 1916, when the Radicals, led by [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen]], won control of the government through the first national elections under universal male suffrage. 745,000 citizens were allowed to vote, of a total population of 7.5 million (immigrants, who represented much of the population, were not allowed to vote); of these, 400,000 abstained.<ref>[[Felipe Pigna]], ''Los Mitos de la Historia Argentina, 3'', 2006, ed. Planeta, p.38</ref>\n\nYrigoyen, however, only obtained 45% of the votes, which did not allow him a majority in Parliament, where the conservatives remained the leading force. Thus, of 80 draft laws proposed by the executive, only 26 were voted through by the conservative majority.<ref name=\"Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.42\">Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.42</ref> A moderate agricultural reform proposal was rejected by Parliament, as was an income tax on interest, and the creation of a Bank of the Republic (which was to have the missions of the current [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]]).<ref name=\"Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.42\"/>\n\nDespite this conservative opposition, the [[Radical Civic Union]] (UCR), with their emphasis on fair elections and democratic institutions, opened their doors to Argentina's expanding middle class as well as to social groups previously excluded from power.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Yrigoyen's policy was to \"fix\" the system, by enacting necessary reforms which would enable the agroindustrial export model to preserve itself.<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.39</ref> It alternated moderate social reforms with repression of the social movements. In 1918, a student movement started at the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba|University of C\u00f3rdoba]], which eventually led to the [[Argentine university reform of 1918|University Reform]], which quickly spread to the rest of Latin America. In [[May '68]], French students recalled the C\u00f3rdoba movement.<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.51</ref>\n\nThe [[Tragic Week (Argentina)|Tragic Week]] of January 1919, during which the [[Argentine Regional Workers' Federation]] (FORA, founded in 1901) had called for a general strike after a police shooting, ended with 700 killed and 4,000 injured.<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.88</ref> General [[Luis Dellepiane]] marched on Buenos Aires to re-establish civil order. Despite being called on by some to initiate a coup against Yrigoyen, he remained loyal to the President, on the sole condition that the latter would allow him a free hand in the repression of the demonstrations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Social movements thereafter continued in the ''[[La Forestal|Forestal]]'' British company, and in [[Patagonia]], where Hector Varela headed the military repression, assisted by the [[Argentine Patriotic League]], killing 1,500.<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.100</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Yrigoyen's administration enacted the [[Labor laws|Labor Code]] establishing the [[right to strike]] in 1921, implemented [[minimum wage]] laws and collective contracts. It also initiated the creation of the ''[[Direcci\u00f3n General de Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales]]'' (YPF), the state oil company, in June 1922. Radicalism rejected [[class struggle]] and advocated social conciliation.<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.44</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Radicals continued Argentina's neutrality policy during World War I, despite the United States urging them to declare war against the [[Central Powers]]. Neutrality enabled Argentina to export goods to Europe, in particular to Great Britain, as well as to issue credit to the belligerent powers. Germany sank two Argentine civilian ships, ''Monte Protegido'' on April 4, 1917 and the ''Toro'', but the diplomatic incident ended only with the expulsion of the German ambassador, [[Karl von Luxburg]]. Yrigoyen organized a Conference of Neutral Powers in Buenos Aires, to oppose the United States' attempt to bring American states in the European war, and also supported [[Augusto Sandino|Sandino]]'s resistance in [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]].<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.58</ref>\n\nIn September 1922, Yrigoyen's administration refused to follow the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' policy enacted against the Soviet Union, and, basing its policy on the assistance given to Austria after the war, decided to send to the USSR 5 million pesos in assistance.<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.59</ref>\n\nThe same year, Yrigoyen was replaced by his rival inside the UCR, [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear]], an aristocrat, who defeated [[Norberto Pi\u00f1ero]]'s ''[[Concentraci\u00f3n Nacional]]'' (conservatives)  with 458,457 votes to 200,080. Alvear brought to his cabinet personalities belonging to the traditional ruling classes, such as [[Jos\u00e9 Nicol\u00e1s Matienzo]] at the Interior Ministry, [[\u00c1ngel Gallardo (politician)|\u00c1ngel Gallardo]] in Foreign Relations, [[Agust\u00edn P. Justo]] at the War Ministry, [[Manuel Domecq Garc\u00eda]] at the Marine and [[Rafael Herrera Vegas]] at the Haciendas. Alvear's supporters founded the ''[[Uni\u00f3n C\u00edvica Radical Antipersonalista]]'', opposed to Yrigoyen's party.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nDuring the early 1920s, the rise of the anarchist movement, fueled by the arrival of recent \u00e9migr\u00e9s and deportees from Europe, spawned a new generation of left-wing activism in Argentina.  The new left, mostly anarchists and [[anarcho-communists]], rejected the incremental progressivism of the old Radical and Socialist elements in Argentina in favor of immediate action.  The extremists, such as [[Severino Di Giovanni]], openly espoused violence and '[[Propaganda of the deed|propaganda by the deed]]'.  A wave of bombings and shootouts with police culminated in an attempt to assassinate U.S. President [[Herbert Hoover]] on his visit to Argentina in 1928 and a nearly successful attempt to assassinate Yrigoyen in 1929 after he was re-elected to the presidency.\n\nIn 1921, the [[counter-revolutionary]] ''[[Logia General San Mart\u00edn]]'' was founded, and diffused nationalist ideas in the [[Armed Forces of Argentina|military]] until its dissolution in 1926. Three years later, the ''[[Liga Republicana]]'' (Republican League) was founded by [[Roberto de Laferr\u00e8re]], on the model of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Blackshirts]] in Italy. The Argentine Right found its major influences in the 19th-century Spanish writer [[Marcelino Men\u00e9ndez y Pelayo]] and in the French royalist [[Charles Maurras]].<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.125-128</ref>  Also in 1922, the poet [[Leopoldo Lugones]], who had turned towards [[fascism]], made a famous speech in [[Lima]], known as \"the time of the sword\", in the presence of the War Minister and future dictator Agust\u00edn P. Justo, which called for a military coup and the establishment of a military dictatorship.\n\nIn 1928, Yrigoyen was re-elected as president and began a series of reforms to increase workers' rights. This intensified the conservative opposition against Yrigoyen, which grew even stronger after Argentina was devastated by the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] after the [[Wall Street Crash]]. On September 6, 1930, a military coup led by the pro-fascist general [[Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Uriburu]] overthrew Yrigoyen's government and began a period in Argentine history known as the [[Infamous Decade]].\n\nDuring the Great Depression, exports of frozen beef, especially to Great Britain, provided much needed foreign currency, but trade fell off sharply.<ref>E.

Jones, \"The Argentine Refrigerated Meat Industry,\" ''Economica'' (1929) #26 pp. 156-172 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2548200 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Infamous Decade (1930\u201343)==\n{{Main|Infamous Decade}}\n\n[[File:Vista de Puerto Madero - Aduana de Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|300px|The training ship ''[[ARA Presidente Sarmiento|Sarmiento]]'' and the Ministry of Defense, Buenos Aires.]]\nIn 1929, Argentina was wealthy by world standards, but the prosperity ended after 1929 with the worldwide [[Great Depression in Latin America|Great Depression]]. In 1930, a military coup, supported by the [[Argentine Patriotic League]], forced Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen from power, and replaced him with [[Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Uriburu]].  Support for the coup was bolstered by the sagging Argentine economy, as well as a string of bomb attacks and shootings involving radical anarchists, which alienated moderate elements of Argentine society and angered the conservative right, which had long been agitating for decisive action by the military forces.\n\nThe military coup initiated during the period known as the \"[[Infamous Decade]]\", characterized by [[electoral fraud]], persecution of the [[opposition (politics)|political opposition]] (mainly against the [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]]) and pervasive government corruption, against the background of the global depression.\n\nDuring his brief tenure as president, Uriburu cracked down heavily on anarchists and other far-left groups, resulting in 2,000 illegal executions of members of anarchist and communist groups. The most famous (and perhaps most symbolic of anarchism's decay in Argentina at the time) was the execution of Severino Di Giovanni, who was captured in late January 1931 and executed on the first of February of the same year.\n\nAfter becoming president through the coup, Uriburu attempted to create a constitutional reform that would include [[corporatism]] in the Argentine Constitution. This move toward fascism was viewed negatively by the conservative backers of the coup and they turned their support to the more moderate conservative general [[Agust\u00edn P. Justo]], who won the presidency in a 1932 election that was heavily fraudulent.\n\nJusto began a policy of liberal economic moves that primarily benefitted the nation's upper classes and permitted great political and industrial corruption at the expense of national growth. One of the most infamous decisions of Justo's government was the creation of the [[Roca\u2013Runciman Treaty]] between Argentina and the United Kingdom, which benefitted the British economy and the rich beef producers of Argentina.\n\nIn 1935, progressive democrat Senator [[Lisandro de la Torre]] began an investigation into several corruption allegations within the Argentine beef production industry, during which he attempted to charge Justo's Minister of Agriculture, Luis Duhau, and the Minister of Finance, Federico Pinedo, with political corruption and fraud charges. During the exposition of the investigation in the National Congress, Duhau started a fight among the senators, during which his bodyguard, Ram\u00f3n Valdez-Cora, tried to kill De La Torre but accidentally ended up shooting De La Torre's friend and political partner [[Enzo Bordabehere]]. The meat investigation was dropped soon afterward, but not before De La Torre managed to achieve the incarceration of the head of the ''Anglo'' meat company for corruption charges. De la Torre would later commit suicide in 1939.\n\nThe collapse of international trade led to industrial growth focused on [[import substitution]], leading to a stronger economic independence. Political conflict increased, marked by confrontation between right-wing [[fascism|fascist]]s and leftist radicals, while military-oriented conservatives controlled the government. Though many claimed the polls to be fraudulent, [[Roberto Ortiz]] was elected president in 1937 and took office the next year, but due to his fragile health he was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Ram\u00f3n Castillo]]. Castillo effectively took power in 1940; he formally assumed leadership in 1942.\n\n==Revolution of '43 (1943\u201346)==\n{{main|1943 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat}}\n{{See also|Argentina during World War II}}\nThe civilian government appeared to be close to joining the Allies, but many officers of the Argentine armed forces (and ordinary Argentine citizens) objected due to fear of the spread of communism. There was a wide support to stay neutral in the conflict, as during World War I. The government was also questioned for domestic policy reasons, namely, electoral fraud, poor labour rights, and the selection of Patr\u00f3n Costas to run for the presidency.\n\nOn June 4, 1943, the [[United Officers' Group]] (GOU), which was a secret alliance between military leaders led by [[Pedro Pablo Ram\u00edrez]], [[Arturo Rawson]], [[Edelmiro Farrell]], and Farrell's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Juan Per\u00f3n]], marched to the [[Casa Rosada]] and demanded the resignation of president Castillo. After hours of threats, their goal was achieved and the president resigned. This event is considered by historians to be the official end of the Infamous Decade.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nAfter the coup, Ram\u00edrez took power. Although he did not declare war, he broke off relations with the [[Axis powers]]. Argentina's largest neighbor, Brazil, had already entered the war on the Allied side in 1942.\n\nIn 1944 Ramirez was replaced by Farrell, an army officer of Irish-Argentine origin who had spent two years attached to Mussolini's army in the twenties.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Initially, his government continued to maintain a neutral policy. Towards the end of the war, Farrell decided it was in the interests of Argentina to be attached to the winning side. Like several Latin American states, Argentina made a late declaration of war against Germany with no intention of providing any military forces.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nJuan Per\u00f3n managed relations with labourers and unions, and became highly popular. He was deposed and detained on [[Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda Island]], but a massive demonstration on October 17, 1945, forced the government to free Per\u00f3n and restore him to office. Per\u00f3n would win the elections shortly afterward by a landslide. The US ambassador, [[Spruille Braden]], took direct action in Argentine politics supporting the antiperonist parties.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Peronist years (1946\u201355)==\n{{See also|Juan Per\u00f3n|Peronism|Eva Per\u00f3n}}\n{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:Juan Peron con banda de presidente.jpg|thumb|200px|President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] (1946).]]\n\nIn 1946 General [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] became president; his populist ideology became known as [[peronism]].

A coup (''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'') led by [[Eduardo Lonardi]], and supported by the [[Catholic Church]], deposed him in 1955. He went into exile, eventually settling in [[Francoist Spain]].\n\n==''Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora'' (1955\u20131958)==\n{{Further|Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora}}\nIn Argentina, the 1950s and 1960s were marked by frequent [[coups d'\u00e9tat]], low economic growth in the 1950s and high growth rates in the 1960s.  Argentina faced problems of continued social and labor demands. Argentine painter [[Antonio Berni]]'s works reflected the social tragedies of these times, painting in particular life in the ''[[villas miseria]]'' (shanty towns).\n\nFollowing the ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' military coup, [[Eduardo Lonardi]] held power only briefly and was succeeded by [[Pedro Aramburu]], president from November 13, 1955, to May 1, 1958. In June 1956, two Peronist generals, [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Valle]] and [[Raul Tanco]], attempted a coup against Aramburu, criticizing an important purge in the army, the abrogation of social reforms and persecution of trade-union leaders. They also demanded liberation of all political and labor activists and a return to constitutional order. The uprising was quickly crushed. General Valle and other members of the military were executed, and twenty civilians were arrested at their homes and their bodies were thrown in the Le\u00f3n Suarez dumping ground.\n\nAlong with the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo|June 1955 Casa Rosada bombing]] on the [[Plaza de Mayo]], the Le\u00f3n Suarez massacre is one of the important events that started a cycle of violence. Pedro Aramburu was later kidnapped and executed for this massacre, in 1970, by Fernando Abal Medina, Emilio Angel Maza, [[Mario Firmenich]] and others, who would later form the ''[[Montoneros]]'' movement.<ref>Julio A. Troxler, a \"revolutionary Peronist\", was one of the few men who escaped the massacre. All the others were dumped in Le\u00f3n Suarez, in [[Buenos Aires Province]]. [[Rodolfo Walsh]] noted Troxler's testimony in ''Operation Massacre''. In 1973, under C\u00e1mpora's government, Troxler became Buenos Aires police chief, but was assassinated by the Triple A during Isabel Per\u00f3n's government. Rodolfo Walsh was murdered after Videla's 1976 coup.</ref>\n\nIn 1956, special elections were held to reform the constitution. The Radical Party under [[Ricardo Balb\u00edn]] won a majority, although 25% of all ballots were turned in the blank as a protest by the banned Peronist party. Also in support of Peronism, the left wing of the Radical Party, led by [[Arturo Frondizi]], left the Constitutional Assembly. The Assembly was severely damaged by this defection and was only able to restore the Constitution of 1853 with the sole addition of the Article 14 ''bis'', which enumerated some social rights.\n\n==Fragile radical administrations (1958\u20131966)==\n[[File:Frondizi.jpg|thumb|200px|President [[Arturo Frondizi]].]]\nA ban on [[Peronist]] expression and representation continued during the fragile civilian governments of the period 1958\u20131966. Frondizi, UCRI's candidate, won the presidential elections of 1958, obtaining approximately 4,000,000 votes against 2,500,000 for Ricardo Balb\u00edn (with 800,000 neutral votes). From [[Caracas]], Per\u00f3n supported Frondizi and called upon his supporters to vote for him, as a means toward the end of prohibition of the Peronist movement and the re-establishment of the workers' social legislation voted during Per\u00f3n's leadership.\n\nOn one hand, Frondizi appointed [[\u00c1lvaro Alsogaray]] as [[Minister of Economy (Argentina)|Minister of Economy]] to placate powerful agrarian interests and other conservatives. A member of the powerful military dynasty [[Alsogaray]], \u00c1lvaro, who had already been Minister of Industry under [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu|Aramburu]]'s military rule, devalued the peso and imposed credit control.\n\nOn the other hand, Frondizi followed a laicist program, which raised concerns among the Catholic nationalist forces, leading to the organization, between 1960 and 1962, of the far-right [[Tacuara Nationalist Movement]].\n\nThe [[Tacuara Nationalist Movement|Tacuara]], the \"first [[urban guerrilla]] group in Argentina\",<ref>Daniel Gutman, ''Tacuara, historia de la primera guerrilla urbana argentina''</ref> engaged in several anti-Semitic bombings, in particular following [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s kidnapping by the [[Mossad]] in 1960. During the visit of [[Dwight Eisenhower]] to Argentina, in February 1962 (Eisenhower had been until 1961 President of the United States), the Tacuara headed nationalist demonstrations against him, leading to the imprisonment of several of their leaders, among them [[Joe Baxter]].<ref>[http://www.irlandeses.org/dilab_baxterj.htm Baxter, Jos\u00e9 Luis] entry at the ''[[Dictionary of Irish Latin American Biography]]'' {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PP Illia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ousting of President [[Arturo Illia]] was initially broadly supported but later deeply regretted by the Argentine population.]]\n\nHowever, Frondizi's government ended in 1962 with intervention yet again by the military, after a series of local elections were won by the Peronist candidates. [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Guido]], chairman of the senate, claimed the presidency on constitutional grounds before the deeply divided armed forces were able to agree on a name.  Right-wing elements in the Argentine armed forces in favor of direct military rule and the suppression of former Peronist politicians, subsequently attempted to wrest control of the government in the [[1963 Argentine Navy Revolt]] on April 2.  The failure of the revolt's plotters to win the loyalty of army units near the capital permitted Guido's government to swiftly put down the revolt at the cost of 21 lives.\n\nIn new elections in 1963, neither Peronists nor Communists were allowed to participate. [[Arturo Illia]] of the Radical People's Party won these elections; regional elections and by-elections over the next few years favored Peronists.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tacuara were outlawed by Illia in 1965, some of its members ultimately turning to the Peronist Left (such as Joe Baxter) while others remained in their far-right positions (such as [[Alberto Ezcurra Uriburu]], who would work with the [[Triple A (Argentina)|Triple A]]).\n\nDespite the fact that the country grew and developed economically during Illia's tenure as president, he was eventually ousted in a military coup in 1966.\n\n==''Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina'' (1966\u201373)==\n{{Main|Argentine Revolution}}\nAmidst growing worker and student unrest, another coup took place in June 1966, self-designated ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina]]'' (Argentine Revolution), which established General [[Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda]] as ''de facto'' president, supported by several leaders of the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labour]] (CGT), among these the general secretary, [[Augusto Vandor]]. This led to a series of military-appointed presidents.\n\nWhile preceding military coups were aimed at establishing temporary, transitional ''[[Military dictatorship|junta]]''s, the ''Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina'' headed by Ongan\u00eda aimed at establishing a new political and social order, opposed both to [[liberal democracy]] and [[communism]], which gave to the [[Armed Forces of Argentina]] a leading, political role in the economic rationalization of the country. The political scientist [[Guillermo O'Donnell]] named this type of [[political regime|regime]] an \"authoritarian-bureaucratic state\",<ref>[[Guillermo O'Donnell]], ''El Estado Burocr\u00e1tico Autoritario'', (1982)</ref> in reference both to the ''Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina'', the [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian military regime]] (1964\u201385), [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s regime (starting in 1973) and [[Juan Mar\u00eda Bordaberry]]'s regime in [[History of Uruguay|Uruguay]].\n\nOngan\u00eda's [[Minister of Economy of Argentina|Minister of Economy]], [[Adalbert Krieger Vasena]], decreed a wage freeze and a 40% devaluation of the currency, which strongly affected the [[Economy of Argentina|state of the Argentine economy]], in particular the agricultural sector, favoring foreign capital. Vasena suspended [[collective bargaining|collective labour conventions]], reformed the hydrocarbon law which had established a partial monopoly of the ''[[YPF|Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales]]'' (YPF) state enterprise, as well as passing a law facilitating expulsions in case of failure to pay rent. Finally, the [[right to strike]] was suspended (Law 16,936) and several other laws reversed progress made concerning [[labor laws]] throughout the preceding years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe workers' movement divided itself between Vandoristas, who supported a \"Peronism without Peron\" line (Vandor declared that \"to save Per\u00f3n, one has to be against Per\u00f3n\") and advocated negotiation with the junta, and Peronists, themselves divided.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn July 1966 Ongan\u00eda ordered the forcible clearing of five facilities of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] (UBA) on July 29, 1966 by the [[Argentine Federal Police|Federal Police]], an event known as ''[[La Noche de los Bastones Largos]]'' (\"The Night of the Long Batons\"). These facilities had been occupied by students, professors and graduates (members of the autonomous government of the university) who opposed the military government's intervention in the universities and revocation of the [[Argentine university reform of 1918|1918 university reform]]. The university repression led to the exile of 301 university professors, including [[Manuel Sadosky]], [[Tulio Halper\u00edn Donghi]], [[Sergio Bag\u00fa]] and [[Risieri Frondizi]].<ref>Marta Slemenson et al., ''Emigraci\u00f3n de cient\u00edficos argentinos.

Finally, at the end of the month, Ongan\u00eda dismissed the leaders of the Armed Forces: [[Alejandro Lanusse]] replaced Julio Alsogaray, [[Pedro Gnavi]] replaced [[Benigno Varela]], and [[Jorge Mart\u00ednez Zuvir\u00eda]] replaced [[Adolfo Alvarez]].\n\nOn 19 September 1968, two important events affected Revolutionary Peronism. On one hand, [[John William Cooke]], former personal delegate of Per\u00f3n and ideologist of the Peronist Left, as well as a friend of [[Fidel Castro]], died from natural causes. On the other hand, a small group (13 men and one woman) who aimed at establishing a ''[[foco]]'' in [[Tucum\u00e1n Province]], in order to head the resistance against the junta, was captured.<ref name=Anzorena48>Oscar R.

While Per\u00f3n managed a reconciliation with [[Augusto Vandor]], head of the CGT Azopardo, he followed, in particular through the voice of his delegate [[Jorge Paladino]], a cautious line of opposition to the military junta, criticizing with moderation the neoliberal policies of the junta but waiting for discontent inside the government (\"''hay que desencillar hasta que aclare''\", said Per\u00f3n, advocating patience). Thus, Ongan\u00eda had an interview with 46 CGT delegates, among them Vandor, who agreed to cooperate with the military junta, thus uniting themselves with the ''Nueva Corriente de Opini\u00f3n'' headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Alonso (trade unionist)|Jos\u00e9 Alonso]] and [[Rogelio Coria]].\n\nIn December 1969, more than 20 priests, members of the ''[[Movement of Priests for the Third World]]'' (MSTM), marched on the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'' to present to Ongan\u00eda a petition pleading with him to abandon the planned eradication of ''[[villas miserias]]'' (shanty towns).<ref name=Anzorena49>Oscar Anzorena, 1987, p.49</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Ongan\u00eda implemented [[corporatism]] policies, experimenting in particular in C\u00f3rdoba, underneath [[Carlos Jos\u00e9 Caballero|Carlos Caballero]]'s governance. The same year, the Movement of Priests for the Third World issued a declaration supporting socialist revolutionary movements, which led to the [[Catholicism in Argentina|Catholic hierarchy]], by the voice of [[Juan Carlos Aramburu]], coadjutor [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]], to proscribe priests from making political or social declarations.<ref name=Anzorena53>Oscar Anzorena, 1987, p.53</ref>\n\n==Growing instability (1969\u201376)==\nDuring the de facto government of the ''Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina'', the left began to regain power through underground movements. This was mainly through violent guerrilla groups. Later, the return of Peronism was expected to calm down the heated waters but did exactly the opposite, creating a violent breach between right-wing and left-wing Peronism, leading to years of violence and political instability that culminated with the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1976.\n\n===Subversive years (1969\u201373)===\nVarious armed actions, headed by the ''[[Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci\u00f3n]]'' (FAL), composed of former members of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Argentina|Revolutionary Communist Party]], occurred in April 1969, leading to several arrests among FAL members. These were the first left-wing [[urban guerrilla]] actions in Argentina. Beside these isolated actions, the [[Cordobazo]] uprising that year, called forth by the CGT de los Argentinos, and its Cordobese leader, [[Agust\u00edn Tosco]], prompted demonstrations in the entire country. The same year, the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP) was formed as the military branch of the Trotskyist [[Workers' Revolutionary Party (Argentina)|Workers' Revolutionary Party]], kidnapping high-profile rich Argentines and demanding ransom.<ref name=\"Nancy Scheper-Hughes\">{{Cite book|title=Child Survival: Anthropological Perspectives on the Treatment and Maltreatment of Children|author=Nancy Scheper-Hughes}}</ref><ref name=\"Paul H.

Per\u00f3n was prevented from running, but voters elected his stand-in, Dr. [[Hector C\u00e1mpora]], as President. C\u00e1mpora defeated his [[Radical Civic Union]] opponent. C\u00e1mpora won 49.5 percent of the votes in the presidential election following a campaign based on a platform of national reconstruction.<ref name=\"Miguel Bonasso 1997\">Miguel Bonasso, ''El Presidente que no fue.

He acceded to his functions on May 25, which was saluted by a massive popular gathering of the Peronist Youth movement, [[Montoneros]], FAR and FAP (\"Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas\") in the [[Plaza de Mayo]]. C\u00e1mpora assumed a strong stance against right-wing Peronists, declaring during his first speech: \"La sangre derramada no ser\u00e1 negociada\" (\"Spilled blood will not be negotiated\").<ref name=\"Miguel Bonasso 1997\"/>\n\n[[Cuba]]n president [[Osvaldo Dortic\u00f3s Torrado|Osvaldo Dortic\u00f3s]] and [[Chile]]an president [[Salvador Allende]] were present at his inauguration, while [[William P. Rogers]], U.S. Secretary of State, and [[Uruguay]]an president [[Juan Mar\u00eda Bordaberry|Juan Bordaberry]], could not attend, blocked in their respective cars by demonstrators. Political prisoners were liberated on the same day, under the pressure of the demonstrators. C\u00e1mpora's government included progressive figures such as Interior Minister Esteban Righi and Education Minister Jorge Taiana, but also included members of the labor and political right-wing Peronist factions, such as [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega]], Per\u00f3n's personal secretary and Minister of Social Welfare, and a member of the [[Propaganda Due|P2 Masonic lodge]].<ref name=\"Miguel Bonasso 1997\"/> Per\u00f3n's followers also commanded strong majorities in both houses of Congress.\n\nHector C\u00e1mpora's government followed a traditional Peronist economic policy, supporting the national market and redistributing wealth. One of Jos\u00e9 Ber Gelbard's first measures as minister of economics was to augment workers' wages. However, the [[1973 oil crisis]] seriously affected Argentina's oil-dependent economy. Almost 600 social conflicts, strikes or occupations occurred in C\u00e1mpora's first month. The military conceded Campora's victory, but strikes, as well as government-backed violence, continued unabated. The slogan \"[[Campora]] in government, Per\u00f3n in power\" expressed the real source of popular joy, however.\n\n===Return of Per\u00f3n (1973\u201374)===\n\nAmidst escalating terror from the right and left alike, Per\u00f3n decided to return and assume the presidency. On June 20, 1973, two million people waited for him at Ezeiza airport. From Per\u00f3n's speaking platform, camouflaged far-right gunmen fired on the masses, shooting at the Peronist Youth movement and the [[Montoneros]], killing at least thirteen and injuring more than three hundred (this became known as the [[Ezeiza massacre]]).<ref>[[Horacio Verbitsky]], \"Ezeiza\", Contrapunto, Buenos Aires, 1985.</ref>\n\nC\u00e1mpora and vice-president Solano Lima resigned on July 13. Deputy [[Ra\u00fal Alberto Lastiri]], Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega's son-in-law and also a [[Propaganda Due|P2 member]], was then promoted to the presidency to organize elections. C\u00e1mpora's followers such as Chancellor Juan Carlos Puig and Interior Minister Esteban Righi were immediately replaced by Alberto J. Vignes and Benito Llambi, and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|Ej\u00e9rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo]] (ERP - People's Revolutionary Army) was declared a \"dissolved terrorist organization\". On September 23, Per\u00f3n won the elections with 61.85% of the votes, with his third wife, [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]], as vice-president. Their administration was inaugurated on October 12.\n\nPeronist right-wing factions won a decisive victory and Per\u00f3n assumed the Presidency in October 1973, a month after [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]'s coup in Chile. Violent acts, including by the Triple A, continued to threaten public order. On September 25, 1973, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Rucci, [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT trade-union]]'s Secretary General and Per\u00f3n's friend, was assassinated by the Montoneros. The government resorted to a number of [[Necessity and Urgency Decree|emergency decrees]], including the implementation of special executive authority to deal with violence. This allowed the government to imprison individuals indefinitely without charge.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn his second period in office, Per\u00f3n was committed to achieving political peace through a new alliance of business and labor to promote national reconstruction.

Economic policies were directed at restructuring wages and currency devaluations in order to attract foreign investment capital to Argentina.

In 1971, Chile and Argentina signed an agreement formally submitting the Beagle Channel issue to binding [[Beagle Channel Arbitration]].

In order to achieve a victory, certain objectives had to be reached before the seventh day after the attack. Some military leaders considered this not enough time due to the difficulty involved in transportation through the passes over the Andean Mountains.''<ref>See Alejandro Luis Corbacho ''\"Predicting the probability of war during brinkmanship crisis: The Beagle and the Malvinas conflicts\"'' http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1016843 (p.45)</ref>\nand in cite 46:\n: ''According to Clar\u00edn, two consequences were feared. First, those who were dubious feared a possible regionalization of the conflict. Second, as a consequence, the conflict could acquire great power proportions. In the first case decision makers speculated that Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Brazil might intervene. Then the great powers could take sides. In this case, the resolution of the conflict would depend not on the combatants, but on the countries that supplied the weapons.''\n\nIn December that year, moments before Videla signed a declaration of war against Chile, [[Pope John Paul II]] agreed to [[Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict|mediate]] between the two nations. The Pope's envoy, Cardinal [[Antonio Samor\u00e8]], successfully averted war and proposed a new definitive boundary in which the three disputed islands would remain Chilean. Argentina and Chile both agreed to Samor\u00e9's proposal and signed the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]], ending that dispute.\n\n==New democracy (1983\u2013present)==\n[[Image:Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn1983.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn's Presidential assignment, 1983.]]\n\nOn October 30, 1983, Argentines went to the polls to choose a president; vice-president; and national, provincial, and local officials in elections found by international observers to be fair and honest. The country returned to constitutional rule after [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]], candidate of the [[Radical Civic Union]] (''Uni\u00f3n C\u00edvica Radical'', UCR), received 52% of the popular vote for president. He began a 6-year term of office on December 10, 1983.\n\n===Alfons\u00edn era (1983\u20131989)===\n{{main|Presidency of Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn}}\nFive days later, he created the [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] (CONADEP), led by Argentine writer [[Ernesto S\u00e1bato|Ernesto Sabato]]. However, it was also under Alfons\u00edn's presidency that the December 24, 1986 \"[[Full stop law]]\" was voted, granting amnesty to all acts committed before December 10, 1983, amid pressure from the military. It would not be until June 2005's [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Supreme Court]] decision to overturn all amnesty laws that investigations could be started again.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4093018.stm | work=BBC News | title=Argentine amnesty laws scrapped | date=June 15, 2005}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Alfons\u00edn administration, a [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] with Chile was signed and the roots of the [[Mercosur]] trade bloc were established.\n\nIn 1985 and 1987, large turnouts for mid-term elections demonstrated continued public support for a strong and vigorous democratic system. The UCR-led government took steps to resolve some of the nation's most pressing problems, including accounting for those who [[desaparecidos|disappeared]] during military rule, establishing [[civilian control of the military|civilian control of the armed forces]], and consolidating democratic institutions. One of the biggest achievements of the Alfons\u00edn administration was the reduction of corruption in public offices, which was reduced by half during his administration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nHowever, constant friction with the military, failure to resolve several economic problems inherited from the military dictatorship and great opposition from the labor unions undermined the effectiveness of the Alfons\u00edn government, which left office six months early after Peronist candidate [[Carlos Menem]] won the [[Argentine general election, 1989|1989 presidential elections]].\n\n===Menemist decade (1989\u201399)===\n{{See also|Washington Consensus}}\n\n[[File:Carlos menem.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Carlos Menem]], President throughout the 1990s]]\nAs President, [[Carlos Menem]] launched a major overhaul of Argentine domestic policy. Large-scale structural reforms dramatically reversed the role of the state in Argentine economic life. Ironically, the Peronist Menem oversaw the [[privatization]] of many of the industries Per\u00f3n had nationalized.\n\nA decisive leader pressing a controversial agenda, Menem was not reluctant to use the presidency's powers to issue \"emergency\" decrees (formally ''[[Necessity and Urgency Decree]]s'') when the Congress was unable to reach consensus on his proposed reforms. Those powers were curtailed somewhat when the constitution was reformed in 1994 as a result of the so-called [[Pact of Olivos]] with the opposition Radical Party. That arrangement opened the way for Menem to seek and win reelection with 50% of the vote in the three-way 1995 presidential race. [[Piquetero]] movement rose.\n\nThe 1995 election saw the emergence of the moderate-left [[Front for a Country in Solidarity|FrePaSo]] political alliance. This alternative to the two traditional political parties in Argentina was particularly strong in Buenos Aires but lacked the national infrastructure of the Peronists and Radicals. In an important development in Argentina's political life, all three major parties in the 1999 race espoused [[free market]] economic policies.\n\n===New millennium crisis (1999\u20132003)===\n{{Main|1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression}}\n\n====De La R\u00faa presidency (1999\u20132001)====\n{{Main|Fernando de la R\u00faa#Presidency}}\n{{See also|1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression#The_crisis}}\n\nIn October 1999, the [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]]&ndash;[[FrePaSo]] [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education|''Alianza'']]'s presidential candidate, [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], defeated Peronist candidate [[Eduardo Duhalde]]. Having taken office in December 1999, De la R\u00faa followed an [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]-sponsored program of government spending cuts, revenue increases, and provincial revenue-sharing reforms to get the federal [[fiscal deficit]] under control, and pursued [[labour market flexibility|labor market flexibilization]] and business-promotion measures aimed at stimulating foreign investment, so as to avoid [[default (finance)|defaulting the public debt]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nTowards the end of 2001, Argentina faced grave economic problems. The IMF pressed Argentina to service its [[external debt]], effectively forcing Argentina to [[devaluation|devalue]] the Argentine peso, which had been pegged to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]], or alternatively fully [[dollarize]] its economy. Deep budget cuts, including a 13% reduction in pay for the nation's 2 million public sector employees, failed to curb the rapidly increasing [[country risk]] on almost U$100 billion in Argentine bonds, increasing debt service costs and further limiting access to international credit, despite a moderately successful debt swap arranged by Minister Cavallo with most bondholders. Voters reacted to the rapidly worsening economy in the [[Argentine legislative election, 2001|October 2001 midterm elections]] by both depriving the Alliance of its majority in the Lower House, and by casting a record 25% of [[spoiled ballot]]s.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1598855.stm|title=Poll rebuke for Argentine president|date=15 October 2001|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Corralito (2001)====\n[[File:Crisis 20 diciembre 2001.jpg|thumb|Police intervention in the 2001 riots]]\nOn November 1, 2001, as people's fears that the peso would be devalued caused massive withdrawal of [[bank deposit]]s and [[capital flight]], de la R\u00faa's Minister of Economy [[Domingo Cavallo]] passed regulations severely limiting withdrawals, effectively freezing the peso-denominated assets of the Argentine [[middle class]], while dollar-denominated foreign accounts were, by its very nature, shielded from devaluation. (The freezing of the bank accounts was informally named ''[[corralito]]''.){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe overall economy declined drastically during December 2001. [[December 2001 riots in Argentina|The resulting riots]] led to dozens of deaths. The Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo resigned, but that did not prevent the collapse of De la R\u00faa's administration. On December 20 de la R\u00faa also resigned, but the political crisis was extremely serious, as a result of the previous resignation of the vice-president [[Carlos \u00c1lvarez (politician)|Carlos ''Chacho'' \u00c1lvarez]] in 2000. The president of the Senate became [[ad interim|interim]] president until the National Congress elected, two days later, [[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]] to finish De la R\u00faa's term. But Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 resigned a week later on December 31, leaving the power to the president of the Chamber of Deputies (as the Senate was undergoing their annual renovation of its president) as interim.\n\nFinally, on January 2, 2002, the National Congress elected the Peronist [[Eduardo Duhalde]], a losing candidate in the most recent presidential election, as. president. The peso was first devalued by 29%, and then the dollar peg was abandoned; by July 2002, the national currency had [[depreciation (currency)|depreciated]] to one-quarter of its former value.\n\n====Recovery (2002\u201303)====\nPresident Duhalde faced a country in turmoil. His administration had to deal with a wave of protests (middle-class [[cacerolazo]]s and unemployed [[piquetero]]s), and did so with a relatively tolerant policy, intending to minimize violence. As inflation became a serious issue and the effects of the crisis became apparent in the form of increased unemployment and poverty, Duhalde chose a moderate, low-profile economist, [[Roberto Lavagna]], as his Minister of Economy. The economic measures implemented brought inflation under control.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nAfter a year, Duhalde deemed his tasks fulfilled and, pressured by certain political factors, called for elections, which in April 2003 brought [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]], the left-of-centre Peronist governor of [[Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz]], to power.\n\n===Kirchner governments (2003\u20132015)===\n{{Main|N\u00e9stor Kirchner|Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner}}\n{{See also|Kirchnerism|Pink tide}}\n\n[[File:Cristina baston Kirchner.jpg|thumb|250px|[[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] hands the presidential mandate to his wife, [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]].]]\n\nPresident Kirchner took office on May 25, 2003.

With the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] on July 9, 1816 and the military defeat of the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1824, a federal state was formed in 1853-1861, known today as the [[Argentine Republic]].\n\n==Pre-Columbian era==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The [[Cueva de las Manos|Cave of the Hands]] in [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz Province]], with indigenous artwork dating from 13,000\u20139,000 years ago.\n| image2 = Pucar\u00e1 de Tilcara 01.JPG\n| width2 = 250\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = The fortification of ''[[Pucar\u00e1 de Tilcara]]'' in [[Jujuy Province]], part of the [[Inca Empire]].\n| footer = \n}}\nThe area now known as Argentina was relatively sparsely populated until the period of European colonization.

The Guaran\u00ed had expanded across large areas of South America, but settled in the northeastern provinces of Argentina. The Toba (Komlek) nation and the [[Diaguita nation|Diaguita]] which included the Calchaqui and the Quilmes lived in the North and the Comechingones in what is today the province of Cordoba. The Charr\u00faa (which included the Minuane), [[yaro]]s, [[Boh\u00e1n]] and Chan\u00e1 (and Chan\u00e1-Timb\u00fa) were people located in the actual territory of Entre R\u00edos and the [[Querand\u00ed people|Querand\u00ed]] in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn the late 15th century, the Native tribes of the [[Quebrada de Humahuaca]] were conquered by the [[Inca Empire]], under [[Topa Inca Yupanqui]], to secure the supply of metals such as silver, zinc, and copper. The Incan domination of the area lasted for about half a century and ended with the arrival of the Spanish in 1536.<ref name=\"Hennessy1999\">{{cite book|author=Huw Hennessy|title=Insight Guide Argentina|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WNOm_mfkxmYC&pg=PA33|date=November 1999|publisher=Langenscheidt Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-88729-031-2|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Spanish colonial era==\n{{See also|Viceroyalty of Peru|Government of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|May Revolution}}\nEuropeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 Portuguese voyage of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci (explorer)|Amerigo Vespucci]].

In 1536 [[Pedro de Mendoza]] established a small settlement at the modern location of [[Buenos Aires]], which was abandoned in 1541.<ref name=\"Mitre, p. 8-9\">Mitre, p. 8-9</ref>\n\nA second one was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], and [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] in 1573 by [[Jer\u00f3nimo Luis de Cabrera]]. Those regions were part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], whose capital was Lima, and settlers arrived from that city. Unlike the other regions of South America, the colonization of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary was not influenced by any [[gold rush]], since it lacked any [[precious metal]]s to mine.<ref name=\"Mitre, p. 8-9\"/>\n\nThe natural ports on the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] [[estuary]] could not be used because all shipments were meant to be made through the port of [[Callao]] near [[Lima]], a condition that led to [[contraband]] becoming the normal means of commerce in cities such as [[Asunci\u00f3n]], [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Montevideo]].<ref>Abad de Santill\u00e1n, p. 391 {{Lang-es|Los ingleses tuvieron en las colonias espa\u00f1olas, a pesar del monopolio comercial metropolitano, fuertes intereses: el comercio il\u00edcito se aproximaba en su monto casi al valor del autorizado por Espa\u00f1a; el contrabando se convirti\u00f3 en un medio importante de vida para los propios colonos y tambi\u00e9n para los gobernantes encargados de reprimirlo.}}<br>\n{{Lang-en|The British had in the Spanish colonies, despite the metropolitan monopoly on commerce, strong interests: legal commerce had amounts near the value of that authorized by Spain; smuggling became an important way to survive for colonials themselves and also for the governors in charge of stopping it.}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish raised the status of this region by establishing the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] in 1776. This viceroyalty consisted of today's Argentina, [[Uruguay]], and [[Paraguay]], as well as much of present-day [[Bolivia]]. Buenos Aires, now holding the customs of the new political subdivision, became a flourishing port, as the revenues from the [[Potos\u00ed]], the increasing maritime activity in terms of goods rather than [[precious metal]]s, the production of [[cattle]] for the [[export]] of [[leather]] and other products, and other political reasons, made it gradually become one of the most important commercial centers of the region.\n\nThe viceroyalty was, however, short-lived due to lack of internal cohesion among its many regions and lack of Spanish support. Ships from Spain became scarce again after the Spanish defeat at the [[battle of Trafalgar]], that gave the British maritime supremacy. The British tried to [[British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata|invade]] Buenos Aires and Montevideo in 1806 and 1807, but were defeated both times by [[Santiago de Liniers]]. Those victories, achieved without help from mainland Spain, boosted the confidence of the city.<ref>Luna, ''Independencia...'', p. 28</ref>\n\nThe beginning of the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain and the capture of the Spanish king [[Ferdinand VII]] created great concern all around the viceroyalty. It was thought that, without a King, people in America should rule themselves. This idea led to multiple attempts to remove the local authorities at [[Chuquisaca Revolution|Chuquisaca]], [[La Paz revolution|La Paz]], Montevideo and [[Mutiny of \u00c1lzaga|Buenos Aires]], all of which were short-lived. A new successful attempt, the [[May Revolution]] of 1810, took place when it was reported that all of Spain, with the exception of C\u00e1diz and Le\u00f3n, had been conquered.\n\n==War of independence==\n{{Main|Argentine War of Independence}}\n{{See also|Primera Junta|Junta Grande|First Triumvirate (Argentina)|Second Triumvirate (Argentina)}}\n\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn (retrato, c.1828).jpg|thumb|alt=oil paining of Jose' e San Martin|Portrait of [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]].]]\nThe May Revolution ousted the viceroy. Other forms of government, such as a [[constitutional monarchy]] or a [[Regent|Regency]] were briefly considered. \nThe viceroyalty was also renamed, and it nominally became the [[United Provinces of South America|United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]]. However, the status of the different territories that had belonged to the viceroyalty changed many times during the course of the war, as some regions would remain loyal to their previous governors and others were captured or recaptured; later these would [[balkanize|split]] into several countries.\n\nThe first military campaigns against the royalists were waged by [[Manuel Belgrano]] and [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli]]. The [[Primera Junta]], after expanding to become the [[Junta Grande]], was replaced by the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|First Triumvirate]]. A [[Second Triumvirate (Argentina)|Second Triumvirate]] would replace it years later, calling for the [[Asamblea del A\u00f1o XIII|Assembly of year XIII]] that was meant to declare independence and write a [[constitution]]. However, it did not do either, and replaced the triumvirates with a single head of state office, the [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Supreme Director]].\n\nBy this time [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] arrived in Buenos Aires with other generals of the [[Peninsular War]]. They gave new strength to the Revolutionary war, which was marked by the defeat of Belgrano and Castelli and the royalist resistance at the Banda Oriental. Alvear took Montevideo, and San Mart\u00edn started a military campaign that would span an important part of the Spanish territories in America. He created the [[Army of the Andes]] in Mendoza and, with the help of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] and other Chileans, he made the [[Crossing of the Andes]] and liberated Chile. With the Chilean navy at his disposal, he moved to Peru, liberating that country as well. San Mart\u00edn met [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] at [[Guayaquil conference|Guayaquil]], and retired from action.\n\nA new assembly, the [[Congress of Tucum\u00e1n]], was called while San Mart\u00edn was preparing the crossing of the Andes. It finally [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Spain or any other foreign power. [[Bolivia]] declared itself independent in 1825, and [[Uruguay]] was created in 1828 as a result of the [[Cisplatine War]].\n\nThe United Kingdom officially recognized Argentine independence in 1825, with the signing of a ''Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation'' on February 2; the British [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in Buenos Aires, [[Woodbine Parish]], signed on behalf of his country. Spanish recognition of Argentine independence was not to come for several decades.\n\n== Historical map ==\nThe map below is based on a wide range of antique maps for the periods shown and is intended to give a broad idea of the changes in the State of Argentina in the nineteenth century.  The periods are broad and plus or minus about a decade around each date.  The hatched areas are disputed or subject to change during the period, the text in this article will explain these changes.

Unitarians thought that Buenos Aires should lead the less-developed provinces, as the head of a strong [[centralized government]]. Federalists thought instead that the country should be a [[federation]] of autonomous provinces, like the United States. During this period, the government would kidnap protestors, and torture them for information.\n\nDuring this period, the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata lacked a head of state, since the unitarian defeat at the [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|Battle of Cepeda]] had ended the authority of the Supreme Directors and the [[Argentine Constitution of 1819|1819 Constitution]]. There was a new attempt in 1826 to write a constitution, leading to the designation of [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] as [[President of Argentina]], but it was rejected by the provinces. Rivadavia resigned due to the poor management at the [[Cisplatine War]], and the 1826 constitution was repealed.\n\nDuring this time, the [[Governor of Buenos Aires Province|Governors of Buenos Aires Province]] received the power to manage the international relations of the confederation, including war and debt payment. The dominant figure of this period was the federalist [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], who is portrayed from different angles by the diverse historiographic flows in Argentina: liberal history usually considers him a dictator, while revisionists support him on the grounds of his defense of national sovereignty.<ref>{{Cite book\n|title= Historia de la Historiograf\u00eda Argentina\n|last= Devoto\n|first= Fernando\n |author2=Pagano, Nora\n|year= 2009\n|publisher= Editorial Sudamericana\n|location= Buenos Aires\n|isbn= 978-950-07-3076-1\n|page= 202\n}}</ref>\n\nHe ruled the province of Buenos Aires from 1829 to 1852, facing military threats from secession attempts, neighboring countries, and even European nations. Although Rosas was a Federalist, he kept the customs receipts of Buenos Aires under the exclusive control of the city, whereas the other provinces expected to have a part of the revenue. Rosas considered this a fair measure because only Buenos Aires was paying the [[external debt]] generated by the [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers]] loan to Rivadavia, the war of independence and the war against Brazil. He developed a paramilitary force of his own, the [[Sociedad Popular Restauradora|Popular Restorer Society]], commonly known as \"''Mazorca''\" (\"Corncob\").\n\nRosas' reluctance to call for a new assembly to write a constitution led General [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]] from [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre R\u00edos]] to turn against him. Urquiza defeated Rosas during the [[battle of Caseros]] and called for such an assembly. The [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]] is, with amendments, still in force to this day. The Constitution was not immediately accepted by Buenos Aires, which seceded from the Confederation; it rejoined a few years later. In 1862 [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] became the first president of the unified country.\n\n==Liberal Governments (1862\u20131880)==\n{{See also|Argentine Constitution of 1853|Conquest of the Desert|Generation of '80|South American dreadnought race}}\n\n[[File:Sarmiento (1873).jpg|thumb|alt=black and white photograph of President Domingo Faustino|President [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]].]]\nThe presidency of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] saw an economic improvement in Argentina, with agricultural modernization, foreign investment, new railroads and ports and a wave of immigration from Europe. Mitre also stabilized the political system by commanding federal interventions that defeated the personal armies of caudillos [[Chacho Pe\u00f1aloza]] and [[Juan S\u00e1a]]. Argentina joined Uruguay and Brazil against Paraguay in the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], which ended during Sarmiento's rule with the defeat of Paraguay and the annexation of part of its territory by Argentina.\n\nDespite victory in the war, Mitre's popularity declined severely because a broad section of the Argentine population was opposed to the war due to the alliance with Brazil (Argentina's historic rival) that took place during the war, and the betrayal of Paraguay (which had been until then one of the country's most important economic allies). One of the major hallmarks of Mitre's presidency was the \"Law of Compromise\", in which Buenos Aires joined the Argentine Republic and allowed the government to use the City of Buenos Aires as the center of government, but without federalizing the city and by reserving the right of the province of Buenos Aires to secede from the nation if conflict arose.\n\nIn 1868 Mitre was succeeded by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], who promoted public education, culture, [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] ; as well as the modernization of the [[Argentine Army|Army]] and the [[Argentine Navy|Navy]]. Sarmiento managed to defeat the last known caudillos and also dealt with the fallout of the Triple Alliance War, which included a decrease in national production due to the death of thousands of soldiers and an outbreak of diseases, such as [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]], brought by returning soldiers.\n\nIn 1874 [[Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda]] became president and ran into trouble when he had to deal with the economic depression left by the [[Panic of 1873]]. Most of these economic issues were solved when new land was opened for development after the expansion of national territory through the [[Conquest of the Desert]], led by his war minister [[Julio Argentino Roca]]. This military campaign took most of the territories under the control of natives, and reduced their population.\n\nIn 1880 a trade conflict caused turmoil in Buenos Aires, which led governor [[Carlos Tejedor (politician)|Carlos Tejedor]] to declare secession from the republic. Avellaneda denied them this right, breaking the Law of Compromise, and proceeded to send army troops led by Roca to take over the province. Tejedor's secession efforts were defeated and Buenos Aires joined the republic definitively, federalizing the city of Buenos Aires and handing it over to the government as the nation's capital city.\n\n==National Autonomist hegemony (1880\u20131916)==\n{{see also|Argentine\u2013Chilean naval arms race|South American dreadnought race}}\n[[File:Julio A Roca.jpg|thumb|200px|President [[Julio Argentino Roca]], the central political figure of the PAN Hegemony years.]]\n\nAfter his surge in popularity due to his successful desert campaign, Julio Roca was elected president in 1880 as the candidate for the [[National Autonomist Party]] (Partido Autonomista Nacional - PAN), a party that would remain in power until 1916. During his presidency, Roca created a net of political alliances and installed several measures that helped him retain almost absolute control of the Argentine political scene throughout the 1880s. This keen ability with political strategy earned him his nickname of \"''The Fox''\".\n\nThe country's economy benefited from a change from [[extensive farming]] to [[industrial agriculture]] and a huge [[Great European immigration wave to Argentina|European immigration]], but there wasn't yet a strong move towards [[industrialization]]. At that time, Argentina received some of the highest levels of foreign investment in Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In the midst of this economic expansion, the [[Argentine Law 1420|Law 1420 of Common Education]] of 1884 guaranteed universal, free, non-religious education to all children. This and other government policies were strongly opposed by the [[Roman Catholicism in Argentina|Roman Catholic Church in Argentina]], causing the [[Holy See]] to break off diplomatic relations with the country for several years and setting the stage for decades of continued [[Church\u2013state relations in Argentina|Church\u2013state strain]].\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Argentina temporarily resolved its border disputes with Chile with the [[Puna de Atacama dispute]] of 1899, the [[Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] and the [[1902 General Treaty of Arbitration]]. Roca's government and those that followed were aligned with the Argentine [[oligarchy]], especially the great land owners.\n[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA 1881.png|thumb|180px|left|Under General Roca, the [[Conquest of the Desert]] extended Argentine power into [[Patagonia]].]]\n\nIn 1888, [[Miguel Ju\u00e1rez Celman]] became president after Roca was constitutionally disqualified from re-election; Celman attempted to reduce Roca's control over the political scene, which earned him his predecessor's opposition. Roca led a great opposition movement against Celman, which coupled with the devastating effects that the [[Long Depression]] had on the Argentine economy, allowed the [[Civic Union (Argentina)|Civic opposition party]] to start a coup d'\u00e9tat which would be later known as the [[Revolution of the Park]]. The Revolution was led by the three main leaders of the Civic Union, [[Leandro Alem]], former president [[Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre]] and moderate socialist [[Juan B. Justo]]. Though it failed in its main goals, the revolution forced Ju\u00e1rez Celman's resignation and marked the decline of the [[Generation of '80]].\n\nIn 1891, Roca proposed that the Civic Union elect someone to be vice-president to his own presidency the next time elections came around. One group led by Mitre decided to take the deal, while another more intransigent group led by Alem was opposed. This eventually led to the split of the Civic Union into the [[National Civic Union (Argentina)]], led by Mitre, and the [[Radical Civic Union]], led by Alem. After this division occurred, Roca withdrew his offer, having completed his plan to divide the Civic Union and decrease their power. Alem would eventually commit suicide in 1896; control of the Radical Civic Union went to his nephew and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen]].\n\nAfter Celman's downfall, his vice-president [[Carlos Pellegrini]] took over and proceeded to resolve the economic crisis which afflicted the country, earning him the moniker of \"''The Storm Sailor''\". Fearing another wave of opposition from Roca like the one imposed on Celman, Pellegrini remained moderate in his presidency ending his predecessor's efforts to distance \"''The Fox''\" from political control. The following governments up until 1898 took similar measures and sided with Roca to avoid being politically chastised.\n\nIn 1898, Roca became president again in a politically unstable situation, with a large number of social conflicts that included massive strikes and anarchist subversion attempts. Roca handled most of these conflicts by having the police or the army crack down on protestors, rebels and suspected rebels. After the end of his second presidency, Roca fell ill and his role in political affairs began to decrease gradually until his death in late 1914.\n\nIn 1904, [[Alfredo Palacios]], a member of [[Juan B. Justo]]'s [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]] (founded in 1896), became the first Socialist deputy in Argentina, as a representative for the working-class neighborhood of [[La Boca]] in Buenos Aires.

Being a progressive member of the PAN, [[Roque S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a]] recognized the need to satisfy the demand by public to maintain the existing regime. After being elected as President in 1910, he passed the [[S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a Law]] in 1912 which made the political vote mandatory, secret and universal among males aged eighteen or more. His intention was not to allow the transition of power to Uni\u00f3n C\u00edvica Radical but to increase public support for the PAN by enabling the universal electoral suffrage. However, the consequence was the opposite of what he intended to accomplish: The following election chose Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen as the president in 1916, and it ended the hegemony of the PAN.\n\n==Radical governments (1916\u201330)==\n{{Main|History of Argentina (1916\u201330)}}\n{{See also|Radical Civic Union}}\n\n[[File:Yrigoyen en ventanilla del ferrocarril viaje a Santa Fe campa\u00f1a electoral de 1926..jpg|thumb|President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen]].]]\nConservative forces dominated Argentine politics until 1916, when the Radicals, led by [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen]], won control of the government through the first national elections under universal male suffrage. 745,000 citizens were allowed to vote, of a total population of 7.5 million (immigrants, who represented much of the population, were not allowed to vote); of these, 400,000 abstained.<ref>[[Felipe Pigna]], ''Los Mitos de la Historia Argentina, 3'', 2006, ed. Planeta, p.38</ref>\n\nYrigoyen, however, only obtained 45% of the votes, which did not allow him a majority in Parliament, where the conservatives remained the leading force. Thus, of 80 draft laws proposed by the executive, only 26 were voted through by the conservative majority.<ref name=\"Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.42\">Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.42</ref> A moderate agricultural reform proposal was rejected by Parliament, as was an income tax on interest, and the creation of a Bank of the Republic (which was to have the missions of the current [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]]).<ref name=\"Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.42\"/>\n\nDespite this conservative opposition, the [[Radical Civic Union]] (UCR), with their emphasis on fair elections and democratic institutions, opened their doors to Argentina's expanding middle class as well as to social groups previously excluded from power.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Yrigoyen's policy was to \"fix\" the system, by enacting necessary reforms which would enable the agroindustrial export model to preserve itself.<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.39</ref> It alternated moderate social reforms with repression of the social movements. In 1918, a student movement started at the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba|University of C\u00f3rdoba]], which eventually led to the [[Argentine university reform of 1918|University Reform]], which quickly spread to the rest of Latin America.

Despite being called on by some to initiate a coup against Yrigoyen, he remained loyal to the President, on the sole condition that the latter would allow him a free hand in the repression of the demonstrations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Social movements thereafter continued in the ''[[La Forestal|Forestal]]'' British company, and in [[Patagonia]], where Hector Varela headed the military repression, assisted by the [[Argentine Patriotic League]], killing 1,500.<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.100</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Yrigoyen's administration enacted the [[Labor laws|Labor Code]] establishing the [[right to strike]] in 1921, implemented [[minimum wage]] laws and collective contracts. It also initiated the creation of the ''[[Direcci\u00f3n General de Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales]]'' (YPF), the state oil company, in June 1922. Radicalism rejected [[class struggle]] and advocated social conciliation.<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.44</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Radicals continued Argentina's neutrality policy during World War I, despite the United States urging them to declare war against the [[Central Powers]]. Neutrality enabled Argentina to export goods to Europe, in particular to Great Britain, as well as to issue credit to the belligerent powers. Germany sank two Argentine civilian ships, ''Monte Protegido'' on April 4, 1917 and the ''Toro'', but the diplomatic incident ended only with the expulsion of the German ambassador, [[Karl von Luxburg]]. Yrigoyen organized a Conference of Neutral Powers in Buenos Aires, to oppose the United States' attempt to bring American states in the European war, and also supported [[Augusto Sandino|Sandino]]'s resistance in [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]].<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.58</ref>\n\nIn September 1922, Yrigoyen's administration refused to follow the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' policy enacted against the Soviet Union, and, basing its policy on the assistance given to Austria after the war, decided to send to the USSR 5 million pesos in assistance.<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.59</ref>\n\nThe same year, Yrigoyen was replaced by his rival inside the UCR, [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear]], an aristocrat, who defeated [[Norberto Pi\u00f1ero]]'s ''[[Concentraci\u00f3n Nacional]]'' (conservatives)  with 458,457 votes to 200,080. Alvear brought to his cabinet personalities belonging to the traditional ruling classes, such as [[Jos\u00e9 Nicol\u00e1s Matienzo]] at the Interior Ministry, [[\u00c1ngel Gallardo (politician)|\u00c1ngel Gallardo]] in Foreign Relations, [[Agust\u00edn P. Justo]] at the War Ministry, [[Manuel Domecq Garc\u00eda]] at the Marine and [[Rafael Herrera Vegas]] at the Haciendas. Alvear's supporters founded the ''[[Uni\u00f3n C\u00edvica Radical Antipersonalista]]'', opposed to Yrigoyen's party.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nDuring the early 1920s, the rise of the anarchist movement, fueled by the arrival of recent \u00e9migr\u00e9s and deportees from Europe, spawned a new generation of left-wing activism in Argentina.  The new left, mostly anarchists and [[anarcho-communists]], rejected the incremental progressivism of the old Radical and Socialist elements in Argentina in favor of immediate action.  The extremists, such as [[Severino Di Giovanni]], openly espoused violence and '[[Propaganda of the deed|propaganda by the deed]]'.  A wave of bombings and shootouts with police culminated in an attempt to assassinate U.S. President [[Herbert Hoover]] on his visit to Argentina in 1928 and a nearly successful attempt to assassinate Yrigoyen in 1929 after he was re-elected to the presidency.\n\nIn 1921, the [[counter-revolutionary]] ''[[Logia General San Mart\u00edn]]'' was founded, and diffused nationalist ideas in the [[Armed Forces of Argentina|military]] until its dissolution in 1926. Three years later, the ''[[Liga Republicana]]'' (Republican League) was founded by [[Roberto de Laferr\u00e8re]], on the model of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Blackshirts]] in Italy. The Argentine Right found its major influences in the 19th-century Spanish writer [[Marcelino Men\u00e9ndez y Pelayo]] and in the French royalist [[Charles Maurras]].<ref>Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.125-128</ref>  Also in 1922, the poet [[Leopoldo Lugones]], who had turned towards [[fascism]], made a famous speech in [[Lima]], known as \"the time of the sword\", in the presence of the War Minister and future dictator Agust\u00edn P. Justo, which called for a military coup and the establishment of a military dictatorship.\n\nIn 1928, Yrigoyen was re-elected as president and began a series of reforms to increase workers' rights. This intensified the conservative opposition against Yrigoyen, which grew even stronger after Argentina was devastated by the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] after the [[Wall Street Crash]]. On September 6, 1930, a military coup led by the pro-fascist general [[Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Uriburu]] overthrew Yrigoyen's government and began a period in Argentine history known as the [[Infamous Decade]].\n\nDuring the Great Depression, exports of frozen beef, especially to Great Britain, provided much needed foreign currency, but trade fell off sharply.<ref>E. G. Jones, \"The Argentine Refrigerated Meat Industry,\" ''Economica'' (1929) #26 pp. 156-172 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2548200 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Infamous Decade (1930\u201343)==\n{{Main|Infamous Decade}}\n\n[[File:Vista de Puerto Madero - Aduana de Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|300px|The training ship ''[[ARA Presidente Sarmiento|Sarmiento]]'' and the Ministry of Defense, Buenos Aires.]]\nIn 1929, Argentina was wealthy by world standards, but the prosperity ended after 1929 with the worldwide [[Great Depression in Latin America|Great Depression]]. In 1930, a military coup, supported by the [[Argentine Patriotic League]], forced Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen from power, and replaced him with [[Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Uriburu]].  Support for the coup was bolstered by the sagging Argentine economy, as well as a string of bomb attacks and shootings involving radical anarchists, which alienated moderate elements of Argentine society and angered the conservative right, which had long been agitating for decisive action by the military forces.\n\nThe military coup initiated during the period known as the \"[[Infamous Decade]]\", characterized by [[electoral fraud]], persecution of the [[opposition (politics)|political opposition]] (mainly against the [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]]) and pervasive government corruption, against the background of the global depression.\n\nDuring his brief tenure as president, Uriburu cracked down heavily on anarchists and other far-left groups, resulting in 2,000 illegal executions of members of anarchist and communist groups. The most famous (and perhaps most symbolic of anarchism's decay in Argentina at the time) was the execution of Severino Di Giovanni, who was captured in late January 1931 and executed on the first of February of the same year.\n\nAfter becoming president through the coup, Uriburu attempted to create a constitutional reform that would include [[corporatism]] in the Argentine Constitution. This move toward fascism was viewed negatively by the conservative backers of the coup and they turned their support to the more moderate conservative general [[Agust\u00edn P. Justo]], who won the presidency in a 1932 election that was heavily fraudulent.\n\nJusto began a policy of liberal economic moves that primarily benefitted the nation's upper classes and permitted great political and industrial corruption at the expense of national growth. One of the most infamous decisions of Justo's government was the creation of the [[Roca\u2013Runciman Treaty]] between Argentina and the United Kingdom, which benefitted the British economy and the rich beef producers of Argentina.\n\nIn 1935, progressive democrat Senator [[Lisandro de la Torre]] began an investigation into several corruption allegations within the Argentine beef production industry, during which he attempted to charge Justo's Minister of Agriculture, Luis Duhau, and the Minister of Finance, Federico Pinedo, with political corruption and fraud charges. During the exposition of the investigation in the National Congress, Duhau started a fight among the senators, during which his bodyguard, Ram\u00f3n Valdez-Cora, tried to kill De La Torre but accidentally ended up shooting De La Torre's friend and political partner [[Enzo Bordabehere]]. The meat investigation was dropped soon afterward, but not before De La Torre managed to achieve the incarceration of the head of the ''Anglo'' meat company for corruption charges. De la Torre would later commit suicide in 1939.\n\nThe collapse of international trade led to industrial growth focused on [[import substitution]], leading to a stronger economic independence. Political conflict increased, marked by confrontation between right-wing [[fascism|fascist]]s and leftist radicals, while military-oriented conservatives controlled the government. Though many claimed the polls to be fraudulent, [[Roberto Ortiz]] was elected president in 1937 and took office the next year, but due to his fragile health he was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Ram\u00f3n Castillo]]. Castillo effectively took power in 1940; he formally assumed leadership in 1942.\n\n==Revolution of '43 (1943\u201346)==\n{{main|1943 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat}}\n{{See also|Argentina during World War II}}\nThe civilian government appeared to be close to joining the Allies, but many officers of the Argentine armed forces (and ordinary Argentine citizens) objected due to fear of the spread of communism. There was a wide support to stay neutral in the conflict, as during World War I. The government was also questioned for domestic policy reasons, namely, electoral fraud, poor labour rights, and the selection of Patr\u00f3n Costas to run for the presidency.\n\nOn June 4, 1943, the [[United Officers' Group]] (GOU), which was a secret alliance between military leaders led by [[Pedro Pablo Ram\u00edrez]], [[Arturo Rawson]], [[Edelmiro Farrell]], and Farrell's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Juan Per\u00f3n]], marched to the [[Casa Rosada]] and demanded the resignation of president Castillo. After hours of threats, their goal was achieved and the president resigned. This event is considered by historians to be the official end of the Infamous Decade.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nAfter the coup, Ram\u00edrez took power. Although he did not declare war, he broke off relations with the [[Axis powers]]. Argentina's largest neighbor, Brazil, had already entered the war on the Allied side in 1942.\n\nIn 1944 Ramirez was replaced by Farrell, an army officer of Irish-Argentine origin who had spent two years attached to Mussolini's army in the twenties.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Initially, his government continued to maintain a neutral policy. Towards the end of the war, Farrell decided it was in the interests of Argentina to be attached to the winning side. Like several Latin American states, Argentina made a late declaration of war against Germany with no intention of providing any military forces.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nJuan Per\u00f3n managed relations with labourers and unions, and became highly popular. He was deposed and detained on [[Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda Island]], but a massive demonstration on October 17, 1945, forced the government to free Per\u00f3n and restore him to office. Per\u00f3n would win the elections shortly afterward by a landslide. The US ambassador, [[Spruille Braden]], took direct action in Argentine politics supporting the antiperonist parties.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Peronist years (1946\u201355)==\n{{See also|Juan Per\u00f3n|Peronism|Eva Per\u00f3n}}\n{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:Juan Peron con banda de presidente.jpg|thumb|200px|President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] (1946).]]\n\nIn 1946 General [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] became president; his populist ideology became known as [[peronism]].

He went into exile, eventually settling in [[Francoist Spain]].\n\n==''Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora'' (1955\u20131958)==\n{{Further|Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora}}\nIn Argentina, the 1950s and 1960s were marked by frequent [[coups d'\u00e9tat]], low economic growth in the 1950s and high growth rates in the 1960s.  Argentina faced problems of continued social and labor demands. Argentine painter [[Antonio Berni]]'s works reflected the social tragedies of these times, painting in particular life in the ''[[villas miseria]]'' (shanty towns).\n\nFollowing the ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' military coup, [[Eduardo Lonardi]] held power only briefly and was succeeded by [[Pedro Aramburu]], president from November 13, 1955, to May 1, 1958. In June 1956, two Peronist generals, [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Valle]] and [[Raul Tanco]], attempted a coup against Aramburu, criticizing an important purge in the army, the abrogation of social reforms and persecution of trade-union leaders. They also demanded liberation of all political and labor activists and a return to constitutional order. The uprising was quickly crushed. General Valle and other members of the military were executed, and twenty civilians were arrested at their homes and their bodies were thrown in the Le\u00f3n Suarez dumping ground.\n\nAlong with the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo|June 1955 Casa Rosada bombing]] on the [[Plaza de Mayo]], the Le\u00f3n Suarez massacre is one of the important events that started a cycle of violence. Pedro Aramburu was later kidnapped and executed for this massacre, in 1970, by Fernando Abal Medina, Emilio Angel Maza, [[Mario Firmenich]] and others, who would later form the ''[[Montoneros]]'' movement.<ref>Julio A. Troxler, a \"revolutionary Peronist\", was one of the few men who escaped the massacre. All the others were dumped in Le\u00f3n Suarez, in [[Buenos Aires Province]]. [[Rodolfo Walsh]] noted Troxler's testimony in ''Operation Massacre''. In 1973, under C\u00e1mpora's government, Troxler became Buenos Aires police chief, but was assassinated by the Triple A during Isabel Per\u00f3n's government. Rodolfo Walsh was murdered after Videla's 1976 coup.</ref>\n\nIn 1956, special elections were held to reform the constitution. The Radical Party under [[Ricardo Balb\u00edn]] won a majority, although 25% of all ballots were turned in the blank as a protest by the banned Peronist party. Also in support of Peronism, the left wing of the Radical Party, led by [[Arturo Frondizi]], left the Constitutional Assembly. The Assembly was severely damaged by this defection and was only able to restore the Constitution of 1853 with the sole addition of the Article 14 ''bis'', which enumerated some social rights.\n\n==Fragile radical administrations (1958\u20131966)==\n[[File:Frondizi.jpg|thumb|200px|President [[Arturo Frondizi]].]]\nA ban on [[Peronist]] expression and representation continued during the fragile civilian governments of the period 1958\u20131966. Frondizi, UCRI's candidate, won the presidential elections of 1958, obtaining approximately 4,000,000 votes against 2,500,000 for Ricardo Balb\u00edn (with 800,000 neutral votes). From [[Caracas]], Per\u00f3n supported Frondizi and called upon his supporters to vote for him, as a means toward the end of prohibition of the Peronist movement and the re-establishment of the workers' social legislation voted during Per\u00f3n's leadership.\n\nOn one hand, Frondizi appointed [[\u00c1lvaro Alsogaray]] as [[Minister of Economy (Argentina)|Minister of Economy]] to placate powerful agrarian interests and other conservatives. A member of the powerful military dynasty [[Alsogaray]], \u00c1lvaro, who had already been Minister of Industry under [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu|Aramburu]]'s military rule, devalued the peso and imposed credit control.\n\nOn the other hand, Frondizi followed a laicist program, which raised concerns among the Catholic nationalist forces, leading to the organization, between 1960 and 1962, of the far-right [[Tacuara Nationalist Movement]].\n\nThe [[Tacuara Nationalist Movement|Tacuara]], the \"first [[urban guerrilla]] group in Argentina\",<ref>Daniel Gutman, ''Tacuara, historia de la primera guerrilla urbana argentina''</ref> engaged in several anti-Semitic bombings, in particular following [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s kidnapping by the [[Mossad]] in 1960. During the visit of [[Dwight Eisenhower]] to Argentina, in February 1962 (Eisenhower had been until 1961 President of the United States), the Tacuara headed nationalist demonstrations against him, leading to the imprisonment of several of their leaders, among them [[Joe Baxter]].<ref>[http://www.irlandeses.org/dilab_baxterj.htm Baxter, Jos\u00e9 Luis] entry at the ''[[Dictionary of Irish Latin American Biography]]'' {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PP Illia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ousting of President [[Arturo Illia]] was initially broadly supported but later deeply regretted by the Argentine population.]]\n\nHowever, Frondizi's government ended in 1962 with intervention yet again by the military, after a series of local elections were won by the Peronist candidates. [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Guido]], chairman of the senate, claimed the presidency on constitutional grounds before the deeply divided armed forces were able to agree on a name.  Right-wing elements in the Argentine armed forces in favor of direct military rule and the suppression of former Peronist politicians, subsequently attempted to wrest control of the government in the [[1963 Argentine Navy Revolt]] on April 2.  The failure of the revolt's plotters to win the loyalty of army units near the capital permitted Guido's government to swiftly put down the revolt at the cost of 21 lives.\n\nIn new elections in 1963, neither Peronists nor Communists were allowed to participate. [[Arturo Illia]] of the Radical People's Party won these elections; regional elections and by-elections over the next few years favored Peronists.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tacuara were outlawed by Illia in 1965, some of its members ultimately turning to the Peronist Left (such as Joe Baxter) while others remained in their far-right positions (such as [[Alberto Ezcurra Uriburu]], who would work with the [[Triple A (Argentina)|Triple A]]).\n\nDespite the fact that the country grew and developed economically during Illia's tenure as president, he was eventually ousted in a military coup in 1966.\n\n==''Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina'' (1966\u201373)==\n{{Main|Argentine Revolution}}\nAmidst growing worker and student unrest, another coup took place in June 1966, self-designated ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina]]'' (Argentine Revolution), which established General [[Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda]] as ''de facto'' president, supported by several leaders of the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labour]] (CGT), among these the general secretary, [[Augusto Vandor]]. This led to a series of military-appointed presidents.\n\nWhile preceding military coups were aimed at establishing temporary, transitional ''[[Military dictatorship|junta]]''s, the ''Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina'' headed by Ongan\u00eda aimed at establishing a new political and social order, opposed both to [[liberal democracy]] and [[communism]], which gave to the [[Armed Forces of Argentina]] a leading, political role in the economic rationalization of the country. The political scientist [[Guillermo O'Donnell]] named this type of [[political regime|regime]] an \"authoritarian-bureaucratic state\",<ref>[[Guillermo O'Donnell]], ''El Estado Burocr\u00e1tico Autoritario'', (1982)</ref> in reference both to the ''Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina'', the [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian military regime]] (1964\u201385), [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s regime (starting in 1973) and [[Juan Mar\u00eda Bordaberry]]'s regime in [[History of Uruguay|Uruguay]].\n\nOngan\u00eda's [[Minister of Economy of Argentina|Minister of Economy]], [[Adalbert Krieger Vasena]], decreed a wage freeze and a 40% devaluation of the currency, which strongly affected the [[Economy of Argentina|state of the Argentine economy]], in particular the agricultural sector, favoring foreign capital. Vasena suspended [[collective bargaining|collective labour conventions]], reformed the hydrocarbon law which had established a partial monopoly of the ''[[YPF|Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales]]'' (YPF) state enterprise, as well as passing a law facilitating expulsions in case of failure to pay rent. Finally, the [[right to strike]] was suspended (Law 16,936) and several other laws reversed progress made concerning [[labor laws]] throughout the preceding years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe workers' movement divided itself between Vandoristas, who supported a \"Peronism without Peron\" line (Vandor declared that \"to save Per\u00f3n, one has to be against Per\u00f3n\") and advocated negotiation with the junta, and Peronists, themselves divided.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn July 1966 Ongan\u00eda ordered the forcible clearing of five facilities of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] (UBA) on July 29, 1966 by the [[Argentine Federal Police|Federal Police]], an event known as ''[[La Noche de los Bastones Largos]]'' (\"The Night of the Long Batons\"). These facilities had been occupied by students, professors and graduates (members of the autonomous government of the university) who opposed the military government's intervention in the universities and revocation of the [[Argentine university reform of 1918|1918 university reform]]. The university repression led to the exile of 301 university professors, including [[Manuel Sadosky]], [[Tulio Halper\u00edn Donghi]], [[Sergio Bag\u00fa]] and [[Risieri Frondizi]].<ref>Marta Slemenson et al., ''Emigraci\u00f3n de cient\u00edficos argentinos.

On one hand, [[John William Cooke]], former personal delegate of Per\u00f3n and ideologist of the Peronist Left, as well as a friend of [[Fidel Castro]], died from natural causes. On the other hand, a small group (13 men and one woman) who aimed at establishing a ''[[foco]]'' in [[Tucum\u00e1n Province]], in order to head the resistance against the junta, was captured.<ref name=Anzorena48>Oscar R.

While Per\u00f3n managed a reconciliation with [[Augusto Vandor]], head of the CGT Azopardo, he followed, in particular through the voice of his delegate [[Jorge Paladino]], a cautious line of opposition to the military junta, criticizing with moderation the neoliberal policies of the junta but waiting for discontent inside the government (\"''hay que desencillar hasta que aclare''\", said Per\u00f3n, advocating patience). Thus, Ongan\u00eda had an interview with 46 CGT delegates, among them Vandor, who agreed to cooperate with the military junta, thus uniting themselves with the ''Nueva Corriente de Opini\u00f3n'' headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Alonso (trade unionist)|Jos\u00e9 Alonso]] and [[Rogelio Coria]].\n\nIn December 1969, more than 20 priests, members of the ''[[Movement of Priests for the Third World]]'' (MSTM), marched on the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'' to present to Ongan\u00eda a petition pleading with him to abandon the planned eradication of ''[[villas miserias]]'' (shanty towns).<ref name=Anzorena49>Oscar Anzorena, 1987, p.49</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Ongan\u00eda implemented [[corporatism]] policies, experimenting in particular in C\u00f3rdoba, underneath [[Carlos Jos\u00e9 Caballero|Carlos Caballero]]'s governance. The same year, the Movement of Priests for the Third World issued a declaration supporting socialist revolutionary movements, which led to the [[Catholicism in Argentina|Catholic hierarchy]], by the voice of [[Juan Carlos Aramburu]], coadjutor [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]], to proscribe priests from making political or social declarations.<ref name=Anzorena53>Oscar Anzorena, 1987, p.53</ref>\n\n==Growing instability (1969\u201376)==\nDuring the de facto government of the ''Revoluci\u00f3n Argentina'', the left began to regain power through underground movements. This was mainly through violent guerrilla groups. Later, the return of Peronism was expected to calm down the heated waters but did exactly the opposite, creating a violent breach between right-wing and left-wing Peronism, leading to years of violence and political instability that culminated with the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1976.\n\n===Subversive years (1969\u201373)===\nVarious armed actions, headed by the ''[[Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci\u00f3n]]'' (FAL), composed of former members of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Argentina|Revolutionary Communist Party]], occurred in April 1969, leading to several arrests among FAL members. These were the first left-wing [[urban guerrilla]] actions in Argentina. Beside these isolated actions, the [[Cordobazo]] uprising that year, called forth by the CGT de los Argentinos, and its Cordobese leader, [[Agust\u00edn Tosco]], prompted demonstrations in the entire country. The same year, the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP) was formed as the military branch of the Trotskyist [[Workers' Revolutionary Party (Argentina)|Workers' Revolutionary Party]], kidnapping high-profile rich Argentines and demanding ransom.<ref name=\"Nancy Scheper-Hughes\">{{Cite book|title=Child Survival: Anthropological Perspectives on the Treatment and Maltreatment of Children|author=Nancy Scheper-Hughes}}</ref><ref name=\"Paul H.

Per\u00f3n was prevented from running, but voters elected his stand-in, Dr. [[Hector C\u00e1mpora]], as President. C\u00e1mpora defeated his [[Radical Civic Union]] opponent. C\u00e1mpora won 49.5 percent of the votes in the presidential election following a campaign based on a platform of national reconstruction.<ref name=\"Miguel Bonasso 1997\">Miguel Bonasso, ''El Presidente que no fue.

He acceded to his functions on May 25, which was saluted by a massive popular gathering of the Peronist Youth movement, [[Montoneros]], FAR and FAP (\"Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas\") in the [[Plaza de Mayo]]. C\u00e1mpora assumed a strong stance against right-wing Peronists, declaring during his first speech: \"La sangre derramada no ser\u00e1 negociada\" (\"Spilled blood will not be negotiated\").<ref name=\"Miguel Bonasso 1997\"/>\n\n[[Cuba]]n president [[Osvaldo Dortic\u00f3s Torrado|Osvaldo Dortic\u00f3s]] and [[Chile]]an president [[Salvador Allende]] were present at his inauguration, while [[William P.

Political prisoners were liberated on the same day, under the pressure of the demonstrators. C\u00e1mpora's government included progressive figures such as Interior Minister Esteban Righi and Education Minister Jorge Taiana, but also included members of the labor and political right-wing Peronist factions, such as [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega]], Per\u00f3n's personal secretary and Minister of Social Welfare, and a member of the [[Propaganda Due|P2 Masonic lodge]].<ref name=\"Miguel Bonasso 1997\"/> Per\u00f3n's followers also commanded strong majorities in both houses of Congress.\n\nHector C\u00e1mpora's government followed a traditional Peronist economic policy, supporting the national market and redistributing wealth. One of Jos\u00e9 Ber Gelbard's first measures as minister of economics was to augment workers' wages. However, the [[1973 oil crisis]] seriously affected Argentina's oil-dependent economy. Almost 600 social conflicts, strikes or occupations occurred in C\u00e1mpora's first month. The military conceded Campora's victory, but strikes, as well as government-backed violence, continued unabated. The slogan \"[[Campora]] in government, Per\u00f3n in power\" expressed the real source of popular joy, however.\n\n===Return of Per\u00f3n (1973\u201374)===\n\nAmidst escalating terror from the right and left alike, Per\u00f3n decided to return and assume the presidency. On June 20, 1973, two million people waited for him at Ezeiza airport. From Per\u00f3n's speaking platform, camouflaged far-right gunmen fired on the masses, shooting at the Peronist Youth movement and the [[Montoneros]], killing at least thirteen and injuring more than three hundred (this became known as the [[Ezeiza massacre]]).<ref>[[Horacio Verbitsky]], \"Ezeiza\", Contrapunto, Buenos Aires, 1985.</ref>\n\nC\u00e1mpora and vice-president Solano Lima resigned on July 13. Deputy [[Ra\u00fal Alberto Lastiri]], Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega's son-in-law and also a [[Propaganda Due|P2 member]], was then promoted to the presidency to organize elections. C\u00e1mpora's followers such as Chancellor Juan Carlos Puig and Interior Minister Esteban Righi were immediately replaced by Alberto J. Vignes and Benito Llambi, and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|Ej\u00e9rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo]] (ERP - People's Revolutionary Army) was declared a \"dissolved terrorist organization\". On September 23, Per\u00f3n won the elections with 61.85% of the votes, with his third wife, [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]], as vice-president. Their administration was inaugurated on October 12.\n\nPeronist right-wing factions won a decisive victory and Per\u00f3n assumed the Presidency in October 1973, a month after [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]'s coup in Chile. Violent acts, including by the Triple A, continued to threaten public order. On September 25, 1973, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Rucci, [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT trade-union]]'s Secretary General and Per\u00f3n's friend, was assassinated by the Montoneros. The government resorted to a number of [[Necessity and Urgency Decree|emergency decrees]], including the implementation of special executive authority to deal with violence. This allowed the government to imprison individuals indefinitely without charge.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn his second period in office, Per\u00f3n was committed to achieving political peace through a new alliance of business and labor to promote national reconstruction.

In this case, the resolution of the conflict would depend not on the combatants, but on the countries that supplied the weapons.''\n\nIn December that year, moments before Videla signed a declaration of war against Chile, [[Pope John Paul II]] agreed to [[Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict|mediate]] between the two nations. The Pope's envoy, Cardinal [[Antonio Samor\u00e8]], successfully averted war and proposed a new definitive boundary in which the three disputed islands would remain Chilean.

The UCR-led government took steps to resolve some of the nation's most pressing problems, including accounting for those who [[desaparecidos|disappeared]] during military rule, establishing [[civilian control of the military|civilian control of the armed forces]], and consolidating democratic institutions.

Large-scale structural reforms dramatically reversed the role of the state in Argentine economic life. Ironically, the Peronist Menem oversaw the [[privatization]] of many of the industries Per\u00f3n had nationalized.\n\nA decisive leader pressing a controversial agenda, Menem was not reluctant to use the presidency's powers to issue \"emergency\" decrees (formally ''[[Necessity and Urgency Decree]]s'') when the Congress was unable to reach consensus on his proposed reforms. Those powers were curtailed somewhat when the constitution was reformed in 1994 as a result of the so-called [[Pact of Olivos]] with the opposition Radical Party. That arrangement opened the way for Menem to seek and win reelection with 50% of the vote in the three-way 1995 presidential race. [[Piquetero]] movement rose.\n\nThe 1995 election saw the emergence of the moderate-left [[Front for a Country in Solidarity|FrePaSo]] political alliance. This alternative to the two traditional political parties in Argentina was particularly strong in Buenos Aires but lacked the national infrastructure of the Peronists and Radicals.

Having taken office in December 1999, De la R\u00faa followed an [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]-sponsored program of government spending cuts, revenue increases, and provincial revenue-sharing reforms to get the federal [[fiscal deficit]] under control, and pursued [[labour market flexibility|labor market flexibilization]] and business-promotion measures aimed at stimulating foreign investment, so as to avoid [[default (finance)|defaulting the public debt]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nTowards the end of 2001, Argentina faced grave economic problems. The IMF pressed Argentina to service its [[external debt]], effectively forcing Argentina to [[devaluation|devalue]] the Argentine peso, which had been pegged to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]], or alternatively fully [[dollarize]] its economy. Deep budget cuts, including a 13% reduction in pay for the nation's 2 million public sector employees, failed to curb the rapidly increasing [[country risk]] on almost U$100 billion in Argentine bonds, increasing debt service costs and further limiting access to international credit, despite a moderately successful debt swap arranged by Minister Cavallo with most bondholders.

The Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo resigned, but that did not prevent the collapse of De la R\u00faa's administration. On December 20 de la R\u00faa also resigned, but the political crisis was extremely serious, as a result of the previous resignation of the vice-president [[Carlos \u00c1lvarez (politician)|Carlos ''Chacho'' \u00c1lvarez]] in 2000.

As inflation became a serious issue and the effects of the crisis became apparent in the form of increased unemployment and poverty, Duhalde chose a moderate, low-profile economist, [[Roberto Lavagna]], as his Minister of Economy. The economic measures implemented brought inflation under control.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nAfter a year, Duhalde deemed his tasks fulfilled and, pressured by certain political factors, called for elections, which in April 2003 brought [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]], the left-of-centre Peronist governor of [[Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz]], to power.\n\n===Kirchner governments (2003\u20132015)===\n{{Main|N\u00e9stor Kirchner|Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner}}\n{{See also|Kirchnerism|Pink tide}}\n\n[[File:Cristina baston Kirchner.jpg|thumb|250px|[[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] hands the presidential mandate to his wife, [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]].]]\n\nPresident Kirchner took office on May 25, 2003.

[[Hermes Binner]] was elected [[governor of Santa Fe]], becoming the first [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist]] governor in Argentina's history and the first non-[[Justicialism|Justicialist]] to rule the rather wealthy Santa Fe province, and Center-left [[Fabiana R\u00edos]] ([[Support for an Egalitarian Republic|ARI]]) became the first woman to be elected [[governor of Tierra del Fuego]], while the right-wing [[Mauricio Macri]] was elected [[Chief of Government of Buenos Aires City]] in June 2007.<ref name=Mde>[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3222,36-951026@51-946547,0.html Pour la premi\u00e8re fois, un socialiste est \u00e9lu gouverneur d'une province argentine], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 4 September 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nOn December 10, 2007, [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] took over the presidency from her husband, after winning elections with 44% of the vote. N\u00e9stor Kirchner remained a highly influential politician during the term of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. The press developed the term \"''presidential marriage''\" to make reference to both of them at once.<ref>Mendelevich, p. 279</ref> Some political analysts compared this type of government with a [[diarchy]].<ref>Mendelevich, p. 280</ref>\n\nAfter proposing a new taxation system for agricultural exports, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez's Government had to face a [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector|severe lock out of the sector]]. The protest, which spread over 129 days, was quickly politicized and marked an inflection point in her administration. The system was finally rejected in the Senate by an opposing vote by the Vice President [[Julio Cobos]].\n\nThe political style of the government changed in 2010 with the [[Death and state funeral of N\u00e9stor Kirchner]]. Cristina slowly distanced herself from the traditional structure of the [[Justicialist Party]] and favored instead ''[[La C\u00e1mpora]]'', a group of young supporters led by her son [[M\u00e1ximo Kirchner]].\n\n=== Macri Administration (2015-2019)===\n{{See also|Presidency of Mauricio Macri}}\n[[File:Mauricio Macri Foto de Prensa2.jpg|thumb|200px|The president [[Mauricio Macri]].]]\nOn 22 November 2015, [[Mauricio Macri]] won the presidency.

Overcoming the former motorist [[Daniel Scioli]], from the [[Front for Victory]]. Macri took over as president on the 10th of December of that same year. His government changed direction from the previous era, moving back to [[neoliberal]] policies.\n\nPresident Macri was one of the political leaders identified in the scandalous Panama Papers where he was identified as having several offshore companies for which other leaders have used to evade taxes, though to the day he has not suffered any convictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/politica/el-presidente-macri-otra-vez-envuelto-en-los-panama-papers.phtml|title=El presidente Macri, otra vez envuelto en los Panama Papers|date=19 September 2018|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dinero.com/internacional/articulo/se-publica-la-lista-completa-de-los-panama-papers/223457|title=Sale a la luz la lista completa de los Panam\u00e1 Papers|last=Dinero|website=Se publica la lista completa de los Panam\u00e1 Papers}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Economic history of Argentina]]\n*[[Historiography of Argentina]]\n*[[History of Argentine nationality]]\n*[[List of Presidents of Argentina]]\n*[[Politics of Argentina]]\n*[[State-Church relations in Argentina]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[History of Latin America]]\n*[[History of South America]]\n*[[Latin America\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite journal | jstor = 2515555 | pages = 211\u2013238 | last1 = Adelman | first1 = J. | title = Socialism and Democracy in Argentina in the Age of the Second International | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | journal = The Hispanic American Historical Review | year = 1992 | doi = 10.2307/2515555}}\n* Andrews, George Reid.
