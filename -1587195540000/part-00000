He graduated from [[Queens College, City University of New York]] in 1974 with a computer science degree. He later received a PhD degree in Islamic art in 1988, from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], London, writing his thesis on Islamic [[lacquerware]].\n\nHe first started to collect art in New York during the 1970s, while also spending a lot of time in London investing in property during the 1980s. Over the coming decades, Khalili created eight distinct art collections under the auspices of the Khalili Family Trust. Khalili is said to have initially generated capital in the 1980s through the sale of a company and also [[venture capital]]. Since then his wealth has grown substantially, which he stated in an interview was due to \"dealing in art, commodities and real estate\". Khalili is known for the purchase of a number of large properties in London. One of his properties in [[Kensington Palace Gardens]], was sold to [[Bernie Ecclestone]] for \u00a357 million. He was also the co-owner of Sixty London on [[Holborn Viaduct]], London. It is currently leased by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] as their London office.\n\nIn 1995, he founded the [[Maimonides Foundation|Maimonides Interfaith Foundation]] where he serves as Chairman.

Over the coming decades, Khalili created eight distinct art collections under the auspices of the Khalili Family Trust. Khalili is said to have initially generated capital in the 1980s through the sale of a company and also [[venture capital]]. Since then his wealth has grown substantially, which he stated in an interview was due to \"dealing in art, commodities and real estate\". Khalili is known for the purchase of a number of large properties in London. One of his properties in [[Kensington Palace Gardens]], was sold to [[Bernie Ecclestone]] for \u00a357 million.

In a ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' article, Michael Spink stated the following about Khalili's collection and growth of wealth; \"he would buy items for \u00a32,000 which, over a long period, appreciated to \u00a3200,000.

In the early 1990s, he began to publish a 27-volume catalogue of his Islamic art collection, for which he commissioned a number of leading [[Islamic]] scholars. In 1992, he was interviewed by ''[[The Independent]]'' following the launch of the first volume of this catalogue of Islamic art. According to the article, suspicions in the art industry were that Khalili was assembling the collection on behalf of a rich investor.

The collection mainly represents four periods, the [[Edo period]] (1603-1868), the [[Meiji period]] (1868-1912), [[Taisho]] (1912-1926) and early [[Sh\u014dwa period|Showa]] (1926-1989), with a few selected pieces produced later on.<ref name=khalilicollections />\n\nThe Khalili Collection of Swedish Textiles comprises nearly a hundred textile panels, dating between 1700-1900. The majority of the works are from a one hundred-year period, and from the area of [[Scania]], the southern-most region of [[Sweden]]. The textile collection contains art mostly made for wedding ceremonies in the region. While they played a part in the ceremonies, they were also a reflection of the artistry and skill of the weaver. Their designs often consist of symbolic illustrations of fertility and long life.<ref name=khalilicollections />\n[[File:Khalili Collection Enamels of the World Chariot of Maharaja of Bhavnagar.jpg|thumb|Enamelled carriage belonging to the Indian Maharaja of [[Bhavnagar]].

GT cars were now [[Group 3 (racing)|Group 3]] and Prototypes were now [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]]. Two new classes for Sports Cars were [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] and [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] for \u2018Special Sports Cars\u2019 (Group 1 and 2 covered Touring Cars, [[Group 7 (racing)|Group 7]] led to the [[1966 Can-Am season|Can-Am series]], with Group 8 and 9 for single-seaters).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\">Spurring 2010, p.208</ref>\n\nAs Group 7 were ineligible for FIA events, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) opened its entry list to Group 3, 4 and 6. The FIA mandated minimum annual production runs of 500 cars for Group 3 (up from 100 previously<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.140\">Clausager 1982, p.140</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\">Moity 1974, p.102-4</ref>) and 50 for Group 4,<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/>  which also had a maximum engine capacity of 5000cc. There were no engine limits on the GTs or Prototypes. As before, the Groups were split up in classes based on engine size, there was a sliding scale of a minimum weight based on the increasing engine size (from 450 to 1000&nbsp;kg for 500 to 7000cc) as was fuel-tank capacity (60 to 160 litres).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\nAlong with the new Appendix J, after four years of focus on GT racing the FIA announced the International Manufacturer's Championship, for Group 6 Prototypes (2L / >2L), and the International Sports Car Championship for Group 4 (1.3L / 2L / 5L).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\n==Entries==\n[[File:Ford GT40 Mark II at Goodwood Revival 2013 001.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ford GT40]] Mark II ]]\n[[File:Ferrari-330p3-2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ferrari 330 P3]]]]\n[[File:Porsche 906 Tour Auto 2014 Circuit de Dijon Prenois 03.jpg|left|thumb|Porsche 906 Carrera]]\nWith the new regulations this year the ACO received a huge 103 entry requests.

Extensive work was done in the wind tunnel, and improving the brakes, handling and engine \u2013 not least improving the fuel economy.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\">Clarke 1997, p.6-7: Autosport Jun17 1966</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\">Fox 1973, p.201</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.18\">Clarke 1997, p.18: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.209\">Armstrong 1966, p.209</ref> The big 7-litre engine now put out 475&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> But the new year started with promise with [[Ken Miles]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]] winning both the inaugural [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and then [[12 Hours of Sebring]].<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/> Copying Ferrari's tactic of overwhelming numbers, they put in fifteen Mark II entrants; eight were accepted by the ACO. This time six were built and prepared by [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]]. Shelby ran three cars himself for Americans [[Dan Gurney]] and [[Jerry Grant]], Miles was now paired with New Zealander [[Denny Hulme]] after Ruby had been injured in a plane crash a month earlier.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\">Fox 1973, p.198</ref> The third car was the all-[[Kiwi (people)|Kiwi]] pairing of [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Chris Amon]]. [[Holman Moody|Holman & Moody]], the successful Ford NASCAR race team was brought on board to race another trio \u2013 for [[Mark Donohue]]/[[Paul Hawkins (racing driver)|Paul Hawkins]], [[Ronnie Bucknum]]/[[Dick Hutcherson]], and [[Lucien Bianchi]]/[[Mario Andretti]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.15\">Clarke 1997, p.15: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref> One of the big improvements Holman & Moody brought with them was a quick-change brakepad system to save time in the pits.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.21\">Clarke 1997, p.21: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref>\n\nThe British team [[Alan Mann Racing]] had two cars prepared by Ford Advanced Vehicles, for [[Graham Hill]]/[[Dick Thompson (racing driver)|Dick Thompson]] and [[John Whitmore (racing driver)|John Whitmore]]/[[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]]. Each of the eight cars was painted in a colour from the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]] road-car range.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\">Spurring 2010, p.210-3</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\">Clarke 1997, p.10: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\nFerrari's response to the Mk II was the new [[Ferrari P#330 P3|Ferrari 330 P3]]. Shorter and wider than the P2, it kept the same 4-litre engine but with fuel-injection now put out 420&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.209\"/> The works team had a pair of closed-cockpit versions for [[John Surtees]]/[[Ludovico Scarfiotti]] and former winners [[Lorenzo Bandini]]/[[Jean Guichet]]. An open-cockpit variant was given to the [[North American Racing Team]] (NART) for [[Pedro Rodriguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]]/[[Richie Ginther]]. But their race preparation had been limited by strike action in Italy.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\">Spurring 2010, p.217-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\">Laban 2001, p.150-1</ref>\n\nNART also entered a long-tailed P2, rebodied by [[Piero Drogo]] and driven by last year's winner [[Masten Gregory]] with [[Bob Bondurant]]. There were also P2/P3 hybrids for the [[Ecurie Francorchamps]] (Dumay/\"Beurlys\") and [[Scuderia Filipinetti]] ([[Willy Mairesse|Mairesse]]/[[Herbert M\u00fcller (racing driver)|M\u00fcller]]. Finally there was a P2 Spyder for Maranello Concessionaires ([[Richard Attwood|Attwood]]/[[David Piper (racing driver)|Piper]]).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\">Clarke 1997, p.9: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> Fighting on two fronts, the company also took on Porsche in the 2-litre class with its [[Dino 206 S]] with a pair from NART and another for Maranello. [[Nino Vaccarella]], race winner in [[1964 24 Hours of Le Mans|1964]], was furious when he found out he was \u2018demoted\u2019 to drive the Dino rather than the P3 and threatened to walk out, but did, in the end run the car.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\">Clarke 1997, p.24: Motor Jun25 1966</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\">Armstrong 1966, p.235</ref>\n\nChevrolet was the other player in the over 2-litre class. Ex-Ferrari engineer [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] had fallen out with [[Renzo Rivolta]] and with his own company brought his new design, the P538, but still using the 5.3L Chevrolet engine. The other Chevy was in Texan [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall]]\u2019s [[Chaparral Cars#2|Chaparral 2D]]. The 5.3L small block put out 420&nbsp;bhp and had a semi-automatic transmission.<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> Driven by [[Phil Hill]] and [[Jo Bonnier]], they made a big impact winning the N\u00fcrburgring round just two weeks earlier.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\">Spurring 2010, p.227</ref>\n\nPorsche came with a new model \u2013 the [[Porsche 906|906]] designed by the team led by [[Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch]]. With the 2.0L flat-6 engine from the 911, it had recently been homologated for Group 4 with the requisite 50 cars.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.210\">Armstrong 1966, p.210</ref> It was race-proven too, after winning the [[Targa Florio]] the month before. However three ''langheck'' (long-tail) prototypes were also entered by the works team, driven by [[Hans Herrmann]]/[[Herbert Linge]], [[Jo Siffert]]/[[Colin Davis (racing driver)|Colin Davis]] and [[Udo Sch\u00fctz]]/[[Peter de Klerk]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\">Spurring 2010, p.220-1</ref>\n\nAlfa Romeo, and its works team [[Autodelta]], had withdrawn from racing for a year to prepare a new car for 1967.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/> But this year, a significant new manufacturer entered the fray: [[Matra]] had bought out [[Automobiles Ren\u00e9 Bonnet]] in 1964, rebadging the [[Matra Djet|Djet]]. However it was a new design that was entered. The M620 had a 2-litre version of the BRM Formula 1 engine developing 245&nbsp;bhp that could match the Porsches in speed, making 275&nbsp;kp/h (170&nbsp;mph). The three cars were driven by up and coming young French single-seater drivers [[Jean-Pierre Beltoise]]/[[Johnny Servoz-Gavin]], [[Jean-Pierre Jaussaud]]/[[Henri Pescarolo]] and [[Jo Schlesser]] with Welshman [[Alan Rees (racing driver)|Alan Rees]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.222\">Spurring 2010, p.222</ref>\n\nRemarkably, given British dominance of the race barely a decade earlier, there were only three British cars in this year's race. Defending class-champions Austin-Healey had two works entries. The other was a [[Marcos Engineering]] kit-car based on a Mini Cooper 'S' chassis. Entered by Frenchman Hubert Giraud and driven by Jean-Louis Marnat and Claude Ballot-Lena, the team was able to get a works engine and gearbox from [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]]. The spectators laughed at the small car and its apparent resemblance to a flea.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\">Spurring 2010, p.233</ref> But the Mini Marcos would became the 'darling of the crowds' later on in the race.\n\nAlpine, after its poor showing in the previous year, returned with 6 cars. The new A210 had a 1.3L Gordini-Renault engine with a Porsche gearbox making it more durable if only a little faster at 245&nbsp;kp/h (150&nbsp;mph). This year a new customer team, the Ecurie Savin-Calberson was supported by Alpine, with former Index winner Roger Delageneste.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\">Spurring 2010, p.224</ref>\n\n[[Charles Deutsch]] (CD) brought his new aerodynamic SP66. The car was powered by a 1130cc Peugeot engine, marking the return of the French company last seen in the 1938 race.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\">Spurring 2010, p.231</ref> Another competitor in the small prototypes was [[ASA (automobile)|ASA]]. Originally a Ferrari design by [[Carlo Chiti]] and [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] before their famous [[History of Ferrari#1961 \u2013 The great walkout|walk-out from Ferrari]], it was sold to the new Italian company and uprated with a 1290cc engine giving 125&nbsp;bhp. Two cars were entered, one by ASA and one by NART.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\">Spurring 2010, p.228</ref>\n\nThe new Group 4 category started attracting interest as the earlier prototypes were meeting the homologation and production requirements. There were six GT40s entered by customer teams, with the 4.7L engine. [[Jochen Rindt]], the previous year's winner, had moved across from Ferrari to Ford, in the new Canadian Comstock Racing Team. They joined Ford France, Scuderia Filipinetti and new privateers Scuderia Bear and [[Superior Essex|Essex Wire]]. Joining Skip Scott, team owner of the Essex Wire team, was a 21-year old [[Jacky Ickx]] in his Le Mans debut.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\">Spurring 2010, p.214-5</ref><ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\">Clausager 1982, p.147</ref>\n\nUp against them was [[Ed Hugus]]\u2019 modified Ferrari 275 GTB and the [[Ecurie Nationale Belge|Equipe Nationale Belge]] ran its 250 LM. Porsche also ran three regular 906s in the Sports category, two works entries as well as one for their Paris importer Toto Veuillet.\n\nWith Shelby now fully concentrated on the Ford program, the Cobra GTs were abandoned. There were only three GT entries: the Ferrari customer teams Ecurie Francorchamps and Maranello Concessionaires both entered a 275 GTB. The third was a quiet though significant entry: Jacques Dewes, ever the pioneering privateer, brought the first Porsche 911 to Le Mans. Production of what would become the ubiquitous Le Mans car had started in late 1964 and the new 911 S model had its \u2018boxer\u2019 6-cylinder engine tuned to 160&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.223\">Spurring 2010, p.223</ref>\n\nFinally, in a subcompetition of its own, there was the tire race between [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]], and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/>\n\n==Practice==\nOnce again there was rain at the April testing weekend. And once again there was tragedy with a fatal accident. American Walt Hansgen's Ford hit water on the pit straight and aquaplaned. He aimed for the escape road at the end of the straight, not realising it was blocked by a sandbank, which he hit at about 190&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph). Taken with critical injuries to the American military hospital at [[Orl\u00e9ans]], he died five days later.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\n\nA notable absentee at the test weekend was the Ferrari works team.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Chris Amon was fastest at the test weekend in the experimental [[Ford GT40#J-car|Ford J-car]] with a 3:34.4 lap.<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> But come race-week it was Gurney who put in the fastest qualifying lap of 3:30.6, a second faster than his stablemates Miles, Gardner and McLaren. Ginther was 5th in the fastest Ferrari with a 3:33.0, with Parkes and Bandini in 7th and 8th respectively. Phil Hill, in the Chaparral, broke up the Ford-Ferrari procession in 10th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\">Spurring 2010, p.235</ref>\n\nJo Siffert put the quickest Porsche 22nd on the grid with 3:51.0, with Nino Vaccarella's Ferrari in 24th (3:53.5) and Jo Schlesser's Matra just behind it (3:53.5). Over the test weekend, Mauro Bianchi had surprised many in the 1-litre Alpine, going as fast as the 1959 Ferrari Testa Rossas.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\nThe quickest Alpine in practice was [[Pauli Toivonen|Toivonen]]/Jansson (4:20.1), well ahead of the best CD (Ogier/Laurent 4:27.5) and the Austin-Healey's (4:45.1) and ASAs (4:49.8).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\"/>\n\nThere were also two significant dramas in practice. The biggest news was the walkout of Ferrari's lead driver [[John Surtees]]. He and team manager Eugenio Dragoni had decided that he, as the fastest Ferrari driver and driving with [[Mike Parkes]], would act as the hare to bait and break the Fords. He was also still recovering from a big accident the previous year and would hand over to Scarfiotti if he got overly tired. Yet during raceweek, with news that new FIAT chairman [[Gianni Agnelli]] would be at the race, Dragoni changed the plan, putting Scarfiotti (Agnelli's nephew) in first. Surtees was furious and stormed off to Maranello to argue his case with [[Enzo Ferrari]].<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Not listened to, Surtees, Ferrari's [[1964 Formula One season|1964 F1 World Champion]], quit the team.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/>\n\nThe second incident was more serious \u2013 Dick Thompson in the Alan Mann Ford Mk II collided with Dick Holqvist who was going far slower in the Scuderia Bear Ford GT40 and pulled right in front of him at Maison Blanche.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/> Holqvist spun off with heavy damage, while Thompson was able to get back to the pits. While repairing the damage, officials told the team that they were disqualified for Thompson leaving the scene of a major accident. Thompson was adamant he had advised pit officials, and in the hearing Ford's director of racing Leo Beebe threatened to withdraw all Fords. He was supported by [[Fritz Huschke von Hanstein|Huschke von Hanstein]] who was prepared to withdraw the Porsche team as well.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> In the end, the car was reinstated though Thompson was banned. This still posed a problem for Ford as they were lacking spare drivers, with injuries with [[A.J.

Fourth, 20 seconds further back, was the first NART Ferrari, of Rodriguez. Meanwhile, Miles had been putting in extremely fast laps, breaking the lap record and getting back up to 5th place. Parkes was 6th ahead of Bonnier in the Chaparral who had already been lapped. Within another hour Miles and Hulme had taken the lead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\">Spurring 2010, p.208-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/>\n\nAt 8pm, only the Miles and Gurney Fords and Rodiguez's Ferrari were on the lead lap (#64).<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.26\">Clarke 1997, p.26: Motor Jun25 1966</ref> At dusk it started to drizzle, reducing the power advantage of the big Fords, and allowing the Ferraris to keep in touch. The Fords were further delayed as a number chose to change brake pads early.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/> By then all three Dinos were out with mechanical issues, removing one threat to Porsche.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> A major accident occurred when Jean-Claude Ogier's CD got loose on spilt oil at the Mulsanne kink and was hit hard side-on by Fran\u00e7ois Pasquier in the NART ASA. Both cars hit the wall and caught fire,  and Ogier was taken to the hospital with two broken arms.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\"/><ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\">Clarke 1997, p.11: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\n===Night===\nAfter 6 hours, heavy rain was pouring down. Ginther's NART Ferrari was leading from Parkes, chased by the Fords of Miles and Gurney on the same lap, McLaren a lap behind then Bandini and Andretti two laps back. But Andretti was soon sidelined with a blown headgasket, as was the Hill/Muir Ford which had broken its front suspension coming out of Arnage corner.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\">Clarke 1997, p.12: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> As the rain eased, the Fords of Miles and Gurney retook the lead. Just before midnight Robert Buchet aquaplaned coming over the crest at the Dunlop Bridge and crashed the French Porsche.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/> The Chaparral had been running well initially, getting as high as 5th, until a broken alternator stopped them also just before midnight while running in 8th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\"/>\n\nAnother heavy downpour at 12.30 contributed to a big accident in the Esses. Guichet had just spun his Ferrari in the rain and got away when Buchet arrived and crashed his Porsche. Then Schlesser's Matra ran into the CD of Georges Heligouin avoiding the accident. As the damage was being cleared, Scarfiotti crashed his P3 into the Matra and all four cars were wrecked, although only Scarfiotti was taken to hospital, with minor bruising.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\"/>\n\nDuring the night the Ferraris started to suffer from overheating. When the NART P3 retired from 4th with a broken gearbox at 3am, and the Filipinetti car of Mairesse/M\u00fcller from 5th an hour later, the Ferrari challenge was spent \u2013 there would be no privateer-saviours for the marque this year. At halfway the Ford Mk IIs held the top-4 places (Miles/Hulme, Gurney/Grant, McLaren/Amon, Bucknum/Hutcherson) with GT40s in 5-6-8: Essex, Filipinetti and Ford-France (Revson/Scott, Spoerry/Sutcliffe, Ligier/Grossman). Siffert/Davis were leading a train of Porsches in 7th and the nearest Ferrari was the Bandini/Guichet P3 limping in 12th. Ford told their cars to drop to 4-minute laps, but Gurney and Miles kept racing hard for the lead.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\"/>\n\n===Morning===\nWhat could have been a procession was anything but for Ford. At 8 am, a pit-stop for the Filipinetti Ford running 5th spilled petrol on a rear tyre. On his out-lap Spoerry lost traction and spun at the Esses wrecking the car. The Ford-France and Essex cars had already retired with engine issues during the night.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/>\n\nAt 9am the Gurney/Grant car, which had been dicing for the lead with Miles & Hulme (against strict team orders), retired from 1st when the car blew a headgasket. That left Ford with only three Mk IIs left (albeit running 1-2-3) as all the GT40s had retired as well. Porsches now held the next five places and the two Ferrari GTs were 9th and 10th chased by the Alpines.\n\n===Finish and post-race===\nWith the field covered it was now that Leo Beebe, Ford racing director, contrived to stage a dead heat by having his two lead cars cross the line simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/le-mans/look-back-1966-le-mans-24-hours|title=A look back at the 1966 Le Mans 24 Hours|date=2016-05-05|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref> The ACO told him this would not be possible \u2014 given the staggered starting formation, the #2 car would have covered 20 metres further, and thus be the race winner.

Miles/Hulme were leading, followed by McLaren/Amon holding station on the same lap. The gold Bucknum/Hutcherson car was third, but twelve laps behind. Miles was told to ease off to allow McLaren to catch up with him. Just before 4pm, it started to drizzle again. As it turned out McLaren's #2 car crossed the finish line just ahead and was declared the winner. It was rumoured that Miles, upset about the team orders, lifted off to allow McLaren to finish a length ahead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.13\">Clarke 1997, p.13: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1104584_watch-the-story-of-the-controversy-behind-the-ford-gt40s-photo-finish-at-le-mans-in-1966|title=Watch the story of the controversy behind the Ford GT40's photo finish at Le Mans in 1966|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2016/06/17/le-mans-1966-the-golden-mystery.html|title=Le Mans 1966: The Golden Mystery \u2013 dailysportscar.com|website=www.dailysportscar.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref>\n\nAt their last pitstop, the 7th-placed Porsche of [[Peter Gregg (racing driver)|Peter Gregg]] and Sten Axelsson was stopped by engine problems. Gregg parked the car waiting for the last lap, but at 3.50pm he could not get it restarted and missed the formation finish. The other Porsches came in 4th to 7th led by Siffert/Davis, who also claimed the Index of Performance. The [[Rolf Stommelen|Stommelen]]/[[G\u00fcnter Klass|Klass]] car in 7th was the first, and only, Sports car to finish. Finally, the new 911 GT ran well and finished 14th starting a long record of success.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/>\n\nFour Alpines finished this year, 9-11-12-13, with that of Delageneste/Cheinisse from the Ecurie Savin-Calberson winning the Thermal Efficiency Index.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/> The final finisher was the little Mini Marcos. Formerly the object of laughter, it had become a crowd favourite running like clockwork. As car after car ran into trouble and dropped out, the little Marcos, by this time nicknamed 'la puce bleue' (the blue flea) wailed on. Despite finishing 26 laps behind the rest of the field.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> the car eventually came home at an incredible 15th overall.\n\nIt had taken three attempts for Ford to win [[1965 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] and the NASCAR Championship, and now it added the Le Mans 24 Hours. Chrysler had first entered in 1925, and after 41 years it was the first win for an American car.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/> The official [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] press release, erroneously dated 7/5/1966, claims:  {{cquote|The McLaren-Amon and the Miles-Hulme cars were running within seconds of each other as the race neared its end, with the Bucknum-Hutcherson car hanging back as insurance. A decision was made in the Ford pits to have the cars finish side by side in what hopefully would be considered a dead heat. All three cars went over the finish in formation, but any chance for a dead heat disappeared when officials discovered a rule that in case of a tie, the car that had started further down the grid had travelled the farther distance. Since McLaren and Amon had started 60 feet behind Miles and Hulme, they were declared the winners. Both [[New Zealanders]] who now reside in England, it was the most important victory yet for the two youngsters. McLaren, who builds his own Formula and sports cars, is 28. Amon 22, is the youngest winner in the history of the event. It was a record shattering performance as the winning car covered more miles (3,009.3) at a faster speed (125.38 mph) than any previous entry. It demonstrated that production engines could compete with racing powerplants and that an American-built car could top Europe's best.<ref>[https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/Europe/en/2016/06/Ford%201966%20Le%20Mans%20release.pdf]</ref>}} The Ford team's decision was a big disappointment for Ken Miles, who was aiming for the [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|'Endurance Racing]] Triple Crown'\u2014winning Daytona-Sebring-Le Mans\u2014as a reward for his investment in the GT40 development. \"I'm disappointed, of course, but what are you going to do about it.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/18408295/|title=20 Jun 1966, Page 11 - The Cumberland News at Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref> Beebe also later admitted he had been annoyed with Miles racing Gurney, disregarding team orders by potentially risking the cars\u2019 endurance.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/>  Two months later, Ken Miles was killed at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside]] while testing the next generation Ford GT40 J-Car, which became the MkIV that won Le Mans in 1967.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|title=Ken Miles--an appreciation|website=www.cobracountry.com|access-date=2016-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201829/http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn a race of attrition it was fortunate the big teams brought such quantity \u2013 only 3 of the 13 Fords finished and only the two GTs finished from the 14 Ferraris entered. By contrast, 5 of the 7 Porsches finished (including their 911 in the GT class) as did four of the six Alpines, showing much better reliability. It was the first time that the 3000 miles/125&nbsp;mph mark had been exceeded.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/>\n\nWith the bitter failure of Ferrari's 330 P3 mirroring the failure of the Ford prototypes the previous year (and with salt rubbed into the wound with Ford's formation finish), the \"Ford-Ferrari War\" moved into its climactic phase.  The Le Mans results boosted Ford over Ferrari for the [[1966 World Sportscar Championship#Manufacturers' Championship|1966 Manufacturers' Championship]].  Ford's answer to Ferrari's next weapon, the [[Ferrari P|330 P4]], was delayed by development problems, handing Ferrari a rematch with the Mk IIs that so dominated them at LeMans, at the 1967 [[Daytona 24 Hours]].  After a defective batch of transaxle shafts sank Ford's effort, Ferrari took a 1-2-3 finish with their new P4s and returned the favor of Ford's victory formation.  Ford's [[Ford GT40|Mark IV]] was ready in time for the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], where it won on its maiden outing.  Three more examples were produced and prepared for the Le Mans 24 Hours, while Ford's championship hopes rested on the older [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] and the new GT40-derived [[Mirage (race car)|Mirages]] to gain points in the intervening races.  After a disappointing showing at [[1000 km Monza|Monza]] a controversial denial of championship points from a Mirage win at the [[1000 km Spa|Spa]] event, Ford saw limited opportunity for taking the Manufacturers' title again and instead concentrated on a last hurrah at Le Mans, where the leading Mark IV, driven by Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt, won handily.  Ferrari took the Manufacturers' title for 1967, edging up-and-coming Porsche by two points.\n\nThe Ford-Ferrari War was ended by new rules for 1968 that eliminated the P4s and Mark IVs from eligibility for the Sports Prototype class with a 3-litre engine capacity limit.  The GT40s met the production requirement and 5 litre limit for [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] in the new [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] class.  Ferrari found the production requirement for homologating the P4 under Group 4 daunting and withdrew from competition in the sport-racer classes.  Neither Ford nor Ferrari fielded a factory team for the Manufacturers' Championship that year; however, the [[John Wyer]] team running the Group 4 [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] brought home the title for Ford and in 1969 achieved wins with the GT40 at Sebring and Le Mans.  When Ferrari was able to enter a homologated car for 1970, the class they competed in was dominated by the [[Porsche 917]].\n\nSeveral cars of the original 24-hours race have survived and have been restored to their former glory. The crowd-pleasing Mini Marcos was club raced, rallied and hill climbed, road registered twice and repainted five times only to be stolen in the night of 30 October 1975 from beneath a flat in Paris. Three days earlier Marcos-boss Harold Dermott had made a deal to buy the car with the intention to restore it and put on museum display. Several people searched for the car ever since, but it was only found back in December 2016 in Portugal by Dutchman Jeroen Booij.\n\n== Legacy in popular culture ==\n=== ''Go Like Hell'' ===\nThe race became the subject of a 2009 book, detailing the race and the famous background rivalry between [[Enzo Ferrari]] and [[Henry Ford II]], by [[A.J.

I recall it was damp and we were running on intermediate Firestone tires and at 210\u2013220 mph [355 kmh] on the Mulsanne Straight, the tires were shedding tread. I took over from Bruce and he spoke to Firestone and they generously said we could switch to the Goodyears the other GT40s were running. Bruce said to me we had to drive the doors off the thing, so we did. There was a bit of history to that. We had both driven the first two 7.0-litre cars at Le Mans the previous year: Bruce with Ken Miles and myself with Phil Hill. We were warned to be careful with the gearbox as they were new and unproven, and both cars retired with gearbox failures. As a result, when I went to Daytona for the 24 hours, paired with Bruce, I suggested to Bruce that we set a fairly conservative pace for the race, and whilst we might be running out of the top three in the early stages, we might be the only one there at the end. We finished fifth. For Le Mans, we decided to set a pace for ourselves. This strategy fell apart when our tires started losing treads early in the race and we lost considerable time. When I was called in to change tires, I think Bruce's frustration had reached boiling point, he put his head through the car door and said 'Go like hell!'.\" At the finish: \"the idea was that the leading GT40s would cross the line together, but in practice, it wasn't possible to have a dead heat.

The following year, they won again. The year after that, they won a third time. And in 1969, a fourth.\n\nThat achievement was arguably the greatest in the company's history. It came after years of struggle, more than a few public failures, and enough burnt cash to refloat the ''Titanic.

That first win made it onto the front pages of European newspapers, and it actually helped sell new cars. Ferrari never won Le Mans again, but Ford wouldn't go back until 2016. When [[2016 24 Hours of Le Mans|Dearborn won last year]], the world went less than nuts. But that makes sense: Both Le Mans and international motorsport are different now, tamer and less raw. So is the automobile itself. Racing is no longer a brutally dangerous pastime or the kind of thing that puts whole countries on the edge of their seats. And most of all, in 2016, there is no [[Henry Ford II|Henry the Deuce]], no world-altering grudge match, no Enzo, no Carroll.

GT cars were now [[Group 3 (racing)|Group 3]] and Prototypes were now [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]]. Two new classes for Sports Cars were [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] and [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] for \u2018Special Sports Cars\u2019 (Group 1 and 2 covered Touring Cars, [[Group 7 (racing)|Group 7]] led to the [[1966 Can-Am season|Can-Am series]], with Group 8 and 9 for single-seaters).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\">Spurring 2010, p.208</ref>\n\nAs Group 7 were ineligible for FIA events, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) opened its entry list to Group 3, 4 and 6. The FIA mandated minimum annual production runs of 500 cars for Group 3 (up from 100 previously<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.140\">Clausager 1982, p.140</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\">Moity 1974, p.102-4</ref>) and 50 for Group 4,<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/>  which also had a maximum engine capacity of 5000cc. There were no engine limits on the GTs or Prototypes. As before, the Groups were split up in classes based on engine size, there was a sliding scale of a minimum weight based on the increasing engine size (from 450 to 1000&nbsp;kg for 500 to 7000cc) as was fuel-tank capacity (60 to 160 litres).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\nAlong with the new Appendix J, after four years of focus on GT racing the FIA announced the International Manufacturer's Championship, for Group 6 Prototypes (2L / >2L), and the International Sports Car Championship for Group 4 (1.3L / 2L / 5L).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208\"/>\n\n==Entries==\n[[File:Ford GT40 Mark II at Goodwood Revival 2013 001.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ford GT40]] Mark II ]]\n[[File:Ferrari-330p3-2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ferrari 330 P3]]]]\n[[File:Porsche 906 Tour Auto 2014 Circuit de Dijon Prenois 03.jpg|left|thumb|Porsche 906 Carrera]]\nWith the new regulations this year the ACO received a huge 103 entry requests.

Extensive work was done in the wind tunnel, and improving the brakes, handling and engine \u2013 not least improving the fuel economy.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\">Clarke 1997, p.6-7: Autosport Jun17 1966</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\">Fox 1973, p.201</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.18\">Clarke 1997, p.18: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.209\">Armstrong 1966, p.209</ref> The big 7-litre engine now put out 475&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> But the new year started with promise with [[Ken Miles]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]] winning both the inaugural [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and then [[12 Hours of Sebring]].<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/> Copying Ferrari's tactic of overwhelming numbers, they put in fifteen Mark II entrants; eight were accepted by the ACO. This time six were built and prepared by [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]]. Shelby ran three cars himself for Americans [[Dan Gurney]] and [[Jerry Grant]], Miles was now paired with New Zealander [[Denny Hulme]] after Ruby had been injured in a plane crash a month earlier.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\">Fox 1973, p.198</ref> The third car was the all-[[Kiwi (people)|Kiwi]] pairing of [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Chris Amon]]. [[Holman Moody|Holman & Moody]], the successful Ford NASCAR race team was brought on board to race another trio \u2013 for [[Mark Donohue]]/[[Paul Hawkins (racing driver)|Paul Hawkins]], [[Ronnie Bucknum]]/[[Dick Hutcherson]], and [[Lucien Bianchi]]/[[Mario Andretti]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.15\">Clarke 1997, p.15: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref> One of the big improvements Holman & Moody brought with them was a quick-change brakepad system to save time in the pits.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.21\">Clarke 1997, p.21: Road & Track Oct 1966</ref>\n\nThe British team [[Alan Mann Racing]] had two cars prepared by Ford Advanced Vehicles, for [[Graham Hill]]/[[Dick Thompson (racing driver)|Dick Thompson]] and [[John Whitmore (racing driver)|John Whitmore]]/[[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]]. Each of the eight cars was painted in a colour from the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]] road-car range.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\">Spurring 2010, p.210-3</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\">Clarke 1997, p.10: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\nFerrari's response to the Mk II was the new [[Ferrari P#330 P3|Ferrari 330 P3]]. Shorter and wider than the P2, it kept the same 4-litre engine but with fuel-injection now put out 420&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.209\"/> The works team had a pair of closed-cockpit versions for [[John Surtees]]/[[Ludovico Scarfiotti]] and former winners [[Lorenzo Bandini]]/[[Jean Guichet]]. An open-cockpit variant was given to the [[North American Racing Team]] (NART) for [[Pedro Rodriguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]]/[[Richie Ginther]]. But their race preparation had been limited by strike action in Italy.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\">Spurring 2010, p.217-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/><ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\">Laban 2001, p.150-1</ref>\n\nNART also entered a long-tailed P2, rebodied by [[Piero Drogo]] and driven by last year's winner [[Masten Gregory]] with [[Bob Bondurant]]. There were also P2/P3 hybrids for the [[Ecurie Francorchamps]] (Dumay/\"Beurlys\") and [[Scuderia Filipinetti]] ([[Willy Mairesse|Mairesse]]/[[Herbert M\u00fcller (racing driver)|M\u00fcller]]. Finally there was a P2 Spyder for Maranello Concessionaires ([[Richard Attwood|Attwood]]/[[David Piper (racing driver)|Piper]]).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\">Clarke 1997, p.9: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> Fighting on two fronts, the company also took on Porsche in the 2-litre class with its [[Dino 206 S]] with a pair from NART and another for Maranello. [[Nino Vaccarella]], race winner in [[1964 24 Hours of Le Mans|1964]], was furious when he found out he was \u2018demoted\u2019 to drive the Dino rather than the P3 and threatened to walk out, but did, in the end run the car.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\">Clarke 1997, p.24: Motor Jun25 1966</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\">Armstrong 1966, p.235</ref>\n\nChevrolet was the other player in the over 2-litre class. Ex-Ferrari engineer [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] had fallen out with [[Renzo Rivolta]] and with his own company brought his new design, the P538, but still using the 5.3L Chevrolet engine. The other Chevy was in Texan [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall]]\u2019s [[Chaparral Cars#2|Chaparral 2D]]. The 5.3L small block put out 420&nbsp;bhp and had a semi-automatic transmission.<ref name=\"Laban 2001, p.150-1\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> Driven by [[Phil Hill]] and [[Jo Bonnier]], they made a big impact winning the N\u00fcrburgring round just two weeks earlier.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\">Spurring 2010, p.227</ref>\n\nPorsche came with a new model \u2013 the [[Porsche 906|906]] designed by the team led by [[Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch]]. With the 2.0L flat-6 engine from the 911, it had recently been homologated for Group 4 with the requisite 50 cars.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.210\">Armstrong 1966, p.210</ref> It was race-proven too, after winning the [[Targa Florio]] the month before. However three ''langheck'' (long-tail) prototypes were also entered by the works team, driven by [[Hans Herrmann]]/[[Herbert Linge]], [[Jo Siffert]]/[[Colin Davis (racing driver)|Colin Davis]] and [[Udo Sch\u00fctz]]/[[Peter de Klerk]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\">Spurring 2010, p.220-1</ref>\n\nAlfa Romeo, and its works team [[Autodelta]], had withdrawn from racing for a year to prepare a new car for 1967.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/> But this year, a significant new manufacturer entered the fray: [[Matra]] had bought out [[Automobiles Ren\u00e9 Bonnet]] in 1964, rebadging the [[Matra Djet|Djet]]. However it was a new design that was entered. The M620 had a 2-litre version of the BRM Formula 1 engine developing 245&nbsp;bhp that could match the Porsches in speed, making 275&nbsp;kp/h (170&nbsp;mph). The three cars were driven by up and coming young French single-seater drivers [[Jean-Pierre Beltoise]]/[[Johnny Servoz-Gavin]], [[Jean-Pierre Jaussaud]]/[[Henri Pescarolo]] and [[Jo Schlesser]] with Welshman [[Alan Rees (racing driver)|Alan Rees]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.222\">Spurring 2010, p.222</ref>\n\nRemarkably, given British dominance of the race barely a decade earlier, there were only three British cars in this year's race. Defending class-champions Austin-Healey had two works entries. The other was a [[Marcos Engineering]] kit-car based on a Mini Cooper 'S' chassis. Entered by Frenchman Hubert Giraud and driven by Jean-Louis Marnat and Claude Ballot-Lena, the team was able to get a works engine and gearbox from [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]]. The spectators laughed at the small car and its apparent resemblance to a flea.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\">Spurring 2010, p.233</ref> But the Mini Marcos would became the 'darling of the crowds' later on in the race.\n\nAlpine, after its poor showing in the previous year, returned with 6 cars. The new A210 had a 1.3L Gordini-Renault engine with a Porsche gearbox making it more durable if only a little faster at 245&nbsp;kp/h (150&nbsp;mph). This year a new customer team, the Ecurie Savin-Calberson was supported by Alpine, with former Index winner Roger Delageneste.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\">Spurring 2010, p.224</ref>\n\n[[Charles Deutsch]] (CD) brought his new aerodynamic SP66. The car was powered by a 1130cc Peugeot engine, marking the return of the French company last seen in the 1938 race.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\">Spurring 2010, p.231</ref> Another competitor in the small prototypes was [[ASA (automobile)|ASA]]. Originally a Ferrari design by [[Carlo Chiti]] and [[Giotto Bizzarrini]] before their famous [[History of Ferrari#1961 \u2013 The great walkout|walk-out from Ferrari]], it was sold to the new Italian company and uprated with a 1290cc engine giving 125&nbsp;bhp. Two cars were entered, one by ASA and one by NART.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\">Spurring 2010, p.228</ref>\n\nThe new Group 4 category started attracting interest as the earlier prototypes were meeting the homologation and production requirements. There were six GT40s entered by customer teams, with the 4.7L engine. [[Jochen Rindt]], the previous year's winner, had moved across from Ferrari to Ford, in the new Canadian Comstock Racing Team. They joined Ford France, Scuderia Filipinetti and new privateers Scuderia Bear and [[Superior Essex|Essex Wire]]. Joining Skip Scott, team owner of the Essex Wire team, was a 21-year old [[Jacky Ickx]] in his Le Mans debut.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\">Spurring 2010, p.214-5</ref><ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\">Clausager 1982, p.147</ref>\n\nUp against them was [[Ed Hugus]]\u2019 modified Ferrari 275 GTB and the [[Ecurie Nationale Belge|Equipe Nationale Belge]] ran its 250 LM. Porsche also ran three regular 906s in the Sports category, two works entries as well as one for their Paris importer \u2018Toto\u2019 Veuillet.\n\nWith Shelby now fully concentrated on the Ford program, the Cobra GTs were abandoned. There were only three GT entries: the Ferrari customer teams Ecurie Francorchamps and Maranello Concessionaires both entered a 275 GTB. The third was a quiet though significant entry: Jacques Dewes, ever the pioneering privateer, brought the first Porsche 911 to Le Mans. Production of what would become the ubiquitous Le Mans car had started in late 1964 and the new 911 S model had its \u2018boxer\u2019 6-cylinder engine tuned to 160&nbsp;bhp.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.223\">Spurring 2010, p.223</ref>\n\nFinally, in a subcompetition of its own, there was the tyre-race between [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/>\n\n==Practice==\nOnce again there was rain at the April testing weekend. And once again there was tragedy with a fatal accident. American Walt Hansgen's Ford hit water on the pit straight and aquaplaned. He aimed for the escape road at the end of the straight, not realising it was blocked by a sandbank, which he hit at about 190&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph). Taken with critical injuries to the American military hospital at [[Orl\u00e9ans]], he died five days later.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.198\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\n\nA notable absentee at the test weekend was the Ferrari works team.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.6-7\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Chris Amon was fastest at the test weekend in the experimental [[Ford GT40#J-car|Ford J-car]] with a 3:34.4 lap.<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> But come race-week it was Gurney who put in the fastest qualifying lap of 3:30.6, a second faster than his stablemates Miles, Gardner and McLaren. Ginther was 5th in the fastest Ferrari with a 3:33.0, with Parkes and Bandini in 7th and 8th respectively. Phil Hill, in the Chaparral, broke up the Ford-Ferrari procession in 10th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\">Spurring 2010, p.235</ref>\n\nJo Siffert put the quickest Porsche 22nd on the grid with 3:51.0, with Nino Vaccarella's Ferrari in 24th (3:53.5) and Jo Schlesser's Matra just behind it (3:53.5). Over the test weekend, Mauro Bianchi had surprised many in the 1-litre Alpine, going as fast as the 1959 Ferrari Testa Rossas.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/>\nThe quickest Alpine in practice was [[Pauli Toivonen|Toivonen]]/Jansson (4:20.1), well ahead of the best CD (Ogier/Laurent 4:27.5) and the Austin-Healey's (4:45.1) and ASAs (4:49.8).<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.235\"/>\n\nThere were also two significant dramas in practice. The biggest news was the walkout of Ferrari's lead driver [[John Surtees]]. He and team manager Eugenio Dragoni had decided that he, as the fastest Ferrari driver and driving with [[Mike Parkes]], would act as the hare to bait and break the Fords. He was also still recovering from a big accident the previous year and would hand over to Scarfiotti if he got overly tired. Yet during raceweek, with news that new FIAT chairman [[Gianni Agnelli]] would be at the race, Dragoni changed the plan, putting Scarfiotti (Agnelli's nephew) in first. Surtees was furious and stormed off to Maranello to argue his case with [[Enzo Ferrari]].<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Not listened to, Surtees, Ferrari's [[1964 Formula One season|1964 F1 World Champion]], quit the team.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.217-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/>\n\nThe second incident was more serious \u2013 Dick Thompson in the Alan Mann Ford Mk II collided with Dick Holqvist who was going far slower in the Scuderia Bear Ford GT40 and pulled right in front of him at Maison Blanche.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/> Holqvist spun off with heavy damage, while Thompson was able to get back to the pits. While repairing the damage, officials told the team that they were disqualified for Thompson leaving the scene of a major accident. Thompson was adamant he had advised pit officials, and in the hearing Ford's director of racing Leo Beebe threatened to withdraw all Fords. He was supported by [[Fritz Huschke von Hanstein|Huschke von Hanstein]] who was prepared to withdraw the Porsche team as well.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> In the end, the car was reinstated though Thompson was banned. This still posed a problem for Ford as they were lacking spare drivers, with injuries with [[A.J. Foyt]], [[Jackie Stewart]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]].<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.9\"/> In the end Australian [[Brian Muir (racing driver)|Brian Muir]], who was in England was flown over to France. He did his two laps, his first ever at Le Mans on raceday morning to qualify.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/>\n\n==Race==\n===Start===\nOn a cool and cloudy afternoon, it was [[Henry Ford II]] this year who was the honorary starter.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Last minute raindrops caused a flurry of tyre changes and some cars switched from Firestone to Goodyear or Dunlop.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.24\"/> At the end of the first lap Ford's cars led \u2013 Hill ahead of Gurney then Bucknum, Parkes in the Ferrari, followed by Whitmore's Ford, the Chaparral, then the GT40s of Scott and Rindt.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> There had been instant excitement when Edgar Berney spun his Bizzarrini on the start-line amongst the crowd of departing cars.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.232\">Spurring 2010, p.232</ref><ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.144\">Clausager 1982, p.144</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> Miles had to pit after the first lap to fix his door after colliding with Whitmore's Ford at the start.<ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> Also pitting on the first lap was Paul Hawkins whose Ford broke a halfshaft going down the [[Mulsanne Straight]] lurching him sideways at nearly 350&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/> The Holman & Moody crew took 70 minutes to repair it only for Mark Donohue to have the rear boot blow off down the Mulsanne and find the differential had been terminally damaged.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.10\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.25\">Clarke 1997, p.25: Motor Jun25 1966</ref>\n\nOn the third lap Gurney took the lead, which he held onto until the first pit-stops. McLaren was being delayed by his tyres going off, so the team quietly changed from Firestones to Goodyears.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/> After only 9 laps, Rindt's Ford blew its engine at the end of the Mulsanne straight, so there would be no consecutive win.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/> At the end of the first hour Fords were 1-2-3, with Gurney leading by 24 seconds from Graham Hill and Bucknum. Fourth, 20 seconds further back, was the first NART Ferrari, of Rodriguez. Meanwhile, Miles had been putting in extremely fast laps, breaking the lap record and getting back up to 5th place. Parkes was 6th ahead of Bonnier in the Chaparral who had already been lapped. Within another hour Miles and Hulme had taken the lead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\">Spurring 2010, p.208-9</ref><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.201\"/>\n\nAt 8pm, only the Miles and Gurney Fords and Rodiguez's Ferrari were on the lead lap (#64).<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.26\">Clarke 1997, p.26: Motor Jun25 1966</ref> At dusk it started to drizzle, reducing the power advantage of the big Fords, and allowing the Ferraris to keep in touch. The Fords were further delayed as a number chose to change brake pads early.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/> By then all three Dinos were out with mechanical issues, removing one threat to Porsche.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1966, p.235\"/> A major accident occurred when Jean-Claude Ogier's CD got loose on spilt oil at the Mulsanne kink and was hit hard side-on by Fran\u00e7ois Pasquier in the NART ASA. Both cars hit the wall and caught fire,  and Ogier was taken to the hospital with two broken arms.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.228\"/><ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.231\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\">Clarke 1997, p.11: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref>\n\n===Night===\nAfter 6 hours, heavy rain was pouring down. Ginther's NART Ferrari was leading from Parkes, chased by the Fords of Miles and Gurney on the same lap, McLaren a lap behind then Bandini and Andretti two laps back. But Andretti was soon sidelined with a blown headgasket, as was the Hill/Muir Ford which had broken its front suspension coming out of Arnage corner.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\">Clarke 1997, p.12: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref> As the rain eased, the Fords of Miles and Gurney retook the lead. Just before midnight Robert Buchet aquaplaned coming over the crest at the Dunlop Bridge and crashed the French Porsche.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/> The Chaparral had been running well initially, getting as high as 5th, until a broken alternator stopped them also just before midnight while running in 8th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.227\"/>\n\nAnother heavy downpour at 12.30 contributed to a big accident in the Esses. Guichet had just spun his Ferrari in the rain and got away when Buchet arrived and crashed his Porsche. Then Schlesser's Matra ran into the CD of Georges Heligouin avoiding the accident. As the damage was being cleared, Scarfiotti crashed his P3 into the Matra and all four cars were wrecked, although only Scarfiotti was taken to hospital, with minor bruising.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.11\"/>\n\nDuring the night the Ferraris started to suffer from overheating. When the NART P3 retired from 4th with a broken gearbox at 3am, and the Filipinetti car of Mairesse/M\u00fcller from 5th an hour later, the Ferrari challenge was spent \u2013 there would be no privateer-saviours for the marque this year. At halfway the Ford Mk IIs held the top-4 places (Miles/Hulme, Gurney/Grant, McLaren/Amon, Bucknum/Hutcherson) with GT40s in 5-6-8: Essex, Filipinetti and Ford-France (Revson/Scott, Spoerry/Sutcliffe, Ligier/Grossman). Siffert/Davis were leading a train of Porsches in 7th and the nearest Ferrari was the Bandini/Guichet P3 limping in 12th. Ford told their cars to drop to 4-minute laps, but Gurney and Miles kept racing hard for the lead.<ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.12\"/>\n\n===Morning===\nWhat could have been a procession was anything but for Ford. At 8 am, a pit-stop for the Filipinetti Ford running 5th spilled petrol on a rear tyre. On his out-lap Spoerry lost traction and spun at the Esses wrecking the car. The Ford-France and Essex cars had already retired with engine issues during the night.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.214-5\"/>\n\nAt 9am the Gurney/Grant car, which had been dicing for the lead with Miles & Hulme (against strict team orders), retired from 1st when the car blew a headgasket. That left Ford with only three Mk IIs left (albeit running 1-2-3) as all the GT40s had retired as well. Porsches now held the next five places and the two Ferrari GTs were 9th and 10th chased by the Alpines.\n\n===Finish and post-race===\nWith the field covered it was now that Leo Beebe, Ford racing director, contrived to stage a dead heat by having his two lead cars cross the line simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/le-mans/look-back-1966-le-mans-24-hours|title=A look back at the 1966 Le Mans 24 Hours|date=2016-05-05|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref> The ACO told him this would not be possible \u2014 given the staggered starting formation, the #2 car would have covered 20 metres further, and thus be the race winner. But Beebe pushed on with his plan anyway.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.208-9\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\">Fox 1973, p.202</ref>\n\nAt the last pit stop, the Mark IIs were still in front. Miles/Hulme were leading, followed by McLaren/Amon holding station on the same lap. The gold Bucknum/Hutcherson car was third, but twelve laps behind. Miles was told to ease off to allow McLaren to catch up with him. Just before 4pm, it started to drizzle again. As it turned out McLaren's #2 car crossed the finish line just ahead and was declared the winner. It was rumoured that Miles, upset about the team orders, lifted off to allow McLaren to finish a length ahead.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 1997, p.13\">Clarke 1997, p.13: Road & Track Sept 1966</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1104584_watch-the-story-of-the-controversy-behind-the-ford-gt40s-photo-finish-at-le-mans-in-1966|title=Watch the story of the controversy behind the Ford GT40's photo finish at Le Mans in 1966|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2016/06/17/le-mans-1966-the-golden-mystery.html|title=Le Mans 1966: The Golden Mystery \u2013 dailysportscar.com|website=www.dailysportscar.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref>\n\nAt their last pitstop, the 7th-placed Porsche of [[Peter Gregg (racing driver)|Peter Gregg]] and Sten Axelsson was stopped by engine problems. Gregg parked the car waiting for the last lap, but at 3.50pm he could not get it restarted and missed the formation finish. The other Porsches came in 4th to 7th led by Siffert/Davis, who also claimed the Index of Performance. The [[Rolf Stommelen|Stommelen]]/[[G\u00fcnter Klass|Klass]] car in 7th was the first, and only, Sports car to finish. Finally, the new 911 GT ran well and finished 14th starting a long record of success.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.220-1\"/>\n\nFour Alpines finished this year, 9-11-12-13, with that of Delageneste/Cheinisse from the Ecurie Savin-Calberson winning the Thermal Efficiency Index.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.224\"/> The final finisher was the little Mini Marcos. Formerly the object of laughter, it had become a crowd favourite running like clockwork. As car after car ran into trouble and dropped out, the little Marcos, by this time nicknamed 'la puce bleue' (the blue flea) wailed on. Despite finishing 26 laps behind the rest of the field.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.233\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.102-4\"/> the car eventually came home at an incredible 15th overall.\n\nIt had taken three attempts for Ford to win [[1965 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] and the NASCAR Championship, and now it added the Le Mans 24 Hours. Chrysler had first entered in 1925, and after 41 years it was the first win for an American car.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/> The official [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] press release, erroneously dated 7/5/1966, claims:  {{cquote|The McLaren-Amon and the Miles-Hulme cars were running within seconds of each other as the race neared its end, with the Bucknum-Hutcherson car hanging back as insurance. A decision was made in the Ford pits to have the cars finish side by side in what hopefully would be considered a dead heat. All three cars went over the finish in formation, but any chance for a dead heat disappeared when officials discovered a rule that in case of a tie, the car that had started further down the grid had travelled the farther distance. Since McLaren and Amon had started 60 feet behind Miles and Hulme, they were declared the winners. Both [[New Zealanders]] who now reside in England, it was the most important victory yet for the two youngsters. McLaren, who builds his own Formula and sports cars, is 28. Amon 22, is the youngest winner in the history of the event. It was a record shattering performance as the winning car covered more miles (3,009.3) at a faster speed (125.38 mph) than any previous entry. It demonstrated that production engines could compete with racing powerplants and that an American-built car could top Europe's best.<ref>[https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/Europe/en/2016/06/Ford%201966%20Le%20Mans%20release.pdf]</ref>}} The Ford team's decision was a big disappointment for Ken Miles, who was aiming for the [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|'Endurance Racing]] Triple Crown'\u2014winning Daytona-Sebring-Le Mans\u2014as a reward for his investment in the GT40 development. \"I'm disappointed, of course, but what are you going to do about it.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/18408295/|title=20 Jun 1966, Page 11 - The Cumberland News at Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref> Beebe also later admitted he had been annoyed with Miles racing Gurney, disregarding team orders by potentially risking the cars\u2019 endurance.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/>  Two months later, Ken Miles was killed at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside]] while testing the next generation Ford GT40 J-Car, which became the MkIV that won Le Mans in 1967.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.210-3\"/><ref name=\"Fox 1973, p.202\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|title=Ken Miles--an appreciation|website=www.cobracountry.com|access-date=2016-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201829/http://www.cobracountry.com/editorials/kenmiles/home.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn a race of attrition it was fortunate the big teams brought such quantity \u2013 only 3 of the 13 Fords finished and only the two GTs finished from the 14 Ferraris entered. By contrast, 5 of the 7 Porsches finished (including their 911 in the GT class) as did four of the six Alpines, showing much better reliability. It was the first time that the 3000 miles/125&nbsp;mph mark had been exceeded.<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.147\"/>\n\nWith the bitter failure of Ferrari's 330 P3 mirroring the failure of the Ford prototypes the previous year (and with salt rubbed into the wound with Ford's formation finish), the \"Ford-Ferrari War\" moved into its climactic phase.  The Le Mans results boosted Ford over Ferrari for the [[1966 World Sportscar Championship#Manufacturers' Championship|1966 Manufacturers' Championship]].  Ford's answer to Ferrari's next weapon, the [[Ferrari P|330 P4]], was delayed by development problems, handing Ferrari a rematch with the Mk IIs that so dominated them at LeMans, at the 1967 [[Daytona 24 Hours]].  After a defective batch of transaxle shafts sank Ford's effort, Ferrari took a 1-2-3 finish with their new P4s and returned the favor of Ford's victory formation.  Ford's [[Ford GT40|Mark IV]] was ready in time for the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], where it won on its maiden outing.  Three more examples were produced and prepared for the Le Mans 24 Hours, while Ford's championship hopes rested on the older [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] and the new GT40-derived [[Mirage (race car)|Mirages]] to gain points in the intervening races.  After a disappointing showing at [[1000 km Monza|Monza]] a controversial denial of championship points from a Mirage win at the [[1000 km Spa|Spa]] event, Ford saw limited opportunity for taking the Manufacturers' title again and instead concentrated on a last hurrah at Le Mans, where the leading Mark IV, driven by Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt, won handily.  Ferrari took the Manufacturers' title for 1967, edging up-and-coming Porsche by two points.\n\nThe Ford-Ferrari War was ended by new rules for 1968 that eliminated the P4s and Mark IVs from eligibility for the Sports Prototype class with a 3-litre engine capacity limit.  The GT40s met the production requirement and 5 litre limit for [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] in the new [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] class.  Ferrari found the production requirement for homologating the P4 under Group 4 daunting and withdrew from competition in the sport-racer classes.  Neither Ford nor Ferrari fielded a factory team for the Manufacturers' Championship that year; however, the [[John Wyer]] team running the Group 4 [[Ford GT40|GT40s]] brought home the title for Ford and in 1969 achieved wins with the GT40 at Sebring and Le Mans.  When Ferrari was able to enter a homologated car for 1970, the class they competed in was dominated by the [[Porsche 917]].\n\nSeveral cars of the original 24-hours race have survived and have been restored to their former glory. The crowd-pleasing Mini Marcos was club raced, rallied and hill climbed, road registered twice and repainted five times only to be stolen in the night of 30 October 1975 from beneath a flat in Paris. Three days earlier Marcos-boss Harold Dermott had made a deal to buy the car with the intention to restore it and put on museum display. Several people searched for the car ever since, but it was only found back in December 2016 in Portugal by Dutchman Jeroen Booij.\n\n== Legacy in popular culture ==\n=== ''Go Like Hell'' ===\nThe race became the subject of a 2009 book, detailing the race and the famous background rivalry between [[Enzo Ferrari]] and [[Henry Ford II]], by [[A.J.

I recall it was damp and we were running on intermediate Firestone tires and at 210\u2013220 mph [355 kmh] on the Mulsanne Straight, the tires were shedding tread. I took over from Bruce and he spoke to Firestone and they generously said we could switch to the Goodyears the other GT40s were running. Bruce said to me we had to drive the doors off the thing, so we did. There was a bit of history to that. We had both driven the first two 7.0-litre cars at Le Mans the previous year: Bruce with Ken Miles and myself with Phil Hill. We were warned to be careful with the gearbox as they were new and unproven, and both cars retired with gearbox failures. As a result, when I went to Daytona for the 24 hours, paired with Bruce, I suggested to Bruce that we set a fairly conservative pace for the race, and whilst we might be running out of the top three in the early stages, we might be the only one there at the end. We finished fifth. For Le Mans, we decided to set a pace for ourselves. This strategy fell apart when our tires started losing treads early in the race and we lost considerable time. When I was called in to change tires, I think Bruce's frustration had reached boiling point, he put his head through the car door and said 'Go like hell!'.\" At the finish: \"the idea was that the leading GT40s would cross the line together, but in practice, it wasn't possible to have a dead heat.

The following year, they won again. The year after that, they won a third time. And in 1969, a fourth.\n\nThat achievement was arguably the greatest in the company's history. It came after years of struggle, more than a few public failures, and enough burnt cash to refloat the ''Titanic. ''Ford's Sixties Le Mans program was famously the result of a dispute between Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari\u2013Ford had tried to purchase Ferrari (the company), only to have Enzo shut down the sale at the last minute. Ford the man vowed to get even, aiming his considerable resources at Ferrari's Le Mans record. The resulting warpath employed everyone from Bruce McLaren to Carroll Shelby and Indy 500 legend [[A. J. Foyt|A.J. Foyt]], putting the stops to Ferrari's unbroken, five-year winning streak at La Sarthe.\n\nCollectively, Ford's wins were one of countless bright moments in a golden decade for both motorsport and [[Popular culture|culture]] in general. That first win made it onto the front pages of European newspapers, and it actually helped sell new cars. Ferrari never won Le Mans again, but Ford wouldn't go back until 2016. When [[2016 24 Hours of Le Mans|Dearborn won last year]], the world went less than nuts. But that makes sense: Both Le Mans and international motorsport are different now, tamer and less raw. So is the automobile itself. Racing is no longer a brutally dangerous pastime or the kind of thing that puts whole countries on the edge of their seats. And most of all, in 2016, there is no [[Henry Ford II|Henry the Deuce]], no world-altering grudge match, no Enzo, no Carroll. The Ford-Ferrari war pivoted on how these men operated and thought, and they made that story what it was.\" Sam Smith, ''Adam Carolla's 'The 24 Hour War' Is a Car Movie by Car People That Isn't Just for Car People'', [[Road & Track|Road and Track]], Jan. 18, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/entertainment/a32330/film-review-adam-carollas-the-24-hour-war/|title=Adam Carolla's 'The 24 Hour War' Is a Car Movie by Car People That Isn't Just for Car People|date=2017-01-18|work=Road & Track|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en}}</ref>}}\n\n=== ''Ford v Ferrari'' ===\n{{Main|Ford v Ferrari}}\n''Ford v Ferrari'' (known as  ''Le Mans '66'' in the UK and other territories) is a sports drama film based on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari for the dominance at Le Mans distributed by [[20th Century Fox]].

However, music channels were unwilling to play it at the time and eventually reached an agreement to play it extensively from December onwards. Consequently, Jay Sean pushed back the single's release date as well as the album's release date. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.\n\nThe song, produced by [[Alan Sampson]],<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/sampsonmusic Official MySpace of the producer Alan Sampson]</ref> became Song of the Week on London's [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] on 10 December 2007 and was also playlisted on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital 95.8FM]], [[Choice FM]], [[The Galaxy Network|Galaxy]], [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|BBC 1Xtra]], and being featured on [[BBC Radio 1|BBC Radio 1's]] B-list. It reached the number one spot on MTV's The Base Chart Show. Later, a [[Hindi]] version of the song was added to [[YouTube]].\n\nSean said of this song: \"It started off with me in the studio with a rap, jumping around like a joker. It's all about the games people play across the dancefloor on a night out \u2013 how you can catch someone's eye and accept a challenge that lasts the rest of the evening.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nThe intro and the epic melody background was based on the ''Hero''<ref>[[Hero (2002 film)]]</ref> soundtrack by [[Tan Dun]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCkbfapn-I4</ref> Some of the scenes in the video were shot in [[Manhattan]].\n\nThe song appears to have a second version with shorter play time and changed lyrics in its third verse.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for the single was shot on 12 August 2007 in the central London nightclub Mo*Vida. On 28 September 2007, the video was exclusively available to watch on 3G mobile handsets and on 9 October 2007 was officially released to the internet by [[2Point9 Records]]. The new video featured Jay Sean with a new style after being out of the limelight for nearly three and a half years.\nOn 28 September 2007, the video was exclusively available to watch on 3G mobile handsets. A clip of the video was added to the 2Point9 YouTube Channel on 29 September 2007.\n\nBy 9 October 2007, the full video was added onto the 2Point9 YouTube Channel. The video premiered on The Box and other music channels in December. It starts off with Jay Sean arriving outside a club, the video is interspersed with a scene of Jay in a dark hallway. He flirts with a woman played by the British Victoria's Secret model, Anara Atanes and then a dance ensues, the video ends with the girl arriving by his side.\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! # !!

The single was also very successful and one of the most played songs in [[Eastern Europe]], particularly in Russia, Bulgaria and Romania, where it became one of the top three best-selling singles of the year. A [[Hindi]] version of the song was also included in the Indian release of the album ''My Own Way''.\n\nIn 2019, a remixed version by Kosovan artist [[Regard (DJ)|DJ Regard]] was officially released<!-- The song was not remixed in 2019, only officially released in 2019.

However, music channels were unwilling to play it at the time and eventually reached an agreement to play it extensively from December onwards. Consequently, Jay Sean pushed back the single's release date as well as the album's release date. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.\n\nThe song, produced by [[Alan Sampson]],<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/sampsonmusic Official MySpace of the producer Alan Sampson]</ref> became Song of the Week on London's [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] on 10 December 2007 and was also playlisted on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital 95.8FM]], [[Choice FM]], [[The Galaxy Network|Galaxy]], [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|BBC 1Xtra]], and being featured on [[BBC Radio 1|BBC Radio 1's]] B-list. It reached the number one spot on MTV's The Base Chart Show. Later, a [[Hindi]] version of the song was added to [[YouTube]].\n\nSean said of this song: \"It started off with me in the studio with a rap, jumping around like a joker. It's all about the games people play across the dancefloor on a night out \u2013 how you can catch someone's eye and accept a challenge that lasts the rest of the evening.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nThe intro and the epic melody background was based on the ''Hero''<ref>[[Hero (2002 film)]]</ref> soundtrack by [[Tan Dun]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCkbfapn-I4</ref> Some of the scenes in the video were shot in [[Manhattan]].\n\nThe song appears to have a second version with shorter play time and changed lyrics in its third verse.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for the single was shot on 12 August 2007 in the central London nightclub Mo*Vida. On 28 September 2007, the video was exclusively available to watch on 3G mobile handsets and on 9 October 2007 was officially released to the internet by [[2Point9 Records]]. The new video featured Jay Sean with a new style after being out of the limelight for nearly three and a half years.\nOn 28 September 2007, the video was exclusively available to watch on 3G mobile handsets. A clip of the video was added to the 2Point9 YouTube Channel on 29 September 2007.\n\nBy 9 October 2007, the full video was added onto the 2Point9 YouTube Channel. The video premiered on The Box and other music channels in December. It starts off with Jay Sean arriving outside a club, the video is interspersed with a scene of Jay in a dark hallway. He flirts with a woman played by the British Victoria's Secret model, Anara Atanes and then a dance ensues, the video ends with the girl arriving by his side.\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! # !!

For example, when a consumer makes a purchase at a merchant site that's set up to handle server-side digital wallets, they type their name, payment and shipping information into the merchant's own form. At the end of the purchase, the consumer is asked to sign up for a wallet of their choice by entering a user name and password for future purchases. Users can also acquire wallets at a wallet vendor's site.\n\nAlthough a wallet is free for consumers, vendors charge merchants for wallets.

His seat was at [[Colcombe Castle]] near [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], and later at the principal historic family seat of [[Tiverton Castle]], after his mother's death. The [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay family]] had historically been an important one in the region, and the dominant force in the counties of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]. However, the rise in power and influence of several [[gentry]] families and other political players, in the years leading up to Thomas' accession to the earldom, threatened the traditional dominance of the earls of Devon in the area. Much of his life was spent in armed territorial [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|struggle against his near-neighbour]], [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville|Sir William Bonville]] of [[Shute, Devon|Shute]], at a time when central control over the provinces was weak. This feud forms part of the breakdown in law and order in England that led to the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nCourtenay was for a time engaged in overseas service during the [[Hundred Years' War]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} Increasingly, however, his efforts became directed towards strengthening his position at home. He had been married off as an infant to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]], placing Courtenay close to the English king's [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] kinsmen. Due to this connection, Courtenay started his career as an adherent to the English court's [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] party. Upon their demise in the late 1440s, he abandoned it in favour of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]]. When York sought the support of Courtenay's arch-enemy Bonville, Courtenay fell out of favour with him. When the Wars of the Roses broke out, he was in the party of the queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], and was one of the Lancastrian commanders at the [[First Battle of St Albans]], where he was wounded.\n\nCourtenay was said to have promoted a reconciliation between the Lancastrian and Yorkist parties, but he died suddenly in 1458. The Wars of the Roses later led to the deaths and executions of all three of Courtenay's sons, [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|Thomas]], Henry, and [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|John]], and to the eventual [[attainder]] of his titles and forfeiture of his lands. The Earldom was however revived in 1485 for his distant cousin, [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1485 creation)|Sir Edward Courtenay]], third in descent from his great-uncle.\n\n==Youth==\nCourtenay was born on 3 May 1414,{{sfn|Nathan|1957|p=[{{google books|vno-vmV2F5sC|pg=152|plainurl=yes}} 152]}} the only surviving son of [[Hugh de Courtenay, 4th Earl of Devon|Hugh Courtenay, 4th/12th Earl of Devon]] (1389 &ndash; 16 June 1422) and Anne Talbot{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} (c.1393\u20131441), sister of the renowned warrior [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]]. He succeeded as '''Earl of Devon''' in 1422, at the age of eight. He may at some time before have become a [[wardship|ward]] of the all-powerful [[Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=15}}\n\nAccording to Cokayne, Courtenay was knighted on 19 May 1426 by King [[Henry VI of England]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} and on 16 December 1431, Courtenay was among an entourage of 300 who attended King Henry VI's second coronation{{sfn|Griffiths|1981}} at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=15}}\n\n===Majority===\nIt appears that no inquisition of proof of age, customary for a [[tenant in chief]], was taken for his father. Based on his family's history and standing and on his own position as the leading landowner of the county, probably expected to take his place as the leader of Devon society. However, his mother's longevity meant that her dower portion, including Tiverton Castle, and the other Courtenay estates which had been alienated under his father's will were not in his hands and the young Courtenay  was forced to live at Colcombe Castle, near [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], very close to his enemy [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]], at Shute.{{sfn|Cherry|1981}} His income of \u00a31500 p.a. was lower than that of most nobles of comparable rank.\n\n==Career==\n===Struggle with Bonville===\n{{main|Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud}}\n[[File:BonvilleArms.png|thumb|200px|Arms of Bonville: ''Sable, six mullets argent pierced gules''{{sfn|Burke|1884|p=99}}]]\nThe new earl found the political situation in Devonshire increasingly stacked against his own interests as a coalition of the greater [[gentry]], led by [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]], and the earl's cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay of [[Powderham]], threatened the Courtenays\u2019 traditional dominance of the county. The relationship was complicated by Bonville's second marriage in 1430 to Elizabeth Courtenay (d. 1471), Courtenay's aunt. Despite links via his wife, [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]], to the ascendant \"court party\" led by [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Beaufort]] and [[John Beaufort, 1st Marquess of Dorset|John Beaufort, 1st earl of Somerset and Marquess of Dorset]], and by [[Margaret Holland]], daughter of the [[Earl of Kent]], Courtenay failed to rectify his situation and instead resorted to violence, beginning in 1439. With the decline of Beaufort power, Courtenay became increasingly associated with [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]]. Courtenay had been attacking Bonville's estates in  the summer of 1439 and the king despatched a [[Privy Councillor]], Sir [[John Stourton, 1st Baron Stourton]], to extract a promise of good behavior from Courtenay, who was thereafter reluctant to attend the court in [[London]].{{sfn|PRO|1907|pp=314, 448}}<ref>The pirate-soldier, Sir Hugh Courtenay, a cousin looted [[merchant vessel]]s along the coast, and led [[brigand]]s with Thomas Carminow, after a long dispute with the Earl.</ref> In 1441, Courtenay was appointed as Steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], a nearly identical post to Royal Steward for Cornwall which had been granted to Sir William Bonville in 1437, for life.{{sfn|PRO|1907|pp=133, 532}} A week later in May 1441, the warrant was retracted. Disputes arose between the two which contemporary records portray as reaching the status of a [[private war]]. Two men wearing Courtenay livery attacked Sir Philip Chetwynd, a friend of Bonville, on the road to London, apparent evidence that the Council's arbitration of November 1440 had failed.<ref>The \"Arbitration\" was published on 1 April 1442.</ref>  Courtenay and Bonville were summoned before the King in December 1441, and were publicly reconciled.{{sfn|Nicolas|1835|pp=165\u201366, 173\u201375}} Tensions remained however and this may have been a factor in the crown's requests to both Courtenay, who initially refused, and Bonville to serve in France, Bonville as [[seneschal]] of [[Gascony]] from 1442\u201346 and Courtenay at [[Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque, Calvados|Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque]] in Normandy in 1446.{{sfn|Nicolas|1835|p=[{{google books|1Pw9AAAAcAAJ|pg=240|plainurl=yes}} 240]}} This is one of the few times that Courtenay served abroad, for he had refused in March 1443, seemingly preferring to spend his time bolstering his position in Devon or at court. While Bonville was abroad, the King released Devon from his debts, including the [[recognisance]] for good behaviour, probably remitted by the influence of father-in-law, John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset.{{sfnm|1a1=Nicolas|1y=1835|1p=408|2a1=Public Record Office|2y=1937|2p=396}}\n\n==Royal appointments==\n===Commissions===\nHis advantageous marriage to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]] brought him links to the \"court party\", and Courtenay began to be selected by the king to serve on Westcountry commissions and was granted an annuity of \u00a3100 for his services.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=315}}\n\n===Other===\n1445 marked a fleeting high point in Courtenay's fortunes, with his appointment as High Steward of England at Queen Margaret's coronation on 25 May.{{sfn|PRO|1908|p=355}} Only the year before, March 1444, Bonville had identified himself with Suffolk, at Margaret's betrothal in Rouen.\n\n==Abandonment of Beauforts==\nThe deaths of his brother-in-law [[John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset]], in 1444, and of the leader of the party [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Beaufort]], 2nd son of [[John of Gaunt]], in 1447, removed Beaufort leadership of the 'court' party, leaving [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], as the most influential figure in national politics.<ref>{{harvnb|Watts|1996}} and {{harvnb|Griffiths|1981}} for differing views on the relationship between Suffolk and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].</ref> While there is no evidence of direct antagonism between Courtenay and the Duke of Suffolk, the latter appeared to favour the Bonvilles. Sir William Bonville enjoyed links with Suffolk and  married his daughter to [[William Tailboys]], one of the Duke's closest associates. Perhaps the most dramatic illustration of this favour was Bonville's elevation to the peerage, presumably at the direction of Suffolk, as [[Baron Bonville]] of Chewton Mendip in 1449.{{sfn|PRO|1941|p=107}}\n\n==Switch to Yorkist party==\nThis promotion of his enemy Bonville may have prompted Devon to oppose the 'Court party' and to serve with his friend [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]] during [[Jack Cade's Rebellion]].  Courtenay switched allegiance to York, who with the [[John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] took control briefly of London. He remained loyal to York during the Parliament of November 1450, when they invoked the support of the [[Commons]] to raise taxation. Having rescued the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] from an angry London mob, York himself had to flee, taking refuge on the Earl of Devon's [[barge]] rowing down the [[Thames]].\nIt is hardly surprising that Devon began to become associated with York, who had assumed the leadership of the \"opposition\" party. The parlous state of national politics (whether the king was a vindictive factionalist or an inane non-entity is largely irrelevant in this context) combined with what seems like a reckless and violent element in Courtenay's own character, led to a further campaign of violence against Bonville and the Suffolk-aligned [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond and Earl of Wiltshire]]. Courtenay and his troops attempted to capture Butler near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in Wiltshire before returning to besiege Bonville in [[Taunton|Taunton Castle]]. The arrival of York (whether to suppress or aid the disturbances is uncertain) caused the two sides to make peace which, unsurprisingly, had no real meaning.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=281}} York then embarked on his abortive attempt to take control of royal government by force, his only allies being Courtenay and his sometime-associate, [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham]].\n\nIn the West Country Courtenay hounded Bonville without mercy, and pursued him to [[Taunton Castle]] and laid siege to it.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=84}} York arrived to lift the siege, and imprisoned Bonville, who was nevertheless quickly released. This exploit ended with the disgrace of all three 'Yorkists' and their submission to royal mercy in March. The King had issued an arrest warrant on 24 September 1451, drafted by Somerset, to be enforced by Butler and Bonville.  The Yorkist rebellions prompted royal commissions for Buckingham and Bonville on 14 February 1452. A direct summons without delay was ordered by [[Royal Proclamation]] on 17 February to bring Courtenay and Lord Cobham to London.<ref>Lord Cobham had been dispossessed by the Earl of Wiltshire, a creation of Henry VI.ibid, 98</ref>\n\n===Treason charge===\nCourtenay was charged with [[treason]] and briefly imprisoned in [[Wallingford Castle]],{{sfn|Harriss|1965|p=216}} before appearing on trial before the [[House of Lords]]. His [[wikt:disgrace|disgrace]] and political isolation allowed his Devonshire rivals to consolidate their positions, further undermining his decreased standing in the county.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=285\u201386}} Bonville acquired all [[royal commission]]s in the south-west.\n\n== Resurgence of York ==\nKing Henry VI's madness and York's appointment as Protector in 1453/4 resulted in a partial rally in Courtenay's fortunes, including his re-appointment to commissions of the peace in the south-western counties, the key barometer of the local balance of power.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=290}} He was a member of the Royal Council until April 1454.{{sfnm|1a1=Storey|1y=1999|1p=165|2a1=Nicolas|2y=1837|2pp=189\u2013193}} Courtenay was bound over to keep the peace with a fine of 1000 marks, but ignored its restrictions. Threatened by the Council on 3 June, he was forced on 24 July to make a new bond.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}}\n\n==Abandonment by York==\nThis was, however, the end of Courtenay's links with York, whose increasingly tight links with the Neville earls of [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Salisbury]] and [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] led to an alignment with Bonville away from Courtenay. This culminated in the marriage of [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington]], Bonville's grandson, to Salisbury's daughter, Katherine. Courtenay did not endear himself to Somerset either, as he and his sons repeatedly disrupted the sessions of the commissioners of the peace in Exeter during 1454/5, which did not assist Protector Somerset in promoting his role as the guardian of law and order. Courtenay was present at the [[First Battle of St Albans]], and was wounded.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} York however still considered him at least neutral as the Duke's letters addressed  to the King on the eve of battle were delivered to the king via the apparently still trusted hands of Courtenay.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=297}}\n\n==Final assault on Bonville==\nPerhaps inspired by the way the Nevilles and York had forcefully ended their respective feuds with the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Percies]] and the [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] in the battle, Courtenay returned to Devon and commenced a further campaign of violence against Bonville and his allies, who were now attached to Warwick's party. The violence began in October 1455 with the horrific murder by Courtenay allies of [[Nicholas Radford]], an eminent [[Westcountry]] lawyer,<ref>\"apprentice of the law\" Radford was a well-known local dignitary, an old man at the time; {{harvnb|PRO|1909|pp=269, 281}}</ref> Recorder of Exeter and one of Bonville's councilors. Several contemporary accounts, including the [[Paston Letters]], record this event with the ensuing mock-funeral and coronary inquest accompanied by the singing of highly inappropriate songs, in tones of shock and horror unusual during the blunted sensitivities of the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Gairdner|1897|p=351}} Among the murderers was [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]], the earl's son and later successor.{{sfn|Storey|1999|pp=168\u201370}} Parliament, meeting in November 1455, reported 800 horsemen and 4,000 infantry running amok across Devon. On 3 November 1455 Courtenay with his sons, Thomas Carrew of Ashwater and a considerable force of 1,000 men occupied the city of Exeter, nominally controlled by Bonville as castellan of the royal castle of Exeter, which they continued to control until 23 December 1455.<ref>{{Harvnb|Storey|1999|p=167}}; Estates of the Percy family, 89\u201396</ref> Courtenay had before warned the populace that Bonville was approaching with a 'great multitude' to sack the city. On 3 November 1455 Bonville's men setting out from  his seat at [[Old Shute House|Shute]] had looted the Earl's nearby house at [[Colcombe Castle]], [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], and Bonville promised his support to the Earl's distant cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay of [[Powderham]]. Dozens of men violated consecrated ground and Radford's valuables were extracted from the cathedral and his house in Exeter was also robbed. Village-dwellers with Bonville connections were assaulted by Devon's men. [[Powderham Castle]], home to the earl's estranged cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay (d. 1463), an ally of Bonville, was besieged on 15 November 1455, the earl's weaponry now including a [[Cannon|serpentine]] cannon. Bonville attempted to relieve the castle but was repulsed as the Earl threatened to batter down its walls.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=311}} Finally battle was joined directly between Bonville and Courtenay at the [[Clyst Heath#Battle of Clyst Heath (1455)|Battle of Clyst Heath]], at Clyst Bridge, just south east of Exeter on 15 December 1455. While it seems that Bonville was put to flight, the number of dead or wounded is entirely unknown. Two days later Thomas Carrew with 500 of Courtenay's retainers pillaged Shute, seizing a bounty of looted goods. Courtenay and his men left Exeter on 21 December 1455 and shortly afterwards submitted to York at [[Shaftesbury]] in Dorset. Early in December 1455 the King had dismissed Devon from the Commission of Peace, and citizens of Exeter had been instructed not to help his army of \"misrule\" in any way.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=173}}\n\n== Aftermath of Clyst Heath ==\nDevon was [[incarcerate]]d in the Tower. Originally, the government planned to bring him to trial for treason but this was abandoned once the King Henry VI returned to  sanity in February 1456, and York was removed as Protector. Courtenay was also returned to the commission of the peace for Devonshire, seemingly the work of [[Margaret of Anjou|Queen Margaret of Anjou]] who had taken personal control of the court. Courtenay had cultivated links with Queen Margaret, and an alliance was sealed by the marriage of his son and heir, [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|Sir Thomas Courtenay]], to the Queen's kinswoman, Marie, the daughter of [[Charles, Count of Maine]]. Despite having been banned from entering and leading armed men into Exeter and holding assemblies, 500 men under John Courtenay entered the [[High Street]] on 8 April 1456.  His rivals, Philip Courtenay and Lord Fitzwarin, were prevented from exercising commissions as [[Justice of the peace|Justices of the Peace]], and were forced to leave the city. Butler, Bonville's patron, and Sir [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], [[Chief Justice]], arrived with a large entourage to investigate under a commission of [[oyer et terminer]]. They rejected Courtenay's  petition to have Bonville's [[sheriff|sheriffdom of Devon]] removed.<ref>Rotuli, op cit., 332</ref>  Two years later his sons, Thomas and Henry Courtenay, were absolved of the murder of Nicholas Radford.{{sfn|PRO|1910|pp=308, 393, 398}}\n\nCourtenay was restored to the bench of JPs and was made Keeper of the Park of Clarendon in February 1457,<ref>History of Commons, 1422\u20131508, vol.

His seat was at [[Colcombe Castle]] near [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], and later at the principal historic family seat of [[Tiverton Castle]], after his mother's death. The [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay family]] had historically been an important one in the region, and the dominant force in the counties of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]. However, the rise in power and influence of several [[gentry]] families and other political players, in the years leading up to Thomas' accession to the earldom, threatened the traditional dominance of the earls of Devon in the area. Much of his life was spent in armed territorial [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|struggle against his near-neighbour]], [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville|Sir William Bonville]] of [[Shute, Devon|Shute]], at a time when central control over the provinces was weak. This feud forms part of the breakdown in law and order in England that led to the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nCourtenay was for a time engaged in overseas service during the [[Hundred Years' War]].{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} Increasingly, however, his efforts became directed towards strengthening his position at home. He had been married off as an infant to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]], placing Courtenay close to the English king's [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] kinsmen. Due to this connection, Courtenay started his career as an adherent to the English court's [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] party. Upon their demise in the late 1440s, he abandoned it in favour of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]]. When York sought the support of Courtenay's arch-enemy Bonville, Courtenay fell out of favour with him. When the Wars of the Roses broke out, he was in the party of the queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], and was one of the Lancastrian commanders at the [[First Battle of St Albans]], where he was wounded.\n\nCourtenay was said to have promoted a reconciliation between the Lancastrian and Yorkist parties, but he died suddenly in 1458. The Wars of the Roses later led to the deaths and executions of all three of Courtenay's sons, [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|Thomas]], Henry, and [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|John]], and to the eventual [[attainder]] of his titles and forfeiture of his lands. The Earldom was however revived in 1485 for his distant cousin, [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1485 creation)|Sir Edward Courtenay]], third in descent from his great-uncle.\n\n==Youth==\nCourtenay was born on 3 May 1414,{{sfn|Nathan|1957|p=[{{google books|vno-vmV2F5sC|pg=152|plainurl=yes}} 152]}} the only surviving son of [[Hugh de Courtenay, 4th Earl of Devon|Hugh Courtenay, 4th/12th Earl of Devon]] (1389 &ndash; 16 June 1422) and Anne Talbot{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} (c.1393\u20131441), sister of the renowned warrior [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]]. He succeeded as '''Earl of Devon''' in 1422, at the age of eight. He may at some time before have become a [[wardship|ward]] of the all-powerful [[Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=15}}\n\nAccording to Cokayne, Courtenay was knighted on 19 May 1426 by King [[Henry VI of England]],{{sfn|Cokayne|1916|p=326}} and on 16 December 1431, Courtenay was among an entourage of 300 who attended King Henry VI's second coronation{{sfn|Griffiths|1981}} at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=15}}\n\n===Majority===\nIt appears that no inquisition of proof of age, customary for a [[tenant in chief]], was taken for his father. Based on his family's history and standing and on his own position as the leading landowner of the county, probably expected to take his place as the leader of Devon society. However, his mother's longevity meant that her dower portion, including Tiverton Castle, and the other Courtenay estates which had been alienated under his father's will were not in his hands and the young Courtenay  was forced to live at Colcombe Castle, near [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], very close to his enemy [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]], at Shute.{{sfn|Cherry|1981}} His income of \u00a31500 p.a. was lower than that of most nobles of comparable rank.\n\n==Career==\n===Struggle with Bonville===\n{{main|Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud}}\n[[File:BonvilleArms.png|thumb|200px|Arms of Bonville: ''Sable, six mullets argent pierced gules''{{sfn|Burke|1884|p=99}}]]\nThe new earl found the political situation in Devonshire increasingly stacked against his own interests as a coalition of the greater [[gentry]], led by [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]], and the earl's cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay of [[Powderham]], threatened the Courtenays\u2019 traditional dominance of the county. The relationship was complicated by Bonville's second marriage in 1430 to Elizabeth Courtenay (d. 1471), Courtenay's aunt. Despite links via his wife, [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]], to the ascendant \"court party\" led by [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Beaufort]] and [[John Beaufort, 1st Marquess of Dorset|John Beaufort, 1st earl of Somerset and Marquess of Dorset]], and by [[Margaret Holland]], daughter of the [[Earl of Kent]], Courtenay failed to rectify his situation and instead resorted to violence, beginning in 1439. With the decline of Beaufort power, Courtenay became increasingly associated with [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]]. Courtenay had been attacking Bonville's estates in  the summer of 1439 and the king despatched a [[Privy Councillor]], Sir [[John Stourton, 1st Baron Stourton]], to extract a promise of good behavior from Courtenay, who was thereafter reluctant to attend the court in [[London]].{{sfn|PRO|1907|pp=314, 448}}<ref>The pirate-soldier, Sir Hugh Courtenay, a cousin looted [[merchant vessel]]s along the coast, and led [[brigand]]s with Thomas Carminow, after a long dispute with the Earl.</ref> In 1441, Courtenay was appointed as Steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], a nearly identical post to Royal Steward for Cornwall which had been granted to Sir William Bonville in 1437, for life.{{sfn|PRO|1907|pp=133, 532}} A week later in May 1441, the warrant was retracted. Disputes arose between the two which contemporary records portray as reaching the status of a [[private war]]. Two men wearing Courtenay livery attacked Sir Philip Chetwynd, a friend of Bonville, on the road to London, apparent evidence that the Council's arbitration of November 1440 had failed.<ref>The \"Arbitration\" was published on 1 April 1442.</ref>  Courtenay and Bonville were summoned before the King in December 1441, and were publicly reconciled.{{sfn|Nicolas|1835|pp=165\u201366, 173\u201375}} Tensions remained however and this may have been a factor in the crown's requests to both Courtenay, who initially refused, and Bonville to serve in France, Bonville as [[seneschal]] of [[Gascony]] from 1442\u201346 and Courtenay at [[Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque, Calvados|Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque]] in Normandy in 1446.{{sfn|Nicolas|1835|p=[{{google books|1Pw9AAAAcAAJ|pg=240|plainurl=yes}} 240]}} This is one of the few times that Courtenay served abroad, for he had refused in March 1443, seemingly preferring to spend his time bolstering his position in Devon or at court. While Bonville was abroad, the King released Devon from his debts, including the [[recognisance]] for good behaviour, probably remitted by the influence of father-in-law, John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset.{{sfnm|1a1=Nicolas|1y=1835|1p=408|2a1=Public Record Office|2y=1937|2p=396}}\n\n==Royal appointments==\n===Commissions===\nHis advantageous marriage to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Devon|Margaret Beaufort]] brought him links to the \"court party\", and Courtenay began to be selected by the king to serve on Westcountry commissions and was granted an annuity of \u00a3100 for his services.{{sfn|Nicolas|1837|p=315}}\n\n===Other===\n1445 marked a fleeting high point in Courtenay's fortunes, with his appointment as High Steward of England at Queen Margaret's coronation on 25 May.{{sfn|PRO|1908|p=355}} Only the year before, March 1444, Bonville had identified himself with Suffolk, at Margaret's betrothal in Rouen.\n\n==Abandonment of Beauforts==\nThe deaths of his brother-in-law [[John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset]], in 1444, and of the leader of the party [[Henry Beaufort|Cardinal Beaufort]], 2nd son of [[John of Gaunt]], in 1447, removed Beaufort leadership of the 'court' party, leaving [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], as the most influential figure in national politics.<ref>{{harvnb|Watts|1996}} and {{harvnb|Griffiths|1981}} for differing views on the relationship between Suffolk and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].</ref> While there is no evidence of direct antagonism between Courtenay and the Duke of Suffolk, the latter appeared to favour the Bonvilles. Sir William Bonville enjoyed links with Suffolk and  married his daughter to [[William Tailboys]], one of the Duke's closest associates. Perhaps the most dramatic illustration of this favour was Bonville's elevation to the peerage, presumably at the direction of Suffolk, as [[Baron Bonville]] of Chewton Mendip in 1449.{{sfn|PRO|1941|p=107}}\n\n==Switch to Yorkist party==\nThis promotion of his enemy Bonville may have prompted Devon to oppose the 'Court party' and to serve with his friend [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]] during [[Jack Cade's Rebellion]].  Courtenay switched allegiance to York, who with the [[John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] took control briefly of London. He remained loyal to York during the Parliament of November 1450, when they invoked the support of the [[Commons]] to raise taxation. Having rescued the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] from an angry London mob, York himself had to flee, taking refuge on the Earl of Devon's [[barge]] rowing down the [[Thames]].\nIt is hardly surprising that Devon began to become associated with York, who had assumed the leadership of the \"opposition\" party. The parlous state of national politics (whether the king was a vindictive factionalist or an inane non-entity is largely irrelevant in this context) combined with what seems like a reckless and violent element in Courtenay's own character, led to a further campaign of violence against Bonville and the Suffolk-aligned [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond and Earl of Wiltshire]]. Courtenay and his troops attempted to capture Butler near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in Wiltshire before returning to besiege Bonville in [[Taunton|Taunton Castle]]. The arrival of York (whether to suppress or aid the disturbances is uncertain) caused the two sides to make peace which, unsurprisingly, had no real meaning.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=281}} York then embarked on his abortive attempt to take control of royal government by force, his only allies being Courtenay and his sometime-associate, [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham]].\n\nIn the West Country Courtenay hounded Bonville without mercy, and pursued him to [[Taunton Castle]] and laid siege to it.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=84}} York arrived to lift the siege, and imprisoned Bonville, who was nevertheless quickly released. This exploit ended with the disgrace of all three 'Yorkists' and their submission to royal mercy in March. The King had issued an arrest warrant on 24 September 1451, drafted by Somerset, to be enforced by Butler and Bonville.  The Yorkist rebellions prompted royal commissions for Buckingham and Bonville on 14 February 1452. A direct summons without delay was ordered by [[Royal Proclamation]] on 17 February to bring Courtenay and Lord Cobham to London.<ref>Lord Cobham had been dispossessed by the Earl of Wiltshire, a creation of Henry VI.ibid, 98</ref>\n\n===Treason charge===\nCourtenay was charged with [[treason]] and briefly imprisoned in [[Wallingford Castle]],{{sfn|Harriss|1965|p=216}} before appearing on trial before the [[House of Lords]]. His [[wikt:disgrace|disgrace]] and political isolation allowed his Devonshire rivals to consolidate their positions, further undermining his decreased standing in the county.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=285\u201386}} Bonville acquired all [[royal commission]]s in the south-west.\n\n== Resurgence of York ==\nKing Henry VI's madness and York's appointment as Protector in 1453/4 resulted in a partial rally in Courtenay's fortunes, including his re-appointment to commissions of the peace in the south-western counties, the key barometer of the local balance of power.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=290}} He was a member of the Royal Council until April 1454.{{sfnm|1a1=Storey|1y=1999|1p=165|2a1=Nicolas|2y=1837|2pp=189\u2013193}} Courtenay was bound over to keep the peace with a fine of 1000 marks, but ignored its restrictions. Threatened by the Council on 3 June, he was forced on 24 July to make a new bond.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}}\n\n==Abandonment by York==\nThis was, however, the end of Courtenay's links with York, whose increasingly tight links with the Neville earls of [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Salisbury]] and [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] led to an alignment with Bonville away from Courtenay. This culminated in the marriage of [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington]], Bonville's grandson, to Salisbury's daughter, Katherine. Courtenay did not endear himself to Somerset either, as he and his sons repeatedly disrupted the sessions of the commissioners of the peace in Exeter during 1454/5, which did not assist Protector Somerset in promoting his role as the guardian of law and order. Courtenay was present at the [[First Battle of St Albans]], and was wounded.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} York however still considered him at least neutral as the Duke's letters addressed  to the King on the eve of battle were delivered to the king via the apparently still trusted hands of Courtenay.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=297}}\n\n==Final assault on Bonville==\nPerhaps inspired by the way the Nevilles and York had forcefully ended their respective feuds with the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Percies]] and the [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] in the battle, Courtenay returned to Devon and commenced a further campaign of violence against Bonville and his allies, who were now attached to Warwick's party. The violence began in October 1455 with the horrific murder by Courtenay allies of [[Nicholas Radford]], an eminent [[Westcountry]] lawyer,<ref>\"apprentice of the law\" Radford was a well-known local dignitary, an old man at the time; {{harvnb|PRO|1909|pp=269, 281}}</ref> Recorder of Exeter and one of Bonville's councilors. Several contemporary accounts, including the [[Paston Letters]], record this event with the ensuing mock-funeral and coronary inquest accompanied by the singing of highly inappropriate songs, in tones of shock and horror unusual during the blunted sensitivities of the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Gairdner|1897|p=351}} Among the murderers was [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]], the earl's son and later successor.{{sfn|Storey|1999|pp=168\u201370}} Parliament, meeting in November 1455, reported 800 horsemen and 4,000 infantry running amok across Devon. On 3 November 1455 Courtenay with his sons, Thomas Carrew of Ashwater and a considerable force of 1,000 men occupied the city of Exeter, nominally controlled by Bonville as castellan of the royal castle of Exeter, which they continued to control until 23 December 1455.<ref>{{Harvnb|Storey|1999|p=167}}; Estates of the Percy family, 89\u201396</ref> Courtenay had before warned the populace that Bonville was approaching with a 'great multitude' to sack the city. On 3 November 1455 Bonville's men setting out from  his seat at [[Old Shute House|Shute]] had looted the Earl's nearby house at [[Colcombe Castle]], [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]], and Bonville promised his support to the Earl's distant cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay of [[Powderham]]. Dozens of men violated consecrated ground and Radford's valuables were extracted from the cathedral and his house in Exeter was also robbed. Village-dwellers with Bonville connections were assaulted by Devon's men. [[Powderham Castle]], home to the earl's estranged cousin, Sir Philip Courtenay (d. 1463), an ally of Bonville, was besieged on 15 November 1455, the earl's weaponry now including a [[Cannon|serpentine]] cannon. Bonville attempted to relieve the castle but was repulsed as the Earl threatened to batter down its walls.{{sfn|Cherry|1981|p=311}} Finally battle was joined directly between Bonville and Courtenay at the [[Clyst Heath#Battle of Clyst Heath (1455)|Battle of Clyst Heath]], at Clyst Bridge, just south east of Exeter on 15 December 1455. While it seems that Bonville was put to flight, the number of dead or wounded is entirely unknown. Two days later Thomas Carrew with 500 of Courtenay's retainers pillaged Shute, seizing a bounty of looted goods. Courtenay and his men left Exeter on 21 December 1455 and shortly afterwards submitted to York at [[Shaftesbury]] in Dorset. Early in December 1455 the King had dismissed Devon from the Commission of Peace, and citizens of Exeter had been instructed not to help his army of \"misrule\" in any way.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=173}}\n\n== Aftermath of Clyst Heath ==\nDevon was [[incarcerate]]d in the Tower. Originally, the government planned to bring him to trial for treason but this was abandoned once the King Henry VI returned to  sanity in February 1456, and York was removed as Protector. Courtenay was also returned to the commission of the peace for Devonshire, seemingly the work of [[Margaret of Anjou|Queen Margaret of Anjou]] who had taken personal control of the court. Courtenay had cultivated links with Queen Margaret, and an alliance was sealed by the marriage of his son and heir, [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|Sir Thomas Courtenay]], to the Queen's kinswoman, Marie, the daughter of [[Charles, Count of Maine]]. Despite having been banned from entering and leading armed men into Exeter and holding assemblies, 500 men under John Courtenay entered the [[High Street]] on 8 April 1456.  His rivals, Philip Courtenay and Lord Fitzwarin, were prevented from exercising commissions as [[Justice of the peace|Justices of the Peace]], and were forced to leave the city. Butler, Bonville's patron, and Sir [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], [[Chief Justice]], arrived with a large entourage to investigate under a commission of [[oyer et terminer]]. They rejected Courtenay's  petition to have Bonville's [[sheriff|sheriffdom of Devon]] removed.<ref>Rotuli, op cit., 332</ref>  Two years later his sons, Thomas and Henry Courtenay, were absolved of the murder of Nicholas Radford.{{sfn|PRO|1910|pp=308, 393, 398}}\n\nCourtenay was restored to the bench of JPs and was made Keeper of the Park of Clarendon in February 1457,<ref>History of Commons, 1422\u20131508, vol.

It is situated in the town of [[Colmar-Berg]], in central [[Luxembourg]], near the confluence of the [[Alzette]] and the [[Attert River|Attert]], two of Luxembourg's most important rivers.\n\n==History==\nThe estate at Colmar-Berg first came into the possession of the Grand Dukes of Luxembourg in 1845.  The [[Belgian Revolution]] had divided Luxembourg from the [[Netherlands]], and also into two, undermining Dutch control of the fortress of [[Luxembourg City]].  [[William II of the Netherlands|Grand Duke William II]] sought to establish a suitable Grand Ducal residence in Luxembourg, hoping that a division of his time between [[The Hague]] and Luxembourg would placate the local, overwhelmingly [[Roman Catholic]], population.  To this end, the Grand Duke bought Berg Castle from the Pasquier estate. In 1848, it was recognised as the exclusive home of the Grand Duke by the newly promulgated constitution.\n\nIn 1890, the Royal house of the Netherlands and the Grand Ducal house of Luxembourg diverged, and the new Grand Duke, [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]], purchased Berg Castle the following year, in order to maintain the Grand Ducal estate at Colmar-Berg. In 1906, [[Guillaume IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|William IV]] had the old castle demolished and a new one constructed in its place, designed by the [[Munich]]-based architect [[Max Ostenrieder]] and the local [[:lb:Pierre Funck (Architekt)|Pierre Funck-Eydt]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Ch\u00e2teau de Berg - Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg - R\u00e9sidences|url = http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/monarchie/residences/chateau-berg/index.html|website = www.monarchie.lu|accessdate = 22 December 2015|language = French}}</ref> Work on the new castle began in 1907, and was completed on the 9th of september 1911, after which it became the primary residence of the Grand Ducal family.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the Grand Ducal family fell upon hard times. [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Charlotte]] sought an agreement with the government of Luxembourg under which the Grand Duchy might divest personal properties to the government, which would then allow the Grand Ducal family to use them as official residences.
