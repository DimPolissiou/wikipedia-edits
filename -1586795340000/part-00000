It is the seventh consecutive season of play in the Scottish Premier League in which Hearts have competed since its inauguration in [[1998\u201399 Scottish Premier League|1998\u201399]]. Hearts also competed in the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Cup|Uefa Cup]], [[2004\u201305 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup]], [[2004\u201305 Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] and the [[Festival Cup]].\n\n==Managers==\n\nOver the course of the season Hearts had 4 Management teams. They started the season under [[Craig Levein]] who left the club on 29 October to join [[Leicester City]]. His assistant [[Peter Houston]] took charge as care taker manager for 1 game before [[John Robertson (footballer born 1964)|John Robertson]] took on the role for 7 months before a fall out with [[Vladimir Romanov|Romanov]] who dismissed him after he refused to accept a demotion to assistant head coach created a vacancy once again. [[Steven Pressley]] and [[John McGlynn (Scottish footballer)|John McGlynn]] jointly took the role of care taker managers for the final two games of the season.\n\n==Stadium==\n\nHearts used two stadiums over the course of the season [[Tynecastle Stadium]] for domestic fixtures and [[Murrayfield Stadium]] for international fixtures. This was due to Tynecastle not meeting Uefa requirements for holding international fixtures.\n==First-team squad==\n:''Squad at end of

Lifetime images of Party members on stamps were used to emphasize the theme of state power. One of such examples was a 1935 set of stamps commemorating [[Mikhail Kalinin]]'s 60th birthday and depicting him as a worker, a farmer, and an orator. These Kalinin stamps illustrated the motive powers of the [[Soviet state]]: the worker, the farmer, and the Communist Party. Such a practice is considered a worldwide trend when in-power politicians are shown on postage stamps symbolizing the state.<ref name=Grant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skandinav.eu/page41.htm|title=Stamps of the USSR (1923\u20131991): 1935.

Earlier stamp themes in the 1920s reflected, though indirectly, the spirit of [[New Economic Policy]]. Since 1929, stamps had been used for a clear declaration of the changed economic policies. When [[Joseph Stalin]] initiated [[industrialisation]], a special set of stamps was issued to support this effort. For example, the 10-kopecks stamp showed a series of tractors, saying \"Let us increase the harvest by 35%\". An inscription on the 20-kopecks stamp called for \"More metal, more machines!\". The 28-kopecks stamp pictured a blast furnace, a chart for iron-ore production and the slogan \"Iron, 8 million tons\".<ref name=Grant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skandinav.eu/page35.htm|title=Stamps of the USSR (1923\u20131991): 1929.

Party platforms with rather lengthy excerpts from Party documents and congresses' resolutions appeared on stamps at that time. Such was, for instance, the series of \"Decisions of the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]\u2014into Life\" that was designed by V. Zavyalov and A. Shmidshtein, and issued in 1962.<ref name=Grant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skandinav.eu/page68.htm|title=Stamps of the USSR (1923\u20131991): 1962. November \u2013 December.

They were no longer brief imperative commands but rather promises and explanations by the Party to Soviet society. For example, on a 1971 [[souvenir sheet]] from the [[24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|24th Party Congress]] series designed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Yuri Levinovsky|WD=Q4256524|lt=Yu. Levinovsky}} and A. Shmidshtein, there was an inscription saying that \"the main problem is to provide a significant increase of the material and cultural level of life of the people on the basis of high rates of development of socialist production, an increase of its effectiveness, scientific-technical progress, and an acceleration of the growth of the productiveness of labor\".<ref name=Grant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skandinav.eu/page77.htm|title=Stamps of the USSR (1923\u20131991): 1971.

One of such examples was a 1935 set of stamps commemorating [[Mikhail Kalinin]]'s 60th birthday and depicting him as a worker, a farmer, and an orator.

Earlier stamp themes in the 1920s reflected, though indirectly, the spirit of [[New Economic Policy]]. Since 1929, stamps had been used for a clear declaration of the changed economic policies. When [[Joseph Stalin]] initiated [[industrialisation]], a special set of stamps was issued to support this effort. For example, the 10-kopecks stamp showed a series of tractors, saying \"Let us increase the harvest by 35%\". An inscription on the 20-kopecks stamp called for \"More metal, more machines!\". The 28-kopecks stamp pictured a blast furnace, a chart for iron-ore production and the slogan \"Iron, 8 million tons\".<ref name=Grant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skandinav.eu/page35.htm|title=Stamps of the USSR (1923\u20131991): 1929.

Party platforms with rather lengthy excerpts from Party documents and congresses' resolutions appeared on stamps at that time. Such was, for instance, the series of \"Decisions of the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]\u2014into Life\" that was designed by V. Zavyalov and A.

They were no longer brief imperative commands but rather promises and explanations by the Party to Soviet society. For example, on a 1971 [[souvenir sheet]] from the [[24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|24th Party Congress]] series designed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Yuri Levinovsky|WD=Q4256524|lt=Yu.

{"title_page": "Scots property law", "text_new": "'''Scots property law''' governs the rules relating to [[property]] found in the legal jurisdiction of [[Scotland]]. As a hybrid legal system with both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] heritage, Scots property law is similar, but not identical, to property law in [[South African property law|South Africa]] and the American state of [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].    \n\nThe term 'property' is wide-ranging but in this article, as in Scots law and many other jurisdictions, it does not solely describe land. Instead, in Scots law, the term 'a person's property' is used when describing objects or 'things' (in Latin: ''rem'') that an individual holds a right of ownership in. It is the rights that an individual holds in a 'thing' that are the subject matter of Scots property law.    \n\nThe terms objects or 'things' is also a wide ranging definition, and is based on Roman law principles.  Objects (or things) can be physical (such as land, a house, a car, a statue or a keyring) or they can also be unseen but still capable of being owned, (eg: a person can have a right to payment under a contract, a person can have a lease in a house, or they may have intellectual property rights in relation to works they have produced). <ref>Badenhorst, PJ, Juanita M. Pienaar, and Hanri Mostert. ''Silberberg and Schoeman's The Law of Property''. 5th Edition. Durban: LexisNexis/Butterworths, 2006, p. 9.</ref> While this may appear to encompass a wide range of 'things', they can be classified and sorted according to a legal system's rules. In Scots property law, all 'things' can be classified according to their nature, discussed below, with each class of property having rules concerning the rights an individual may have in that property.    \n\n== Legal Sources of Scots Property Law ==\nPrior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] unification as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]]. Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century so the legal system developed a distinct property law. In the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]]. The jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|1801]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999, so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, latterly Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\nIndividuals (both human and [[Legal person|juristic]]) have a patrimony, also known as 'estate', containing all the individual's rights (ie: their legal entitlements) with an economic value (termed ''patrimonial rights'') and all their liabilities.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref>   This definition is wide ranging so will encompass all the rights, such as the right of ownership or contractual rights, an individual may have. Most individuals will only have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession''2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5.</ref> Patrimonial rights that a person holds in a 'thing' or object are the focus of property law and Scots law distinguishes these 'rights in a 'thing<nowiki>''</nowiki> (in Latin: ''a jus in rem (Lit: a right in a thing)'') from any other rights that an individual may hold.\n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nScots law follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref>\n\n=== Identifying Personal or Real Rights ===\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of an individual committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care). With personal rights, the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') can bring to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> <blockquote>Example 1: A contracts with B to purchase a piece of land. B backs out of the deal but A still wants to buy the land. A has a contractual (personal) right to sue B because they had entered into a contract. A does not have a real right in the thing because no real right had been [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|transferred to him validly]].  A sues B in the Sheriff Court for breach of contract under her personal right.  \n\nExample 2: D is hit by E's car while riding his bike, committing a delict by breaching his duty of care to other road users. D now has a right in delict (a personal right) for E to pay D's damages for his injuries.  D sues E in the Court of Session.  \n\nExample 3: F owns (a real right) a bike. G steals F's bike. F sees G with the bike and wants it back. F, as well as remedies available in criminal law, can raise an action in the courts against G for G's interference with F's right of ownership.  </blockquote>Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>See Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref> However, any real right an individual may have in property must be <u>recognised and valid</u> in Scots law in order to be a true real right. \n\n=== The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in an Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|ownership]] and subordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref>''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession (property law)|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Corporeal heritable property in Scots law|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Incorporeal heritable property in Scots law|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Corporeal moveable property in Scots law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Other Legal Rules Relating to Property in Scotland ==\n\n===Feudal law===\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation of the Feudal System ====\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: The King/Queen). The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</ref> Over time the most common form of feudal grants became the ''feufarm'' which carried with an obligation pay a ''feuduty''.<ref>I.

T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Alternatively, a vassal could substitute their place in the feudal chain with another individual by a disposition.<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503''.''</ref> \n\nThe feudal system was starkly different from the Civilian law \"bedrock\"<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503. </ref> that Scots law had operated on before its introduction. The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''dominium directum''). This interest gave the granter the right to enforce conditions over the property. The grantee had the right to possess the property (or ''dominium utile''), providing that they did not breach any of the conditions set by the granter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/58690451/Historic+Deed+Types|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>One of the most important conditions in property law that a superior could make was the use of [[Real burdens in scots law|real burdens]], restrictions which were placed on the use of the land. These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Condition (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n==== Feudal Reform and Abolition ====\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. By the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of ''dominium utile'' owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (''dominium directum'') in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].'' However, ''a''round 10% of landowners in Scotland still had to make ''feu duty'' payments by 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> This enabled feudal superiors such as the [[Church of Scotland]], who historically were feudal superiors of large tracts of land, to receive ''feu duty'' revenue amounting to \u00a330,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=2004-11-28|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> With feudalism deemed \"outdated and archaic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> by the new [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]], a major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) was passed by the newly-sitting [[Scottish Parliament]] which eliminated the feudal system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Section 1 of the 2000 Act is unequivocal:<blockquote>\"The feudal system of land tenure, that is to say the entire system whereby land is held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior is, on the appointed day, abolished.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/1/data.htm|title=Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The 2000 Act provided that ''dominium utile'' ownership would convert into full ownership on the appointed day,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(1).</ref> and that any other feudal estate (such as superiorities or ''dominium directum)'' in Scotland would cease to exist.<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(2)</ref> The appointed day was 28 November 2004,<ref>Scottish Government, ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 guidance,'' https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17975/Abolition</ref> and on this date feudalism in Scotland ended. \n\n===Shetland and Orkney Islands: Udal Law===\nThe [[Northern Isles]] became part of Scotland as a result of two [[Pledge in Scots law|pledge]]<nowiki/>s for outstanding payments made by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to [[James III of Scotland]] under an agreement for the marriage of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], Christian I's daughter to James III in 1468 ([[Orkney|the Orkney Isles]]) and 1469 (the [[Shetland]] Isles).<ref>B.Crawford, 'The Pawning of Orkney and Shetland' (1969) ''Scottish Historical Review'' 35\u201353, Appendix.<br /></ref> The [[Registers of Scotland]] ''2012'' ''Registration Manual'' describes the current situation:<blockquote>\"Although the islands are now part of Scotland, udal law has never been formally abolished in Orkney and Shetland.

As a hybrid legal system with both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] heritage, Scots property law is similar, but not identical, to property law in [[South African property law|South Africa]] and the American state of [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].    \n\nThe term 'property' is wide-ranging but in this article, as in Scots law and many other jurisdictions, it does not solely describe land. Instead, in Scots law, the term 'a person's property' is used when describing objects or 'things' (in Latin: ''rem'') that an individual holds a right of ownership in. It is the rights that an individual holds in a 'thing' that are the subject matter of Scots property law.    \n\nThe terms objects or 'things' is also a wide ranging definition, and is based on Roman law principles.  Objects (or things) can be physical (such as land, a house, a car, a statue or a keyring) or they can also be unseen but still capable of being owned, (eg: a person can have a right to payment under a contract, a person can have a lease in a house, or they may have intellectual property rights in relation to works they have produced). <ref>Badenhorst, PJ, Juanita M. Pienaar, and Hanri Mostert. ''Silberberg and Schoeman's The Law of Property''. 5th Edition. Durban: LexisNexis/Butterworths, 2006, p. 9.</ref> While this may appear to encompass a wide range of 'things', they can be classified and sorted according to a legal system's rules. In Scots property law, all 'things' can be classified according to their nature, discussed below, with each class of property having rules concerning the rights an individual may have in that property.    \n\n== Legal Sources of Scots Property Law ==\nPrior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] unification as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]]. Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century so the legal system developed a distinct property law. In the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]] and the jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|1801]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999, so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, latterly Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\nIndividuals (both human and [[Legal person|juristic]]) have a patrimony, also known as 'estate', containing all the individual's rights (ie: their legal entitlements) with an economic value (termed ''patrimonial rights'') and all their liabilities.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref>   This definition is wide ranging so will encompass all the rights, such as the right of ownership or contractual rights, an individual may have. Most individuals will only have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession''2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5.</ref> Patrimonial rights that a person holds in a 'thing' or object are the focus of property law and Scots law distinguishes these 'rights in a 'thing<nowiki>''</nowiki> (in Latin: ''a jus in rem (Lit: a right in a thing)'') from any other rights that an individual may hold.\n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nScots law follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref>\n\n=== Identifying Personal or Real Rights ===\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of an individual committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care). With personal rights, the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') can bring to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> <blockquote>Example 1: A contracts with B to purchase a piece of land. B backs out of the deal but A still wants to buy the land. A has a contractual (personal) right to sue B because they had entered into a contract. A does not have a real right in the thing because no real right had been [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|transferred to him validly]].  A sues B in the Sheriff Court for breach of contract under her personal right.  \n\nExample 2: D is hit by E's car, committing a delict by breaching his duty of care to others. D now has a right in delict (a personal right) for E to pay D's damages for his injuries.  D sues E in the Court of Session.  \n\nExample 3: F owns (a real right) a bike. G steals F's bike. F sees G with the bike and wants it back. F, as well as remedies available in criminal law, G can raise an action in the courts for interfering with F's right of ownership.  </blockquote>Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>See Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref> However, any real right an individual may have in property must be <u>recognised and valid</u> in Scots law in order to be a true real right. \n\n=== The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in an Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|ownership]] and subordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref>''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, <nowiki>http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</nowiki></ref> The Crown vassals, could then divide up their land and make further grants of land, such as by ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation. T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Alternatively, a vassal could substitute their place in the feudal chain with another individual by a disposition.<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503''.''</ref> \n\nThe feudal system was starkly different from the Civilian law \"bedrock\"<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503. </ref> that Scots law had operated on before its introduction. The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''dominium directum''). This interest gave the granter the right to enforce conditions over the property. The grantee had the right to possess the property (or ''dominium utile''), providing that they did not breach any of the conditions set by the granter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/58690451/Historic+Deed+Types|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>One of the most important conditions in property law that a superior could make was the use of [[Real burdens in scots law|real burdens]], restrictions which were placed on the use of the land. These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Condition (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n==== Feudal Reform and Abolition ====\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. By the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of ''dominium utile'' owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (''dominium directum'') in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].'' However, ''a''round 10% of landowners in Scotland still had to make ''feu duty'' payments by 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> This enabled feudal superiors such as the [[Church of Scotland]], who historically were feudal superiors of large tracts of land, to receive ''feu duty'' revenue amounting to \u00a330,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=2004-11-28|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> With feudalism deemed \"outdated and archaic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> by the new [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]], a major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) was passed by the newly-sitting [[Scottish Parliament]] which eliminated the feudal system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Section 1 of the 2000 Act is unequivocal:<blockquote>\"The feudal system of land tenure, that is to say the entire system whereby land is held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior is, on the appointed day, abolished.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/1/data.htm|title=Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The 2000 Act provided that ''dominium utile'' ownership would convert into full ownership on the appointed day,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(1).</ref> and that any other feudal estate (such as superiorities or ''dominium directum)'' in Scotland would cease to exist.<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(2)</ref> The appointed day was 28 November 2004,<ref>Scottish Government, ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 guidance,'' https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17975/Abolition</ref> and on this date feudalism in Scotland ended. \n\n===Shetland and Orkney Islands: Udal Law===\nThe [[Northern Isles]] became part of Scotland as a result of two [[Pledge in Scots law|pledge]]<nowiki/>s for outstanding payments made by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to [[James III of Scotland]] under an agreement for the marriage of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], Christian I's daughter to James III in 1468 ([[Orkney|the Orkney Isles]]) and 1469 (the [[Shetland]] Isles).<ref>B.Crawford, 'The Pawning of Orkney and Shetland' (1969) ''Scottish Historical Review'' 35\u201353, Appendix.<br /></ref> The [[Registers of Scotland]] ''2012'' ''Registration Manual'' describes the current situation:<blockquote>\"Although the islands are now part of Scotland, udal law has never been formally abolished in Orkney and Shetland.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

{"title_page": "Sodium-ion battery", "text_new": "The '''sodium-ion battery''' ('''NIB''') is a type of [[rechargeable battery]] analogous to the [[lithium-ion battery]] but using [[sodium]] [[ion]]s (Na<sup>+</sup>) as the [[Electric charge|charge]] carriers. Its [[Lithium-ion battery#Electrochemistry|working principle]] and [[Lithium-ion battery#Construction|cell construction]] are identical with that of the commercially widespread lithium-ion battery with the only difference being that the lithium compounds are swapped with sodium compounds: in essence, it consists of a cathode based on a sodium containing material, an anode (not necessarily a sodium-based material) and a liquid electrolyte containing dissociated sodium salts in [[Chemical polarity|polar]] [[Protic solvent|protic]] or aprotic [[solvent]]s. During charging, Na<sup>+</sup> are extracted from the cathode and inserted into the anode while the electrons travel through the external circuit; during discharging, the reverse process occurs where the Na<sup>+</sup> are extracted from the anode and re-inserted in the cathode with the electrons travelling through the external circuit doing useful work. Ideally, the anode and cathode materials should be able to withstand repeated cycles of sodium storage without degradation.\n\n== Research progress ==\nDevelopment of the sodium-ion battery took place side-by-side with that of the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s and early 1980s, however, its development was superseded by that of the lithium-ion battery in 1990s and 2000s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Yang-Kook|last2=Myung|first2=Seung-Taek|last3=Hwang|first3=Jang-Yeon|date=2017-06-19|title=Sodium-ion batteries: present and future|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|volume=46|issue=12|pages=3529\u20133614|doi=10.1039/C6CS00776G|pmid=28349134|issn=1460-4744|doi-access=free}}</ref><sup>[</sup><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yabuuchi|first=Naoaki|last2=Kubota|first2=Kei|last3=Dahbi|first3=Mouad|last4=Komaba|first4=Shinichi|date=2014-12-10|title=Research Development on Sodium-Ion Batteries|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=114|issue=23|pages=11636\u201311682|doi=10.1021/cr500192f|pmid=25390643|issn=0009-2665}}</ref> From 2011, research interest in sodium-ion batteries has been revived. The major advancements made in the field have been outlined below.\n\n'''Anodes:''' The dominant anode used in commercial lithium-ion batteries, [[graphite]], cannot be used in sodium-ion batteries as it cannot store the larger sodium ion in appreciable quantities. Instead, a disordered carbon material consisting of a non-graphitizable, non-crystalline and amorphous carbon structure (called \u2018hard carbon\u2019) is the current preferred sodium-ion anode of choice. Hard carbon's sodium storage was discovered by Stevens and Dahn in 2000.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dahn|first=J. R.|last2=Stevens|first2=D.

Such a storage performance is similar to that seen for lithium storage in graphite anode for lithium-ion batteries where capacities of 300 \u2013 360 mAh/g are typical.

Similar to all lithium-ion cathodes, sodium-ion cathodes also store sodium via [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] reaction mechanism. Owing to their high [[Bulk density|tap density]], high operating potentials and high capacities, cathodes based on sodium transition metal oxides have received the greatest attention. Furthermore, from a desire to keep costs low, significant research has been geared towards avoiding or reducing costly elements such as [[Cobalt|Co]], [[Chromium|Cr]], [[Nickel|Ni]] or [[Vanadium|V]] in the oxides.

Aqueous electrolytes, owing to the limited [[Electrochemical window|electrochemical stability window]] of water, result in sodium-ion batteries of lower voltages and hence, limited energy densities. To extend the voltage range of sodium-ion batteries, the same non-aqueous [[carbonate ester]] polar aprotic solvents used in lithium-ion electrolytes, such as [[ethylene carbonate]], [[dimethyl carbonate]], [[diethyl carbonate]], [[propylene carbonate]] etc. can be used.

This is because of growing concerns about the availability of lithium resources and hence, about their future costs. Apart from being the sixth most [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|abundant element in the Earth's crust]], sodium can be extracted from seawater indicating that its resources are effectively infinite. Due to these facts, the consensus is that sodium-ion batteries\u2019 costs would perpetually be low if the cathode and anode are also based on earth-abundant elements. Furthermore, sodium-ion batteries allow for usage of [[aluminium]] current collectors for the cathode as well as anode. In lithium-ion batteries, the anode current collector has to be the heavier and more costly [[copper]] as Al alloys with lithium at low potentials (sodium does not form an alloy with Al).\n\nAnother advantage is that sodium-ion batteries utilise the same manufacturing protocols and methodology as that required for commercial lithium-ion batteries owing to their similar working principles. Hence, sodium-ion batteries can be a drop-in replacement for lithium-ion batteries not only in terms of application but also during the production process. This fact indicates no additional capital costs are required for existing lithium-ion battery manufacturers to switch to sodium-ion technology.\n\n'''Energy Density:''' It was assumed traditionally that NIBs would never display the same levels of energy densities as those delivered by LIBs. This rationale was assumed by taking into account the higher [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] of sodium ''vs'' lithium (23 ''vs'' 6.9 g/mol) and a higher [[Standard electrode potential (data page)|standard electrode reduction potential]] of the Na/Na<sup>+</sup> redox couple relative to the Li/Li<sup>+</sup> redox couple (-2.71 V ''vs'' S.H.E. and -3.02 V ''vs'' S.H.E. respectively). Such a rationale is applicable only to metal batteries where the anode would be the concerned metal (sodium or lithium metal). In metal-ion batteries, the anode is any suitable host material other than the metal itself. Hence, strictly speaking, the energy density of metal-ion batteries is dictated by the individual capacities of the cathode and anode host materials as well as the difference in their working potentials (the higher the difference in working potentials, the higher the output voltage of the metal-ion battery). Considering this, there is no reason to assume that NIBs would be inferior to LIBs in terms of energy densities \u2013 recent research developments have already indicated several potential cathodes and anodes with performance similar or better than lithium-ion cathodes or anodes. Furthermore, the use of lighter Al current collector for anode helps enhancing the energy density of sodium-ion batteries.\n\nWith reference to rechargeable lead-acid batteries, the energy density of NIBs can be anywhere from 1 \u2013 5 times the value, depending on the chemistry used for the sodium-ion battery.\n\n'''Safety:''' Lead-acid batteries themselves are quite safe in operation, but the use of corrosive acid-based electrolytes hampers their safety. Lithium-ion batteries are quite stable if cycled with care but are susceptible to catching [[Lithium-ion battery#Safety|fire and exploding]] if overcharged thus necessitating strict controls on [[battery management system]]s. Another safety issue with lithium-ion batteries is that transportation cannot occur at fully discharged state \u2013 such batteries are required to be transported at least at 30% [[state of charge]]. In general, metal-ion batteries tend to be at their most unsafe state at the fully charged state, hence, the requirement for lithium-ion batteries to be transported at a partially charged state is not only cumbersome and more unsafe but also imposes additional costs. Such requirement for lithium-ion battery transport is on account of the dissolution concerns of Cu current collector if the lithium-ion battery's voltage drops too low.<ref name=\":1\" /> Sodium-ion batteries, using Al current collector on the anode, suffers no such issue upon being fully discharged to 0 V \u2013 in fact, it has been demonstrated that keeping sodium-ion batteries at a shorted state (0 V) for prolonged periods does not hamper its cycle life at all.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">Barker, J.; Wright, C.

Hence, electrolytes with a higher percentage of propylene carbonate can be formulated for sodium-ion batteries as opposed to highly [[Flammable liquid|flammable]] [[diethyl carbonate]] or [[dimethyl carbonate]] (preferred for lithium-ion electrolytes) which would result in significantly enhanced safety for NIBs.\n\n== Commercialisation==\nAt present, there are a few companies around the world developing commercial sodium-ion batteries for various different applications.

Altris AB is a spin-off company coming from the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m Advanced Battery Centre lead by Prof. Kristina Edstr\u00f6m at Uppsala University. EIT InnoEnergy has invested in the company from its inception. The company is selling Fennac\u00ae, an iron based Prussian blue analogue for the positive electrode in non-aqueous sodium ion batteries. Batteries containing Fennac\u00ae utilise hard carbon as the anode.\n\n==Applications==\nWhile the sodium-ion battery technology is very versatile and can essentially be tailored to suit any application, it is widely believed that the first usage of sodium-ion batteries would be for all applications which are currently being served by lead-acid batteries. For such lower energy density applications, sodium-ion batteries would essentially be delivering much higher energy densities than current lead-acid batteries (1 \u2013 5 times higher) at similar costs with enhanced performance (efficiency, safety, faster charging/discharging capabilities and cycling stabilities). These applications could be for smart grids, [[Grid energy storage|grid-storage]] for [[Renewable energy|renewable]] power plants, the car [[Automotive battery|SLI]] battery, [[Uninterruptible power supply|UPS]], telecoms, [[Home energy storage|home storage]] and for any other stationary energy storage applications.\n\nThe higher energy density sodium-ion batteries (typically those using non-aqueous electrolytes) would be well suited for those applications currently dominated by lithium-ion batteries. Among the lower energy density spectrum of such high energy density batteries, applications such as [[power tool]]s, [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], low speed [[electric vehicle]]s, e-bikes, e-scooters and e-buses would benefit from the lower costs of sodium-ion batteries with respect to those of lithium-ion batteries at similar performance levels (safety being in favour of sodium-ion batteries).\u00a0\n\nIt is expected that with the current rate of rapid progress in the field of sodium-ion batteries, such batteries would be eventually used in applications requiring very high energy density batteries (such as long-range electric vehicles and consumer electronics such as mobile phones and laptops) which are currently served by high cost and high energy density lithium-ion batteries.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of battery types]]\n* Alkali metal-ion battery\n** [[Lithium-ion battery]]\n** Sodium-ion battery\n** [[Potassium-ion battery]]\n*[[Rechargeable battery]]\n*[[Salt water battery]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Galvanic cells}}\n\n[[Category:Metal-ion batteries]]\n[[Category:Battery types]]\n", "text_old": "The '''sodium-ion battery''' ('''NIB''') is a type of [[rechargeable battery]] analogous to the [[lithium-ion battery]] but using [[sodium]] [[ion]]s (Na<sup>+</sup>) as the [[Electric charge|charge]] carriers. Its [[Lithium-ion battery#Electrochemistry|working principle]] and [[Lithium-ion battery#Construction|cell construction]] are identical with that of the commercially widespread lithium-ion battery with the only difference being that the lithium compounds are swapped with sodium compounds: in essence, it consists of a cathode based on a sodium containing material, an anode (not necessarily a sodium-based material) and a liquid electrolyte containing dissociated sodium salts in [[Chemical polarity|polar]] [[Protic solvent|protic]] or aprotic [[solvent]]s. During charging, Na<sup>+</sup> are extracted from the cathode and inserted into the anode while the electrons travel through the external circuit; during discharging, the reverse process occurs where the Na<sup>+</sup> are extracted from the anode and re-inserted in the cathode with the electrons travelling through the external circuit doing useful work. Ideally, the anode and cathode materials should be able to withstand repeated cycles of sodium storage without degradation.\n\n== Research progress ==\nDevelopment of the sodium-ion battery took place side-by-side with that of the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s and early 1980s, however, its development was superseded by that of the lithium-ion battery in 1990s and 2000s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Yang-Kook|last2=Myung|first2=Seung-Taek|last3=Hwang|first3=Jang-Yeon|date=2017-06-19|title=Sodium-ion batteries: present and future|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|volume=46|issue=12|pages=3529\u20133614|doi=10.1039/C6CS00776G|pmid=28349134|issn=1460-4744|doi-access=free}}</ref><sup>[</sup><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yabuuchi|first=Naoaki|last2=Kubota|first2=Kei|last3=Dahbi|first3=Mouad|last4=Komaba|first4=Shinichi|date=2014-12-10|title=Research Development on Sodium-Ion Batteries|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=114|issue=23|pages=11636\u201311682|doi=10.1021/cr500192f|pmid=25390643|issn=0009-2665}}</ref> From 2011, research interest in sodium-ion batteries has been revived.

Instead, a disordered carbon material consisting of a non-graphitizable, non-crystalline and amorphous carbon structure (called \u2018hard carbon\u2019) is the current preferred sodium-ion anode of choice.

Such a storage performance is similar to that seen for lithium storage in graphite anode for lithium-ion batteries where capacities of 300 \u2013 360 mAh/g are typical.

Similar to all lithium-ion cathodes, sodium-ion cathodes also store sodium via [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] reaction mechanism. Owing to their high [[Bulk density|tap density]], high operating potentials and high capacities, cathodes based on sodium transition metal oxides have received the greatest attention.

Aqueous electrolytes, owing to the limited [[Electrochemical window|electrochemical stability window]] of water, result in sodium-ion batteries of lower voltages and hence, limited energy densities. To extend the voltage range of sodium-ion batteries, the same non-aqueous [[carbonate ester]] polar aprotic solvents used in lithium-ion electrolytes, such as [[ethylene carbonate]], [[dimethyl carbonate]], [[diethyl carbonate]], [[propylene carbonate]] etc. can be used. The current most widely used non-aqueous electrolyte utilises [[Sodium hexafluorophosphate|sodium hexafluorophate]] as the salt dissolved in a mixture of the aforementioned solvents. Additionally, electrolyte additives can be used which can beneficially affect a host of performance metrics of the battery.\n\n== Advantages ==\n\nSodium-ion batteries have several advantages over competing battery technologies. The table below compares how NIBs in general fare against the two established rechargeable battery technology in the market currently: the lithium-ion battery and the rechargeable [[Lead\u2013acid battery|lead-acid battery]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Zhenguo|last2=Zhang|first2=Jianlu|last3=Kintner-Meyer|first3=Michael C.

This is because of growing concerns about the availability of lithium resources and hence, about their future costs. Apart from being the sixth most [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|abundant element in the Earth's crust]], sodium can be extracted from seawater indicating that its resources are effectively infinite. Due to these facts, the consensus is that sodium-ion batteries\u2019 costs would perpetually be low if the cathode and anode are also based on earth-abundant elements. Furthermore, sodium-ion batteries allow for usage of [[aluminium]] current collectors for the cathode as well as anode. In lithium-ion batteries, the anode current collector has to be the heavier and more costly [[copper]] as Al alloys with lithium at low potentials (sodium does not form an alloy with Al).\n\nAnother advantage is that sodium-ion batteries utilise the same manufacturing protocols and methodology as that required for commercial lithium-ion batteries owing to their similar working principles. Hence, sodium-ion batteries can be a drop-in replacement for lithium-ion batteries not only in terms of application but also during the production process. This fact indicates no additional capital costs are required for existing lithium-ion battery manufacturers to switch to sodium-ion technology.\n\n'''Energy Density:''' It was assumed traditionally that NIBs would never display the same levels of energy densities as those delivered by LIBs. This rationale was assumed by taking into account the higher [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] of sodium ''vs'' lithium (23 ''vs'' 6.9 g/mol) and a higher [[Standard electrode potential (data page)|standard electrode reduction potential]] of the Na/Na<sup>+</sup> redox couple relative to the Li/Li<sup>+</sup> redox couple (-2.71 V ''vs'' S.H.E. and -3.02 V ''vs'' S.H.E. respectively). Such a rationale is applicable only to metal batteries where the anode would be the concerned metal (sodium or lithium metal). In metal-ion batteries, the anode is any suitable host material other than the metal itself. Hence, strictly speaking, the energy density of metal-ion batteries is dictated by the individual capacities of the cathode and anode host materials as well as the difference in their working potentials (the higher the difference in working potentials, the higher the output voltage of the metal-ion battery). Considering this, there is no reason to assume that NIBs would be inferior to LIBs in terms of energy densities \u2013 recent research developments have already indicated several potential cathodes and anodes with performance similar or better than lithium-ion cathodes or anodes. Furthermore, the use of lighter Al current collector for anode helps enhancing the energy density of sodium-ion batteries.\n\nWith reference to rechargeable lead-acid batteries, the energy density of NIBs can be anywhere from 1 \u2013 5 times the value, depending on the chemistry used for the sodium-ion battery.\n\n'''Safety:''' Lead-acid batteries themselves are quite safe in operation, but the use of corrosive acid-based electrolytes hampers their safety. Lithium-ion batteries are quite stable if cycled with care but are susceptible to catching [[Lithium-ion battery#Safety|fire and exploding]] if overcharged thus necessitating strict controls on [[battery management system]]s. Another safety issue with lithium-ion batteries is that transportation cannot occur at fully discharged state \u2013 such batteries are required to be transported at least at 30% [[state of charge]]. In general, metal-ion batteries tend to be at their most unsafe state at the fully charged state, hence, the requirement for lithium-ion batteries to be transported at a partially charged state is not only cumbersome and more unsafe but also imposes additional costs. Such requirement for lithium-ion battery transport is on account of the dissolution concerns of Cu current collector if the lithium-ion battery's voltage drops too low.<ref name=\":1\" /> Sodium-ion batteries, using Al current collector on the anode, suffers no such issue upon being fully discharged to 0 V \u2013 in fact, it has been demonstrated that keeping sodium-ion batteries at a shorted state (0 V) for prolonged periods does not hamper its cycle life at all.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">Barker, J.; Wright, C. W.; \u201cStorage and/or transportation of sodium-ion cells\u201d.

Filed by Faradion Limited on August 22, 2014.</ref> While sodium-ion batteries can use many of the same solvents in the electrolyte as used by lithium-ion battery electrolytes, the compatibility of hard carbon with the more thermally stable [[propylene carbonate]] is a distinct advantage that sodium-ion batteries have over lithium-ion batteries. Hence, electrolytes with a higher percentage of propylene carbonate can be formulated for sodium-ion batteries as opposed to highly [[Flammable liquid|flammable]] [[diethyl carbonate]] or [[dimethyl carbonate]] (preferred for lithium-ion electrolytes) which would result in significantly enhanced safety for NIBs.\n\n== Commercialisation==\nAt present, there are a few companies around the world developing commercial sodium-ion batteries for various different applications. The major companies are listed below.\n\nFaradion Limited: Founded in 2011 in the [[United Kingdom]], Faradion has developed an extensive [[Intellectual property|IP]] portfolio (as of 2019, it has filed 26 patent families) covering a range of materials and methodologies for manufacture and system designs for sodium-ion batteries. Its chief cell design uses any of one of its patented high energy density oxide cathodes with hard carbon anode and with its patented liquid electrolyte. Primarily focusing on energy applications, Faradion pouch cells have demonstrated energy densities comparable to commercial Li-ion batteries (140 \u2013 150 Wh/kg at cell-level) with good rate performance till [[Electric battery#C rate|3C]] and excellent cycle lives of 300 (100% [[depth of discharge]]) to over 1,000 cycles (80% depth of discharge).<ref name=\":1\" /> Faradion has been able to successfully demonstrate viability of its scaled-up battery packs for e-bike and e-scooter applications.<ref name=\":1\" /> Faradion has also patented the concept of transporting sodium-ion cells in the shorted state (at 0 V), effectively eliminating any risks from commercial transport of such cells.<ref name=\":2\" /> The company's [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] is Dr. Jerry Barker, co-inventor of several popularly used lithium-ion and sodium-ion electrode materials such as LiM<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>,<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6884544.html ]</ref>  Li<sub>3</sub>M<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5871866.html]</ref> and  Na<sub>3</sub>M<sub>2</sub>(PO4)<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub><ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6872492.html]</ref> and the  carbothermal reduction<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6645452.html]</ref> method of synthesis for battery electrode materials.\n\nTiamat: Founded in 2017 in France, TIAMAT has spun off from the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]/[[French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission|CEA]] following researches carried out by a task force around the Na-ion technology funded within the RS2E network and a [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development#Horizon 2020|H2020]] EU-project called NAIADES.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ra2017cnrs.fr/en/en-2020-des-batteries-dopees-au-sodium/|title=Sodium to boost batteries by 2020|date=2018-03-26|website=2017 une ann\u00e9e avec le CNRS|access-date=2019-09-05}}</ref> With an exclusive licence for 6 patents from the CNRS and CEA, the solution developed by TIAMAT focuses on the development of [[List of battery sizes#Lithium-ion batteries (rechargeable)|18650]] cylindrical full cells based on polyanionic materials.

Altris AB is a spin-off company coming from the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m Advanced Battery Centre lead by Prof. Kristina Edstr\u00f6m at Uppsala University. EIT InnoEnergy has invested in the company from its inception. The company is selling Fennac\u00ae, an iron based Prussian blue analogue for the positive electrode in non-aqueous sodium ion batteries. Batteries containing Fennac\u00ae utilise hard carbon as the anode.\n\n==Applications==\nWhile the sodium-ion battery technology is very versatile and can essentially be tailored to suit any application, it is widely believed that the first usage of sodium-ion batteries would be for all applications which are currently being served by lead-acid batteries. For such lower energy density applications, sodium-ion batteries would essentially be delivering much higher energy densities than current lead-acid batteries (1 \u2013 5 times higher) at similar costs with enhanced performance (efficiency, safety, faster charging/discharging capabilities and cycling stabilities). These applications could be for smart grids, [[Grid energy storage|grid-storage]] for [[Renewable energy|renewable]] power plants, the car [[Automotive battery|SLI]] battery, [[Uninterruptible power supply|UPS]], telecoms, [[Home energy storage|home storage]] and for any other stationary energy storage applications.\n\nThe higher energy density sodium-ion batteries (typically those using non-aqueous electrolytes) would be well suited for those applications currently dominated by lithium-ion batteries. Among the lower energy density spectrum of such high energy density batteries, applications such as [[power tool]]s, [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], low speed [[electric vehicle]]s, e-bikes, e-scooters and e-buses would benefit from the lower costs of sodium-ion batteries with respect to those of lithium-ion batteries at similar performance levels (safety being in favour of sodium-ion batteries).\u00a0\n\nIt is expected that with the current rate of rapid progress in the field of sodium-ion batteries, such batteries would be eventually used in applications requiring very high energy density batteries (such as long-range electric vehicles and consumer electronics such as mobile phones and laptops) which are currently served by high cost and high energy density lithium-ion batteries.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of battery types]]\n* Alkali metal-ion battery\n** [[Lithium-ion battery]]\n** Sodium-ion battery\n** [[Potassium-ion battery]]\n*[[Rechargeable battery]]\n*[[Salt water battery]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Galvanic cells}}\n\n[[Category:Metal-ion batteries]]\n[[Category:Battery types]]\n", "name_user": "Mazarin07", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCommercialisation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-ion_battery"}
