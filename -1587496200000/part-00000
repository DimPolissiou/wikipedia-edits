The whole suite is [[User Account Control|Vista UAC]] aware and is designed to take advantage of [[multi-core]] processors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpchacha.com/chasysdraw/index.php |title=Chasys Draw IES Homepage |date=2012-07-02 |publisher=John Paul Chacha}}</ref>\n\nThe software is developed by John Paul Chacha in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].\n\nChasys Draw IES is currently released as [[freeware]], and is available for computers running [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s.\n\nThe suite is coded in a blend of [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[assembly language]]. It runs on [[x86]] processors and supports the [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], [[SSE2]], [[SSSE3|S-SSE3]], and [[SSE4|SSE4.1]] [[instruction set]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpchacha.com/chasysdraw/help.php |title=Chasys Draw IES Documentation |date=2012-07-02 |publisher=John Paul Chacha}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nChasys Draw is a project that was started in November 2001 by John Paul Chacha, mostly as a hobby than anything else. The original Chasys Draw was a rather simple bitmap editor done in [[visual basic]], a lot like [[MS Paint]] save for its ability to do gradients. This application underwent many changes, eventually leading up to Chasys Draw 5. This was the first version to have its own native format, referred to simply as CD5.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.file-extensions.org/cd5-file-extension |title=Chasys Draw Image format |date=2007-09-11 |publisher=File-Extensions.org}}</ref>\n\nMajor updates to the graphics code in May 2002 resulted in Chasys Draw DTFx (Direct Tool eFfects). The new graphics code being referred to here was actually a miniature bitmap abstraction engine that allowed for fast per-pixel operations and direct image buffer access (much as the DIB engine does for GDI). The engine was named JpDRAW. This version was also done in VB, but was much faster than all the previous versions. The new graphics code allowed for more tools to be implemented than was ever possible before. Later on in 2002, the developer decided to completely abandon VB as a programming platform and moved all the code to [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]]. The move to C/C++ allowed the development of a full-fledged graphics engine which was named JpDRAW2. Chasys was renamed to Chasys Draw Artist, and the CD5 image format was also updated to reflect the new features. By coincidence, the module that implemented the file format was the fifth module to be added, so the format was called Chasys Draw module 5, retaining the .cd5 file extension.\n\n; First public release\n\nIn April 2004, Chasys Draw Artist was released to the public via the internet for the first time (version 1.27). The release was done via betanews<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/Chasys-Draw-IES/1217327756/1 |title=Chasys Draw Artist at Betanews Fileforum |date=2007-09-09 |publisher=Betanews}}</ref>). In 2005, Chasys Draw underwent major user interface changes as well as internal changes. By December of that year, the project had reached version 1.63. This was the first version to introduce advanced features such as [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]]. It was also the first version with full support for [[alpha channel]]s. The CD5 image format was also upgraded to version 2, adding advanced [[Data compression|compression]], full alpha channels, [[encryption]] and [[metadata]]. Version 1.63 was the first version to win an [[IEEE]] ([[Kenya]] chapter) award in ICT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.centurionsystemsltd.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=30&limit=1&limitstart=1 |title=Chasys Draw Artist wins IEEE Expo |date=2007-09-09 |publisher=Centurion Systems |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708132654/http://eng.centurionsystemsltd.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=30&limit=1&limitstart=1 |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe \"chazy-glass\" interface, from which the all later versions' user interfaces borrowed, was introduced in version 1.80. Chasys Draw Artist adopted [[Image editing|photo editing]] features in version 2.01. Comprehensive tutorials were added and many features were re-designed to make them easier to use. [[Thread (computer science)|Multi-threading]] was introduced to accelerate some tasks, such as the improved auto-save engine. Utilities such as a converter and browser were added. Version 2.43 of Chasys Draw Artist was quietly released to the public in late 2007 without any announcements. It featured many fixes to the formal version 2.42, as well as many new features. The quiet release was due to a decision to re-build Chasys Draw Artist from scratch, while still continuing support for the old architecture. An experimental version 2.45 was released only to beta-testers for the purpose of testing new technologies that would be included in the new architecture and was officially withdrawn in May 2008.\n\nDuring the time when the versions 2.43~2.45 were being released, work was underway to create a new layer-based Chasys Draw, which was released as Chasys Draw IES (Image Editing Suite), with the initial version number 2.50. A new multi-layer tag-based image format was created to support layering and [[Blend modes|blending modes]]; this was named CD5 v3. The next version introduced animation and multi-resolution support as editing modes, and the next one brought in an unlimited undo engine, new plug-ins and several internal fixes. Further development led to the introduction of [[super-resolution]] and [[image stacking]], support for video and [[video capture]], [[Spatial anti-aliasing|Anti-aliasing]], metadata save and restore, a \"Pen and Path\" tool, physical measurement specification, and a [[video]] sequence composer engine. The user interface was enhanced with adaptive scrolling and the auto-save engine was optimized. Some [[memory management]] was added for machines with low [[RAM]].\n\nBy version 2.60, Chasys Draw IES was capable of loading  [[Photoshop]]'s PSD files, as well as load and save [[JPEG 2000]]. This version also had shell integration with [[thumbnail]]s and application-level support for [[multi-monitor]] display setups. [[Metadata]] was extended to support save, restore and scaling for text formatting and path data. There was also a new palette with exchangeable swatches, loadable from all kinds of palette files. A slicing tool for web and user interface design was also included. A [[C++]] code module output for inline image generation was added, as was a constrained recolor brush.\n\nThe concept of a \"fully anti-aliased work-flow\" was introduced in version 2.62, in which all drawing and selection tools were anti-aliased by default. Support for Photoshop plug-ins using Adobe's [[8bf]] format was added in version 2.66, allowing users to utilize thousands of free plug-ins available online. Equivalents for the [[Pantone]] [[Palette (painting)|palette]]s (PMS 100 to 814-2x) were added, and the \"Just-in-Time\" memory compressor significantly reduced the editor's memory requirements.\n\n; First freeware release\n\nChasys Draw IES went [[freeware]] on 6 June 2009. With the coming of the freeware IES, two [[Blend modes|blending modes]] (Hue and Chroma) were added. Textures were improved to allow multiple layer-based textures. The TextArt G3 engine was enhanced with LINK metadata, and alpha shift was improved. IES 2.72 added the Luma Wand tool, fixed [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] and [[TIFF]] transparency issues, and fixed Smart-Paste transparency. IES 2.74 introduced alpha protection, and 2.75 followed with a new adjustments engine that faced out many effects implemented by the effects engine. The adjustments engine was designed to appeal to experienced image editors. IES 2.76 introduced a new transform engine and the Resizer for IES plug-in supporting multi-core and 18 scaling methods, including customizable [[Sinc filter|windowed Sinc]] [[interpolation]]. IES 2.77 added Greyscale with Tint adjustment, separated the Lock and Click-Thru layer properties, extended the Cloning Brush with three options (this, below and composite) and also extended the Color Picker with multiple point sampling.\n\nIES 3.01 brought a new look and many breakthrough tools to the suite. It was geared toward touch and was fully compatible with Windows 7. The toolbox was reorganized, with some tools being grouped and new ones added. Some message boxes were replaced with a new popup system, and the working of the workspace was changed to use a [[blitter|back-blitter]], which enabled the addition of new blending modes, Screen and Mask. The printing interface was modified and given accurate proofing. Alpha Function Adjustment was added and a new Anti-[[Quantization error|Quantization]] Engine included for all adjustments to remove the need for 16 bits per channel editing. An internal clipboard was created to cater for copying images that are too large for the Windows clipboard, and translucency full-page gradients added. Some new tutorials were added and keyboard shortcuts made configurable.\n\nIES 3.05 brought the power of custom full-page gradients to the suite, supporting .ggr, .grd and .gra gradients. New gradient styles were included, as was support for Adobe color tables (.act), palette previewing, point color editing and a highly improved TextArt engine.\n\n; Digital lightroom\n\nIES 3.11 was introduced on 14 December 2009. It was done on a new development base and added a new application, raw-Input. This was a [[Raw image format|RAW image format]] processor based on dcraw. This application allowed the use of Chasys Draw IES in processing digital negatives, which are popular with professional photographers.\n\nChasys Draw IES 3.24 was released with a re-designed user interface, powered by a higher performance graphics core and better memory management. A history palette was introduced, as was a new screen capture function with video capability. The layer palette received drag-drop capability and unsharp masking got yet another upgrade. Soft proofing with ICC profiles was introduced in version 3.27. Full support for [[Windows 7|Win-7]] was added in version, as was support for [[Exif]]. Support for [[graphics tablet]]s (including [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]]) followed in version 3.33, and support for [[LightScribe|LightScribe Direct Disc Labeling]] was added in version 3.40.\n\n; Conversion to Unicode\n\nChasys Draw IES 3.56 was the product of porting Chasys Draw IES from [[ASCII|ANSI]] to [[Unicode|UNICODE]]. It featured the first version of the Live Language Translation Engine, with [[Internationalization and localization|multiple language support]]. A new, Unicode-aware \"TextArt G4\" engine was also introduced. IES 3.63 featured highly improved Photoshop 8BF support, a Silent Install option, Drag-drop to the Layers window, a censoring brush (under fx Brush), Improved RAW support, FastExternals 2.22 with a new callback suite (pi_StateStore), an external histogram window and a new Touch Gadget. It also included several bug fixes. Fault-tolerant file saving and taskbar progress reporting for Windows 7 were introduced in version 3.64.\n\n; Recent versions\n\nRecent versions of Chasys Draw IES have added high-end features such as [[Layers (digital image editing)#Adjustment layer|adjustment layers]], Power Management, jitter-corrected Video Screen Capture, video cropping, digitizer pen rotation (e.g. Wacom Intuos with 6D Art Pen), and Shell-out.\n\n== Features ==\n\nChasys Draw IES emphasizes speed and ease of use as major design goals, and its design is intended to reflect this.\n\n=== Layers ===\n\nChasys Draw IES uses the concept of a ''free-style'' layer. A free-style layer is one that can be positioned anywhere, including totally removing it from the image and keeping it aside. Chasys Draw IES Artist provides free-style layering as a way to enable people to work with images the same way they would if the images were photos placed on their desk - you may stack what you need together, while placing pieces that you are not currently using outside the stack but within reach.\n\n==== Adjustment Layers ====\n\nChasys Draw IES supports [[Layers (digital image editing)#Adjustment layer|adjustment layers]], with support for multiple adjustments per adjustment layer and the ability to import adjustment layers from [[Adobe Photoshop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpchacha.com/chasysdraw/help.php?file=artist_concepts_adjlayer.htm |title=Chasys Draw IES Help: Adjustment Layers |date=2017-08-08 |publisher=John Paul Chacha's Lab }}</ref> Adjustment layers are special layers that adjust the information on the layers below them; they allow you to perform non-destructive image editing by applying adjustments to your image without permanently changing pixel values.\n\n=== Image modes ===\n\nThe rendering (drawing) of layers in Chasys Draw IES Artist is dictated by a parameter called the image mode.\n\nThe default image mode, [[Compositing|composite]], renders the layers as a stack for the purpose of [[compositing]]. Two sub-modes are provided, a ''normal'' sub-mode that emphasizes free-style layering and a ''clipped'' sub-mode that clips the output like other image editing software.\n\nIn the multi-resolution image mode, similar copies of the image are made at different resolutions. The destination device then has a choice of images to choose from, depending on the intended display resolution. This mode is primarily used for creating icons and cursors.\n\nThe [[animation]] image mode is used for short videos, known as animations. In this mode, only one layer is displayed at a time, one after the other, after a duration of time dictated by the frame delay layer attribute. It is analogous to the way an artist can draw a slightly different figure on each page of a pad of paper so that when you flip between sheets rapidly, the drawing appears to move. This mode includes a sub-mode for [[Onion skinning|onion-skin animation]].\n\n=== Layer attachments (metadata) ===\n\nChasys Draw IES can add descriptive information, such as the name and style of font used, path data, etc. to a layer. This information is called metadata, and is saved along with the layer. If the layer were to be opened for editing later, this information will be restored to facilitate easier editing.\n\n=== File formats ===\n\nChasys Draw IES supports saving and loading a large number of different [[file format]]s, and support for others can be added using plug-ins. The software ships with plug-ins for 92 different file formats, including PSD (native format for [[Adobe Photoshop]], read and write), XCF (native format for [[GIMP]], read and write), PDN (native format for [[Paint.NET]], read only), CPT (native format for [[Corel Photo-Paint]], read only), ORA (OpenRaster interchange format) and several [[Raw image format|RAW image formats]]. The native format is Chasys Draw Image (CD5).<ref>\n{{cite web |title=File formats supported by Chasys Draw IES |url=http://www.jpchacha.com/chm_view.php?src_dir=chasys_draw_ies&src_file=files_image.htm |year=2007 |publisher=gimphelp.org}}</ref>\n\n== Latest Changes ==\n\n* New and Improved User Interface \n* Major codebase rewrite and optimization \n* Borderless fullscreen with fade out in Viewer \n* Improved Previewer performance and timing \n* Smoother Object Animation rendering \n* Sprite-sheet manipulation features \n* Automatic EXIF rotation in Viewer \n* Improved Undo engine performance \n* Faster font loading and management \n* Pause and resume jobs in Converter \n* Save and JPEG auto-confirm for quick editing \n* [bug fix] Resource leaks leading to crashes \n* [bug fix] OS/2 style BMP files not loading\n* [bug fix] ICNS icon file loading errors \n\n== Reviews ==\n\nReviews of Chasys Draw IES have been largely positive, with the editors at [[CNET Networks|CNET]] [[download.com]] giving it a 5/5 star rating and saying \"Chasys Draw IES Artist is a free, full-featured image editing and drawing program that does what big-box programs like Adobe Photoshop can do, with a few unique touches that set it apart and actually make it easier to use than the competition.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.cnet.com/Chasys-Draw-IES/3000-2192_4-10909426.html |title=CNET Download.com review of Chasys Draw IES |year=2011 |publisher=CNET Download.com}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nChasys Draw IES has been criticized for its lack of a native [[CMYK]] mode.

Fault-tolerant file saving and taskbar progress reporting for Windows 7 were introduced in version 3.64.\n\n; Recent versions\n\nRecent versions of Chasys Draw IES have added high-end features such as [[Layers (digital image editing)#Adjustment layer|adjustment layers]], Power Management, jitter-corrected Video Screen Capture, video cropping, digitizer pen rotation (e.g. Wacom Intuos with 6D Art Pen), and Shell-out.\n\n== Features ==\n\nChasys Draw IES emphasizes speed and ease of use as major design goals, and its design is intended to reflect this.\n\n=== Layers ===\n\nChasys Draw IES uses the concept of a ''free-style'' layer. A free-style layer is one that can be positioned anywhere, including totally removing it from the image and keeping it aside. Chasys Draw IES Artist provides free-style layering as a way to enable people to work with images the same way they would if the images were photos placed on their desk - you may stack what you need together, while placing pieces that you are not currently using outside the stack but within reach.\n\n==== Adjustment Layers ====\n\nChasys Draw IES supports [[Layers (digital image editing)#Adjustment layer|adjustment layers]], with support for multiple adjustments per adjustment layer and the ability to import adjustment layers from [[Adobe Photoshop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpchacha.com/chasysdraw/help.php?file=artist_concepts_adjlayer.htm |title=Chasys Draw IES Help: Adjustment Layers |date=2017-08-08 |publisher=John Paul Chacha's Lab }}</ref> Adjustment layers are special layers that adjust the information on the layers below them; they allow you to perform non-destructive image editing by applying adjustments to your image without permanently changing pixel values.\n\n=== Image modes ===\n\nThe rendering (drawing) of layers in Chasys Draw IES Artist is dictated by a parameter called the image mode.\n\nThe default image mode, [[Compositing|composite]], renders the layers as a stack for the purpose of [[compositing]]. Two sub-modes are provided, a ''normal'' sub-mode that emphasizes free-style layering and a ''clipped'' sub-mode that clips the output like other image editing software.\n\nIn the multi-resolution image mode, similar copies of the image are made at different resolutions. The destination device then has a choice of images to choose from, depending on the intended display resolution. This mode is primarily used for creating icons and cursors.\n\nThe [[animation]] image mode is used for short videos, known as animations. In this mode, only one layer is displayed at a time, one after the other, after a duration of time dictated by the frame delay layer attribute. It is analogous to the way an artist can draw a slightly different figure on each page of a pad of paper so that when you flip between sheets rapidly, the drawing appears to move. This mode includes a sub-mode for [[Onion skinning|onion-skin animation]].\n\n=== Layer attachments (metadata) ===\n\nChasys Draw IES can add descriptive information, such as the name and style of font used, path data, etc. to a layer. This information is called metadata, and is saved along with the layer. If the layer were to be opened for editing later, this information will be restored to facilitate easier editing.\n\n=== File formats ===\n\nChasys Draw IES supports saving and loading a large number of different [[file format]]s, and support for others can be added using plug-ins. The software ships with plug-ins for 92 different file formats, including PSD (native format for [[Adobe Photoshop]], read and write), XCF (native format for [[GIMP]], read and write), PDN (native format for [[Paint.NET]], read only), CPT (native format for [[Corel Photo-Paint]], read only), ORA (OpenRaster interchange format) and several [[Raw image format|RAW image formats]]. The native format is Chasys Draw Image (CD5).<ref>\n{{cite web |title=File formats supported by Chasys Draw IES |url=http://www.jpchacha.com/chm_view.php?src_dir=chasys_draw_ies&src_file=files_image.htm |year=2007 |publisher=gimphelp.org}}</ref>\n\n== Latest Changes ==\n\n* Improved User Interface\n* Fluid rendering for object animation\n* Improved Layers window with quick show/hide\n* Improved Snip tool with selection simulation\n* Brush Engine 4.3 with improved [[Graphics tablet|Pen Tablet]] response\n* Snap to Object and Snap to Center functionality\n* Configurable autosave timer with battery adaptation\n* Activated layer outlining with walking ants\n* Cancel tool operations using Escape key\n*Several minor improvements and optimizations\n* [bug fix] Error reporting service not working\n*[bug fix] Luma Sharpen removes transparency\n*[bug fix] Artist fails to start on some computers\n\n== Reviews ==\n\nReviews of Chasys Draw IES have been largely positive, with the editors at [[CNET Networks|CNET]] [[download.com]] giving it a 5/5 star rating and saying \"Chasys Draw IES Artist is a free, full-featured image editing and drawing program that does what big-box programs like Adobe Photoshop can do, with a few unique touches that set it apart and actually make it easier to use than the competition.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.cnet.com/Chasys-Draw-IES/3000-2192_4-10909426.html |title=CNET Download.com review of Chasys Draw IES |year=2011 |publisher=CNET Download.com}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nChasys Draw IES has been criticized for its lack of a native [[CMYK]] mode.

Apart from medieval constructions, churches built until the [[Second World War]] are about 90% wooden.<ref name=\"Muri\">Muri, Sigurd (1975): ''Gamle kyrkjer i ny tid''. Oslo: Samlaget.</ref> The stave church ([[timber frame]]) method of construction is believed to be older than the log technique, and the former was completely abandoned after the reformation.<ref name=\"Bugge\">Bugge, G. and C. Norberg-Schultz (1990): ''Stav og laft i Norge. Early wooden architecture in Norway.'' Oslo: Norsk arkitekturforlag</ref>\n\n==== Stave churches ====\nOnce common all over northwestern Europe, most of the surviving stave churches are in Norway. Around 1,000 (or as many as 2,000) stave churches were erected before the [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]], of which 28 still exist.<ref>Storsletten, Ola (1993): ''En arv i tre'' (De norske stavkirkene), Oslo 1993.</ref> Prior to the stave technique several (perhaps hundreds) small [[post church]]es were erected. In this construction the posts (the vertical, roof-bearing timbers) were placed directly in excavated holes and thus susceptible to decay. The stave construction instead placed the posts on a line of stones (a foundation) resulting in a durable building. Traces of post holes have been found under some of the existing stave churches.<ref name=\"Ekroll\" /> The first [[St Mary's Church, Oslo]] was probably an 11th-century post church. While the stave technique was abandoned in church building after the reformation, it was retained in the construction of barns and boathouses in [[Western Norway]] into the 20th century.<ref name=\"Bugge\" /> Stave churches were usually built entirely from wood, including the roof cover from [[wood shingle]] or [[Shake (shingle)|shakes]].\n\n==== Log building ====\nAfter the Protestant reformation when the construction of new (or replacement of old) churches was resumed, wood was still the dominant material but the log technique replaced stave technique.<ref name=\"Christie\" /> The log construction gave a lower more sturdy style of building compared to the light and often tall stave churches. Log construction easily became structurally unstable for long and tall walls, particularly if cut through by tall windows. Adding transepts improved the stability of the log technique and is one reason why the cross-shaped floor plan was widely used during 17th and 18th centuries. For instance the [[Old Olden Church]] (1759) replaced a building damaged by hurricane, the 1759 church was then constructed in cruciform shape to make it withstand the strongest winds.<ref>[http://www.sffarkiv.no/sffbasar/default.asp?p=result&db=dbatlas_leks&spraak_id=1&ptype=single&art_id=124 County archives about Olden Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002054032/http://www.sffarkiv.no/sffbasar/default.asp?p=result&db=dbatlas_leks&spraak_id=1&ptype=single&art_id=124 |date=2 October 2013 }} article published 2000.

[[V\u00e5g\u00e5 Church]] for instance was largely built by materials from the previous stave church on the site. Building materials and interior decorations were often reused in new churches. In 1782 some wood beams from the dismantled stave church were used in the new Norddal Church built on same site. In Norddal Church there is also an altarpiece from around 1510 and a baroque 17th century pulpit previously used in the demolished stave church.<ref>Furseth, Astor (ed.): ''Norddal kyrkje 1782\u20131982''.

For instance in the [[Grue Church fire]] more than 100 persons died making it the biggest fire disaster recorded in Norway. Some fires have been intentional, notably the destruction of [[\u00c5sane Old Church]] of the original [[Fantoft Stave Church]] \u2013 both later rebuilt as replicas.

The early 12th century stone churches built in Norway's political and business centres implied the introduction of masonry work. Residential stone buildings are unknown until the 13th century and private masonry buildings were generally not constructed in the rural areas.<ref name=\"Ekroll\" /> Old stone churches were usually built from naturally occurring stones or stones cut in local quarries. [[Lime mortar]] was used to bind stones in these old constructions. [[Soapstone]] is a common building material, notably in [[Nidaros Cathedral]] as well as [[St Mary's Church, Bergen]] and in sorts of decorations that required great detail. For instance several [[baptismal font]]s are made from soapstone. The widespread use of soapstone is so specific to Norway that Ekroll calls it a \"national stone\".<ref name=\"Ekroll\" /> Soapstone was particularly common in \u00d8sfold, Hordaland, Sogn, Tr\u00f8ndelag and North Norway. Limestone was commonly used in Oslo, Akershus, Hedmark and Oppland; while a local type of marble was used in M\u00f8re og Romsdal and Tr\u00f8ndelag. Green slate was commonly used in Rogaland and Tr\u00f8ndelag. Local types of granite was used in Vestfold, Telemark and Agder. The walls of [[Selje Abbey]] was covered in local [[olivine]] stones. Only the most important medieval churches were built from the most costly [[ashlar]], for instance [[Nidaros Cathedral]], [[Old Aker Church]] and [[Giske Church]] (a total of some 20 buildings). Other churches were built from stones that were merely roughly fitted to an approximately plane surface. Surviving medieval stone structures are mostly church buildings, only a small number of profane monuments remain, including [[Bergenhus Fortress|H\u00e5kon's Hall]] and parts of [[Akershus Fortress]].\n\nBrick was used in the Middle Ages, but in church building it is most visible in a number of large 19th-century city churches including [[Trinity Church (Arendal)]], [[Skien Church]], [[Trinity Church (Oslo)]] and catholic [[St. Olav's Cathedral, Oslo]]. About 170 churches from the 17th and 18th centuries still exist, only 14 of these are built from stone or brick.<ref name=\"Muri\" /> The [[S\u00f8r-Fron Church|Gudbrandsdal Cathedral]] is one of the few rural stone churches from the 18th century. A stone church was at the time estimated as 50-100% more costly to build than a wooden church. Locals in Gudbrandsdal had an intimate knowledge about wood construction and stone churches were not unknown, but locals did not have the skills to complete such a large stone structure and an expert were called in. Stones were obtained from a quarry nearby.<ref name=\"Hosar\">Hosar, K\u00e5re: ''S\u00f8r-Fron kirke. Lokal bakgrunn og impulser utenfra''.

The main types mentioned below can be used for classification, although there may be some overlap or combined designs.<ref name=\"Muri\" /> For instance [[Dolstad Church]] has four arms attached to the central octagon creating an octagonal-cruciform floor plan. In some octagonal churches the chancel and altar is in a separate section attached to octagonal main body as in long churches.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages most churches were built from wood according to the stave church technique. Most masonry churches were originally constructed as long churches and a small number as classical basilicas.

Only in the 20th century the majority of churches have been built from stone, brick or concrete. The 320 stave churches existing or known around 1800 were mostly in rural or sparsely populated areas. Stone churches were more common in cities, along the outer coast, in rich agricultural areas in East Norway and Tr\u00f8ndelag, and in regional centres in fjord districts of West Norway.<ref name=\"Anker\" /> For instance the main church in Aurland ([[Aurland#Vangen Kyrkje|Vangen Church]]) is a stone construction, while the churches in smaller [[Undredal Stave Church|Undredal]] and [[Fl\u00e5m]] are wooden. The main churches within the \"one fourth county\" clerical subdivision were often built in stone, for instance Kinsarvik church in Hardanger district.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Number of buildings by material and period.<ref name=\"Muri\" />\n|-\n!

Apart from medieval constructions, churches built until the [[Second World War]] are about 90% wooden.<ref name=\"Muri\">Muri, Sigurd (1975): ''Gamle kyrkjer i ny tid''. Oslo: Samlaget.</ref> The stave church ([[timber frame]]) method of construction is believed to be older than the log technique, and the former was completely abandoned after the reformation.<ref name=\"Bugge\">Bugge, G. and C. Norberg-Schultz (1990): ''Stav og laft i Norge. Early wooden architecture in Norway.'' Oslo: Norsk arkitekturforlag</ref>\n\n==== Stave churches ====\nOnce common all over northwestern Europe, most of the surviving stave churches are in Norway. Around 1,000 (or as many as 2,000) stave churches were erected before the [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]], of which 28 still exist.<ref>Storsletten, Ola (1993): ''En arv i tre'' (De norske stavkirkene), Oslo 1993.</ref> Prior to the stave technique several (perhaps hundreds) small [[post church]]es were erected. In this construction the posts (the vertical, roof-bearing timbers) were placed directly in excavated holes and thus susceptible to decay. The stave construction instead placed the posts on a line of stones (a foundation) resulting in a durable building. Traces of post holes have been found under some of the existing stave churches.<ref name=\"Ekroll\" /> The first [[St Mary's Church, Oslo]] was probably an 11th-century post church. While the stave technique was abandoned in church building after the reformation, it was retained in the construction of barns and boathouses in [[Western Norway]] into the 20th century.<ref name=\"Bugge\" /> Stave churches were usually built entirely from wood, including the roof cover from [[wood shingle]] or [[Shake (shingle)|shakes]].\n\n==== Log building ====\nAfter the Protestant reformation when the construction of new (or replacement of old) churches was resumed, wood was still the dominant material but the log technique replaced stave technique.<ref name=\"Christie\" /> The log construction gave a lower more sturdy style of building compared to the light and often tall stave churches. Log construction easily became structurally unstable for long and tall walls, particularly if cut through by tall windows. Adding transepts improved the stability of the log technique and is one reason why the cross-shaped floor plan was widely used during 17th and 18th centuries. For instance the [[Old Olden Church]] (1759) replaced a building damaged by hurricane, the 1759 church was then constructed in cruciform shape to make it withstand the strongest winds.<ref>[http://www.sffarkiv.no/sffbasar/default.asp?p=result&db=dbatlas_leks&spraak_id=1&ptype=single&art_id=124 County archives about Olden Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002054032/http://www.sffarkiv.no/sffbasar/default.asp?p=result&db=dbatlas_leks&spraak_id=1&ptype=single&art_id=124 |date=2 October 2013 }} article published 2000. Retrieved 14 September 2013.</ref> Between the Reformation and modern days, log building was so predominant that some medieval stone churches (such as [[S\u00f8ndeled Church]] and [[Lunner Church]]) were enlarged by adding a log-built sections. Log buildings are often covered by [[clapboard (architecture)|clapboards]] concealing the load-bearing structure, one exception is the uncovered logs of [[B\u00f8verdal Church]].

The [[octagon]]al floor plan offers good visibility as well as a rigid structure allowing a relatively wide nave to be constructed \u2013 [[H\u00e5kon Christie]] believes that this is a reason why the [[Octagonal churches in Norway|octagonal church design]] became popular during the 1700s.<ref name=\"Christie\" /> [[Halvor Vreim|Vreim]] believes that the introduction of log technique after the reformation resulted in a multitude of church designs in Norway.<ref name=\"Vreim\" />\n\n==== Other aspects ====\nWhen a log building was complete and all timber fitted, it could easily be dismantled, relocated and rebuilt fitting all pieces in the original order. [[Elverh\u00f8y Church]], for instance, was relocated in 1861 and 1975. The previous church building at [[Sylte Church|Sylte]] was originally standing 4&nbsp;km further upstream in the valley, about one month after materials had been transported in spring 1812 it was ready to use.<ref>''Grunn og gror.''

[[V\u00e5g\u00e5 Church]] for instance was largely built by materials from the previous stave church on the site. Building materials and interior decorations were often reused in new churches. In 1782 some wood beams from the dismantled stave church were used in the new Norddal Church built on same site. In Norddal Church there is also an altarpiece from around 1510 and a baroque 17th century pulpit previously used in the demolished stave church.<ref>Furseth, Astor (ed.): ''Norddal kyrkje 1782\u20131982''. Published by Norddal sokner\u00e5d 1982.</ref>\n\nFor traditional wood construction, the best quality wood was obtained by cutting the top of [[Scots pine|pinetrees]] then letting the log accumulate resin for a couple of years.<ref name=\"Bugge\" />\n\nFire is a hazard in wood churches. For instance in the [[Grue Church fire]] more than 100 persons died making it the biggest fire disaster recorded in Norway. Some fires have been intentional, notably the destruction of [[\u00c5sane Old Church]] of the original [[Fantoft Stave Church]] \u2013 both later rebuilt as replicas. The original [[Meldal Church]] from 1651 burned down in 1981 and the new church copied the style of the original. In 2011 the [[\u00d8stre Porsgrunn Church]], once one of Norway's largest wooden churches, was completely destroyed by fire, and reconstruction versus modern church is an ongoing debate. Since 1980 more than 28 church buildings have been destroyed by fire, these were often rebuilt in fire proof brick or concrete.<ref name=\"Konsulenten\">S\u00e6ther, Arne (2005): Kirkebygging i nyere tid. available at [http://www.kirkekonsulenten.no/siste.htm Kirkekonsulenten].

The early 12th century stone churches built in Norway's political and business centres implied the introduction of masonry work. Residential stone buildings are unknown until the 13th century and private masonry buildings were generally not constructed in the rural areas.<ref name=\"Ekroll\" /> Old stone churches were usually built from naturally occurring stones or stones cut in local quarries. [[Lime mortar]] was used to bind stones in these old constructions. [[Soapstone]] is a common building material, notably in [[Nidaros Cathedral]] as well as [[St Mary's Church, Bergen]] and in sorts of decorations that required great detail. For instance several [[baptismal font]]s are made from soapstone. The widespread use of soapstone is so specific to Norway that Ekroll calls it a \"national stone\".<ref name=\"Ekroll\" /> Soapstone was particularly common in \u00d8sfold, Hordaland, Sogn, Tr\u00f8ndelag and North Norway. Limestone was commonly used in Oslo, Akershus, Hedmark and Oppland; while a local type of marble was used in M\u00f8re og Romsdal and Tr\u00f8ndelag. Green slate was commonly used in Rogaland and Tr\u00f8ndelag. Local types of granite was used in Vestfold, Telemark and Agder. The walls of [[Selje Abbey]] was covered in local [[olivine]] stones. Only the most important medieval churches were built from the most costly [[ashlar]], for instance [[Nidaros Cathedral]], [[Old Aker Church]] and [[Giske Church]] (a total of some 20 buildings). Other churches were built from stones that were merely roughly fitted to an approximately plane surface. Surviving medieval stone structures are mostly church buildings, only a small number of profane monuments remain, including [[Bergenhus Fortress|H\u00e5kon's Hall]] and parts of [[Akershus Fortress]].\n\nBrick was used in the Middle Ages, but in church building it is most visible in a number of large 19th-century city churches including [[Trinity Church (Arendal)]], [[Skien Church]], [[Trinity Church (Oslo)]] and catholic [[St. Olav's Cathedral, Oslo]]. About 170 churches from the 17th and 18th centuries still exist, only 14 of these are built from stone or brick.<ref name=\"Muri\" /> The [[S\u00f8r-Fron Church|Gudbrandsdal Cathedral]] is one of the few rural stone churches from the 18th century. A stone church was at the time estimated as 50-100% more costly to build than a wooden church. Locals in Gudbrandsdal had an intimate knowledge about wood construction and stone churches were not unknown, but locals did not have the skills to complete such a large stone structure and an expert were called in. Stones were obtained from a quarry nearby.<ref name=\"Hosar\">Hosar, K\u00e5re: ''S\u00f8r-Fron kirke. Lokal bakgrunn og impulser utenfra''.

The main types mentioned below can be used for classification, although there may be some overlap or combined designs.<ref name=\"Muri\" /> For instance [[Dolstad Church]] has four arms attached to the central octagon creating an octagonal-cruciform floor plan. In some octagonal churches the chancel and altar is in a separate section attached to octagonal main body as in long churches.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages most churches were built from wood according to the stave church technique. Most masonry churches were originally constructed as long churches and a small number as classical basilicas. Virtually no new churches were built during the 1400 and 1500s.<ref name=\"Vreim\">[[Halvor Vreim|Vreim, Halvor]] (1947): ''Norsk trearkitektur.''

When church building resumed during the 1600s, a careful break from the Catholic tradition can be observed while during the 1700s a clear preference for Protestant church architecture emerged in Norway.

After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the Anglo-Norman style was the main inspiration for Romanesque church building in West Norway, Agder and Tr\u00f8ndelag. East Norway were more influenced by Danish and German ideals with less emphasis on ornaments. Smaller rural churches are difficult to date, but Ekroll assumes that the Romanesque style was retained longest in rural Norway.<ref name=\"Ekroll\" /> Romanesque ornaments continued to be used on wood carvings on stave churches and on profane rural buildings.<ref name=\"Ostby\" /> Notable Romanesque monuments:\n* [[Old Aker Church]] is primarily a Romanesque (Anglo-Norman) basilica from around 1100,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://snl.no/Gamle_Aker_kirke |title=Gamle Aker kirke \u2013 Store norske leksikon |publisher=Snl.no |accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref> but with some [[Baroque]] interior added early 18th century.\n* The construction of [[Stavanger Cathedral]] began according to Romanesque style (around 1100), then later enlarged in Gothic style (after 1272).\n* The transepts of Nidaros Cathedral.\n* [[Talgje Church]] (12th century, Anglo-Norman style) at [[Finn\u00f8y]]\n* [[Gjerpen church]] (12th century, cruciform)\n* [[Sister Churches, Norway|Sister Churches at Gran]] (12th century)\n* [[Cathedral Ruins in Hamar|The catholic Hamar Cathedral]] began as a Romanesque structure around 1150\n* [[Sakshaug gamle Church]] (about 1150), Romanesque-Norman with some Gothic arcs\n* [[Alstadhaug Church]] began in Anglo-Norman style around 1180, enlarged in early Gothic style 13th century\n\n==== Gothic ====\n[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style was probably introduced by [[H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konssen]] around 1240 and the style became dominant during the 13th century until church building came to a standstill after 1300 \u2013 lesser work on the Nidaros Cathedral however continued throughout the Middle Ages. [[Nidaros Cathedral]] is the only Norwegian church building where the full array of Gothic elements, including [[flying buttress]]es, is used. Other buildings with notable Gothic elements or additions include [[Utstein Abbey]] and [[Stavanger Cathedral]]. The typical [[rib vault]] was rarely used in Norwegian medieval Gothic, church builders instead relied on various types of [[timber roof truss]]es. On exception is the octagonal apse with rib vaults in [[Alstadhaug Church]], probably inspired by the Nidaros octagon.<ref name=\"Ostby\" /> [[Voss Church]] at Vossevangen is a 13th-century stone church in Gothic style, but with a wooden roof construction.
