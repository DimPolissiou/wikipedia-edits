She gives Pete their baby, Lucas, while she recovers from the ordeal. Addison and Sam get even closer and develop feelings for each other, but decide not to become a couple because they don't want to hurt Naomi. Charlotte and Cooper break up, and Dell loses Heather in an explosion which nearly kills Betsey also.\n\nSam and Naomi's daughter, Maya, gets pregnant and marries the father of her baby, Dink. Addison and Pete become a couple, which causes Addison to get close to Lucas until Violet wants him back, even going as far as taking Pete to court to get joint custody. Sheldon starts to fall for Charlotte after they start to sleep together.\n\nIn the season finale, Addison and Sam finally get together while Charlotte and Cooper get engaged much to Sheldon's dismay. Pete and Violet work over their issues, while Dell and Maya get involved in a car accident and the severity of Dell's condition is overlooked. Dr. Amelia Shepherd, younger sister of Derek Shepherd (Addison's ex-husband) operated on him, having just arrived in town. She was unable to resuscitate him following heart failure. Maya survived her operation to save her spinal cord and prevent paralysis while at the same time she gives birth to a girl, who also survives the ordeal.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]] as [[Addison Montgomery]]\n* [[Tim Daly]] as [[Peter Wilder]]\n* [[Audra McDonald]] as [[Naomi Bennett]]\n* [[Paul Adelstein]] as [[Cooper Freedman]]\n* [[KaDee Strickland]] as [[Charlotte King]]\n* [[Chris Lowell]] as [[William \"Dell\" Parker]]\n* [[Taye Diggs]] as [[Sam Bennett (Private Practice)|Sam Bennett]]\n* [[Amy Brenneman]] as [[Violet Turner]]\n\n===Also starring===\n* [[Brian Benben]] as Sheldon Wallace\n\n===Recurring cast===\n* Geffri Maya as Maya Bennett\n* Hailey Sole as Betsey Parker\n* [[James Morrison (actor)|James Morrison]] as William White, Ryan Leitsch\n* [[Amanda Detmer]] as Morgan Barnes\n* [[Agnes Bruckner]] as Heather\n* [[Amanda Foreman (actress)|Amanda Foreman]] as Katie Kent\n* [[Michael Patrick Thornton]] as Gabriel Fife\n* [[Christina Chang]] as Vanessa Hoyt\n* [[Stephen Lunsford]] as Filmore \"Dink\" Davis\n* [[Stephen Collins (actor)|Stephen Collins]] as \"The Captain\" Montgomery\n* [[Caterina Scorsone]] as [[Amelia Shepherd]]\n* [[Sean Bridgers]] as Frank\n\n===Special guest stars===\n* [[Chandra Wilson]] as [[Miranda Bailey]]\n* [[Eric Dane]] as [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]]\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Bizzy Montgomery\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Corinne, Dink's mother\n\n==Episodes==\n{{See also|List of Private Practice episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#8B008B |overall=5 |season=5 |title=28 |director=14 |writer=25 |airdate=14 |viewers=9 |country=US |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Private Practice (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber=32\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title= A Death in the Family\n |WrittenBy=[[Shonda Rhimes]], [[Jon Cowan]] & [[Robert Rovner]]\n |DirectedBy=[[Mark Tinker]]\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|10|1}}\n |Aux4=11.58<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/10/02/greys-practice-csi-mentalist-all-a-tick-up-in-broadcast-final-leno-show-down-a-tick/29326|title='Greys', 'Practice', 'CSI', 'Mentalist' all a tick up in broadcast finals, 'Leno Show' down a tick|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=October 2, 2009|accessdate=September 13, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005212627/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/10/02/greys-practice-csi-mentalist-all-a-tick-up-in-broadcast-final-leno-show-down-a-tick/29326|archivedate=October 5, 2009}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary=Pete comes home to find Violet on the floor bleeding to death, from Katie attacking her, and that the baby is gone, moments later Naomi arrives and they both call and ambulance and race to save her life.

It is the second largest automobile manufacturer with 16.2% market share as of February 2019 and US$5.5 billion turn-over in India.\n\n[[File:2005 Hyundai Santro Xing.jpg|thumb|[[Hyundai Santro Xing]] (first generation) was manufactured only by Hyundai Motor India Limited.]]\n\nHyundai Motor India Limited was formed on 6 May 1996 by the [[Hyundai Motor Company]] of [[South Korea]]. When Hyundai Motor Company entered the [[Automobile Industry in India|Indian Automobile Market]] in 1996 the ''Hyundai'' brand was almost unknown throughout India. During the entry of Hyundai in 1996, there were only five major automobile manufacturers in India, i.e. [[Maruti Udyog Limited|Maruti]], [[Hindustan Motors|Hindustan]], [[Premier Automobiles Limited|Premier]], [[TATA Motors|Tata]] and [[Mahindra & Mahindra Limited|Mahindra]]. [[Daewoo Motors|Daewoo]] had entered the Indian automobile market with [[Daewoo Cielo#1994.E2.80.931997: Daewoo Cielo|Cielo]] just three years back while [[Ford India Private Limited|Ford]], [[Opel India Private Limited|Opel]] and [[Honda Siel Cars India|Honda]] had entered less than a year back.\n\nFor more than a decade till Hyundai arrived, [[Maruti Suzuki]] had a near [[monopoly]] over the passenger cars segment because [[Tata Motors]] and [[Mahindra & Mahindra]] were solely utility and commercial vehicle manufacturers, while Hindustan and Premier both built outdated and uncompetitive products. The company is looking its future business growth in Mobility and has invested $14 million in Delhi based car rental platform Revv. With this strategic investment in Revv, Hyundai Motor will work to co-develop the company's new growth engine by developing innovative mobility services that combine technologies such as autonomous driving and artificial intelligence with the sharing economy to transform people's lives.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hyundai India 2018 stampsheet.jpg|thumb|2018 stamp sheet dedicated to the 20th anniversary of Hyundai India]]\nHMIL's first car, the [[Hyundai Santro]] was launched on 23 September 1998 and was a runaway success. Within a few months of its inception HMIL became the second largest automobile manufacturer and the largest automobile exporter in India. Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Company (HMC), South Korea and is the largest passenger car exporter and the second largest car manufacturer in India. HMIL presently markets 10 models \u2013 Eon, Grand i10, Xcent, Elite i20, i20 Active, Verna, Creta, Elantra, Tucson, and the newly launched Santro.\n\nHMC has set up a research and development facility (Hyundai Motor India Engineering \u2013 HMIE) in the cyber city of Hyderabad.\n\nAs HMC's global export hub for compact cars, HMIL is the first automotive company in India to achieve the export of 10 lakh cars in just over a decade. HMIL currently exports cars to more than 87 countries across EU, Africa, Middle East, Latin America, Asia and Australia. It has been the number one exporter of passenger cars of the country for the eighth year in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motorbash.com/eight-years-counting-hyundai-india-is-the-top-exporter-of-the-year/|title=Eight Years & Counting, Hyundai India is the \u2018Top Exporter' of the Year|date=26 September 2013|publisher=motorbash.com}}</ref>\n\nTo support its growth and expansion plans, HMIL currently has 493 strong dealer network and more than 1,309 strong service points across India.\n\nIn July 2012, [[Arvind Saxena]], the Director of Marketing and Sales stepped down from the position after serving the company for 7 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.zigwheels.com/news-features/news/arvind-saxena-resigns-from-hyundai/13677/1  | title= Arvind Saxena resigns from Hyundai| date= 23 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2018,Rakesh Srivastava, Director Sales and Marketing at Hyundai India resigned from his position after serving for six years.\n\nOn December 4, 2018: Hyundai Motor India Ltd, announced the top level management changes with immediate effect.

When Hyundai Motor Company entered the [[Automobile Industry in India|Indian automobile market]] in 1996 the Hyundai brand was almost unknown throughout India. During the entry of Hyundai in 1996, there were only five major automobile manufacturers in India, i.e. [[Maruti Udyog Limited|Maruti]], [[Hindustan Motors|Hindustan]], [[Premier Automobiles Limited|Premier]], [[TATA Motors|Tata]] and [[Mahindra & Mahindra Limited|Mahindra]]. [[Daewoo Motors|Daewoo]] had entered the Indian automobile market with [[Daewoo Cielo#1994.E2.80.931997: Daewoo Cielo|Cielo]] just three years back while [[Ford India Private Limited|Ford]], [[Opel India Private Limited|Opel]] and [[Honda Siel Cars India|Honda]] had entered less than a year back.\n\nFor more than a decade till Hyundai arrived, [[Maruti Suzuki]] had a near [[monopoly]] over the passenger cars segment because [[Tata Motors]] and [[Mahindra & Mahindra]] were solely utility and commercial vehicle manufacturers, while Hindustan and Premier both built outdated and uncompetitive products. The company is looking at future business growth in mobility and has invested $14 million in the Delhi based car rental platform Revv.

Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]], a doctor in the city of [[Nagpur]], British India.<ref name=\"Curran1950\">{{cite journal |first=Jean A. |last=Curran |jstor=3023941 |title=The RSS: Militant Hinduism |journal=Far Eastern Survey |volume=19 |pages=93\u201398 |number=10 |date= 17 May 1950 |doi=10.2307/3023941}}</ref>\n\nHedgewar was a political protege of [[B. S. Moonje]], a [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilakite]] [[Indian National Congress|Congressman]], [[Hindu Mahasabha]] politician and social activist from Nagpur.  Moonje had sent Hedgewar to Calcutta to pursue his medical studies and to learn combat techniques from the revolutionary secret societies of the Bengalis.  Hedgewar became a member of the [[Anushilan Samiti]], an anti-British revolutionary group, getting into its inner circle. The secretive methods of these societies were eventually used by him in organising the RSS.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nAfter returning to Nagpur, Hedgewar organised anti-British activities through the ''Kranti Dal'' (Party of Revolution) and participated in independence activist [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]]'s Home Rule campaign in 1918.  According to the official RSS history,{{sfn|Bhishikar|1979}} he came to realise that revolutionary activities alone were not enough to overthrow the British. After reading [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s ''[[Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?|Hindutva]]'', published in Nagpur in 1923, and meeting Savarkar in the [[Ratnagiri]] prison in 1925, Hedgewar was extremely influenced by him, and he founded the RSS with the objective of strengthening the Hindu society.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}\n\n[[File:RSS meeting 1939.jpg|thumb|right|A rare group [[photo]] of six initial ''swayamsevaks'' taken on the occasion of a RSS meeting held in 1939<ref>Krant M.

He recruited energetic Hindu youth with revolutionary fervour, gave them a uniform of a black forage cap, khaki shirt (later white shirt) and khaki shorts\u2014emulating the British police\u2014and taught them paramilitary techniques with ''lathi'' (bamboo staff), sword, javelin, and dagger. Hindu ceremonies and rituals played a large role in the organisation, not so much for religious observance, but to provide awareness of India's glorious past and to bind the members in a religious communion. Hedgewar also held weekly sessions of what he called ''baudhik'' (ideological education), consisting of simple questions to the novices concerning the Hindu nation and its history and heroes, especially warrior king [[Shivaji]]. The saffron flag of Shivaji, the [[Bhagwa Dhwaj]], was used as the emblem for the new organisation. Its public tasks involved protecting Hindu pilgrims at festivals and confronting Muslim resistance against Hindu processions near mosques.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nTwo years into the life of the organisation, in 1927, Hedgewar organised an \"Officers' Training Camp\" with the objective of forming a corps of key workers, whom he called ''pracharaks''. He asked the volunteers to become [[sadhu]]s first, renouncing professional and family lives and dedicating themselves to the cause of the RSS.  According to scholar [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], Hedgewar embraced this doctrine after it had been reinterpreted by nationalists such as [[Aurobindo]]. The tradition of renunciation gave the RSS the character of a 'Hindu sect'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=40\u201341}} Development of the ''shakha'' network of the RSS was the main preoccupation for Hedgewar throughout his career as the RSS chief.  The first ''pracharaks'' were responsible for establishing as many ''shakhas'' as possible, first in Nagpur, then across Maharashtra and eventually in the rest of India. [[Prabhakar Balwant Dani|P. B. Dani]] was sent to establish a ''shakha'' at the [[Benaras Hindu University]] and other universities were similarly targeted to recruit new followers among the student population.  Three ''pracharaks'' went to Punjab: Appaji Joshi to [[Sialkot]], Moreshwar Munje to the [[DAV College]] in [[Rawalpindi]] and Raja Bhau Paturkar to the [[DAV College]] in [[Lahore]].  In 1940, Madhavrao Muley was appointed as the ''prant pracharak'' (regional missionary) in Lahore.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=65\u201367}}\n\n== Motivations ==\nScholars differ on Hedgewar's motivations for forming the RSS, especially because he never involved the RSS in fighting the British rule. Jaffrelot says that the RSS was intended to propagate the ideology of [[Hindutva]] and to provide \"new physical strength\" to the majority community.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot 2010\"/> An alternative interpretation is that he formed it to fight the Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=249}}\n\n=== Tilakite ideology ===\nAfter Tilak's demise in 1920, like other followers of Tilak in Nagpur, Hedgewar was opposed to some of the programmes adopted by Gandhi. Gandhi's stance on the Indian Muslim [[Khilafat Movement|Khilafat issue]] was a cause for concern to Hedgewar, and so was the fact that the 'cow protection' was not on the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] agenda. This led Hedgewar, along with other Tilakities, to part ways with Gandhi. In 1921, Hedgewar delivered a series of lectures in Maharashtra with slogans such as \"Freedom within a year\" and \"boycott\". He deliberately broke the law, for which he was imprisoned for a year. After being released in 1922, Hedgewar was distressed at the lack of organisation among the Congress volunteers for the independence struggle. Without proper mobilisation and organisation, he felt that the patriotic youth of India could never get independence for the country. Subsequently, he felt the need to create an independent organisation that was based on the country's traditions and history.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\n=== Hindu-Muslim relations ===\nThe decade of 1920s witnessed a significant deterioration in the relations between Hindus and Muslims.  The Muslim masses were mobilised by the [[Khilafat movement]], demanding the reinstatement of the Caliphate in Turkey, and [[Gandhi]] made an alliance with it for conducting his own [[Non-co-operation movement]]. Gandhi aimed to create [[Hindu-Muslim unity]] in forming the alliance. However, the alliance saw a \"common enemy\", not a \"common enmity\".<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001|p=27}}. Quote: '... mobilizaiton of Indian Muslims in the name of Islam and in defense of the Ottoman ''khalifa'' was inherently \"communal\", no less than the Islamic movements of opposition to British imperialism which preceded it.... All defined a Hindu no less than a British \"other\".'</ref> When Gandhi called off the Non-co-operation movement due to outbreaks of violence, Muslims disagreed with his strategy. Once the movements failed, the mobilised Muslims turned their anger towards Hindus.<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001}}; {{harvp|Misra, Identity and Religion: Foundations of Anti-Islamism in India|2004}}</ref> The first major incident of religious violence was reportedly the [[Moplah rebellion]] in August 1921, it was widely narrated that the rebellion ended in large-scale violence against Hindu in [[Malabar region|Malabar]].  A cycle of inter-communal violence throughout India followed for several years.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=19\u201320}} In 1923, there were riots in Nagpur, called \"Muslim riots\" by Hedgewar, where Hindus were felt to be \"totally disorganized and panicky.\" These incidents made a major impression on Hedgewar and convinced him of the need to organise the Hindu society.{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|p=34}}\n\nAfter acquiring about 100 ''swayamsevaks'' (volunteers) to the RSS in 1927, Hedgewar took the issue to the Muslim domain. He led the Hindu religious procession for [[Ganesha]], beating the drums in defiance of the usual practice not to pass in front of a mosque with music.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=40}} On the day of [[Lakshmi Puja]] on 4 September, Muslims are said to have retaliated.  When the Hindu procession reached a mosque in the Mahal area of Nagpur, Muslims blocked it. Later in the afternoon, they attacked the Hindu residences in the Mahal area. It is said that the RSS cadres were prepared for the attack and beat the Muslim rioters back. [[1927 Nagpur riots|Riots]] continued for 3 days and the army had to be called in to quell the violence. RSS organised the Hindu resistance and protected the Hindu households while the Muslim households had to leave Nagpur ''en masse'' for safety.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=250}}{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Frykenberg|1996|p=241}} Tapan Basu et al. note the accounts of \"Muslim aggressiveness\" and the \"Hindu self-defence\" in the RSS descriptions of the incident. The above incident vastly enhanced the prestige of the RSS and enabled its subsequent expansion.{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n=== Stigmatisation and emulation ===\n[[Christophe Jaffrelot]] points out the theme of \"stigmatisation and emulation\" in the ideology of the RSS along with other Hindu nationalist movements such as the [[Arya Samaj]] and the Hindu Mahasabha.  Muslims, Christians and the British were thought of as \"foreign bodies\" implanted in the Hindu nation, who were able to exploit the disunity and absence of valour among the Hindus in order to subdue them. The solution lay in emulating the characteristics of these \"Threatening Others\" that were perceived to give them strength, such as paramilitary organisation, emphasis on unity and nationalism. The Hindu nationalists combined these emulatory aspects with a selective borrowing of traditions from the Hindu past to achieve a synthesis that was uniquely Indian and Hindu.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n=== Hindu Mahasabha influence ===\nThe [[Hindu Mahasabha]], which was initially a special interest group within the [[Indian National Congress]] and later an independent party, was an important influence on the RSS, even though it is rarely acknowledged. In 1923, prominent Hindu leaders like [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] met together on this platform and voiced their concerns on the 'division in the Hindu community'. In his presidential speech to Mahasabha, Malaviya stated: \"Friendship could exist between equals. If the Hindus made themselves strong and the rowdy section among the Mahomedans were convinced they could not safely rob and dishonour Hindus, unity would be established on a stable basis.\" He wanted the activists 'to educate all boys and girls, establish ''akharas'' (gymnasiums), establish a volunteer corps to persuade people to comply with decisions of the Hindu Mahasabha, to accept untouchables as Hindus and grant them the right to use wells, enter temples, get an education.' Later, Hindu Mahasabha leader [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s 'Hindutva' ideology also had a profound impact on Hedgewar's thinking about the 'Hindu nation'.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\nThe initial meeting for the formation of the Sangh on the [[Vijaya Dashami]] day of 1925 was held between Hedgewar and four Hindu Mahasabha leaders: [[B. S. Moonje]], [[Ganesh Savarkar]], [[L. V. Paranjpe]] and B. B. Tholkar. RSS took part as a volunteer force in organising the Hindu Mahasabha annual meeting in Akola in 1931.  Moonje remained a patron of the RSS throughout his life.  Both he and Ganesh Savarkar worked to spread the RSS ''shakhas'' in Maharashtra, Panjab, Delhi, and the princely states by initiating contacts with local leaders.  Savarkar merged his own youth organisation ''Tarun Hindu Sabha'' with the RSS and helped its expansion. V. D. Savarkar, after his release in 1937, joined them in spreading the RSS and giving speeches in its support.  Officials in the Home Department called the RSS the \"volunteer organisation of the Hindu Mahasabha.\"{{sfn|Bapu|2013|pp=97\u2013100}}{{sfn|Goyal|1979|pp=59\u201376}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Indian Independence Movement===\nAfter the formation of the RSS, which portrays itself as a social movement, Hedgewar kept the organisation from having any direct affiliation with the political organisations then fighting British rule.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|title=RSS aims for a Hindu nation|date=10 March 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011631/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|archive-date=24 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> RSS rejected Gandhi's willingness to co-operate with the Muslims.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008|p=156}}{{sfn|Bhatt, Hindu Nationalism|2001|p=115}}\n\nIn accordance with Hedgewar's tradition of keeping the RSS away from the Indian Independence movement, any political activity that could be construed as being anti-British was carefully avoided.

It stated:{{Quote|Even though Dr. Ambedkar is reported to have recently stated in [[Bombay]] that the days of Manu have ended it is nevertheless a fact that the daily lives of Hindus are even at present-day affected by the principles and injunctions contained in the ''Manusmrithi'' and other ''[[Smriti]]s''.

Accordingly, the [[Kapur Commission|Justice Kapur Commission]]<ref name=\"kapoor\">{{cite book|title=Report of Commission of Inquiry into Conspiracy to murder Mahatma Gandhi, By India (Republic).

Following his release in August 1948, Golwalkar wrote to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to lift the ban on RSS. After Nehru replied that the matter was the responsibility of the Home Minister, Golwalkar consulted Vallabhai Patel regarding the same.

Later, a constitution was drafted for RSS, which, however, initially did not meet any of Patel's demands. After a failed attempt to agitate again, eventually the RSS's constitution was amended according to Patel's wishes with the exception of the procedure for selecting the head of the organisation and the enrolment of pre-adolescents. However, the organisation's internal democracy which was written into its constitution, remained a 'dead letter'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=89}}\n\nOn 11 July 1949 the Government of India lifted the ban on the RSS by issuing a communique stating that the decision to lift the ban on the RSS had been taken in view of the RSS leader Golwalkar's undertaking to make the group's loyalty towards the Constitution of India and acceptance and respect towards the National Flag of India more explicit in the Constitution of the RSS, which was to be worked out in a democratic manner.<ref name=\"Curran1950\"/><ref name=\"Noorani2000\" />\n\n===Decolonisation of Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Goa===\n\nAfter India had achieved independence, the RSS was one of the socio-political organisations that supported and participated in movements to decolonise [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], which at that time was ruled by Portugal. In early 1954 volunteers Raja Wakankar and Nana Kajrekar of the RSS visited the area round about Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Daman several times to study the topography and get acquainted with locals who wanted the area to change from being a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] to being an [[States and Territories of India|Indian union territory]]. In April 1954 the RSS formed a coalition with the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO) and the Azad Gomantak Dal (AGD) for the annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli into the Republic of India.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\">Purushottam Shripad Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, published by Usha P. Lele, 1987</ref> On the night of 21 July, United Front of Goans, a group working independently of the coalition, captured the Portuguese police station at Dadra and declared Dadra independent. Subsequently, on 28 July, volunteer teams from the RSS and AGD captured the territories of Naroli and Phiparia and ultimately the capital of [[Silvassa]]. The Portuguese forces that had escaped and moved towards Nagar Haveli, were assaulted at Khandvel and forced to retreat until they surrendered to the Indian border police at Udava on 11 August 1954. A native administration was set up with Appasaheb Karmalkar of the NMLO as the Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli on 11 August 1954.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\" />\n\nThe capture of Dadra and Nagar Haveli gave a boost to the movement against Portuguese colonial rule in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\"/> In 1955 RSS leaders demanded the end of Portuguese rule in Goa and its integration into India. When Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused to provide an armed intervention, RSS leader Jagannath Rao Joshi led the Satyagraha agitation straight into Goa. He was imprisoned with his followers by the Portuguese police. The nonviolent protests continued but met with repression. On 15 August 1955, the Portuguese police opened fire on the ''satyagrahis'', killing thirty or so civilians.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=130}}\n\nGoa was later [[Annexation of Goa|annexed into the Indian union]] in 1961 through an army operation, codenamed '[[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]]', that was carried out by the Nehru government.\n\n===War-time activities===\nAfter the declaration of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Bangladesh War of Independence]] by [[Indira Gandhi]], RSS provided support to the government, by offering its services to maintain law and order in Delhi and its volunteers were apparently the first to donate blood.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=243}}\n\n===Movement against the Emergency===\nIn 1975 the Indira Gandhi government proclaimed [[The Emergency (India)|emergency rule in India]], thereby suspending [[fundamental rights (India)|fundamental rights]] and curtailing the [[freedom of the press]].<ref name=emma>Emma Tarlo, ''Unsettling Memories: Narratives of India's \"emergency\"'', Published by Orient Blackswan, 2003, {{ISBN|81-7824-066-1}}, {{ISBN|978-81-7824-066-4}}</ref> This action was taken after the Supreme Court of India cancelled her election to the Indian Parliament on charges of [[malpractice]]s in the election.<ref name=emma/> Democratic institutions were suspended and prominent opposition leaders, including Gandhian [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], were arrested whilst thousands of people were detained without any charges taken up against them.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008}} RSS, which was seen as being close to opposition leaders, and with its large organisational base was seen to have the capability of organising protests against the government, was also banned.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=297}}\n\nDeoras, the then chief of RSS, wrote letters to Indira Gandhi, promising her to extend the organisation's co-operation in return for the lifting of the ban, asserting that RSS had no connection with the [[Bihar Movement|movement in Bihar]] and [[Navnirman Andolan|that in Gujarat]].

When Golwalkar wrote to Nehru asking for the lifting of the ban on RSS after Gandhi's assassination, Nehru replied that the government had proof that RSS activities were 'anti-national' by virtue of being 'communalist'. In his letter to the heads of provincial governments in December 1947, Nehru wrote that \"we have a great deal of evidence to show that RSS is an organisation which is in the nature of a private army and which is definitely proceeding on the strictest Nazi lines, even following the techniques of the organisation\".{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=87, 88}}\n\nSardar [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Vallabhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, said in early January 1948 that the RSS activists were \"patriots who love their country\". He asked the Congressmen to 'win over' the RSS by love, instead of trying to 'crush' them. He also appealed to the RSS to join the Congress instead of opposing it. Jaffrelot says that this attitude of Patel can be partly explained by the assistance the RSS gave the Indian administration in maintaining public order in September 1947, and that his expression of 'qualified sympathy' towards RSS reflected the long-standing inclination of several Hindu traditionalists in Congress. However, after Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948, Patel began to view that the activities of RSS were a danger to public security.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=86-}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=12}} In his reply letter to Golwalkar on 11 September 1948 regarding the lifting of ban on RSS, Patel stated that though RSS did service to the Hindu society by helping and protecting the Hindus when in need during partition violence, they also began attacking Muslims with revenge and went against \"innocent men, women and children\". He said that the speeches of RSS were \"full of communal poison\", and as a result of that 'poison', he remarked, India had to lose Gandhi, noting that the RSS men had celebrated Gandhi's death. Patel was also apprehensive of the secrecy in the working manner of RSS, and complained that all of its provincial heads were Maratha Brahmins. He criticised the RSS for having its own army inside India, which he said, cannot be permitted as \"it was a potential danger to the State\". He also remarked: \"The members of RSS claimed to be the defenders of Hinduism. But they must understand that Hinduism would not be saved by rowdyism.\"{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=82}}\n\n[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first President of India, did not approve of RSS. In 1948, he criticised RSS for carrying out 'loot, arson, rioting and killing of Muslims' in Delhi and other Hindu majority areas. In his letter to home minister Patel on 14 May 1948, he stated that RSS men had planned to dress up as Muslims in Hindu majority areas and attack Muslims in Muslim majority areas to create trouble. He asked Patel to take strict action against RSS for aiming to create enmity among Hindus and Muslims. He called RSS a [[Maharashtrian Brahmin]] movement, and viewed it as a secret organisation which used violence and promoted fascism, without any regard to truthful means and constitutional methods. He stated that RSS was \"definitely a menace to public peace\".{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=113}}\n\nField Marshal [[K. M.

of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as the revitalisation of the Indian value system based on universalism and peace and prosperity to all.<ref name=\"bunch\">M S Golwalkar, Bunch of Thoughts, Publishers: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana</ref> [[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]], the worldview that the whole world is one family, propounded by the ancient thinkers of India, is considered as one of the ideologies of the organisation.<ref name=\"sheshadri\">H.

Hence, the focus is on social reform, economic upliftment of the downtrodden, and the protection of the cultural diversity of the natives in India.<ref name=\"sheshadri\" /> The organisation says it aspires to unite all Hindus and build a strong India that can contribute to the welfare of the world. In the words of RSS ideologue and the second head of the RSS, Golwalkar, \"in order to be able to contribute our unique knowledge to mankind, in order to be able to live and strive for the unity and welfare of the world, we stand before the world as a self-confident, resurgent and mighty nation\".<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n\nIn ''Vichardhara'' (ideology), Golwalkar affirms the RSS mission of integration as:<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n{{Quote|RSS has been making determined efforts to inculcate in our people the burning devotion for Bharat and its national ethos; kindle in them the spirit of dedication and sterling qualities and character; rouse social consciousness, mutual good-will, love and cooperation among them all; to make them realise that casts, creeds, and languages are secondary and that service to the nation is the supreme end and to mold their behaviour accordingly; instill in them a sense of true humility and discipline and train their bodies to be strong and robust so as to shoulder any social responsibility; and thus to create all-round Anushasana (Discipline) in all walks of life and build together all our people into a unified harmonious national whole, extending from Himalayas to Kanyakumari.|[[M.

The movement considers Hindus as inclusive of Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, tribals, untouchables, Veerashaivism, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, and other groups as a community, a view similar to the inclusive referencing of the term Hindu in the Indian Constitution Article 25 (2)(b).<ref>Martin E.

G.|year=2000|isbn=9788187496137|location=New Delhi|pages=99}}</ref>\n\n=== Involvement in politics ===\nSeveral Sangh Parivar politicians such as [[Balraj Madhok]] in the 1960s and 1970s to the [[BJP]] leaders like [[L. K. Advani]] have complained about the RSS's interference in party politics. Though some former Hindu nationalists believed that Sangh should take part in politics, they failed to draw the RSS, which was intended to be a purely cultural movement, into the political arena until the 1950s. Savarkar tried to convince Hedgewar and later Golwalkar, to tie up with Hindu Mahasabha, but failed to do so.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nUnder pressure from other ''swayamsevaks'', Golwalkar gradually changed his mind after independence under unusual circumstances during the ban on RSS in 1948 after the assassination of Gandhi. After the first wave of arrests of RSS activists at that time, some of its members who had gone underground recommended that their movement be involved in politics, seeing that no political force was present to advocate the cause of RSS in parliament or anywhere else. One such member who significantly suggested this cause was [[K. R. Malkani]], who wrote in 1949:{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n{{quote|Sangh must take part in politics not only to protect itself against the greedy design of politicians, but to stop the un-Bharatiya and anti-Bharatiya policies of the Government and to advance and expedite the cause of Bharatiya through state machinery side by side with official effort in the same direction. ... Sangh must continue as it is, an ''ashram'' for the national cultural education of the entire citizenry, but it must develop a political wing for the more effective and early achievement of its ideals.}}\n\nGolwalkar approved of Malkani's and others' views regarding the formation of a new party in 1950. Jaffrelot says that the death of Sardar Patel influenced this change since Golwalkar opined that Patel could have transformed the Congress party by emphasising its affinities with Hindu nationalism, while after Patel, Nehru became strong enough to impose his 'anti-communal' line within his party. Accordingly, Golwalkar met [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]] and agreed for endorsing senior ''swayamsevaks'', who included [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]], Balraj Madhok and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], to the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], a newly formed political party by Mukherjee. These men, who took their orders in Nagpur, captured power in the party after Mukherjee's death.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n[[Balasaheb Deoras]], who succeeded Golwalkar as the chief of RSS, got very much involved in politics. In 1965, when he was the general secretary of the RSS, he addressed the annual meeting of Jana Sangh, which is seen as an \"unprecedented move\" by an RSS dignitary that reflected his strong interest in politics and his will to make the movement play a larger part in the public sphere. Jaffrelot says that he exemplified the specific kind of swayamsevaks known as 'activists', giving expression to his leanings towards political activism by having the RSS support the [[Bihar Movement|JP Movement]].{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The importance that RSS began to give to the electoral politics is demonstrated when its units (''shakhas'') were made constituency-based in the early 1970s, from which the RSS shakhas began to involve directly in elections, not only of legislatures, but also of trade unions, student and cultural organisations.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}}\n\nAs soon as the RSS men took over the Jana Sangh party, the Hindu traditionalists who previously joined the party because of S. P. Mukherjee were sidelined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Your explanation here}} The organisation of the party was restructured and all its organisational secretaries, who were the pillars of the party, came from the RSS, both at the district and state level. The party also took the vision of RSS in its mission, where its ultimate objective, in the long run, was the reform of society, but not the conquest of power, since the 'state' was not viewed as a prominent institution. Hence the Jana Sangh initially remained reluctant to join any alliance that was not fully in harmony with its ideology. In 1962, Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was the party's chief, explained this approach by saying that \"coalitions were bound to degenerate into a struggle for power by opportunist elements coming together in the interest of expediency\". He wanted to build the party as an alternative party to the Congress and saw the elections as an \"opportunity to educate the people on political issues and to challenge the right of the Congress to be in power\". Jaffrelot says that this indifferent approach of party politics was in accordance with its lack of interest in the 'state' and the wish to make it weaker, or more decentralised.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} After India's defeat in the [[Sino-Indian War|1962 Sino\u2013Indian war]], the RSS and other right-wing forces in India were strengthened since the leftist and centrist opinions, sometimes even Nehru himself, could then be blamed for being 'soft' towards China. The RSS and Jana Sangh also took complete advantage of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war with Pakistan]] to \"deepen suspicion about Muslims\", and also en-cashed the growing unpopularity of Congress, particularly in the [[Hindi Belt|Hindi-belt]], where a left-wing alternative was weak or non-existent.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were banning [[Cattle slaughter in India|cow slaughter]], abolishing the [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special status given to Jammu and Kashmir]], and legislating a [[uniform civil code]]. Explaining the Jana Sangh's failure to become a major political force despite claiming to represent the national interests of the Hindus, scholar Bruce Desmond Graham states that the party's close initial ties with the Hindi-belt and its preoccupation with the issues of North India such as promotion of Hindi, energetic resistance to Pakistan etc., had become a serious disadvantage to the party in the long run. He also adds that its interpretation of Hinduism was \"restrictive and exclusive\", arguing that \"its doctrines were inspired by an activist version of Hindu nationalism and, indirectly, by the values of [[Brahmanism]] rather than the devotional and quietist values of popular Hinduism.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=253}} Desmond says that, if the Jana Sangh had carefully moderated its Hindu nationalism, it could have been able to well-exploit any strong increase in support for the traditional and nationalist Hindu opinion, and hence to compete on equal terms with the Congress in the northern states. He also remarks that if it had adopted a less harsh attitude towards Pakistan and Muslims, \"it would have been much more acceptable to Hindu traditionalists in the central and southern states, where partition had left fewer emotional scars.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Jana Sangh started making alliances by entering the anti-Congress coalitions since 1960s. It became part of the 1971 Grand Alliance and finally merged itself with the [[Janata Party]] in 1977.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The success of Janata Party in [[1977 Indian general election|1977 elections]] made the RSS members central ministers for the first time (Vajpayee, Advani and [[Brij Lal Verma]]),{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} and provided the RSS with an opportunity to avail the state and its instruments to further its ends, through the resources of various state governments as well as the central government.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8v7Vr2iQUHkC&pg=PA240|title=India Since Independence: Making Sense of Indian Politics|last=Krishna|first=Ananth V.|publisher=Pearson Education India|year=2011|isbn=9788131734650|pages=240|language=en}}</ref> However, this merge, which was seen as a dilution of its original doctrine, was viewed by the ex-Jana Sanghis as submersion of their initial identity. Meanwhile, the other components of the Janata Party denounced the allegiance the ex-Jana Sanghis continued to pay to the RSS. This led to a 'dual membership' controversy, regarding the links the former Jana Sangh members were retaining with the RSS, and it led to the split of Janata Party in 1979.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nThe former Jana Sangh elements formed a new party, [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), in 1980. However, BJP originated more as a successor to the Janata Party and did not return to the beginning stages of the Hindu nationalist identity and Jana Sangh doctrines. The RSS resented this dilution of ideology \u2013 the new slogans promoted by the then BJP president Vajpayee like 'Gandhian socialism' and 'positive secularism'. By early 1980s, RSS is said to have established its political strategy of \"never keeping all its eggs in one basket\". It even decided to support Congress in some states, for instance, to create the [[Hindu Munnani]] in Tamil Nadu in the backdrop of the [[1981 Meenakshipuram conversion|1981 Meenakshipuram mass conversion to Islam]], and to support one of its offshoots, [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), to launch an enthno-religious movement on the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. BJP did not have much electoral success in its initial years and was able to win only two seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|1984 elections]]. After L. K. Advani replaced Vajpayee as party president in 1986, the BJP also began to rally around the Ayodhya campaign. In 1990, the party organised the ''[[Ram Rath Yatra]]'' to advance this campaign in large-scale.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} Advani also attacked the then ruling Congress party with the slogans such as '[[pseudo-secularism]]', accusing Congress of misusing secularism for the political appeasement of minorities, and established an explicit and unambiguous path of Hindu revival.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 'instrumentalisation' of the Ayodhya issue and the related communal riots which polarised the electorate along religious lines helped the BJP make good progress in the subsequent elections of [[1989 Indian general election|1989]], [[1991 Indian general election|1991]] and [[1996 Indian general election|1996]]. However, in the mid-1990s, BJP adopted a more moderate approach to politics in order to make allies. As Jaffrelot remarks, it was because the party realised during then that it would not be in a position to form the government on its own in the near future. In 1998, it built a major coalition, [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), in the Lok Sabha and succeeded in the [[1998 Indian general election|general election in 1998]], and was able to succeed again in the [[1999 Indian general election|mid-term elections of 1999]], with Vajpayee as their Prime Ministerial candidate. Though the RSS and other Sangh Parivar components appreciated some of the steps taken by the Vajpayee government, like the [[Pokhran-II|testing of a nuclear bomb]], they felt disappointed with the government's overall performance. The fact that no solid step was taken towards building the [[Rama|Ram]] temple in Ayodhya was resented by the VHP. The [[Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee#Economic policy|liberalisation policy of the government]] faced objection from the [[Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh]], a trade union controlled by the RSS. Jaffrelot says, RSS and the other Sangh Parivar elements had come to the view that the \"BJP leaders had been victims of their thirst for power: they had preferred to compromise to remain in office instead of sticking to their principles.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175-179}}\n\nAfter the end of Vajpayee's tenure in 2004, BJP remained as a major opposition party in the subsequent years; and again in the year 2014, the NDA came to power after BJP gained an overwhelming majority in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general elections]], with [[Narendra Modi]], a former RSS member who previously served as Gujarat's chief minister for three tenures, as their prime ministerial candidate.

B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]]]]\nRSS was founded in 1925 by [[K. B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]], a doctor in the city of [[Nagpur]], British India.<ref name=\"Curran1950\">{{cite journal |first=Jean A. |last=Curran |jstor=3023941 |title=The RSS: Militant Hinduism |journal=Far Eastern Survey |volume=19 |pages=93\u201398 |number=10 |date= 17 May 1950 |doi=10.2307/3023941}}</ref>\n\nHedgewar was a political protege of [[B. S. Moonje]], a [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilakite]] [[Indian National Congress|Congressman]], [[Hindu Mahasabha]] politician and social activist from Nagpur.  Moonje had sent Hedgewar to Calcutta to pursue his medical studies and to learn combat techniques from the revolutionary secret societies of the Bengalis.  Hedgewar became a member of the [[Anushilan Samiti]], an anti-British revolutionary group, getting into its inner circle. The secretive methods of these societies were eventually used by him in organising the RSS.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nAfter returning to Nagpur, Hedgewar organised anti-British activities through the ''Kranti Dal'' (Party of Revolution) and participated in independence activist [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]]'s Home Rule campaign in 1918.  According to the official RSS history,{{sfn|Bhishikar|1979}} he came to realise that revolutionary activities alone were not enough to overthrow the British. After reading [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s ''[[Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?|Hindutva]]'', published in Nagpur in 1923, and meeting Savarkar in the [[Ratnagiri]] prison in 1925, Hedgewar was extremely influenced by him, and he founded the RSS with the objective of strengthening the Hindu society.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}\n\n[[File:RSS meeting 1939.jpg|thumb|right|A rare group [[photo]] of six initial ''swayamsevaks'' taken on the occasion of a RSS meeting held in 1939<ref>Krant M. L. Verma ''Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas'' (Vol{{nbsp}}3) p.{{nbsp}}854 (Dr.{{nbsp}}Hedgewar with five other ''swayamsevaks'' who established RSS in 1925)</ref>]]\nHedgewar believed that a handful of British were able to rule over the vast country of India because Hindus were disunited, lacked valour (''pararkram'') and lacked a civic character.  He recruited energetic Hindu youth with revolutionary fervour, gave them a uniform of a black forage cap, khaki shirt (later white shirt) and khaki shorts\u2014emulating the British police\u2014and taught them paramilitary techniques with ''lathi'' (bamboo staff), sword, javelin, and dagger. Hindu ceremonies and rituals played a large role in the organisation, not so much for religious observance, but to provide awareness of India's glorious past and to bind the members in a religious communion. Hedgewar also held weekly sessions of what he called ''baudhik'' (ideological education), consisting of simple questions to the novices concerning the Hindu nation and its history and heroes, especially warrior king [[Shivaji]]. The saffron flag of Shivaji, the [[Bhagwa Dhwaj]], was used as the emblem for the new organisation. Its public tasks involved protecting Hindu pilgrims at festivals and confronting Muslim resistance against Hindu processions near mosques.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nTwo years into the life of the organisation, in 1927, Hedgewar organised an \"Officers' Training Camp\" with the objective of forming a corps of key workers, whom he called ''pracharaks''. He asked the volunteers to become [[sadhu]]s first, renouncing professional and family lives and dedicating themselves to the cause of the RSS.  According to scholar [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], Hedgewar embraced this doctrine after it had been reinterpreted by nationalists such as [[Aurobindo]]. The tradition of renunciation gave the RSS the character of a 'Hindu sect'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=40\u201341}} Development of the ''shakha'' network of the RSS was the main preoccupation for Hedgewar throughout his career as the RSS chief.  The first ''pracharaks'' were responsible for establishing as many ''shakhas'' as possible, first in Nagpur, then across Maharashtra and eventually in the rest of India. [[Prabhakar Balwant Dani|P. B. Dani]] was sent to establish a ''shakha'' at the [[Benaras Hindu University]] and other universities were similarly targeted to recruit new followers among the student population.  Three ''pracharaks'' went to Punjab: Appaji Joshi to [[Sialkot]], Moreshwar Munje to the [[DAV College]] in [[Rawalpindi]] and Raja Bhau Paturkar to the [[DAV College]] in [[Lahore]].  In 1940, Madhavrao Muley was appointed as the ''prant pracharak'' (regional missionary) in Lahore.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=65\u201367}}\n\n== Motivations ==\nScholars differ on Hedgewar's motivations for forming the RSS, especially because he never involved the RSS in fighting the British rule. Jaffrelot says that the RSS was intended to propagate the ideology of [[Hindutva]] and to provide \"new physical strength\" to the majority community.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot 2010\"/> An alternative interpretation is that he formed it to fight the Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=249}}\n\n=== Tilakite ideology ===\nAfter Tilak's demise in 1920, like other followers of Tilak in Nagpur, Hedgewar was opposed to some of the programmes adopted by Gandhi. Gandhi's stance on the Indian Muslim [[Khilafat Movement|Khilafat issue]] was a cause for concern to Hedgewar, and so was the fact that the 'cow protection' was not on the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] agenda. This led Hedgewar, along with other Tilakities, to part ways with Gandhi. In 1921, Hedgewar delivered a series of lectures in Maharashtra with slogans such as \"Freedom within a year\" and \"boycott\". He deliberately broke the law, for which he was imprisoned for a year. After being released in 1922, Hedgewar was distressed at the lack of organisation among the Congress volunteers for the independence struggle. Without proper mobilisation and organisation, he felt that the patriotic youth of India could never get independence for the country. Subsequently, he felt the need to create an independent organisation that was based on the country's traditions and history.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\n=== Hindu-Muslim relations ===\nThe decade of 1920s witnessed a significant deterioration in the relations between Hindus and Muslims.  The Muslim masses were mobilised by the [[Khilafat movement]], demanding the reinstatement of the Caliphate in Turkey, and [[Gandhi]] made an alliance with it for conducting his own [[Non-co-operation movement]]. Gandhi aimed to create [[Hindu-Muslim unity]] in forming the alliance. However, the alliance saw a \"common enemy\", not a \"common enmity\".<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001|p=27}}. Quote: '... mobilizaiton of Indian Muslims in the name of Islam and in defense of the Ottoman ''khalifa'' was inherently \"communal\", no less than the Islamic movements of opposition to British imperialism which preceded it.... All defined a Hindu no less than a British \"other\".'</ref> When Gandhi called off the Non-co-operation movement due to outbreaks of violence, Muslims disagreed with his strategy. Once the movements failed, the mobilised Muslims turned their anger towards Hindus.<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001}}; {{harvp|Misra, Identity and Religion: Foundations of Anti-Islamism in India|2004}}</ref> The first major incident of religious violence was reportedly the [[Moplah rebellion]] in August 1921, it was widely narrated that the rebellion ended in large-scale violence against Hindu in [[Malabar region|Malabar]].  A cycle of inter-communal violence throughout India followed for several years.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=19\u201320}} In 1923, there were riots in Nagpur, called \"Muslim riots\" by Hedgewar, where Hindus were felt to be \"totally disorganized and panicky.\" These incidents made a major impression on Hedgewar and convinced him of the need to organise the Hindu society.{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|p=34}}\n\nAfter acquiring about 100 ''swayamsevaks'' (volunteers) to the RSS in 1927, Hedgewar took the issue to the Muslim domain. He led the Hindu religious procession for [[Ganesha]], beating the drums in defiance of the usual practice not to pass in front of a mosque with music.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=40}} On the day of [[Lakshmi Puja]] on 4 September, Muslims are said to have retaliated.  When the Hindu procession reached a mosque in the Mahal area of Nagpur, Muslims blocked it. Later in the afternoon, they attacked the Hindu residences in the Mahal area. It is said that the RSS cadres were prepared for the attack and beat the Muslim rioters back. [[1927 Nagpur riots|Riots]] continued for 3 days and the army had to be called in to quell the violence. RSS organised the Hindu resistance and protected the Hindu households while the Muslim households had to leave Nagpur ''en masse'' for safety.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=250}}{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Frykenberg|1996|p=241}} Tapan Basu et al. note the accounts of \"Muslim aggressiveness\" and the \"Hindu self-defence\" in the RSS descriptions of the incident. The above incident vastly enhanced the prestige of the RSS and enabled its subsequent expansion.{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n=== Stigmatisation and emulation ===\n[[Christophe Jaffrelot]] points out the theme of \"stigmatisation and emulation\" in the ideology of the RSS along with other Hindu nationalist movements such as the [[Arya Samaj]] and the Hindu Mahasabha.  Muslims, Christians and the British were thought of as \"foreign bodies\" implanted in the Hindu nation, who were able to exploit the disunity and absence of valour among the Hindus in order to subdue them. The solution lay in emulating the characteristics of these \"Threatening Others\" that were perceived to give them strength, such as paramilitary organisation, emphasis on unity and nationalism. The Hindu nationalists combined these emulatory aspects with a selective borrowing of traditions from the Hindu past to achieve a synthesis that was uniquely Indian and Hindu.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n=== Hindu Mahasabha influence ===\nThe [[Hindu Mahasabha]], which was initially a special interest group within the [[Indian National Congress]] and later an independent party, was an important influence on the RSS, even though it is rarely acknowledged. In 1923, prominent Hindu leaders like [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] met together on this platform and voiced their concerns on the 'division in the Hindu community'. In his presidential speech to Mahasabha, Malaviya stated: \"Friendship could exist between equals. If the Hindus made themselves strong and the rowdy section among the Mahomedans were convinced they could not safely rob and dishonour Hindus, unity would be established on a stable basis.\" He wanted the activists 'to educate all boys and girls, establish ''akharas'' (gymnasiums), establish a volunteer corps to persuade people to comply with decisions of the Hindu Mahasabha, to accept untouchables as Hindus and grant them the right to use wells, enter temples, get an education.' Later, Hindu Mahasabha leader [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s 'Hindutva' ideology also had a profound impact on Hedgewar's thinking about the 'Hindu nation'.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\nThe initial meeting for the formation of the Sangh on the [[Vijaya Dashami]] day of 1925 was held between Hedgewar and four Hindu Mahasabha leaders: [[B. S. Moonje]], [[Ganesh Savarkar]], [[L. V. Paranjpe]] and B. B. Tholkar. RSS took part as a volunteer force in organising the Hindu Mahasabha annual meeting in Akola in 1931.  Moonje remained a patron of the RSS throughout his life.  Both he and Ganesh Savarkar worked to spread the RSS ''shakhas'' in Maharashtra, Panjab, Delhi, and the princely states by initiating contacts with local leaders.  Savarkar merged his own youth organisation ''Tarun Hindu Sabha'' with the RSS and helped its expansion. V. D. Savarkar, after his release in 1937, joined them in spreading the RSS and giving speeches in its support.  Officials in the Home Department called the RSS the \"volunteer organisation of the Hindu Mahasabha.\"{{sfn|Bapu|2013|pp=97\u2013100}}{{sfn|Goyal|1979|pp=59\u201376}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Indian Independence Movement===\nAfter the formation of the RSS, which portrays itself as a social movement, Hedgewar kept the organisation from having any direct affiliation with the political organisations then fighting British rule.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|title=RSS aims for a Hindu nation|date=10 March 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011631/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|archive-date=24 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> RSS rejected Gandhi's willingness to co-operate with the Muslims.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008|p=156}}{{sfn|Bhatt, Hindu Nationalism|2001|p=115}}\n\nIn accordance with Hedgewar's tradition of keeping the RSS away from the Indian Independence movement, any political activity that could be construed as being anti-British was carefully avoided.

Patel then demanded an absolute pre-condition that the RSS adopt a formal written constitution<ref name=\"PLJ100\">{{cite book |last1=Panicker |first1=P L John |title=Gandhian approach to communalism in contemporary India |page=100 |url=https://sg.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/7178/9/09_chapter%202.pdf#page=79 |accessdate=6 November 2019}}</ref> and make it public, where Patel expected RSS to pledge its loyalty to the [[Constitution of India]], accept the Tricolor as the [[National Flag]] of India, define the power of the head of the organisation, make the organisation democratic by holding internal elections, authorisation of their parents before enrolling the pre-adolescents into the movement, and to renounce violence and secrecy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=88, 89}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=14}}<ref name=\"Noorani2000\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PnBFW7cdtsC&pg=PT42|title=The RSS and the BJP: A Division of Labour|author=Abdul Gafoor Abdul Majeed Noorani|publisher=LeftWord Books|year=2000|isbn=978-81-87496-13-7}}</ref>{{rp|42\u2013}} Golwalkar launched a huge agitation against this demand during which he was imprisoned again. Later, a constitution was drafted for RSS, which, however, initially did not meet any of Patel's demands. After a failed attempt to agitate again, eventually the RSS's constitution was amended according to Patel's wishes with the exception of the procedure for selecting the head of the organisation and the enrolment of pre-adolescents. However, the organisation's internal democracy which was written into its constitution, remained a 'dead letter'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=89}}\n\nOn 11 July 1949 the Government of India lifted the ban on the RSS by issuing a communique stating that the decision to lift the ban on the RSS had been taken in view of the RSS leader Golwalkar's undertaking to make the group's loyalty towards the Constitution of India and acceptance and respect towards the National Flag of India more explicit in the Constitution of the RSS, which was to be worked out in a democratic manner.<ref name=\"Curran1950\"/><ref name=\"Noorani2000\" />\n\n===Decolonisation of Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Goa===\n\nAfter India had achieved independence, the RSS was one of the socio-political organisations that supported and participated in movements to decolonise [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], which at that time was ruled by Portugal. In early 1954 volunteers Raja Wakankar and Nana Kajrekar of the RSS visited the area round about Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Daman several times to study the topography and get acquainted with locals who wanted the area to change from being a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] to being an [[States and Territories of India|Indian union territory]]. In April 1954 the RSS formed a coalition with the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO) and the Azad Gomantak Dal (AGD) for the annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli into the Republic of India.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\">Purushottam Shripad Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, published by Usha P. Lele, 1987</ref> On the night of 21 July, United Front of Goans, a group working independently of the coalition, captured the Portuguese police station at Dadra and declared Dadra independent. Subsequently, on 28 July, volunteer teams from the RSS and AGD captured the territories of Naroli and Phiparia and ultimately the capital of [[Silvassa]]. The Portuguese forces that had escaped and moved towards Nagar Haveli, were assaulted at Khandvel and forced to retreat until they surrendered to the Indian border police at Udava on 11 August 1954. A native administration was set up with Appasaheb Karmalkar of the NMLO as the Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli on 11 August 1954.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\" />\n\nThe capture of Dadra and Nagar Haveli gave a boost to the movement against Portuguese colonial rule in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\"/> In 1955 RSS leaders demanded the end of Portuguese rule in Goa and its integration into India. When Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused to provide an armed intervention, RSS leader Jagannath Rao Joshi led the Satyagraha agitation straight into Goa. He was imprisoned with his followers by the Portuguese police. The nonviolent protests continued but met with repression. On 15 August 1955, the Portuguese police opened fire on the ''satyagrahis'', killing thirty or so civilians.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=130}}\n\nGoa was later [[Annexation of Goa|annexed into the Indian union]] in 1961 through an army operation, codenamed '[[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]]', that was carried out by the Nehru government.\n\n===War-time activities===\nAfter the declaration of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Bangladesh War of Independence]] by [[Indira Gandhi]], RSS provided support to the government, by offering its services to maintain law and order in Delhi and its volunteers were apparently the first to donate blood.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=243}}\n\n===Movement against the Emergency===\nIn 1975 the Indira Gandhi government proclaimed [[The Emergency (India)|emergency rule in India]], thereby suspending [[fundamental rights (India)|fundamental rights]] and curtailing the [[freedom of the press]].<ref name=emma>Emma Tarlo, ''Unsettling Memories: Narratives of India's \"emergency\"'', Published by Orient Blackswan, 2003, {{ISBN|81-7824-066-1}}, {{ISBN|978-81-7824-066-4}}</ref> This action was taken after the Supreme Court of India cancelled her election to the Indian Parliament on charges of [[malpractice]]s in the election.<ref name=emma/> Democratic institutions were suspended and prominent opposition leaders, including Gandhian [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], were arrested whilst thousands of people were detained without any charges taken up against them.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008}} RSS, which was seen as being close to opposition leaders, and with its large organisational base was seen to have the capability of organising protests against the government, was also banned.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=297}}\n\nDeoras, the then chief of RSS, wrote letters to Indira Gandhi, promising her to extend the organisation's co-operation in return for the lifting of the ban, asserting that RSS had no connection with the [[Bihar Movement|movement in Bihar]] and [[Navnirman Andolan|that in Gujarat]]. He tried to persuade Vinoba Bhave to mediate between the RSS and the government and also sought the offices of [[Sanjay Gandhi]], Indira Gandhi's son.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}}{{sfn|Noorani, RSS and the BJP|2000|p=31}} Later, when there was no response, volunteers of the RSS formed underground movements against the Emergency.<ref name=\":0\" /> Literature that was censored in the media was clandestinely published and distributed on a large scale, and funds were collected for the movement.

When Golwalkar wrote to Nehru asking for the lifting of the ban on RSS after Gandhi's assassination, Nehru replied that the government had proof that RSS activities were 'anti-national' by virtue of being 'communalist'. In his letter to the heads of provincial governments in December 1947, Nehru wrote that \"we have a great deal of evidence to show that RSS is an organisation which is in the nature of a private army and which is definitely proceeding on the strictest Nazi lines, even following the techniques of the organisation\".{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=87, 88}}\n\nSardar [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Vallabhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, said in early January 1948 that the RSS activists were \"patriots who love their country\". He asked the Congressmen to 'win over' the RSS by love, instead of trying to 'crush' them. He also appealed to the RSS to join the Congress instead of opposing it. Jaffrelot says that this attitude of Patel can be partly explained by the assistance the RSS gave the Indian administration in maintaining public order in September 1947, and that his expression of 'qualified sympathy' towards RSS reflected the long-standing inclination of several Hindu traditionalists in Congress. However, after Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948, Patel began to view that the activities of RSS were a danger to public security.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=86-}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=12}} In his reply letter to Golwalkar on 11 September 1948 regarding the lifting of ban on RSS, Patel stated that though RSS did service to the Hindu society by helping and protecting the Hindus when in need during partition violence, they also began attacking Muslims with revenge and went against \"innocent men, women and children\". He said that the speeches of RSS were \"full of communal poison\", and as a result of that 'poison', he remarked, India had to lose Gandhi, noting that the RSS men had celebrated Gandhi's death. Patel was also apprehensive of the secrecy in the working manner of RSS, and complained that all of its provincial heads were Maratha Brahmins. He criticised the RSS for having its own army inside India, which he said, cannot be permitted as \"it was a potential danger to the State\". He also remarked: \"The members of RSS claimed to be the defenders of Hinduism. But they must understand that Hinduism would not be saved by rowdyism.\"{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=82}}\n\n[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first President of India, did not approve of RSS. In 1948, he criticised RSS for carrying out 'loot, arson, rioting and killing of Muslims' in Delhi and other Hindu majority areas. In his letter to home minister Patel on 14 May 1948, he stated that RSS men had planned to dress up as Muslims in Hindu majority areas and attack Muslims in Muslim majority areas to create trouble. He asked Patel to take strict action against RSS for aiming to create enmity among Hindus and Muslims. He called RSS a [[Maharashtrian Brahmin]] movement, and viewed it as a secret organisation which used violence and promoted fascism, without any regard to truthful means and constitutional methods. He stated that RSS was \"definitely a menace to public peace\".{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=113}}\n\nField Marshal [[K. M.

of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as the revitalisation of the Indian value system based on universalism and peace and prosperity to all.<ref name=\"bunch\">M S Golwalkar, Bunch of Thoughts, Publishers: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana</ref> [[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]], the worldview that the whole world is one family, propounded by the ancient thinkers of India, is considered as one of the ideologies of the organisation.<ref name=\"sheshadri\">H. V. Seshadri, ''Hindu renaissance under way'', Published in 1984, Jagarana Prakashana, Distributors, Rashtrotthana Sahitya (Bangalore)</ref>\n\nBut the immediate focus, the leaders believe, is on the Hindu renaissance, which would build an egalitarian society and a strong India that could propound this philosophy. Hence, the focus is on social reform, economic upliftment of the downtrodden, and the protection of the cultural diversity of the natives in India.<ref name=\"sheshadri\" /> The organisation says it aspires to unite all Hindus and build a strong India that can contribute to the welfare of the world. In the words of RSS ideologue and the second head of the RSS, Golwalkar, \"in order to be able to contribute our unique knowledge to mankind, in order to be able to live and strive for the unity and welfare of the world, we stand before the world as a self-confident, resurgent and mighty nation\".<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n\nIn ''Vichardhara'' (ideology), Golwalkar affirms the RSS mission of integration as:<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n{{Quote|RSS has been making determined efforts to inculcate in our people the burning devotion for Bharat and its national ethos; kindle in them the spirit of dedication and sterling qualities and character; rouse social consciousness, mutual good-will, love and cooperation among them all; to make them realise that casts, creeds, and languages are secondary and that service to the nation is the supreme end and to mold their behaviour accordingly; instill in them a sense of true humility and discipline and train their bodies to be strong and robust so as to shoulder any social responsibility; and thus to create all-round Anushasana (Discipline) in all walks of life and build together all our people into a unified harmonious national whole, extending from Himalayas to Kanyakumari.|[[M.

The movement considers Hindus as inclusive of Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, tribals, untouchables, Veerashaivism, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, and other groups as a community, a view similar to the inclusive referencing of the term Hindu in the Indian Constitution Article 25 (2)(b).<ref>Martin E.

He believed that the movement should inculcate a faith in the masses that would make them rise above the base appeal of Communism.<ref name=bunch/>\n\n=== Reform in 'caste' ===\nThe RSS has advocated the training of Dalits and other backward classes as temple high priests (a position traditionally reserved for [[Caste]] [[Brahmins]] and denied to lower castes).

K. Advani]] have complained about the RSS's interference in party politics. Though some former Hindu nationalists believed that Sangh should take part in politics, they failed to draw the RSS, which was intended to be a purely cultural movement, into the political arena until the 1950s. Savarkar tried to convince Hedgewar and later Golwalkar, to tie up with Hindu Mahasabha, but failed to do so.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nUnder pressure from other ''swayamsevaks'', Golwalkar gradually changed his mind after independence under unusual circumstances during the ban on RSS in 1948 after the assassination of Gandhi. After the first wave of arrests of RSS activists at that time, some of its members who had gone underground recommended that their movement be involved in politics, seeing that no political force was present to advocate the cause of RSS in parliament or anywhere else. One such member who significantly suggested this cause was [[K. R. Malkani]], who wrote in 1949:{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n{{quote|Sangh must take part in politics not only to protect itself against the greedy design of politicians, but to stop the un-Bharatiya and anti-Bharatiya policies of the Government and to advance and expedite the cause of Bharatiya through state machinery side by side with official effort in the same direction. ... Sangh must continue as it is, an ''ashram'' for the national cultural education of the entire citizenry, but it must develop a political wing for the more effective and early achievement of its ideals.}}\n\nGolwalkar approved of Malkani's and others' views regarding the formation of a new party in 1950. Jaffrelot says that the death of Sardar Patel influenced this change since Golwalkar opined that Patel could have transformed the Congress party by emphasising its affinities with Hindu nationalism, while after Patel, Nehru became strong enough to impose his 'anti-communal' line within his party. Accordingly, Golwalkar met [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]] and agreed for endorsing senior ''swayamsevaks'', who included [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]], Balraj Madhok and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], to the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], a newly formed political party by Mukherjee. These men, who took their orders in Nagpur, captured power in the party after Mukherjee's death.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n[[Balasaheb Deoras]], who succeeded Golwalkar as the chief of RSS, got very much involved in politics. In 1965, when he was the general secretary of the RSS, he addressed the annual meeting of Jana Sangh, which is seen as an \"unprecedented move\" by an RSS dignitary that reflected his strong interest in politics and his will to make the movement play a larger part in the public sphere. Jaffrelot says that he exemplified the specific kind of swayamsevaks known as 'activists', giving expression to his leanings towards political activism by having the RSS support the [[Bihar Movement|JP Movement]].{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The importance that RSS began to give to the electoral politics is demonstrated when its units (''shakhas'') were made constituency-based in the early 1970s, from which the RSS shakhas began to involve directly in elections, not only of legislatures, but also of trade unions, student and cultural organisations.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}}\n\nAs soon as the RSS men took over the Jana Sangh party, the Hindu traditionalists who previously joined the party because of S. P. Mukherjee were sidelined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Your explanation here}} The organisation of the party was restructured and all its organisational secretaries, who were the pillars of the party, came from the RSS, both at the district and state level. The party also took the vision of RSS in its mission, where its ultimate objective, in the long run, was the reform of society, but not the conquest of power, since the 'state' was not viewed as a prominent institution. Hence the Jana Sangh initially remained reluctant to join any alliance that was not fully in harmony with its ideology. In 1962, Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was the party's chief, explained this approach by saying that \"coalitions were bound to degenerate into a struggle for power by opportunist elements coming together in the interest of expediency\". He wanted to build the party as an alternative party to the Congress and saw the elections as an \"opportunity to educate the people on political issues and to challenge the right of the Congress to be in power\". Jaffrelot says that this indifferent approach of party politics was in accordance with its lack of interest in the 'state' and the wish to make it weaker, or more decentralised.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} After India's defeat in the [[Sino-Indian War|1962 Sino\u2013Indian war]], the RSS and other right-wing forces in India were strengthened since the leftist and centrist opinions, sometimes even Nehru himself, could then be blamed for being 'soft' towards China. The RSS and Jana Sangh also took complete advantage of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war with Pakistan]] to \"deepen suspicion about Muslims\", and also en-cashed the growing unpopularity of Congress, particularly in the [[Hindi Belt|Hindi-belt]], where a left-wing alternative was weak or non-existent.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were banning [[Cattle slaughter in India|cow slaughter]], abolishing the [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special status given to Jammu and Kashmir]], and legislating a [[uniform civil code]]. Explaining the Jana Sangh's failure to become a major political force despite claiming to represent the national interests of the Hindus, scholar Bruce Desmond Graham states that the party's close initial ties with the Hindi-belt and its preoccupation with the issues of North India such as promotion of Hindi, energetic resistance to Pakistan etc., had become a serious disadvantage to the party in the long run. He also adds that its interpretation of Hinduism was \"restrictive and exclusive\", arguing that \"its doctrines were inspired by an activist version of Hindu nationalism and, indirectly, by the values of [[Brahmanism]] rather than the devotional and quietist values of popular Hinduism.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=253}} Desmond says that, if the Jana Sangh had carefully moderated its Hindu nationalism, it could have been able to well-exploit any strong increase in support for the traditional and nationalist Hindu opinion, and hence to compete on equal terms with the Congress in the northern states. He also remarks that if it had adopted a less harsh attitude towards Pakistan and Muslims, \"it would have been much more acceptable to Hindu traditionalists in the central and southern states, where partition had left fewer emotional scars.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Jana Sangh started making alliances by entering the anti-Congress coalitions since 1960s. It became part of the 1971 Grand Alliance and finally merged itself with the [[Janata Party]] in 1977.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The success of Janata Party in [[1977 Indian general election|1977 elections]] made the RSS members central ministers for the first time (Vajpayee, Advani and [[Brij Lal Verma]]),{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} and provided the RSS with an opportunity to avail the state and its instruments to further its ends, through the resources of various state governments as well as the central government.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8v7Vr2iQUHkC&pg=PA240|title=India Since Independence: Making Sense of Indian Politics|last=Krishna|first=Ananth V.|publisher=Pearson Education India|year=2011|isbn=9788131734650|pages=240|language=en}}</ref> However, this merge, which was seen as a dilution of its original doctrine, was viewed by the ex-Jana Sanghis as submersion of their initial identity. Meanwhile, the other components of the Janata Party denounced the allegiance the ex-Jana Sanghis continued to pay to the RSS. This led to a 'dual membership' controversy, regarding the links the former Jana Sangh members were retaining with the RSS, and it led to the split of Janata Party in 1979.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nThe former Jana Sangh elements formed a new party, [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), in 1980. However, BJP originated more as a successor to the Janata Party and did not return to the beginning stages of the Hindu nationalist identity and Jana Sangh doctrines. The RSS resented this dilution of ideology \u2013 the new slogans promoted by the then BJP president Vajpayee like 'Gandhian socialism' and 'positive secularism'. By early 1980s, RSS is said to have established its political strategy of \"never keeping all its eggs in one basket\". It even decided to support Congress in some states, for instance, to create the [[Hindu Munnani]] in Tamil Nadu in the backdrop of the [[1981 Meenakshipuram conversion|1981 Meenakshipuram mass conversion to Islam]], and to support one of its offshoots, [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), to launch an enthno-religious movement on the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. BJP did not have much electoral success in its initial years and was able to win only two seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|1984 elections]]. After L. K. Advani replaced Vajpayee as party president in 1986, the BJP also began to rally around the Ayodhya campaign. In 1990, the party organised the ''[[Ram Rath Yatra]]'' to advance this campaign in large-scale.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} Advani also attacked the then ruling Congress party with the slogans such as '[[pseudo-secularism]]', accusing Congress of misusing secularism for the political appeasement of minorities, and established an explicit and unambiguous path of Hindu revival.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 'instrumentalisation' of the Ayodhya issue and the related communal riots which polarised the electorate along religious lines helped the BJP make good progress in the subsequent elections of [[1989 Indian general election|1989]], [[1991 Indian general election|1991]] and [[1996 Indian general election|1996]]. However, in the mid-1990s, BJP adopted a more moderate approach to politics in order to make allies. As Jaffrelot remarks, it was because the party realised during then that it would not be in a position to form the government on its own in the near future. In 1998, it built a major coalition, [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), in the Lok Sabha and succeeded in the [[1998 Indian general election|general election in 1998]], and was able to succeed again in the [[1999 Indian general election|mid-term elections of 1999]], with Vajpayee as their Prime Ministerial candidate. Though the RSS and other Sangh Parivar components appreciated some of the steps taken by the Vajpayee government, like the [[Pokhran-II|testing of a nuclear bomb]], they felt disappointed with the government's overall performance. The fact that no solid step was taken towards building the [[Rama|Ram]] temple in Ayodhya was resented by the VHP. The [[Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee#Economic policy|liberalisation policy of the government]] faced objection from the [[Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh]], a trade union controlled by the RSS. Jaffrelot says, RSS and the other Sangh Parivar elements had come to the view that the \"BJP leaders had been victims of their thirst for power: they had preferred to compromise to remain in office instead of sticking to their principles.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175-179}}\n\nAfter the end of Vajpayee's tenure in 2004, BJP remained as a major opposition party in the subsequent years; and again in the year 2014, the NDA came to power after BJP gained an overwhelming majority in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general elections]], with [[Narendra Modi]], a former RSS member who previously served as Gujarat's chief minister for three tenures, as their prime ministerial candidate.

Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

In stories Bamse is said to have got up on his hind legs and, at over {{convert|6|ft}} tall, clamped his great paws on assailants to end any fight.

In addition to the county sheriff, the constitutional chief [[Police|law enforcement]] officer of the county, Cobb County has a separate [[police]] department under the authority of the Board of Commissioners. The sheriff oversees the [[County jail|jail]], to which everyone arrested under state law is taken, regardless of the city or other area of the county where it happens, or which police department makes the arrest.\n\nEach city has a separate police department, answerable to its governing council. Marietta, Smyrna, and Austell have separate [[fire department]]s, with the Cobb County Fire Department being the authority having jurisdiction over Kennesaw, Acworth, Powder Springs, and unincorporated areas. Cobb [[9-1-1|911]] covers unincorporated areas and the city of Marietta.

This funds mainly [[transport]]ation and [[park]]s. Cobb levies a 1% tax to lower [[property tax]]es, but only for the public school budget, and not the additional 1% HOST [[homestead exemption]] for general funds. The county has also voted not to pay the extra 1% to join [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]].\n\nAt the beginning of 2006, Cobb became the last county in the state to raise the tax to 6%, which also doubled the tax on [[food]] to 2%. The [[SPLOST]] barely passed by a 114 [[vote]] margin, or less than one-quarter of a percent, in a September 2005 [[referendum]]. The [[revenue]] was to go to a new county [[courthouse]], expanded jail, various [[transportation]] projects, and the purchasing of property for parks and green space.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cobbcip.org |title=Cobb Local Sales Tax for Public Safety and Transportation |publisher=Cobbcip.org |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2010-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107030318/http://www.cobbcip.org/ |archivedate=2010-11-07 }}</ref> In 2008, the school tax was renewed for a third term, funding the Marietta and Cobb [[school system]]s.\n\n==Economy==\nThe [[Cobb County School District]] is Cobb County's largest employer, employing over 15,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cobbk12.org/aboutccsd/index.htm|title=Index|publisher=[[Cobb County School District]]|accessdate=July 28, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530084831/http://www.cobbk12.org/aboutccsd/index.htm|archivedate=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nPrivate corporations include:\n* [[The Home Depot]] Atlanta Store Support Center, world headquarters<ref>[http://corporate.homedepot.com/en_US/Corporate/Public_Relations/Online_Press_Kit/Docs/Corp_Financial_Overview.pdf Corporate and Financial Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002023554/https://corporate.homedepot.com/en_US/Corporate/Public_Relations/Online_Press_Kit/Docs/Corp_Financial_Overview.pdf|date=2011-10-02}}.

The chairman of the board is elected county-wide. The other four commissioners are elected from single-member [[district]]s. The board hires a county [[city manager|manager]] who oversees day-to-day operations of the county's [[executive department]]s.\n\nCounty residents also elect a sheriff, district attorney, probate court judge, clerk of superior court, clerk of the state court, state court solicitor, chief magistrate judge (who then appoints other magistrate court judges), superior court judges, state court judges, tax commissioner, surveyor, and a seven-member board of education. In addition to the county sheriff, the constitutional chief [[Police|law enforcement]] officer of the county, Cobb County has a separate [[police]] department under the authority of the Board of Commissioners. The sheriff oversees the [[County jail|jail]], to which everyone arrested under state law is taken, regardless of the city or other area of the county where it happens, or which police department makes the arrest.\n\nEach city has a separate police department, answerable to its governing council. Marietta, Smyrna, and Austell have separate [[fire department]]s, with the Cobb County Fire Department being the authority having jurisdiction over Kennesaw, Acworth, Powder Springs, and unincorporated areas. Cobb [[9-1-1|911]] covers unincorporated areas and the city of Marietta. Kennesaw and Acworth jointly operate a small 911 [[call center]] ([[Public Safety Answering Point|PSAP]]) upstairs in Kennesaw [[city hall]], [[dispatch (logistics)|dispatching]] the police departments in both cities, and [[call forwarding|forwarding]] fire calls to Cobb. Smyrna operates a separate PSAP while offering dispatch services to the city of Powder Springs. Austell operates its own separate 911 system.\n\nThe county retails potable water to much of the county, and wholesales it to various cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://water.cobbcountyga.gov/Files/WhatWeDo.html|title=Cobb County Government|publisher=Water.cobbcountyga.gov|accessdate=2012-12-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231031127/http://water.cobbcountyga.gov/Files/WhatWeDo.html|archivedate=2012-12-31}}</ref>\n\nThe current County Manager is Rob Hosack.<ref>{{Cite web|title=County Manager|url=http://www.cobbcounty.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=848&Itemid=1118|website=cobbcounty.org|access-date=2016-02-03|first=Kristina|last=Abernathy}}</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nFrom 1964 until 2012, the county was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections.

In 2016, [[Hillary Clinton]] became the first Democrat to win Cobb County since 1976, and the first non-Georgian to carry the county since 1960.

This funds mainly [[transport]]ation and [[park]]s. Cobb levies a 1% tax to lower [[property tax]]es, but only for the public school budget, and not the additional 1% HOST [[homestead exemption]] for general funds. The county has also voted not to pay the extra 1% to join [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]].\n\nAt the beginning of 2006, Cobb became the last county in the state to raise the tax to 6%, which also doubled the tax on [[food]] to 2%. The [[SPLOST]] barely passed by a 114 [[vote]] margin, or less than one-quarter of a percent, in a September 2005 [[referendum]]. The [[revenue]] was to go to a new county [[courthouse]], expanded jail, various [[transportation]] projects, and the purchasing of property for parks and green space.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cobbcip.org |title=Cobb Local Sales Tax for Public Safety and Transportation |publisher=Cobbcip.org |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2010-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107030318/http://www.cobbcip.org/ |archivedate=2010-11-07 }}</ref> In 2008, the school tax was renewed for a third term, funding the Marietta and Cobb [[school system]]s.\n\n==Economy==\nThe [[Cobb County School District]] is Cobb County's largest employer, employing over 15,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cobbk12.org/aboutccsd/index.htm|title=Index|publisher=[[Cobb County School District]]|accessdate=July 28, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530084831/http://www.cobbk12.org/aboutccsd/index.htm|archivedate=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nPrivate corporations include:\n* [[The Home Depot]] Atlanta Store Support Center, world headquarters<ref>[http://corporate.homedepot.com/en_US/Corporate/Public_Relations/Online_Press_Kit/Docs/Corp_Financial_Overview.pdf Corporate and Financial Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002023554/https://corporate.homedepot.com/en_US/Corporate/Public_Relations/Online_Press_Kit/Docs/Corp_Financial_Overview.pdf|date=2011-10-02}}.
