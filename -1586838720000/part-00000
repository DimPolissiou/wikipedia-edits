It is the world's largest Buddhist temple.<ref name=\"Guiness\" /><ref name=\"JakartaPost1\" /><ref name=\"unesco-whc\" /> The temple consists of nine stacked platforms, six square and three circular, topped by a central dome. It is decorated with 2,672 [[relief]] panels and 504 [[Buddhist art|Buddha statues]]. The central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated [[stupa]].<ref name=\"p35-36\" />\n\nBuilt in the 9th century during the reign of the [[Sailendra Dynasty]], the temple design follows [[Javanese temple architecture|Javanese]] [[Buddhist architecture]], which blends the [[Architecture of Indonesia|Indonesian]] indigenous cult of [[ancestor worship]] and the Buddhist concept of attaining [[Nirvana]].<ref name=\"unesco-whc\" /> The temple demonstrates the influences of [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art that reflects [[India]]'s influence on the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian.<ref name=\"aOtRK\" /><ref name=\"idyTD\" /> The monument is a [[shrine]] to the [[Lord Buddha]] and a place for [[Buddhist pilgrimage]]. The pilgrim journey begins at the base of the monument and follows a path around the monument, ascending to the top through three levels symbolic of [[Buddhist cosmology]]: ''[[Desire realm|K\u0101madh\u0101tu]]'' (the world of desire), ''[[R\u016bpajh\u0101na|R\u016bpadh\u0101tu]]'' (the world of forms) and ''[[Ar\u016bpajh\u0101na|Ar\u016bpadh\u0101tu]]'' (the world of formlessness). The monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of stairways and corridors with 1,460 narrative relief panels on the walls and the [[balustrade]]s. Borobudur has one of the largest and most complete ensembles of Buddhist reliefs in the world.<ref name=\"unesco-whc\" />\n\nEvidence suggests that Borobudur was constructed in the 9th century and subsequently abandoned following the 14th-century decline of [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]] kingdoms in Java and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] conversion to Islam.<ref name=\"Soekmono4\" /> Worldwide knowledge of its existence was sparked in 1814 by [[Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles]], then the [[British Java|British ruler of Java]], who was advised of its location by native Indonesians.<ref name=\"3L5mh\" /> Borobudur has since been preserved through several restorations. The largest restoration project was undertaken between 1975 and 1982 by the [[Indonesian government]] and [[UNESCO]], followed by the monument's listing as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=\"unesco-whc\" />\n\nBorobudur is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, and ranks with [[Bagan]] in [[Myanmar]] and [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]] as one of the great archeological sites of Southeast Asia. Borobudur remains popular for pilgrimage, with [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Buddhists in Indonesia]] celebrating [[Vesak|Vesak Day]] at the monument. Borobudur is Indonesia's single most visited [[tourism in Indonesia|tourist attraction]].<ref name=\"yZUgN\" /><ref name=\"Hampton2004\" /><ref name=\"Sedyawati1997\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Borobudur-Nothwest-view.jpg|thumb|480px|left|[[Candi of Indonesia|Candi]] Borobudur viewed from the northwest. The monument was mentioned in the [[Karangtengah inscription|Karangtengah]] and [[Tri Tepusan inscription]]s.]]\nIn [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], ancient temples are referred to as ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]''; thus locals refer to \"Borobudur Temple\" as ''Candi Borobudur''. The term ''candi'' also loosely describes ancient structures, for example gates and baths. The origins of the name ''Borobudur,'' however, are unclear,<ref name=\"Soekmono13\" /> although the original names of most ancient Indonesian temples are no longer known.<ref name=\"Soekmono13\" /> The name Borobudur was first written in [[Sir Thomas Raffles|Raffles]]'s [[The History of Java (1817 book)|book on Javan history]].<ref name=\"Raffles1814\" /> Raffles wrote about a monument called ''Borobudur'', but there are no older documents suggesting the same name.<ref name=\"Soekmono13\" /> The only [[old Javanese]] [[Palm-leaf manuscript|manuscript]] that hints the monument called ''Budur'' as a holy Buddhist sanctuary is ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'', written by [[Mpu Prapanca]], a Buddhist scholar of [[Majapahit]] court, in 1365.<ref name=\"moens\" />\n\nMost ''candi'' are named after a nearby village. If it followed [[Javanese language]] conventions and was named after the nearby village of ''Bore'', the monument should have been named \"BudurBoro\". Raffles thought that ''Budur'' might correspond to the modern Javanese word ''Buda'' (\"ancient\")\u2014i.e., \"ancient Boro\". He also suggested that the name might derive from ''boro'', meaning \"great\" or \"honourable\" and ''Budur'' for Buddha.<ref name=\"Soekmono13\" /> However, another archaeologist suggests the second component of the name (''Budur'') comes from Javanese term ''bhudhara'' (\"mountain\").<ref name=\"casparis\" />\n\nAnother possible etymology by Dutch archaeologist A.J. Bernet Kempers suggests that ''Borobudur'' is a corrupted simplified local [[Javanese language|Javanese]] pronunciation of ''Biara Beduhur'' written in [[Sanskrit]] as ''Vihara Buddha Uhr''. The term ''Buddha-Uhr'' could mean \"the city of Buddhas\", while another possible term ''Beduhur'' is probably an [[Old Javanese]] term, still survived today in [[Balinese language|Balinese vocabulary]], which means \"a high place\", constructed from the stem word ''dhuhur'' or ''luhur'' (high). This suggests that Borobudur means [[vihara]] of [[Buddha]] located on a high place or on a hill.<ref name=\"3WO5T\" />\n\nThe construction and inauguration of a sacred Buddhist building\u2014possibly a reference to Borobudur\u2014was mentioned in two inscriptions, both discovered in Kedu, [[Temanggung Regency]]. The [[Karangtengah inscription]], dated 824, mentioned a sacred building named ''Jinalaya'' (the realm of those who have conquered worldly desire and reached enlightenment), inaugurated by [[Pramodhawardhani]], daughter of [[Samaratungga]]. The [[Tri Tepusan inscription]], dated 842, is mentioned in the ''sima'', the (tax-free) lands awarded by \u00c7r\u012b Kahulunnan (Pramodhawardhani) to ensure the funding and maintenance of a ''Kam\u016bl\u0101n'' called ''Bh\u016bmisambh\u0101ra''.<ref name=\"4DvUu\" /> ''Kam\u016bl\u0101n'' is from the word ''mula,'' which means \"the place of origin\", a sacred building to honor the [[ancestors]], probably those of the [[Sailendra]]s. Casparis suggested that ''Bh\u016bmi Sambh\u0101ra Bhudh\u0101ra'', which in [[Sanskrit]] means \"the mountain of combined virtues of the ten stages of [[Boddhisattva]]hood\", was the original name of Borobudur.<ref name=\"4IUze\" />\n\n==Location==\n===The three temples===\n{{See also|Borobudur Temple Compounds}}\n[[File:Borobudur Map en.svg|thumb|left|380px|Straight-line arrangement of Borobudur, Pawon, and Mendut]]\nApproximately {{convert|40|km|mi}} northwest of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]] and {{convert|86|km|mi}} west of [[Surakarta]], Borobudur is located in an elevated area between two twin volcanoes, [[Mount Sundoro|Sundoro]]-[[Mount Sumbing|Sumbing]] and [[Mount Merbabu|Merbabu]]-[[Mount Merapi|Merapi]], and two rivers, the [[Progo River|Progo]] and the Elo. According to local myth, the area known as [[Kedu Plain]] is a Javanese \"[[List of Sacred Places in Java|sacred\" place]] and has been dubbed \"the garden of Java\" due to its high [[soil fertility|agricultural fertility]].<ref name=\"p1\" /> \n\nDuring the restoration in the early 20th century, it was discovered that three Buddhist temples in the region, Borobudur, [[Pawon]] and [[Mendut]], are positioned along a straight line.<ref name=\"krom\" /> A ritual relationship between the three temples must have existed, although the exact ritual process is unknown.<ref name=\"moens\" />\n\n===Ancient lake hypothesis===\n{{See also|Lake Borobudur}}\n[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudur-06.jpg|thumb|right|Borobudur is surrounded by mountains, including twin volcanoes; [[Mount Merbabu]] and [[Mount Merapi|Merapi]]]]\nSpeculation about a surrounding lake's existence was the subject of intense discussion among archaeologists in the 20th century. In 1931, a Dutch artist and scholar of Hindu and Buddhist architecture, [[W.O.J. Nieuwenkamp]], developed a [[hypothesis]] that the Kedu Plain was once a lake and Borobudur initially represented a [[lotus flower]] floating on the lake.<ref name=\"casparis\" /> It has been claimed that Borobudur was built on a bedrock hill, {{convert|265|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] and {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the floor of a dried-out [[Lake Borobudur|paleolake]].<ref name=\"Murwanto\" />\n\nDumar\u00e7ay together with Professor [[Ganapathi Thanikaimoni|Thanikaimoni]] took soil samples in 1974 and again in 1977 from trial trenches that had been dug into the hill, as well as from the plain immediately to the south. These samples were later analysed by Thanikaimoni, who examined their pollen and spore content to identify the type of vegetation that had grown in the area around the time of Borobudur's construction. They were unable to discover any pollen or spore samples that were characteristic of any vegetation known to grow in an aquatic environment such as a lake, pond or marsh. The area surrounding Borobudur appears to have been surrounded by agricultural land and palm trees at the time of the monument's construction, as is still the case today. Caesar Vo\u00fbte and the geomorphologist Dr J.J. Nossin in 1985\u201386 field studies re-examined the Borobudur lake hypothesis and confirmed the absence of a lake around Borobudur at the time of its construction and active use as a sanctuary. These findings ''A New Perspective on Some Old Questions Pertaining to Borobudur'' were published in the 2005 UNESCO publication titled \"The Restoration of Borobudur\".\n\n==History==\n===Construction===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Temperaschilderij voorstellende de Borobudur als bedevaartsoord TMnr 75-2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A painting by G.B. Hooijer (c. 1916\u20131919) reconstructing the scene of Borobudur during its heyday]]\n\nThere are no known records of construction or the intended purpose of Borobudur.<ref name=\"Soekmono9\" /> The duration of construction has been estimated by comparison of [[stone carving|carved]] reliefs on the temple's hidden foot and the [[inscription]]s commonly used in royal charters during the 8th and 9th centuries. Borobudur was likely founded around 800 AD.<ref name=\"Soekmono9\" /> This corresponds to the period between 760 and 830&nbsp;AD, the peak of the [[Sailendra|Sailendra dynasty]] rule over [[Medang|Mataram kingdom]] in central Java,<ref name=\"IzEy0\" /> when their power encompassed not only the [[Srivijaya|Srivijayan Empire]] but also [[Ligor|southern Thailand]], Indianized kingdoms of [[Philippines]], North Malaya (Kedah, also known in Indian texts as the ancient Hindu state of Kadaram).<ref>[[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]]</ref><ref>[[Ligor inscription]]</ref><ref>Coed\u00e8s, George (1968). Walter F. Vella, ed. The Indianized States of Southeast Asia. trans.Susan Brown Cowing. University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8248-0368-1}}.</ref> The construction has been estimated to have taken 75 years with completion during the reign of [[Samaratungga]] in 825.<ref name=\"Dumarcay\" /><ref name=\"JAzWi\" />\n\nThere is uncertainty about Hindu and Buddhist rulers in [[Java]] around that time. The Sailendras were known as ardent followers of Buddhism, though stone inscriptions found at Sojomerto also suggest they may have been Hindus.<ref name=\"Dumarcay\" /> It was during this time that many Hindu and Buddhist monuments were built on the plains and mountains around the Kedu Plain. The Buddhist monuments, including Borobudur, were erected around the same period as the Hindu [[Shiva]] [[Prambanan]] temple compound. In 732&nbsp;AD, the Shivaite King [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]] commissioned a [[Shivalinga]] sanctuary to be built on the Wukir hill, only {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Borobudur.<ref name=\"holing\" />\n\nConstruction of Buddhist temples, including Borobudur, at that time was possible because Sanjaya's immediate successor, [[Rakai Panangkaran]], granted his permission to the Buddhist followers to build such temples.<ref name=\"meulen\" /> In fact, to show his respect, Panangkaran gave the village of [[Kalasan]] to the Buddhist community, as is written in the Kalasan Charter dated 778 AD.<ref name=\"meulen\" /> This has led some archaeologists to believe that there was never serious conflict concerning religion in Java as it was possible for a Hindu king to patronize the establishment of a Buddhist monument; or for a Buddhist king to act likewise.<ref name=\"Soekmono10\" /> However, it is likely that there were two rival royal dynasties in Java at the time\u2014the Buddhist Sailendra and the [[Saivite]] Sanjaya\u2014in which the latter triumphed over their rival in the 856 battle on the [[Ratu Boko|Ratubaka]] plateau.<ref name=\"hall\" /> Similar confusion also exists regarding the Lara Jonggrang temple at the [[Prambanan]] complex, which was believed to have been erected by the victor [[Rakai Pikatan]] as the Sanjaya dynasty's reply to Borobudur,<ref name=\"hall\" /> but others suggest that there was a climate of peaceful coexistence where Sailendra involvement exists in Lara Jonggrang.<ref name=\"ZgPuX\" />\n\n===Abandonment===\n[[File:Borobudur 2008.JPG|thumb|left|Borobudur stupas overlooking a mountain. For centuries, it was deserted.]]\nBorobudur lay hidden for centuries under layers of [[volcanic ash]] and jungle growth. The facts behind its abandonment remain a mystery. It is not known when active use of the monument and Buddhist pilgrimage to it ceased. Sometime between 928 and 1006, King [[Mpu Sindok]] moved the capital of the [[Medang Kingdom]] to the region of [[East Java]] after a series of volcanic eruptions; it is not certain whether this influenced the abandonment, but several sources mention this as the most likely period of abandonment.<ref name=\"Soekmono4\" /><ref name=\"Murwanto\" /> The monument is mentioned vaguely as late as {{circa}} 1365, in [[Mpu Prapanca]]'s ''[[Nagarakretagama]],'' written during the [[Majapahit]] era and mentioning \"the vihara in Budur\".<ref name=\"AikB1\" /> Soekmono (1976) also mentions the popular belief that the temples were disbanded when the population converted to Islam in the 15th century.<ref name=\"Soekmono4\" />\n\nThe monument was not forgotten completely, though folk stories gradually shifted from its past glory into more [[superstitious]] beliefs associated with bad luck and misery. Two [[Javanese historical texts|old Javanese chronicles]] (''babad'') from the 18th century mention cases of bad luck associated with the monument. According to the ''[[Babad Tanah Jawi]]'' (or the ''History of Java''), the monument was a fatal factor for Mas Dana, a rebel who revolted against Pakubuwono I, the king of [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] in 1709.<ref name=\"Soekmono4\" /> It was mentioned that the \"Redi Borobudur\" hill was besieged and the insurgents were defeated and sentenced to death by the king. In the ''[[Babad Mataram]]'' (or the ''History of the Mataram Kingdom''), the monument was associated with the misfortune of Prince Monconagoro, the crown prince of the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] in 1757.<ref name=\"p5\" /> In spite of a taboo against visiting the monument, \"he took what is written as ''the knight who was captured in a cage'' (a statue in one of the perforated stupas)\". Upon returning to his palace, he fell ill and died one day later.\n\n===Rediscovery===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Europese mannen poseren op het tempelcomplex van de Borobudur bij de bovenste stupa waarop een afdak en trapleuningen zijn geplaatst TMnr 60043646.jpg|upright|thumb|Borobudur's main stupa in mid 19th-century, a wooden deck had been installed above the main stupa.]]\nFollowing [[Invasion of Java (1811)|its capture]], Java was under British administration from 1811 to 1816. The appointed governor was Lieutenant [[Governor-General]] [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]], who took great interest in the history of Java. He collected Javanese antiques and made notes through contacts with local inhabitants during his tour throughout the island. On an inspection tour to [[Semarang]] in 1814, he was informed about a big monument deep in a jungle near the village of Bumisegoro.<ref name=\"p5\" /> He was not able to see the site himself, but sent {{illm|Hermann Cornelius|nl|}}<!--(1774\u20131833)-->, a Dutch engineer who, among other antiquity explorations had uncovered the [[Sewu]] complex in 1806\u201307, to investigate.\nIn two months, Cornelius and his 200 men cut down trees, burned down vegetation and dug away the earth to reveal the monument. Due to the danger of collapse, he could not unearth all galleries. He reported his findings to Raffles, including various drawings. Although Raffles mentioned the discovery and hard work by Cornelius and his men in only a few sentences, he has been credited with the monument's rediscovery, as the one who had brought it to the world's attention.<ref name=\"Raffles1814\" />\n\nChristiaan Lodewijk Hartmann<!--(1795\u20131856)-->, the [[Resident (title)#Dutch colonial Residents|Resident]] of the [[Kedu Residency|Kedu region]], continued Cornelius's work, and in 1835, the whole complex was finally unearthed. His interest in Borobudur was more personal than official. Hartmann did not write any reports of his activities, in particular, the alleged story that he discovered the large statue of Buddha in the main stupa.<ref name=\"p6\" /> In 1842, Hartmann investigated the main dome, although what he discovered is unknown and the main stupa remains empty.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De Boroboudour op Java TMnr 60050687.jpg|left|thumb|Borobudur in 1872.]]\n\nThe [[Dutch East Indies]] government then commissioned Frans Carel Wilsen<!--(1813\u201399)-->, a Dutch engineering official, who studied the monument and drew hundreds of relief sketches. Jan Frederik Gerrit Brumund<!--(1814\u201363)--> was also appointed to make a detailed study of the monument, which was completed in 1859. The government intended to publish an article based on Brumund's study supplemented by Wilsen's drawings, but Brumund refused to cooperate. The government then commissioned another scholar, [[Conradus Leemans]]<!--(1809\u201393)-->, who compiled a [[monograph]] based on Brumund's and Wilsen's sources. In 1873, the first monograph of the detailed study of Borobudur was published, followed by its French translation a year later.<ref name=\"p6\" /> The first photograph of the monument was taken in 1872 by the Dutch-[[Flemish people|Flemish]] engraver [[Isidore van Kinsbergen]].<ref name=\"p42\" />\n\nAppreciation of the site developed slowly, and it served for some time largely as a source of souvenirs and income for \"souvenir hunters\" and thieves. In 1882, the chief inspector of cultural artifacts recommended that Borobudur be entirely disassembled with the relocation of reliefs into museums due to the unstable condition of the monument.<ref name=\"p42\" /> As a result, the government appointed Willem Pieter Groeneveldt<!--(1841\u20131915)-->, curator of the archaeological collection of the [[Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences|Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences]],<ref name=\"olbT2\" /> to undertake a thorough investigation of the site and to assess the actual condition of the complex; his report found that these fears were unjustified and recommended it be left intact.\n\nBorobudur was considered as the source of souvenirs, and parts of its sculptures were looted, some even with colonial-government consent. In 1896 [[King Chulalongkorn]] of [[Siam]] visited Java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from Borobudur. These include thirty pieces taken from a number of relief panels, five buddha images, two lions, one gargoyle, several kala motifs from the stairs and gateways, and a guardian statue ([[dvarapala]]). Several of these artifacts, most notably the lions, dvarapala, kala, makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in the Java Art room in [[Bangkok National Museum|The National Museum in Bangkok]].<ref name=\"kw2cs\" />\n\n===Restoration===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De Borobudur TMnr 10023620.jpg|thumb|right|Borobudur after Van Erp's restoration in 1911. Note the reconstructed ''chhatra'' pinnacle on top of the main stupa (now dismantled).]]\n[[File:Karmawibhangga Museum Borobudur Unfinished Buddha.jpg|thumb|The [[Unfinished Buddha]] from the main stupa of Borobudur at [[Karmawibhangga Museum]], to which the Buddhists give offerings, along with the main stupa's ''chhatra'' on its back.]]\nBorobudur attracted attention in 1885, when the Dutch engineer {{illm|Jan Willem IJzerman|id||nl|}}<!--(1851\u20131932)-->, Chairman of the Archaeological Society in Yogyakarta, made a discovery about the hidden foot.<ref name=\"kompas\" /> Photographs that reveal reliefs on the hidden foot were made in 1890\u20131891.<ref name=\"p43\" /> The discovery led the Dutch East Indies government to take steps to safeguard the monument. In 1900, the government set up a commission consisting of three officials to assess the monument: Jan Lourens Andries Brandes<!--(1857\u20131905)-->, an [[Art history|art historian]], {{illm|Theodoor van Erp|nl}}, a [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch army]] engineer officer, and Benjamin Willem van de Kamer<!--(1860\u20131920)-->, a construction engineer from the Department of Public Works.\n\nIn 1902, the commission submitted a threefold plan of proposal to the government. First, the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, after fencing off the courtyards, proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should be improved by restoring floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared up to the first balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 [[Dutch guilder]]s.\n\nThe restoration then was carried out between 1907 and 1911, using the principles of [[anastylosis]] and led by Theodor van Erp.<ref name=\"unesco2004\" /> The first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, Van Erp discovered more things he could do to improve the monument; he submitted another proposal, which was approved with the additional cost of 34,600 guilders. At first glance, Borobudur had been restored to its old glory. Van Erp went further by carefully reconstructing the ''[[chattra]]'' (three-tiered parasol) pinnacle on top of the main stupa. However, he later dismantled the ''chattra'', citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the pinnacle, which means that the original design of Borobudur's pinnacle is actually unknown. The dismantled ''chattra'' now is stored in [[Karmawibhangga Museum]], a few hundred meters north from Borobudur.\n\nDue to the limited budget, the restoration had been primarily focused on cleaning the sculptures, and Van Erp did not solve the drainage problem. Within fifteen years, the gallery walls were sagging, and the reliefs showed signs of new cracks and deterioration.<ref name=\"unesco2004\" /> Van Erp used concrete from which [[alkali salt]]s and [[calcium hydroxide]] leached and were transported into the rest of the construction. This caused some problems, so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed.\n\n[[File:Borobudur restoration.png|thumb|upright|left|Embedding concrete and [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] [[Pipe (material)|pipe]] to improve Borobudur's drainage system during the 1973 restoration]]\n\nSmall restorations had been performed since then, but not sufficient for complete protection. During [[World War II]] and [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in 1945 to 1949, Borobudur restoration efforts were halted. The monument suffered further from the weather and drainage problems, which caused the earth core inside the temple to expand, pushing the stone structure and tilting the walls. By 1950s some parts of Borobudur were facing imminent danger of collapsing. In 1965, Indonesia asked the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] for advice on ways to counteract the problem of weathering at Borobudur and other monuments. In 1968 Professor Soekmono, then head of the Archeological Service of Indonesia, launched his \"Save Borobudur\" campaign, in an effort to organize a massive restoration project.<ref name=\"PBS\" />\n\n[[File:Save Borobudur Monument, 2.50rp+0.25 (1968).jpg|upright|thumb|A 1968 Indonesian stamp promoting restoration of Borobudur]]\nIn the late 1960s, the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]] had requested from the international community a major renovation to protect the monument. In 1973, a master plan to restore Borobudur was created.<ref name=\"1973restoration\" /> Through an ''Agreement concerning the Voluntary Contributions to be Given for the Execution of the Project to Preserve Borobudur'' ([[Paris]], 29 January 1973), 5 countries agreed to contribute to the restoration: [[Australia]] ([[Australian dollar|AUD]] $200,000), [[Belgium]] ([[Belgian franc|BEF]] fr.250,000), [[Cyprus]] ([[Cypriot pound|CYP]] \u00a3100,000), [[France]] ([[US Dollar|USD]] $77,500) and [[Germany]] ([[Deutsche Mark|DEM]] DM 2,000,000).<ref name=\"f1DIg\" /> The Indonesian government and [[UNESCO]] then undertook the complete overhaul of the monument in a big restoration project between 1975 and 1982.<ref name=\"unesco2004\" /> In 1975, the actual work began. Over one million stones were dismantled and removed during the restoration, and set aside like pieces of a massive jig-saw puzzle to be individually identified, catalogued, cleaned and treated for preservation. Borobudur became a testing ground for new conservation techniques, including new procedures to battle the microorganisms attacking the stone.<ref name=\"PBS\" /> The foundation was stabilized, and all 1,460 panels were cleaned. The restoration involved the dismantling of the five square platforms and the improvement of drainage by embedding water channels into the monument. Both impermeable and filter layers were added. This colossal project involved around 600 people to restore the monument and cost a total of US$6,901,243.<ref name=\"ZP492\" />\n\nAfter the renovation was finished, UNESCO listed Borobudur as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1991.<ref name=\"unesco-whc\" /> It is listed under Cultural criteria (i) \"to represent a masterpiece of human creative genius\", (ii) \"to exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design\", and (vi) \"to be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance\".<ref name=\"unesco-whc\" />\n\nIn December 2017, the idea to reinstall ''[[chattra]]'' on top of Borobudur main stupa's ''yasthi'' has been revisited. However, expert said a thorough study is needed on restoring the umbrella-shaped pinnacle. By early 2018, the ''chattra'' restoration has not yet commenced.<ref name=\"2Z4v9\" />\n\n===Contemporary events===\n[[File:Borobudur monks 1.jpg|thumb|Buddhist pilgrims meditate on the top platform]]\n\n====Religious ceremony====\nFollowing the major 1973 renovation funded by [[UNESCO]],<ref name=\"1973restoration\" /> Borobudur is once again used as a [[place of worship]] and pilgrimage. Once a year, during the [[full moon]] in May or June, [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Buddhists in Indonesia]] observe [[Vesak]] ({{lang-id|Waisak}}) day commemorating the birth, death, and the time when [[Gautama Buddha|Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama]] attained the highest wisdom to become the Buddha Shakyamuni. Vesak is an official [[Public holidays in Indonesia|national holiday]] in Indonesia,<ref name=\"XNF0R\" /> and the ceremony is centered at the three Buddhist temples by walking from [[Mendut]] to [[Pawon]] and ending at Borobudur.<ref name=\"walubi-The_Meaning_of_Procession\" />\n\n====Tourism====\n[[File:Borobudur on Vesak Day 2011.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vesak]] ceremony at Borobudur]]\nThe monument is the single most visited [[tourism in Indonesia|tourist attraction in Indonesia]]. In 1974, 260,000 tourists, of whom 36,000 were foreigners, visited the monument.<ref name=\"Hampton2004\" /> The figure climbed to {{Nowrap|2.5 million}} visitors annually (80% were domestic tourists) in the mid-1990s, before [[1997 East Asian financial crisis|the country's economic crisis]].<ref name=\"Sedyawati1997\" /> Tourism development, however, has been criticized for not including the local community, giving rise to occasional conflicts.<ref name=\"Hampton2004\" /> In 2003, residents and small businesses around Borobudur organized several meetings and poetry protests, objecting to a provincial government plan to build a three-storey mall complex, dubbed the \"Java World\".<ref name=\"2Z7Xj\" />\n\nInternational tourism awards were given to Borobudur archaeological park, such as [[Pacific Asia Travel Association|PATA]] Grand Pacific Award 2004, PATA Gold Award Winner 2011, and PATA Gold Award Winner 2012. In June 2012, Borobudur was recorded in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the world's largest Buddhist archaeological site.<ref name=\"sEzfV\" />\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bezoekers van de Borobudur TMnr 20027041.jpg|thumb|Tourists in Borobudur]]\n\n====Conservation====\nUNESCO identified three specific areas of concern under the present state of conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements.<ref name=\"UNESCO report\" /> The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure.<ref name=\"UNESCO report\" /> The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place to limit the number of visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.<ref name=\"UNESCO report\" />\n\nIn August 2014, the Conservation Authority of Borobudur reported some severe abrasion of the stone stairs caused by the scraping of visitors' footwear. The conservation authority planned to install wooden stairs to cover and protect the original stone stairs, just like those installed in Angkor Wat.<ref name=\"jnEYg\" />\n\n====Rehabilitation====\n[[File:Borobudur route map.png|thumb|Location of Borobudur relative to Mount Merapi and Yogyakarta]]\nBorobudur was heavily affected by the eruption of [[Mount Merapi]] in [[2010 eruptions of Mount Merapi|October and November 2010]]. [[Volcanic ash]] from Merapi fell on the temple complex, which is approximately {{convert|28|km|mi|0}} west-southwest of the crater. A layer of ash up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|0}}<ref name=\"antara2983\" /> thick fell on the temple statues during the eruption of 3\u20135 November, also killing nearby vegetation, with experts fearing that the acidic ash might damage the historic site. The temple complex was closed from 5 to 9 November to clean up the ashfall.<ref name=\"zcvVs\" /><ref name=\"84r4s\" />\n\n[[UNESCO]] donated US$3 million as a part of the costs towards the rehabilitation of Borobudur after [[Mount Merapi]]'s 2010 eruption.<ref name=\"gV00f\" /> More than 55,000 stone blocks comprising the temple's structure were dismantled to restore the drainage system, which had been clogged by slurry after the rain. The restoration was finished in November.<ref name=\"VSAmy\" />\n\nIn January 2012, two German stone-conservation experts spent ten days at the site analyzing the temples and making recommendations to ensure their long-term preservation.<ref name=\"8hzZ0\" /> In June, Germany agreed to contribute $130,000 to UNESCO for the second phase of rehabilitation, in which six experts in stone conservation, [[microbiology]], [[structural engineering]] and [[chemical engineering]] would spend a week in Borobudur in June, then return for another visit in September or October. These missions would launch the preservation activities recommended in the January report and would include capacity building activities to enhance the preservation capabilities of governmental staff and young conservation experts.<ref name=\"wdDe1\" />\n\nOn 14 February 2014, major tourist attractions in Yogyakarta and Central Java, including Borobudur, [[Prambanan]] and [[Ratu Boko]], were closed to visitors, after being severely affected by the volcanic ash from the eruption of [[Kelud]] volcano in East Java, located around 200 kilometers east from Yogyakarta. Workers covered the iconic stupas and statues of Borobudur temple to protect the structure from volcanic ash. The Kelud volcano erupted on 13 February 2014 with an explosion heard as far away as Yogyakarta.<ref name=\"ZRpjE\" />\n\n====Security threats====\nOn 21 January 1985, nine stupas were badly damaged by [[1985 Borobudur bombing|nine bombs]].<ref name=\"glXES\" /><ref name=\"Tempo\" /> In 1991, a blind Muslim preacher, [[Husein Ali Al Habsyie]], was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for masterminding a series of bombings in the mid-1980s, including the temple attack.<ref name=\"qStJf\" /> Two other members of the Islamic [[Extremism|extremist group]] that carried out the bombings were each sentenced to 20 years in 1986, and another man received a 13-year prison term.\n\nOn 27 May 2006, an [[2006 Yogyakarta earthquake|earthquake]] of 6.2 magnitude struck the south coast of Central Java. The event caused severe damage around the region and casualties to the nearby city of [[Yogyakarta]], but Borobudur remained intact.<ref name=\"ZKhbU\" />\n\nIn August 2014, Indonesian police and security forces tightened the security in and around Borobudur temple compound, as a precaution to a threat posted on social media by a self-proclaimed Indonesian branch of [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria|ISIS]], citing that the terrorists planned to destroy Borobudur and other statues in Indonesia.<ref name=\"wGCI5\" /> The security improvements included the repair and increased deployment of [[CCTV]] monitors and the implementation of a night patrol in and around the temple compound. The [[jihadist]] group follows a strict interpretation of Islam that condemns any [[anthropomorphic]] representations such as sculptures as [[idolatry]].\n\n====Visitor overload problem====\nThe high volume of visitors ascending the Borobudur's narrow stairs, has caused a severe wear out on the stone of the stairs, eroding the stones surface and made them thinner and smoother. Overall, Borobudur has 2,033 surfaces of stone stairs, spread over four cardinal directions; including the west side, the east, south and north. There are around 1,028 surfaces of them, or about 49.15 percent, that are severely worn out.<ref name=\"Kompas-Ika\" />\n\nTo avoid further wear of stairs' stones, since November 2014, two main sections of Borobudur stairs \u2013 the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides \u2013 are covered with wooden structures. The similar technique has been applied in [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids.<ref name=\"Kompas-Ika\" /> In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the stairs with [[rubber]] cover.<ref name=\"rvtHl\" /> Proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals.<ref name=\"l6WAT\" />\n\n==Architecture==\nThe archaeological excavation into Borobudur during reconstruction suggests that adherents of Hinduism or a pre-Indic faith had already begun to erect a large structure on Borobudur's hill before the site was appropriated by Buddhists. The foundations are unlike any Hindu or Buddhist shrine structures, and therefore, the initial structure is considered more indigenous Javanese than Hindu or Buddhist.<ref name=\"Golden\" />\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|left|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a [[Mandala]]]]\nBorobudur is built as a single large [[stupa]] and, when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant [[Vajrayana|tantric Buddhist]] ''[[mandala]]'', simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind.<ref name=\"8itFX\" /> The original foundation is a square, approximately {{convert|118|m|ft}} on each side. It has nine platforms, of which the lower six are [[Square (geometry)|square]] and the upper three are [[Circle|circular]].<ref name=\"5M1rn\" /> The upper platform features seventy-two small stupas surrounding one large central stupa. Each stupa is bell-shaped and pierced by numerous decorative openings. Statues of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] sit inside the pierced enclosures.\n\nThe design of Borobudur took the form of a [[step pyramid]]. Previously, the [[Prehistoric Indonesia|prehistoric]] [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[megalithic]] culture in Indonesia had constructed several earth mounds and stone step pyramid structures called ''punden berundak'' as discovered in Pangguyangan site near Cisolok<ref name=\"t8HH0\" /> and in Cipari near Kuningan.<ref name=\"BBjtH\" /> The construction of stone pyramids is based on native beliefs that mountains and high places are the abode of ancestral spirits or [[hyang]]s.<ref name=\"C2mb4\" /> The ''punden berundak'' step pyramid is the basic design in Borobudur,<ref name=\"Htvul\" /> believed to be the continuation of older megalithic tradition incorporated with Mahayana Buddhist ideas and symbolism.<ref name=\"MuWfW\" />\n\n[[File:Panoramic views of Borobudur.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Borobudur, it took the form of a [[step pyramid]] and mandala plan]]\n\nThe monument's three divisions symbolize the three \"realms\" of Buddhist cosmology, namely ''[[Buddhist cosmology#Desire Realm (K\u0101madh\u0101tu)|Kamadhatu]]'' (the world of desires), ''[[Rupajhana|Rupadhatu]]'' (the world of forms), and finally ''[[Arupadhatu]]'' (the formless world). Ordinary sentient beings live out their lives on the lowest level, the realm of desire. Those who have burnt out all desire for continued existence leave the world of desire and live in the world on the level of form alone: they see forms but are not drawn to them. Finally, full Buddhas go beyond even form and experience reality at its purest, most fundamental level, the formless ocean of nirvana.<ref name=\"M9pn9\" /> The liberation from the cycle of [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]] where the enlightened soul had no longer attached to worldly form corresponds to the concept of [[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101]], the complete voidness or [[anatta|the nonexistence of the self]]. ''K\u0101madh\u0101tu'' is represented by the base, ''Rupadhatu'' by the five square platforms (the body), and ''Arupadhatu'' by the three circular platforms and the large topmost stupa. The architectural features between the three stages have metaphorical differences. For instance, square and detailed decorations in the ''Rupadhatu'' disappear into plain circular platforms in the ''Arupadhatu'' to represent how the world of forms\u2014where men are still attached with forms and names\u2014changes into the world of the formless.<ref name=\"Yl6eq\" />\n\nCongregational worship in Borobudur is performed in a walking pilgrimage. Pilgrims are guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform represents one stage of [[Four stages of enlightenment|enlightenment]]. The path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize [[Buddhist cosmology]].<ref name=\"Ferschin2004\" />\n\nIn 1885, a hidden structure under the base was accidentally discovered.<ref name=\"kompas\" /> The \"hidden footing\" contains reliefs, 160 of which are narratives describing the real ''K\u0101madh\u0101tu''. The remaining reliefs are panels with short inscriptions that apparently provide instructions for the sculptors, illustrating the scenes to be carved.<ref name=\"p18\" /> The real base is hidden by an encasement base, the purpose of which remains a mystery. It was first thought that the real base had to be covered to prevent a disastrous subsidence of the monument into the hill.<ref name=\"p18\" /> There is another theory that the encasement base was added because the original hidden footing was incorrectly designed, according to ''[[Vastu Shastra]]'', the Indian ancient book about architecture and [[town planning]].<ref name=\"kompas\" /> Regardless of why it was commissioned, the encasement base was built with detailed and meticulous design and with aesthetic and religious consideration.\n\n===Building structure===\n[[File:Borobudur Cross Section en.svg|thumb|left|300px|Half cross-section with 4:6:9 height ratio for foot, body and head, respectively]]\n\nApproximately {{convert|55000|m3|cuyd}} of [[andesite]] stones were taken from neighbouring stone quarries to build the monument.<ref name=\"Soekmono16\" /> The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Knobs, indentations and [[Dovetail joint|dovetails]] were used to form joints between stones. The roof of stupas, niches and arched gateways were constructed in [[Corbel arch|corbelling]] method. [[Relief]]s were created ''[[in situ]]'' after the building had been completed.\n\nThe monument is equipped with a good [[drainage]] system to cater to the area's high [[Precipitation (meteorology)|stormwater]] run-off. To prevent flooding, 100 spouts are installed at each corner, each with a unique carved [[gargoyle]] in the shape of a [[giant (mythology)|giant]] or [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]].\n\n[[File:Lens Flare at Borobudur Stairs Kala Arches.JPG|thumb|upright|Stairs of Borobudur through arches of [[K\u0101la (time)|Kala]]]]\n[[File:Borobudur mural.jpg|thumb|upright|A narrow corridor with reliefs on the wall]]\n\nBorobudur differs markedly from the general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar to the shape of [[pyramid]], Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a ''stupa'', instead of a temple.<ref name=\"Soekmono16\" /> A ''stupa'' is intended as a [[shrine]] for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.\n\nLittle is known about [[Gunadharma]], the architect of the complex.<ref name=\"Long\" /> His name is recounted from Javanese folk tales rather than from written inscriptions.\n\nThe basic unit of measurement used during construction was the ''tala'', defined as the length of a human face from the forehead's hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance.<ref name=\"Atmadi1988\" /> The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the [[fractal]] and [[Self-similarity|self-similar]] geometry in Borobudur's design.<ref name=\"Atmadi1988\" /><ref name=\"fraktal\" /> This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the ''tala'' have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, as is the case with the temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia.<ref name=\"Long\" />\n\nThe main structure can be divided into three components: base, body, and top.<ref name=\"Long\" /> The base is {{convert|123|x|123|m|ft|abbr=on}} in size with {{convert|4|m|ft}} walls.<ref name=\"Soekmono16\" /> The body is composed of five square platforms, each of diminishing height. The first terrace is set back {{convert|7|m|ft}} from the edge of the base. Each subsequent terrace is set back {{convert|2|m|ft}}, leaving a narrow corridor at each stage. The top consists of three circular platforms, with each stage supporting a row of perforated ''[[stupa]]s'', arranged in [[Concentric|concentric circles]]. There is one main dome at the center, the top of which is the highest point of the monument, {{convert|35|m|ft}} above ground level. Stairways at the center of each of the four sides give access to the top, with a number of arched gates overlooked by 32 lion statues. The gates are adorned with [[K\u0101la (time)|Kala]]'s head carved on top of each and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makaras]] projecting from each side. This Kala-Makara motif is commonly found on the gates of Javanese temples. The main entrance is on the eastern side, the location of the first narrative reliefs. Stairways on the slopes of the hill also link the monument to the low-lying plain.\n\n==Reliefs==\n[[File:Borobudur Reliefs Position en.svg|thumb|left|The position of narrative bas-reliefs stories on Borobudur wall]]\n\nBorobudur is constructed in such a way that it reveals various levels of terraces, showing intricate architecture that goes from being heavily ornamented with bas-reliefs to being plain in ''Arupadhatu'' circular terraces.<ref name=\"LUQR2\" /> The first four terrace walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.<ref name=\"UBDsh\" />\n\nThe bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also [[Indonesian architecture|native vernacular architecture]]. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]], gods, [[boddhisattva|bodhisattva]]s, [[kinnara]]s, [[gandharva]]s and [[apsara]]s. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is [[Borobudur Ship]].<ref name=\"QeTbh\" /> Today, the actual-size replica of Borobudur Ship that had sailed from Indonesia to Africa in 2004 is displayed in the [[Samudra Raksa Museum]], located a few hundred meters north of Borobudur.<ref name=\"w8rJ4\" />\n\nThe Borobudur reliefs also pay close attention to Indian aesthetic discipline, such as pose and gesture that contain certain meanings and aesthetic value. The reliefs of noblemen, and noble women, kings, or divine beings such as [[apsara]]s, [[Tara (Buddhism)|tara]]s and boddhisattvas are usually portrayed in [[tribhanga]] pose, the three-bend pose on neck, hips, and knee, with one leg resting and one upholding the body weight. This position is considered as the most graceful pose, such as the figure of [[Surasundari]] holding a lotus.<ref name=\"Zdcr0\" />\n\nDuring Borobudur excavation, archeologists discovered colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, as well as bits of [[gold foil]], and concluded that the monument that we see today \u2013 a dark gray mass of [[andesite|volcanic stone]], lacking in colour \u2013 was probably once coated with ''varjalepa'' white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching.<ref name=\"World Religions\" /> The same ''vajralepa'' plaster can also be found in [[Sari Temple|Sari]], [[Kalasan]] and [[Sewu]] temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin-left:1em; float:right;\"\n|+Narrative panels distribution<ref name=\"p20\" />\n|-\n!

The total relief surface is {{convert|2500|m2|sqft}}, and they are distributed at the hidden foot (''K\u0101madh\u0101tu'') and the five square platforms (''Rupadhatu'').<ref name=\"p20\" />\n\nThe narrative panels, which tell the story of [[Sudhana]] and Manohara,<ref name=\"uJFNP\" /> are grouped into 11 series that encircle the monument with a total length of {{convert|3000|m|ft}}. The hidden foot contains the first series with 160 narrative panels, and the remaining 10 series are distributed throughout walls and balustrades in four galleries starting from the eastern entrance stairway to the left. Narrative panels on the wall read from right to left, while those on the balustrade read from left to right. This conforms with ''[[pradaksina]]'', the ritual of circumambulation performed by [[pilgrim]]s who move in a clockwise direction while keeping the [[sanctuary]] to their right.<ref name=\"p21\" />\n\nThe hidden foot depicts the workings of [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic law]]. The walls of the first gallery have two superimposed series of reliefs; each consists of 120 panels. The upper part depicts the [[Gautama Buddha|biography of the Buddha]], while the lower part of the wall and also the balustrades in the first and the second galleries tell the story of the Buddha's former lives.<ref name=\"p20\" /> The remaining panels are devoted to Sudhana's further wandering about his search, terminated by his attainment of the [[Perfection of Wisdom|Perfect Wisdom]].\n\n===The law of karma (Karmavibhangga)===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf O 89 op de verborgen voet van de Borobudur TMnr 10015826.jpg|thumb|right| The Karmavibangga scene on Borobudur's hidden foot, on the right depicting sinful act of killing and cooking turtles and fishes, on the left those who make living by killing animals will be tortured in hell, by being cooked alive, being cut, or being thrown into a burning house.]]\n\nThe 160 hidden panels do not form a continuous story, but each panel provides one complete illustration of [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da|cause and effect]].<ref name=\"p20\" /> There are depictions of blameworthy activities, from gossip to murder, with their corresponding punishments. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. The pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, complete with the full panorama of ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]'' (the endless cycle of birth and death). The encasement base of the Borobudur temple was disassembled to reveal the hidden foot, and the reliefs were photographed by Casijan Chepas in 1890. It is these photographs that are displayed in [[Borobudur Museum]] (Karmawibhangga Museum), located just several hundred meters north of the temple. During the restoration, the foot encasement was reinstalled, covering the Karmawibhangga reliefs. Today, only the southeast corner of the hidden foot is revealed and visible for visitors.\n\n===The story of Prince Siddhartha and the birth of Buddha (Lalitavistara)===\n{{Main|The birth of Buddha (Lalitavistara)}}\n[[File:Queen Maya, Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|[[Queen Maya]] riding horse carriage retreating to [[Lumbini]] to give birth to Prince [[Siddhartha Gautama]]]]\nThe story starts with the descent of the Lord Buddha from the [[Tushita]] heaven and ends with his first sermon in the Deer Park near [[Benares]].<ref name=\"p21\" /> The relief shows the birth of the Buddha as [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]], son of King [[Suddhodana]] and [[Queen Maya]] of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]] (in Nepal).\n\nThe story is preceded by 27 panels showing various preparations, in the heavens and on the earth, to welcome the final incarnation of the [[Bodhisattva]].<ref name=\"p21\" /> Before descending from Tushita heaven, the Bodhisattva entrusted his crown to his successor, the future Buddha [[Maitreya]]. He descended on earth in the shape of [[white elephant]]s with six [[tusk]]s, penetrated to Queen Maya's right womb. Queen Maya had a dream of this event, which was interpreted that his son would become either a sovereign or a Buddha.\n[[File:Siddharta Gautama Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|Prince [[Siddhartha Gautama]] became an [[ascetic]] hermit.]]\nWhile Queen Maya felt that it was the time to give birth, she went to the [[Lumbini]] park outside the Kapilavastu city. She stood under a [[plaksa]] tree, holding one branch with her right hand, and she gave birth to a son, Prince Siddhartha. The story on the panels continues until the prince becomes the Buddha.\n\n===The stories of Buddha's previous life (Jataka) and other legendary people (Avadana)===\n[[Jataka]]s are stories about the Buddha before he was born as Prince Siddhartha.<ref name=\"Soekmono26\" /> They are the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The future Buddha may appear in them as a king, an outcast, a god, an elephant\u2014but, in whatever form, he exhibits some virtue that the tale thereby inculcates.<ref name=\"HqZ8l\" /> [[Avadana]]s are similar to jatakas, but the main figure is not the Bodhisattva himself. The saintly deeds in avadanas are attributed to other legendary persons. Jatakas and avadanas are treated in one and the same series in the reliefs of Borobudur.\n\nThe first twenty lower panels in the first gallery on the wall depict the ''Sudhanakumaravadana,'' or the saintly deeds of [[Sudhana]]. The first 135 upper panels in the same gallery on the balustrades are devoted to the 34 legends of the ''[[Jatakamala]]''.<ref name=\"Soekmono29\" /> The remaining 237 panels depict stories from other sources, as do the lower series and panels in the second gallery. Some jatakas are depicted twice, for example the story of King Sibhi ([[Rama]]'s forefather).\n\n===Sudhana's search for the ultimate truth (Gandavyuha)===\nGandavyuha is the story told in the final chapter of the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'' about Sudhana's tireless wandering in search of the Highest Perfect Wisdom. It covers two galleries (third and fourth) and also half of the second gallery, comprising in total of 460 panels.<ref name=\"Soekmono32\" /> The principal figure of the story, the youth Sudhana, son of an extremely rich merchant, appears on the 16th panel. The preceding 15 panels form a [[prologue]] to the story of the miracles during Buddha's ''[[Sam\u0101dhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]]'' in the [[Jetavana|Garden of Jeta]] at [[Sravasti]].\n\nDuring his search, Sudhana visited no fewer than thirty teachers, but none of them had satisfied him completely. He was then instructed by [[Manjusri]] to meet the monk Megasri, where he was given the first doctrine. As his journey continues, Sudhana meets (in the following order) Supratisthita, the physician Megha (Spirit of Knowledge), the banker Muktaka, the monk Saradhvaja, the [[upasaka|upasika]] Asa (Spirit of Supreme Enlightenment), Bhismottaranirghosa, the [[Brahmin]] Jayosmayatna, Princess Maitrayani, the monk Sudarsana, a boy called Indriyesvara, the upasika Prabhuta, the banker Ratnachuda, King [[Anala]], the god [[Shiva|Siva Mahadeva]], [[Queen Maya]], [[Bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]] and then back to Manjusri. Each meeting has given Sudhana a specific doctrine, knowledge and wisdom. These meetings are shown in the third gallery.\n\nAfter the last meeting with Manjusri, Sudhana went to the residence of Bodhisattva [[Samantabhadra]], depicted in the fourth gallery. The entire series of the fourth gallery is devoted to the teaching of Samantabhadra. The narrative panels finally end with Sudhana's achievement of the Supreme Knowledge and the Ultimate Truth.<ref name=\"p35\" />\n\n==Buddha statues==\n[[File:Borobudur-perfect-buddha.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Buddha statue with the hand position of ''[[Dharmachakra|dharmachakra mudra]]'']]\n\nApart from the story of the [[Buddhist cosmology]] carved in stone, Borobudur has many statues of various Buddhas. The cross-legged statues are seated in a [[lotus position]] and distributed on the five square platforms (the ''Rupadhatu'' level), as well as on the top platform (the ''Arupadhatu'' level).\n\nThe Buddha statues are in niches at the ''Rupadhatu'' level, arranged in rows on the outer sides of the balustrades, the number of statues decreasing as platforms progressively diminish to the upper level. The first balustrades have 104 niches, the second 104, the third 88, the fourth 72 and the fifth 64. In total, there are 432 Buddha statues at the ''Rupadhatu'' level.<ref name=\"p35-36\" /> At the ''Arupadhatu'' level (or the three circular platforms), Buddha statues are placed inside perforated [[stupa]]s. The first circular platform has 32 stupas, the second 24 and the third 16, which adds up to 72 stupas.<ref name=\"p35-36\" /> Of the original 504 Buddha statues, over 300 are damaged (mostly headless), and 43 are missing. Since the monument's discovery, heads have been acquired as collector's items, mostly by Western museums.<ref name=\"lgraW\" /> Some of these Buddha heads are now displayed in numbers of museums, such as the [[Tropenmuseum]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Guimet Museum|Mus\u00e9e Guimet]] in Paris, and [[The British Museum]] in [[London]].<ref name=\"1pgW0\" /> Germany has in 2014 returned its collection and funded their reattachment and further conservation of the site.<ref name=\"thejakartapost\">{{cite news |last1=Muryanto |first1=Bambang |title=Buddhas to be reunited with their heads |url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/20/buddhas-be-reunited-with-their-heads.html |accessdate=31 December 2019 |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:WLANL - Pachango - Tropenmuseum - Kop Borobudur.jpg|thumb|upright|Head from a Borobudur Buddha statue in [[Tropenmuseum]], Amsterdam.]]\n[[File:Headless buddha.jpg|thumb|upright|Headless Buddha statue in Borobudur.

There are five groups of ''mudra'': North, East, South, West and Zenith, which represent the five cardinal compass points according to [[Mahayana]]. The first four balustrades have the first four ''mudras'': North, East, South and West, of which the Buddha statues that face one compass direction have the corresponding ''mudra''. Buddha statues at the fifth balustrades and inside the 72 stupas on the top platform have the same ''mudra'': [[Zenith]]. Each ''mudra'' represents one of the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas]]; each has its own symbolism.<ref name=\"KdQFg\" />\n\nFollowing the order of ''Pradakshina'' (clockwise circumumbulation) starting from the East, the ''mudras'' of the Borobudur buddha statues are:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px;\"|Statue\n! style=\"width:70px;\"|Mudra\n! style=\"width:140px;\"|Symbolic meaning\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Dhyani Buddha\n! style=\"width:60px;\"|Cardinal Point\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Location of the Statue\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur TMnr 10016277.jpg|70px]]\n|''Bhumisparsa mudra''\n|Calling the Earth to witness\n|[[Aksobhya]]\n|East\n|''Rupadhatu'' niches on the first four eastern balustrades\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur TMnr 60013976.jpg|70px]]\n|''Vara mudra''\n|Benevolence, alms giving\n|[[Ratnasambhava]]\n|South\n|''Rupadhatu'' niches on the first four southern balustrades\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur voorstellende Dhyani Boeddha Amitabha TMnr 10016276.jpg|70px]]\n|''Dhyana mudra''\n|Concentration and meditation\n|[[Amitabha]]\n|West\n|''Rupadhatu'' niches on the first four western balustrades\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur voorstellende Dhyani Boeddha Amogasiddha TMnr 10016274.jpg|70px]]\n|''Abhaya mudra''\n|Courage, fearlessness\n|[[Amoghasiddhi]]\n|North\n|''Rupadhatu'' niches on the first four northern balustrades\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur voorstellende Dhyani Boeddha Vairocana TMnr 10015947.jpg|70px]]\n|''Vitarka mudra''\n|Reasoning and virtue\n|[[Vairochana]]\n|Zenith\n|''Rupadhatu'' niches in all directions on the fifth (uppermost) balustrade\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur TMnr 60019836.jpg|70px]]\n|''[[Dharmachakra|Dharmachakra mudra]]''\n|Turning the Wheel of ''dharma'' (law)\n|[[Vairochana]]\n|Zenith\n|''Arupadhatu'' in 72 perforated stupas on three rounded platforms\n|}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM President Soekarno en de Indiase premier Nehru kijken toe hoe Indira Gandhi bloemen in ontvangst neemt tijdens een bezoek aan de Borobudur TMnr 10015646.jpg|thumb|right|Sukarno took [[Nehru]] to visit Borobudur in June 1950.]]\nThe aesthetic and technical mastery of Borobudur, and also its sheer size, has evoked the sense of grandeur and pride for Indonesians. Just like [[Angkor Wat]] for Cambodian, Borobudur has become a powerful symbol for Indonesia \u2014 to testify for its past greatness. [[Sukarno]] made a point of showing the site to foreign dignitaries. The [[Suharto]] regime \u2014 realized its important symbolic and economic meanings \u2014 diligently embarked on a massive project to restore the monument with the help from UNESCO. Many museums in Indonesia contain a scale model replica of Borobudur. The monument has become almost an icon, grouped with the [[wayang]] puppet play and [[gamelan]] music into a vague classical Javanese past from which Indonesians are to draw inspiration.<ref name=\"M Wood\" />\n[[File:Coat of arms of Central Java.svg|thumb|left|upright|Emblem of [[Central Java]] displaying Borobudur.]]\nSeveral archaeological relics taken from Borobudur or its replica have been displayed in some museums in Indonesia and abroad. Other than [[Karmawibhangga Museum]] within Borobudur temple ground, some museums boast to host relics of Borobudur, such as [[National Museum (Indonesia)|Indonesian National Museum]] in Jakarta, [[Tropenmuseum]] in Amsterdam, [[British Museum]] in London, and [[Bangkok National Museum|Thai National Museum]] in Bangkok. [[Louvre]] museum in Paris, [[National Museum (Malaysia)|Malaysian National Museum]] in Kuala Lumpur, and [[Museum of World Religions]] in Taipei also displayed the replica of Borobudur.<ref name=\"World Religions\" /> The monument has drawn global attention to the classical Buddhist civilization of ancient Java.\n\nThe rediscovery and reconstruction of Borobudur has been hailed by [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Indonesian Buddhist]] as the sign of the Buddhist revival in Indonesia. In 1934, [[Narada Thera]], a missionary monk from [[Sri Lanka]], visited Indonesia for the first time as part of his journey to spread the Dharma in Southeast Asia. This opportunity was used by a few local Buddhists to revive Buddhism in Indonesia. A [[bodhi tree]] planting ceremony was held in Southeastern side of Borobudur on 10 March 1934 under the blessing of Narada Thera, and some Upasakas were ordained as monks.<ref name=\"Buddhanet\" /> Once a year, thousands of Buddhist from Indonesia and neighboring countries flock to Borobudur to commemorate national [[Vesak]] ceremony.<ref name=\"AptiJ\" />\n\nThe emblem of [[Central Java]] province and [[Magelang Regency]] bears the image of Borobudur. It has become the symbol of Central Java, and also Indonesia on a wider scale. Borobudur has become the name of several establishments, such as Borobudur University, [[Borobudur Hotel]] in Central Jakarta, and several Indonesian restaurants abroad. Borobudur has been featured in [[Rupiah]] banknote, stamps, numbers of books, publications, documentaries and Indonesian tourism promotion materials. The monument has become one of the main [[Tourism in Indonesia|tourism attraction in Indonesia]], vital for generating local economy in the region surrounding the temple. The tourism sector of the city of [[Yogyakarta]] for example, flourishes partly because of its proximity to Borobudur and Prambanan temples.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Gallery of reliefs===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Borobudur ship.JPG|<small>Relief panel of a [[Borobudur ship|ship at Borobudur]]. </small>\nFile:Musician Borobudur.jpg|<small>Musicians performing a musical ensemble, probably the early form of [[gamelan]].</small>\nFile:Apsara Borobudur.jpg|<small>The [[Apsara]] of Borobudur. </small>\nFile:Sailendra King and Queen, Borobudur.jpg|<small>The scene of King and Queen with their subjects.</small>\nFile:Borobudur relief 3.jpg|<small>One relief on a corridor wall.</small>\nFile:Borobudur Keris.jpg|<small>A weapon, probably the early form of [[kris|keris]].</small>\nFile:Borobodur2.jpg|<small>A detailed carved relief stone.</small>\nFile:Tara Borobudur 3.jpg|<small>[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] holding a [[Fly-whisk|Chamara]]</small>\nFile:Tara Borobudur 2.jpg|<small>Surasundari holding a lotus</small>\nFile:029 LalitavistaraDeva listening to Dhamma.jpg|<small>Close up of a relief</small>\nFile:Borobudur Relief Panel I.a65 (cropped), 1022a.jpg|<small>Great Departure from Lalitavistara</small>\n</gallery>\n\n===Gallery of Borobudur===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:World Heritage inscription of Borobudur Temple 1991.jpg|<small>World Heritage inscription of Borobudur Temple</small>\nFile:The procedures visiting Borobudur Temple.jpg|<small>The procedures signage for visiting Borobudur Temple</small>\nFile:The inscription of Borobudur restoration in 1973.jpg|<small>The inscription of Borobudur restoration in 1973 by the former Indonesian president Soeharto</small>\nFile:Scaterred Antefix - decorative architectural ornament either on the top of balustrade on Borobudur temple wall.jpg|<small>The scattered parts of Borobudur Temple at Karmawibhangga Museum.

It is the world's largest Buddhist temple.<ref name=\"Guiness\" /><ref name=\"JakartaPost1\" /><ref name=\"unesco-whc\" /> The temple consists of nine stacked platforms, six square and three circular, topped by a central dome. It is decorated with 2,672 [[relief]] panels and 504 [[Buddhist art|Buddha statues]]. The central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated [[stupa]].<ref name=\"p35-36\" />\n\nBuilt in the 9th century during the reign of the [[Sailendra Dynasty]], the temple design follows [[Javanese temple architecture|Javanese]] [[Buddhist architecture]], which blends the [[Architecture of Indonesia|Indonesian]] indigenous cult of [[ancestor worship]] and the Buddhist concept of attaining [[Nirvana]].<ref name=\"unesco-whc\" /> The temple demonstrates the influences of [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art that reflects [[India]]'s influence on the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian.<ref name=\"aOtRK\" /><ref name=\"idyTD\" /> The monument is a [[shrine]] to the [[Lord Buddha]] and a place for [[Buddhist pilgrimage]]. The pilgrim journey begins at the base of the monument and follows a path around the monument, ascending to the top through three levels symbolic of [[Buddhist cosmology]]: ''[[Desire realm|K\u0101madh\u0101tu]]'' (the world of desire), ''[[R\u016bpajh\u0101na|R\u016bpadh\u0101tu]]'' (the world of forms) and ''[[Ar\u016bpajh\u0101na|Ar\u016bpadh\u0101tu]]'' (the world of formlessness). The monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of stairways and corridors with 1,460 narrative relief panels on the walls and the [[balustrade]]s. Borobudur has one of the largest and most complete ensembles of Buddhist reliefs in the world.<ref name=\"unesco-whc\" />\n\nEvidence suggests that Borobudur was constructed in the 9th century and subsequently abandoned following the 14th-century decline of [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]] kingdoms in Java and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] conversion to Islam.<ref name=\"Soekmono4\" /> Worldwide knowledge of its existence was sparked in 1814 by [[Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles]], then the [[British Java|British ruler of Java]], who was advised of its location by native Indonesians.<ref name=\"3L5mh\" /> Borobudur has since been preserved through several restorations. The largest restoration project was undertaken between 1975 and 1982 by the [[Indonesian government]] and [[UNESCO]], followed by the monument's listing as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=\"unesco-whc\" />\n\nBorobudur is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, and ranks with [[Bagan]] in [[Myanmar]] and [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]] as one of the great archeological sites of Southeast Asia. Borobudur remains popular for pilgrimage, with [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Buddhists in Indonesia]] celebrating [[Vesak|Vesak Day]] at the monument. Borobudur is Indonesia's single most visited [[tourism in Indonesia|tourist attraction]].<ref name=\"yZUgN\" /><ref name=\"Hampton2004\" /><ref name=\"Sedyawati1997\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Borobudur-Nothwest-view.jpg|thumb|480px|left|[[Candi of Indonesia|Candi]] Borobudur viewed from the northwest. The monument was mentioned in the [[Karangtengah inscription|Karangtengah]] and [[Tri Tepusan inscription]]s.]]\nIn [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], ancient temples are referred to as ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]''; thus locals refer to \"Borobudur Temple\" as ''Candi Borobudur''. The term ''candi'' also loosely describes ancient structures, for example gates and baths. The origins of the name ''Borobudur,'' however, are unclear,<ref name=\"Soekmono13\" /> although the original names of most ancient Indonesian temples are no longer known.<ref name=\"Soekmono13\" /> The name Borobudur was first written in [[Sir Thomas Raffles|Raffles]]'s [[The History of Java (1817 book)|book on Javan history]].<ref name=\"Raffles1814\" /> Raffles wrote about a monument called ''Borobudur'', but there are no older documents suggesting the same name.<ref name=\"Soekmono13\" /> The only [[old Javanese]] [[Palm-leaf manuscript|manuscript]] that hints the monument called ''Budur'' as a holy Buddhist sanctuary is ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'', written by [[Mpu Prapanca]], a Buddhist scholar of [[Majapahit]] court, in 1365.<ref name=\"moens\" />\n\nMost ''candi'' are named after a nearby village. If it followed [[Javanese language]] conventions and was named after the nearby village of ''Bore'', the monument should have been named \"BudurBoro\". Raffles thought that ''Budur'' might correspond to the modern Javanese word ''Buda'' (\"ancient\")\u2014i.e., \"ancient Boro\". He also suggested that the name might derive from ''boro'', meaning \"great\" or \"honourable\" and ''Budur'' for Buddha.<ref name=\"Soekmono13\" /> However, another archaeologist suggests the second component of the name (''Budur'') comes from Javanese term ''bhudhara'' (\"mountain\").<ref name=\"casparis\" />\n\nAnother possible etymology by Dutch archaeologist A.J. Bernet Kempers suggests that ''Borobudur'' is a corrupted simplified local [[Javanese language|Javanese]] pronunciation of ''Biara Beduhur'' written in [[Sanskrit]] as ''Vihara Buddha Uhr''. The term ''Buddha-Uhr'' could mean \"the city of Buddhas\", while another possible term ''Beduhur'' is probably an [[Old Javanese]] term, still survived today in [[Balinese language|Balinese vocabulary]], which means \"a high place\", constructed from the stem word ''dhuhur'' or ''luhur'' (high). This suggests that Borobudur means [[vihara]] of [[Buddha]] located on a high place or on a hill.<ref name=\"3WO5T\" />\n\nThe construction and inauguration of a sacred Buddhist building\u2014possibly a reference to Borobudur\u2014was mentioned in two inscriptions, both discovered in Kedu, [[Temanggung Regency]]. The [[Karangtengah inscription]], dated 824, mentioned a sacred building named ''Jinalaya'' (the realm of those who have conquered worldly desire and reached enlightenment), inaugurated by [[Pramodhawardhani]], daughter of [[Samaratungga]]. The [[Tri Tepusan inscription]], dated 842, is mentioned in the ''sima'', the (tax-free) lands awarded by \u00c7r\u012b Kahulunnan (Pramodhawardhani) to ensure the funding and maintenance of a ''Kam\u016bl\u0101n'' called ''Bh\u016bmisambh\u0101ra''.<ref name=\"4DvUu\" /> ''Kam\u016bl\u0101n'' is from the word ''mula,'' which means \"the place of origin\", a sacred building to honor the [[ancestors]], probably those of the [[Sailendra]]s. Casparis suggested that ''Bh\u016bmi Sambh\u0101ra Bhudh\u0101ra'', which in [[Sanskrit]] means \"the mountain of combined virtues of the ten stages of [[Boddhisattva]]hood\", was the original name of Borobudur.<ref name=\"4IUze\" />\n\n==Location==\n===The three temples===\n{{See also|Borobudur Temple Compounds}}\n[[File:Borobudur Map en.svg|thumb|left|380px|Straight-line arrangement of Borobudur, Pawon, and Mendut]]\nApproximately {{convert|40|km|mi}} northwest of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]] and {{convert|86|km|mi}} west of [[Surakarta]], Borobudur is located in an elevated area between two twin volcanoes, [[Mount Sundoro|Sundoro]]-[[Mount Sumbing|Sumbing]] and [[Mount Merbabu|Merbabu]]-[[Mount Merapi|Merapi]], and two rivers, the [[Progo River|Progo]] and the Elo. According to local myth, the area known as [[Kedu Plain]] is a Javanese \"[[List of Sacred Places in Java|sacred\" place]] and has been dubbed \"the garden of Java\" due to its high [[soil fertility|agricultural fertility]].<ref name=\"p1\" /> \n\nDuring the restoration in the early 20th century, it was discovered that three Buddhist temples in the region, Borobudur, [[Pawon]] and [[Mendut]], are positioned along a straight line.<ref name=\"krom\" /> A ritual relationship between the three temples must have existed, although the exact ritual process is unknown.<ref name=\"moens\" />\n\n===Ancient lake hypothesis===\n{{See also|Lake Borobudur}}\n[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudur-06.jpg|thumb|right|Borobudur is surrounded by mountains, including twin volcanoes; [[Mount Merbabu]] and [[Mount Merapi|Merapi]]]]\nSpeculation about a surrounding lake's existence was the subject of intense discussion among archaeologists in the 20th century. In 1931, a Dutch artist and scholar of Hindu and Buddhist architecture, [[W.O.J. Nieuwenkamp]], developed a [[hypothesis]] that the Kedu Plain was once a lake and Borobudur initially represented a [[lotus flower]] floating on the lake.<ref name=\"casparis\" /> It has been claimed that Borobudur was built on a bedrock hill, {{convert|265|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] and {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the floor of a dried-out [[Lake Borobudur|paleolake]].<ref name=\"Murwanto\" />\n\nDumar\u00e7ay together with Professor [[Ganapathi Thanikaimoni|Thanikaimoni]] took soil samples in 1974 and again in 1977 from trial trenches that had been dug into the hill, as well as from the plain immediately to the south. These samples were later analysed by Thanikaimoni, who examined their pollen and spore content to identify the type of vegetation that had grown in the area around the time of Borobudur's construction. They were unable to discover any pollen or spore samples that were characteristic of any vegetation known to grow in an aquatic environment such as a lake, pond or marsh. The area surrounding Borobudur appears to have been surrounded by agricultural land and palm trees at the time of the monument's construction, as is still the case today. Caesar Vo\u00fbte and the geomorphologist Dr J.J. Nossin in 1985\u201386 field studies re-examined the Borobudur lake hypothesis and confirmed the absence of a lake around Borobudur at the time of its construction and active use as a sanctuary. These findings ''A New Perspective on Some Old Questions Pertaining to Borobudur'' were published in the 2005 UNESCO publication titled \"The Restoration of Borobudur\".\n\n==History==\n===Construction===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Temperaschilderij voorstellende de Borobudur als bedevaartsoord TMnr 75-2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A painting by G.B. Hooijer (c. 1916\u20131919) reconstructing the scene of Borobudur during its heyday]]\n\nThere are no known records of construction or the intended purpose of Borobudur.<ref name=\"Soekmono9\" /> The duration of construction has been estimated by comparison of [[stone carving|carved]] reliefs on the temple's hidden foot and the [[inscription]]s commonly used in royal charters during the 8th and 9th centuries. Borobudur was likely founded around 800 AD.<ref name=\"Soekmono9\" /> This corresponds to the period between 760 and 830&nbsp;AD, the peak of the [[Sailendra|Sailendra dynasty]] rule over [[Medang|Mataram kingdom]] in central Java,<ref name=\"IzEy0\" /> when their power encompassed not only the [[Srivijaya|Srivijayan Empire]] but also [[Ligor|southern Thailand]], Indianized kingdoms of [[Philippines]], North Malaya (Kedah, also known in Indian texts as the ancient Hindu state of Kadaram).<ref>[[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]]</ref><ref>[[Ligor inscription]]</ref><ref>Coed\u00e8s, George (1968). Walter F. Vella, ed. The Indianized States of Southeast Asia. trans.Susan Brown Cowing. University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8248-0368-1}}.</ref> The construction has been estimated to have taken 75 years with completion during the reign of [[Samaratungga]] in 825.<ref name=\"Dumarcay\" /><ref name=\"JAzWi\" />\n\nThere is uncertainty about Hindu and Buddhist rulers in [[Java]] around that time. The Sailendras were known as ardent followers of Buddhism, though stone inscriptions found at Sojomerto also suggest they may have been Hindus.<ref name=\"Dumarcay\" /> It was during this time that many Hindu and Buddhist monuments were built on the plains and mountains around the Kedu Plain. The Buddhist monuments, including Borobudur, were erected around the same period as the Hindu [[Shiva]] [[Prambanan]] temple compound. In 732&nbsp;AD, the Shivaite King [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]] commissioned a [[Shivalinga]] sanctuary to be built on the Wukir hill, only {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Borobudur.<ref name=\"holing\" />\n\nConstruction of Buddhist temples, including Borobudur, at that time was possible because Sanjaya's immediate successor, [[Rakai Panangkaran]], granted his permission to the Buddhist followers to build such temples.<ref name=\"meulen\" /> In fact, to show his respect, Panangkaran gave the village of [[Kalasan]] to the Buddhist community, as is written in the Kalasan Charter dated 778 AD.<ref name=\"meulen\" /> This has led some archaeologists to believe that there was never serious conflict concerning religion in Java as it was possible for a Hindu king to patronize the establishment of a Buddhist monument; or for a Buddhist king to act likewise.<ref name=\"Soekmono10\" /> However, it is likely that there were two rival royal dynasties in Java at the time\u2014the Buddhist Sailendra and the [[Saivite]] Sanjaya\u2014in which the latter triumphed over their rival in the 856 battle on the [[Ratu Boko|Ratubaka]] plateau.<ref name=\"hall\" /> Similar confusion also exists regarding the Lara Jonggrang temple at the [[Prambanan]] complex, which was believed to have been erected by the victor [[Rakai Pikatan]] as the Sanjaya dynasty's reply to Borobudur,<ref name=\"hall\" /> but others suggest that there was a climate of peaceful coexistence where Sailendra involvement exists in Lara Jonggrang.<ref name=\"ZgPuX\" />\n\n===Abandonment===\n[[File:Borobudur 2008.JPG|thumb|left|Borobudur stupas overlooking a mountain. For centuries, it was deserted.]]\nBorobudur lay hidden for centuries under layers of [[volcanic ash]] and jungle growth. The facts behind its abandonment remain a mystery. It is not known when active use of the monument and Buddhist pilgrimage to it ceased. Sometime between 928 and 1006, King [[Mpu Sindok]] moved the capital of the [[Medang Kingdom]] to the region of [[East Java]] after a series of volcanic eruptions; it is not certain whether this influenced the abandonment, but several sources mention this as the most likely period of abandonment.<ref name=\"Soekmono4\" /><ref name=\"Murwanto\" /> The monument is mentioned vaguely as late as {{circa}} 1365, in [[Mpu Prapanca]]'s ''[[Nagarakretagama]],'' written during the [[Majapahit]] era and mentioning \"the vihara in Budur\".<ref name=\"AikB1\" /> Soekmono (1976) also mentions the popular belief that the temples were disbanded when the population converted to Islam in the 15th century.<ref name=\"Soekmono4\" />\n\nThe monument was not forgotten completely, though folk stories gradually shifted from its past glory into more [[superstitious]] beliefs associated with bad luck and misery. Two [[Javanese historical texts|old Javanese chronicles]] (''babad'') from the 18th century mention cases of bad luck associated with the monument. According to the ''[[Babad Tanah Jawi]]'' (or the ''History of Java''), the monument was a fatal factor for Mas Dana, a rebel who revolted against Pakubuwono I, the king of [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] in 1709.<ref name=\"Soekmono4\" /> It was mentioned that the \"Redi Borobudur\" hill was besieged and the insurgents were defeated and sentenced to death by the king. In the ''[[Babad Mataram]]'' (or the ''History of the Mataram Kingdom''), the monument was associated with the misfortune of Prince Monconagoro, the crown prince of the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] in 1757.<ref name=\"p5\" /> In spite of a taboo against visiting the monument, \"he took what is written as ''the knight who was captured in a cage'' (a statue in one of the perforated stupas)\". Upon returning to his palace, he fell ill and died one day later.\n\n===Rediscovery===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Europese mannen poseren op het tempelcomplex van de Borobudur bij de bovenste stupa waarop een afdak en trapleuningen zijn geplaatst TMnr 60043646.jpg|upright|thumb|Borobudur's main stupa in mid 19th-century, a wooden deck had been installed above the main stupa.]]\nFollowing [[Invasion of Java (1811)|its capture]], Java was under British administration from 1811 to 1816. The appointed governor was Lieutenant [[Governor-General]] [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]], who took great interest in the history of Java. He collected Javanese antiques and made notes through contacts with local inhabitants during his tour throughout the island. On an inspection tour to [[Semarang]] in 1814, he was informed about a big monument deep in a jungle near the village of Bumisegoro.<ref name=\"p5\" /> He was not able to see the site himself, but sent {{illm|Hermann Cornelius|nl|}}<!--(1774\u20131833)-->, a Dutch engineer who, among other antiquity explorations had uncovered the [[Sewu]] complex in 1806\u201307, to investigate.\nIn two months, Cornelius and his 200 men cut down trees, burned down vegetation and dug away the earth to reveal the monument. Due to the danger of collapse, he could not unearth all galleries. He reported his findings to Raffles, including various drawings. Although Raffles mentioned the discovery and hard work by Cornelius and his men in only a few sentences, he has been credited with the monument's rediscovery, as the one who had brought it to the world's attention.<ref name=\"Raffles1814\" />\n\nChristiaan Lodewijk Hartmann<!--(1795\u20131856)-->, the [[Resident (title)#Dutch colonial Residents|Resident]] of the [[Kedu Residency|Kedu region]], continued Cornelius's work, and in 1835, the whole complex was finally unearthed. His interest in Borobudur was more personal than official. Hartmann did not write any reports of his activities, in particular, the alleged story that he discovered the large statue of Buddha in the main stupa.<ref name=\"p6\" /> In 1842, Hartmann investigated the main dome, although what he discovered is unknown and the main stupa remains empty.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De Boroboudour op Java TMnr 60050687.jpg|left|thumb|Borobudur in 1872.]]\n\nThe [[Dutch East Indies]] government then commissioned Frans Carel Wilsen<!--(1813\u201399)-->, a Dutch engineering official, who studied the monument and drew hundreds of relief sketches. Jan Frederik Gerrit Brumund<!--(1814\u201363)--> was also appointed to make a detailed study of the monument, which was completed in 1859. The government intended to publish an article based on Brumund's study supplemented by Wilsen's drawings, but Brumund refused to cooperate. The government then commissioned another scholar, [[Conradus Leemans]]<!--(1809\u201393)-->, who compiled a [[monograph]] based on Brumund's and Wilsen's sources. In 1873, the first monograph of the detailed study of Borobudur was published, followed by its French translation a year later.<ref name=\"p6\" /> The first photograph of the monument was taken in 1872 by the Dutch-[[Flemish people|Flemish]] engraver [[Isidore van Kinsbergen]].<ref name=\"p42\" />\n\nAppreciation of the site developed slowly, and it served for some time largely as a source of souvenirs and income for \"souvenir hunters\" and thieves. In 1882, the chief inspector of cultural artifacts recommended that Borobudur be entirely disassembled with the relocation of reliefs into museums due to the unstable condition of the monument.<ref name=\"p42\" /> As a result, the government appointed Willem Pieter Groeneveldt<!--(1841\u20131915)-->, curator of the archaeological collection of the [[Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences|Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences]],<ref name=\"olbT2\" /> to undertake a thorough investigation of the site and to assess the actual condition of the complex; his report found that these fears were unjustified and recommended it be left intact.\n\nBorobudur was considered as the source of souvenirs, and parts of its sculptures were looted, some even with colonial-government consent. In 1896 [[King Chulalongkorn]] of [[Siam]] visited Java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from Borobudur. These include thirty pieces taken from a number of relief panels, five buddha images, two lions, one gargoyle, several kala motifs from the stairs and gateways, and a guardian statue ([[dvarapala]]). Several of these artifacts, most notably the lions, dvarapala, kala, makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in the Java Art room in [[Bangkok National Museum|The National Museum in Bangkok]].<ref name=\"kw2cs\" />\n\n===Restoration===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De Borobudur TMnr 10023620.jpg|thumb|right|Borobudur after Van Erp's restoration in 1911. Note the reconstructed ''chhatra'' pinnacle on top of the main stupa (now dismantled).]]\n[[File:The Unfinished Buddha of Borobudur at Karmawibhangga Museum.jpg|thumb|The [[Unfinished Buddha]] from the main stupa of Borobudur at [[Karmawibhangga Museum]], to which the Buddhists give offerings, along with the main stupa's ''chhatra'' on its back.]]\nBorobudur attracted attention in 1885, when the Dutch engineer {{illm|Jan Willem IJzerman|id||nl|}}<!--(1851\u20131932)-->, Chairman of the Archaeological Society in Yogyakarta, made a discovery about the hidden foot.<ref name=\"kompas\" /> Photographs that reveal reliefs on the hidden foot were made in 1890\u20131891.<ref name=\"p43\" /> The discovery led the Dutch East Indies government to take steps to safeguard the monument. In 1900, the government set up a commission consisting of three officials to assess the monument: Jan Lourens Andries Brandes<!--(1857\u20131905)-->, an [[Art history|art historian]], {{illm|Theodoor van Erp|nl}}, a [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch army]] engineer officer, and Benjamin Willem van de Kamer<!--(1860\u20131920)-->, a construction engineer from the Department of Public Works.\n\nIn 1902, the commission submitted a threefold plan of proposal to the government. First, the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, after fencing off the courtyards, proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should be improved by restoring floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared up to the first balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 [[Dutch guilder]]s.\n\nThe restoration then was carried out between 1907 and 1911, using the principles of [[anastylosis]] and led by Theodor van Erp.<ref name=\"unesco2004\" /> The first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, Van Erp discovered more things he could do to improve the monument; he submitted another proposal, which was approved with the additional cost of 34,600 guilders. At first glance, Borobudur had been restored to its old glory. Van Erp went further by carefully reconstructing the ''[[chattra]]'' (three-tiered parasol) pinnacle on top of the main stupa. However, he later dismantled the ''chattra'', citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the pinnacle, which means that the original design of Borobudur's pinnacle is actually unknown. The dismantled ''chattra'' now is stored in [[Karmawibhangga Museum]], a few hundred meters north from Borobudur.\n\nDue to the limited budget, the restoration had been primarily focused on cleaning the sculptures, and Van Erp did not solve the drainage problem. Within fifteen years, the gallery walls were sagging, and the reliefs showed signs of new cracks and deterioration.<ref name=\"unesco2004\" /> Van Erp used concrete from which [[alkali salt]]s and [[calcium hydroxide]] leached and were transported into the rest of the construction. This caused some problems, so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed.\n\n[[File:Borobudur restoration.png|thumb|upright|left|Embedding concrete and [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] [[Pipe (material)|pipe]] to improve Borobudur's drainage system during the 1973 restoration]]\n\nSmall restorations had been performed since then, but not sufficient for complete protection. During [[World War II]] and [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in 1945 to 1949, Borobudur restoration efforts were halted. The monument suffered further from the weather and drainage problems, which caused the earth core inside the temple to expand, pushing the stone structure and tilting the walls. By 1950s some parts of Borobudur were facing imminent danger of collapsing. In 1965, Indonesia asked the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] for advice on ways to counteract the problem of weathering at Borobudur and other monuments. In 1968 Professor Soekmono, then head of the Archeological Service of Indonesia, launched his \"Save Borobudur\" campaign, in an effort to organize a massive restoration project.<ref name=\"PBS\" />\n\n[[File:Save Borobudur Monument, 2.50rp+0.25 (1968).jpg|upright|thumb|A 1968 Indonesian stamp promoting restoration of Borobudur]]\nIn the late 1960s, the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]] had requested from the international community a major renovation to protect the monument. In 1973, a master plan to restore Borobudur was created.<ref name=\"1973restoration\" /> Through an ''Agreement concerning the Voluntary Contributions to be Given for the Execution of the Project to Preserve Borobudur'' ([[Paris]], 29 January 1973), 5 countries agreed to contribute to the restoration: [[Australia]] ([[Australian dollar|AUD]] $200,000), [[Belgium]] ([[Belgian franc|BEF]] fr.250,000), [[Cyprus]] ([[Cypriot pound|CYP]] \u00a3100,000), [[France]] ([[US Dollar|USD]] $77,500) and [[Germany]] ([[Deutsche Mark|DEM]] DM 2,000,000).<ref name=\"f1DIg\" /> The Indonesian government and [[UNESCO]] then undertook the complete overhaul of the monument in a big restoration project between 1975 and 1982.<ref name=\"unesco2004\" /> In 1975, the actual work began. Over one million stones were dismantled and removed during the restoration, and set aside like pieces of a massive jig-saw puzzle to be individually identified, catalogued, cleaned and treated for preservation. Borobudur became a testing ground for new conservation techniques, including new procedures to battle the microorganisms attacking the stone.<ref name=\"PBS\" /> The foundation was stabilized, and all 1,460 panels were cleaned. The restoration involved the dismantling of the five square platforms and the improvement of drainage by embedding water channels into the monument. Both impermeable and filter layers were added. This colossal project involved around 600 people to restore the monument and cost a total of US$6,901,243.<ref name=\"ZP492\" />\n\nAfter the renovation was finished, UNESCO listed Borobudur as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1991.<ref name=\"unesco-whc\" /> It is listed under Cultural criteria (i) \"to represent a masterpiece of human creative genius\", (ii) \"to exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design\", and (vi) \"to be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance\".<ref name=\"unesco-whc\" />\n\nIn December 2017, the idea to reinstall ''[[chattra]]'' on top of Borobudur main stupa's ''yasthi'' has been revisited. However, expert said a thorough study is needed on restoring the umbrella-shaped pinnacle. By early 2018, the ''chattra'' restoration has not yet commenced.<ref name=\"2Z4v9\" />\n\n===Contemporary events===\n[[File:Borobudur monks 1.jpg|thumb|Buddhist pilgrims meditate on the top platform]]\n\n====Religious ceremony====\nFollowing the major 1973 renovation funded by [[UNESCO]],<ref name=\"1973restoration\" /> Borobudur is once again used as a [[place of worship]] and pilgrimage. Once a year, during the [[full moon]] in May or June, [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Buddhists in Indonesia]] observe [[Vesak]] ({{lang-id|Waisak}}) day commemorating the birth, death, and the time when [[Gautama Buddha|Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama]] attained the highest wisdom to become the Buddha Shakyamuni. Vesak is an official [[Public holidays in Indonesia|national holiday]] in Indonesia,<ref name=\"XNF0R\" /> and the ceremony is centered at the three Buddhist temples by walking from [[Mendut]] to [[Pawon]] and ending at Borobudur.<ref name=\"walubi-The_Meaning_of_Procession\" />\n\n====Tourism====\n[[File:Borobudur on Vesak Day 2011.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vesak]] ceremony at Borobudur]]\nThe monument is the single most visited [[tourism in Indonesia|tourist attraction in Indonesia]]. In 1974, 260,000 tourists, of whom 36,000 were foreigners, visited the monument.<ref name=\"Hampton2004\" /> The figure climbed to {{Nowrap|2.5 million}} visitors annually (80% were domestic tourists) in the mid-1990s, before [[1997 East Asian financial crisis|the country's economic crisis]].<ref name=\"Sedyawati1997\" /> Tourism development, however, has been criticized for not including the local community, giving rise to occasional conflicts.<ref name=\"Hampton2004\" /> In 2003, residents and small businesses around Borobudur organized several meetings and poetry protests, objecting to a provincial government plan to build a three-storey mall complex, dubbed the \"Java World\".<ref name=\"2Z7Xj\" />\n\nInternational tourism awards were given to Borobudur archaeological park, such as [[Pacific Asia Travel Association|PATA]] Grand Pacific Award 2004, PATA Gold Award Winner 2011, and PATA Gold Award Winner 2012. In June 2012, Borobudur was recorded in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the world's largest Buddhist archaeological site.<ref name=\"sEzfV\" />\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bezoekers van de Borobudur TMnr 20027041.jpg|thumb|Tourists in Borobudur]]\n\n====Conservation====\nUNESCO identified three specific areas of concern under the present state of conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements.<ref name=\"UNESCO report\" /> The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure.<ref name=\"UNESCO report\" /> The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place to limit the number of visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.<ref name=\"UNESCO report\" />\n\nIn August 2014, the Conservation Authority of Borobudur reported some severe abrasion of the stone stairs caused by the scraping of visitors' footwear. The conservation authority planned to install wooden stairs to cover and protect the original stone stairs, just like those installed in Angkor Wat.<ref name=\"jnEYg\" />\n\n====Rehabilitation====\n[[File:Borobudur route map.png|thumb|Location of Borobudur relative to Mount Merapi and Yogyakarta]]\nBorobudur was heavily affected by the eruption of [[Mount Merapi]] in [[2010 eruptions of Mount Merapi|October and November 2010]]. [[Volcanic ash]] from Merapi fell on the temple complex, which is approximately {{convert|28|km|mi|0}} west-southwest of the crater. A layer of ash up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|0}}<ref name=\"antara2983\" /> thick fell on the temple statues during the eruption of 3\u20135 November, also killing nearby vegetation, with experts fearing that the acidic ash might damage the historic site. The temple complex was closed from 5 to 9 November to clean up the ashfall.<ref name=\"zcvVs\" /><ref name=\"84r4s\" />\n\n[[UNESCO]] donated US$3 million as a part of the costs towards the rehabilitation of Borobudur after [[Mount Merapi]]'s 2010 eruption.<ref name=\"gV00f\" /> More than 55,000 stone blocks comprising the temple's structure were dismantled to restore the drainage system, which had been clogged by slurry after the rain. The restoration was finished in November.<ref name=\"VSAmy\" />\n\nIn January 2012, two German stone-conservation experts spent ten days at the site analyzing the temples and making recommendations to ensure their long-term preservation.<ref name=\"8hzZ0\" /> In June, Germany agreed to contribute $130,000 to UNESCO for the second phase of rehabilitation, in which six experts in stone conservation, [[microbiology]], [[structural engineering]] and [[chemical engineering]] would spend a week in Borobudur in June, then return for another visit in September or October. These missions would launch the preservation activities recommended in the January report and would include capacity building activities to enhance the preservation capabilities of governmental staff and young conservation experts.<ref name=\"wdDe1\" />\n\nOn 14 February 2014, major tourist attractions in Yogyakarta and Central Java, including Borobudur, [[Prambanan]] and [[Ratu Boko]], were closed to visitors, after being severely affected by the volcanic ash from the eruption of [[Kelud]] volcano in East Java, located around 200 kilometers east from Yogyakarta. Workers covered the iconic stupas and statues of Borobudur temple to protect the structure from volcanic ash. The Kelud volcano erupted on 13 February 2014 with an explosion heard as far away as Yogyakarta.<ref name=\"ZRpjE\" />\n\n====Security threats====\nOn 21 January 1985, nine stupas were badly damaged by [[1985 Borobudur bombing|nine bombs]].<ref name=\"glXES\" /><ref name=\"Tempo\" /> In 1991, a blind Muslim preacher, [[Husein Ali Al Habsyie]], was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for masterminding a series of bombings in the mid-1980s, including the temple attack.<ref name=\"qStJf\" /> Two other members of the Islamic [[Extremism|extremist group]] that carried out the bombings were each sentenced to 20 years in 1986, and another man received a 13-year prison term.\n\nOn 27 May 2006, an [[2006 Yogyakarta earthquake|earthquake]] of 6.2 magnitude struck the south coast of Central Java. The event caused severe damage around the region and casualties to the nearby city of [[Yogyakarta]], but Borobudur remained intact.<ref name=\"ZKhbU\" />\n\nIn August 2014, Indonesian police and security forces tightened the security in and around Borobudur temple compound, as a precaution to a threat posted on social media by a self-proclaimed Indonesian branch of [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria|ISIS]], citing that the terrorists planned to destroy Borobudur and other statues in Indonesia.<ref name=\"wGCI5\" /> The security improvements included the repair and increased deployment of [[CCTV]] monitors and the implementation of a night patrol in and around the temple compound. The [[jihadist]] group follows a strict interpretation of Islam that condemns any [[anthropomorphic]] representations such as sculptures as [[idolatry]].\n\n====Visitor overload problem====\nThe high volume of visitors ascending the Borobudur's narrow stairs, has caused a severe wear out on the stone of the stairs, eroding the stones surface and made them thinner and smoother. Overall, Borobudur has 2,033 surfaces of stone stairs, spread over four cardinal directions; including the west side, the east, south and north. There are around 1,028 surfaces of them, or about 49.15 percent, that are severely worn out.<ref name=\"Kompas-Ika\" />\n\nTo avoid further wear of stairs' stones, since November 2014, two main sections of Borobudur stairs \u2013 the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides \u2013 are covered with wooden structures. The similar technique has been applied in [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids.<ref name=\"Kompas-Ika\" /> In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the stairs with [[rubber]] cover.<ref name=\"rvtHl\" /> Proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals.<ref name=\"l6WAT\" />\n\n==Architecture==\nThe archaeological excavation into Borobudur during reconstruction suggests that adherents of Hinduism or a pre-Indic faith had already begun to erect a large structure on Borobudur's hill before the site was appropriated by Buddhists. The foundations are unlike any Hindu or Buddhist shrine structures, and therefore, the initial structure is considered more indigenous Javanese than Hindu or Buddhist.<ref name=\"Golden\" />\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|left|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a [[Mandala]]]]\nBorobudur is built as a single large [[stupa]] and, when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant [[Vajrayana|tantric Buddhist]] ''[[mandala]]'', simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind.<ref name=\"8itFX\" /> The original foundation is a square, approximately {{convert|118|m|ft}} on each side. It has nine platforms, of which the lower six are [[Square (geometry)|square]] and the upper three are [[Circle|circular]].<ref name=\"5M1rn\" /> The upper platform features seventy-two small stupas surrounding one large central stupa. Each stupa is bell-shaped and pierced by numerous decorative openings. Statues of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] sit inside the pierced enclosures.\n\nThe design of Borobudur took the form of a [[step pyramid]]. Previously, the [[Prehistoric Indonesia|prehistoric]] [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[megalithic]] culture in Indonesia had constructed several earth mounds and stone step pyramid structures called ''punden berundak'' as discovered in Pangguyangan site near Cisolok<ref name=\"t8HH0\" /> and in Cipari near Kuningan.<ref name=\"BBjtH\" /> The construction of stone pyramids is based on native beliefs that mountains and high places are the abode of ancestral spirits or [[hyang]]s.<ref name=\"C2mb4\" /> The ''punden berundak'' step pyramid is the basic design in Borobudur,<ref name=\"Htvul\" /> believed to be the continuation of older megalithic tradition incorporated with Mahayana Buddhist ideas and symbolism.<ref name=\"MuWfW\" />\n\n[[File:Panoramic views of Borobudur.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Borobudur, it took the form of a [[step pyramid]] and mandala plan]]\n\nThe monument's three divisions symbolize the three \"realms\" of Buddhist cosmology, namely ''[[Buddhist cosmology#Desire Realm (K\u0101madh\u0101tu)|Kamadhatu]]'' (the world of desires), ''[[Rupajhana|Rupadhatu]]'' (the world of forms), and finally ''[[Arupadhatu]]'' (the formless world). Ordinary sentient beings live out their lives on the lowest level, the realm of desire. Those who have burnt out all desire for continued existence leave the world of desire and live in the world on the level of form alone: they see forms but are not drawn to them. Finally, full Buddhas go beyond even form and experience reality at its purest, most fundamental level, the formless ocean of nirvana.<ref name=\"M9pn9\" /> The liberation from the cycle of [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]] where the enlightened soul had no longer attached to worldly form corresponds to the concept of [[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101]], the complete voidness or [[anatta|the nonexistence of the self]]. ''K\u0101madh\u0101tu'' is represented by the base, ''Rupadhatu'' by the five square platforms (the body), and ''Arupadhatu'' by the three circular platforms and the large topmost stupa. The architectural features between the three stages have metaphorical differences. For instance, square and detailed decorations in the ''Rupadhatu'' disappear into plain circular platforms in the ''Arupadhatu'' to represent how the world of forms\u2014where men are still attached with forms and names\u2014changes into the world of the formless.<ref name=\"Yl6eq\" />\n\nCongregational worship in Borobudur is performed in a walking pilgrimage. Pilgrims are guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform represents one stage of [[Four stages of enlightenment|enlightenment]]. The path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize [[Buddhist cosmology]].<ref name=\"Ferschin2004\" />\n\nIn 1885, a hidden structure under the base was accidentally discovered.<ref name=\"kompas\" /> The \"hidden footing\" contains reliefs, 160 of which are narratives describing the real ''K\u0101madh\u0101tu''. The remaining reliefs are panels with short inscriptions that apparently provide instructions for the sculptors, illustrating the scenes to be carved.<ref name=\"p18\" /> The real base is hidden by an encasement base, the purpose of which remains a mystery. It was first thought that the real base had to be covered to prevent a disastrous subsidence of the monument into the hill.<ref name=\"p18\" /> There is another theory that the encasement base was added because the original hidden footing was incorrectly designed, according to ''[[Vastu Shastra]]'', the Indian ancient book about architecture and [[town planning]].<ref name=\"kompas\" /> Regardless of why it was commissioned, the encasement base was built with detailed and meticulous design and with aesthetic and religious consideration.\n\n===Building structure===\n[[File:Borobudur Cross Section en.svg|thumb|left|300px|Half cross-section with 4:6:9 height ratio for foot, body and head, respectively]]\n\nApproximately {{convert|55000|m3|cuyd}} of [[andesite]] stones were taken from neighbouring stone quarries to build the monument.<ref name=\"Soekmono16\" /> The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Knobs, indentations and [[Dovetail joint|dovetails]] were used to form joints between stones. The roof of stupas, niches and arched gateways were constructed in [[Corbel arch|corbelling]] method. [[Relief]]s were created ''[[in situ]]'' after the building had been completed.\n\nThe monument is equipped with a good [[drainage]] system to cater to the area's high [[Precipitation (meteorology)|stormwater]] run-off. To prevent flooding, 100 spouts are installed at each corner, each with a unique carved [[gargoyle]] in the shape of a [[giant (mythology)|giant]] or [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]].\n\n[[File:Lens Flare at Borobudur Stairs Kala Arches.JPG|thumb|upright|Stairs of Borobudur through arches of [[K\u0101la (time)|Kala]]]]\n[[File:Borobudur mural.jpg|thumb|upright|A narrow corridor with reliefs on the wall]]\n\nBorobudur differs markedly from the general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar to the shape of [[pyramid]], Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a ''stupa'', instead of a temple.<ref name=\"Soekmono16\" /> A ''stupa'' is intended as a [[shrine]] for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.\n\nLittle is known about [[Gunadharma]], the architect of the complex.<ref name=\"Long\" /> His name is recounted from Javanese folk tales rather than from written inscriptions.\n\nThe basic unit of measurement used during construction was the ''tala'', defined as the length of a human face from the forehead's hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance.<ref name=\"Atmadi1988\" /> The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the [[fractal]] and [[Self-similarity|self-similar]] geometry in Borobudur's design.<ref name=\"Atmadi1988\" /><ref name=\"fraktal\" /> This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the ''tala'' have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, as is the case with the temple of [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia.<ref name=\"Long\" />\n\nThe main structure can be divided into three components: base, body, and top.<ref name=\"Long\" /> The base is {{convert|123|x|123|m|ft|abbr=on}} in size with {{convert|4|m|ft}} walls.<ref name=\"Soekmono16\" /> The body is composed of five square platforms, each of diminishing height. The first terrace is set back {{convert|7|m|ft}} from the edge of the base. Each subsequent terrace is set back {{convert|2|m|ft}}, leaving a narrow corridor at each stage. The top consists of three circular platforms, with each stage supporting a row of perforated ''[[stupa]]s'', arranged in [[Concentric|concentric circles]]. There is one main dome at the center, the top of which is the highest point of the monument, {{convert|35|m|ft}} above ground level. Stairways at the center of each of the four sides give access to the top, with a number of arched gates overlooked by 32 lion statues. The gates are adorned with [[K\u0101la (time)|Kala]]'s head carved on top of each and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makaras]] projecting from each side. This Kala-Makara motif is commonly found on the gates of Javanese temples. The main entrance is on the eastern side, the location of the first narrative reliefs. Stairways on the slopes of the hill also link the monument to the low-lying plain.\n\n==Reliefs==\n[[File:Borobudur Reliefs Position en.svg|thumb|left|The position of narrative bas-reliefs stories on Borobudur wall]]\n\nBorobudur is constructed in such a way that it reveals various levels of terraces, showing intricate architecture that goes from being heavily ornamented with bas-reliefs to being plain in ''Arupadhatu'' circular terraces.<ref name=\"LUQR2\" /> The first four terrace walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.<ref name=\"UBDsh\" />\n\nThe bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also [[Indonesian architecture|native vernacular architecture]]. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]], gods, [[boddhisattva|bodhisattva]]s, [[kinnara]]s, [[gandharva]]s and [[apsara]]s. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is [[Borobudur Ship]].<ref name=\"QeTbh\" /> Today, the actual-size replica of Borobudur Ship that had sailed from Indonesia to Africa in 2004 is displayed in the [[Samudra Raksa Museum]], located a few hundred meters north of Borobudur.<ref name=\"w8rJ4\" />\n\nThe Borobudur reliefs also pay close attention to Indian aesthetic discipline, such as pose and gesture that contain certain meanings and aesthetic value. The reliefs of noblemen, and noble women, kings, or divine beings such as [[apsara]]s, [[Tara (Buddhism)|tara]]s and boddhisattvas are usually portrayed in [[tribhanga]] pose, the three-bend pose on neck, hips, and knee, with one leg resting and one upholding the body weight. This position is considered as the most graceful pose, such as the figure of [[Surasundari]] holding a lotus.<ref name=\"Zdcr0\" />\n\nDuring Borobudur excavation, archeologists discovered colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, as well as bits of [[gold foil]], and concluded that the monument that we see today \u2013 a dark gray mass of [[andesite|volcanic stone]], lacking in colour \u2013 was probably once coated with ''varjalepa'' white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching.<ref name=\"World Religions\" /> The same ''vajralepa'' plaster can also be found in [[Sari Temple|Sari]], [[Kalasan]] and [[Sewu]] temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin-left:1em; float:right;\"\n|+Narrative panels distribution<ref name=\"p20\" />\n|-\n!

The total relief surface is {{convert|2500|m2|sqft}}, and they are distributed at the hidden foot (''K\u0101madh\u0101tu'') and the five square platforms (''Rupadhatu'').<ref name=\"p20\" />\n\nThe narrative panels, which tell the story of [[Sudhana]] and Manohara,<ref name=\"uJFNP\" /> are grouped into 11 series that encircle the monument with a total length of {{convert|3000|m|ft}}. The hidden foot contains the first series with 160 narrative panels, and the remaining 10 series are distributed throughout walls and balustrades in four galleries starting from the eastern entrance stairway to the left. Narrative panels on the wall read from right to left, while those on the balustrade read from left to right. This conforms with ''[[pradaksina]]'', the ritual of circumambulation performed by [[pilgrim]]s who move in a clockwise direction while keeping the [[sanctuary]] to their right.<ref name=\"p21\" />\n\nThe hidden foot depicts the workings of [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic law]]. The walls of the first gallery have two superimposed series of reliefs; each consists of 120 panels. The upper part depicts the [[Gautama Buddha|biography of the Buddha]], while the lower part of the wall and also the balustrades in the first and the second galleries tell the story of the Buddha's former lives.<ref name=\"p20\" /> The remaining panels are devoted to Sudhana's further wandering about his search, terminated by his attainment of the [[Perfection of Wisdom|Perfect Wisdom]].\n\n===The law of karma (Karmavibhangga)===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf O 89 op de verborgen voet van de Borobudur TMnr 10015826.jpg|thumb|right| The Karmavibangga scene on Borobudur's hidden foot, on the right depicting sinful act of killing and cooking turtles and fishes, on the left those who make living by killing animals will be tortured in hell, by being cooked alive, being cut, or being thrown into a burning house.]]\n\nThe 160 hidden panels do not form a continuous story, but each panel provides one complete illustration of [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da|cause and effect]].<ref name=\"p20\" /> There are depictions of blameworthy activities, from gossip to murder, with their corresponding punishments. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. The pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, complete with the full panorama of ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]'' (the endless cycle of birth and death). The encasement base of the Borobudur temple was disassembled to reveal the hidden foot, and the reliefs were photographed by Casijan Chepas in 1890. It is these photographs that are displayed in [[Borobudur Museum]] (Karmawibhangga Museum), located just several hundred meters north of the temple. During the restoration, the foot encasement was reinstalled, covering the Karmawibhangga reliefs. Today, only the southeast corner of the hidden foot is revealed and visible for visitors.\n\n===The story of Prince Siddhartha and the birth of Buddha (Lalitavistara)===\n{{Main|The birth of Buddha (Lalitavistara)}}\n[[File:Queen Maya, Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|[[Queen Maya]] riding horse carriage retreating to [[Lumbini]] to give birth to Prince [[Siddhartha Gautama]]]]\nThe story starts with the descent of the Lord Buddha from the [[Tushita]] heaven and ends with his first sermon in the Deer Park near [[Benares]].<ref name=\"p21\" /> The relief shows the birth of the Buddha as [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]], son of King [[Suddhodana]] and [[Queen Maya]] of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]] (in Nepal).\n\nThe story is preceded by 27 panels showing various preparations, in the heavens and on the earth, to welcome the final incarnation of the [[Bodhisattva]].<ref name=\"p21\" /> Before descending from Tushita heaven, the Bodhisattva entrusted his crown to his successor, the future Buddha [[Maitreya]]. He descended on earth in the shape of [[white elephant]]s with six [[tusk]]s, penetrated to Queen Maya's right womb. Queen Maya had a dream of this event, which was interpreted that his son would become either a sovereign or a Buddha.\n[[File:Siddharta Gautama Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|Prince [[Siddhartha Gautama]] became an [[ascetic]] hermit.]]\nWhile Queen Maya felt that it was the time to give birth, she went to the [[Lumbini]] park outside the Kapilavastu city. She stood under a [[plaksa]] tree, holding one branch with her right hand, and she gave birth to a son, Prince Siddhartha. The story on the panels continues until the prince becomes the Buddha.\n\n===The stories of Buddha's previous life (Jataka) and other legendary people (Avadana)===\n[[Jataka]]s are stories about the Buddha before he was born as Prince Siddhartha.<ref name=\"Soekmono26\" /> They are the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The future Buddha may appear in them as a king, an outcast, a god, an elephant\u2014but, in whatever form, he exhibits some virtue that the tale thereby inculcates.<ref name=\"HqZ8l\" /> [[Avadana]]s are similar to jatakas, but the main figure is not the Bodhisattva himself. The saintly deeds in avadanas are attributed to other legendary persons. Jatakas and avadanas are treated in one and the same series in the reliefs of Borobudur.\n\nThe first twenty lower panels in the first gallery on the wall depict the ''Sudhanakumaravadana,'' or the saintly deeds of [[Sudhana]]. The first 135 upper panels in the same gallery on the balustrades are devoted to the 34 legends of the ''[[Jatakamala]]''.<ref name=\"Soekmono29\" /> The remaining 237 panels depict stories from other sources, as do the lower series and panels in the second gallery. Some jatakas are depicted twice, for example the story of King Sibhi ([[Rama]]'s forefather).\n\n===Sudhana's search for the ultimate truth (Gandavyuha)===\nGandavyuha is the story told in the final chapter of the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'' about Sudhana's tireless wandering in search of the Highest Perfect Wisdom. It covers two galleries (third and fourth) and also half of the second gallery, comprising in total of 460 panels.<ref name=\"Soekmono32\" /> The principal figure of the story, the youth Sudhana, son of an extremely rich merchant, appears on the 16th panel. The preceding 15 panels form a [[prologue]] to the story of the miracles during Buddha's ''[[Sam\u0101dhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]]'' in the [[Jetavana|Garden of Jeta]] at [[Sravasti]].\n\nDuring his search, Sudhana visited no fewer than thirty teachers, but none of them had satisfied him completely. He was then instructed by [[Manjusri]] to meet the monk Megasri, where he was given the first doctrine. As his journey continues, Sudhana meets (in the following order) Supratisthita, the physician Megha (Spirit of Knowledge), the banker Muktaka, the monk Saradhvaja, the [[upasaka|upasika]] Asa (Spirit of Supreme Enlightenment), Bhismottaranirghosa, the [[Brahmin]] Jayosmayatna, Princess Maitrayani, the monk Sudarsana, a boy called Indriyesvara, the upasika Prabhuta, the banker Ratnachuda, King [[Anala]], the god [[Shiva|Siva Mahadeva]], [[Queen Maya]], [[Bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]] and then back to Manjusri. Each meeting has given Sudhana a specific doctrine, knowledge and wisdom. These meetings are shown in the third gallery.\n\nAfter the last meeting with Manjusri, Sudhana went to the residence of Bodhisattva [[Samantabhadra]], depicted in the fourth gallery. The entire series of the fourth gallery is devoted to the teaching of Samantabhadra. The narrative panels finally end with Sudhana's achievement of the Supreme Knowledge and the Ultimate Truth.<ref name=\"p35\" />\n\n==Buddha statues==\n[[File:Borobudur-perfect-buddha.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Buddha statue with the hand position of ''[[Dharmachakra|dharmachakra mudra]]'']]\n\nApart from the story of the [[Buddhist cosmology]] carved in stone, Borobudur has many statues of various Buddhas. The cross-legged statues are seated in a [[lotus position]] and distributed on the five square platforms (the ''Rupadhatu'' level), as well as on the top platform (the ''Arupadhatu'' level).\n\nThe Buddha statues are in niches at the ''Rupadhatu'' level, arranged in rows on the outer sides of the balustrades, the number of statues decreasing as platforms progressively diminish to the upper level. The first balustrades have 104 niches, the second 104, the third 88, the fourth 72 and the fifth 64. In total, there are 432 Buddha statues at the ''Rupadhatu'' level.<ref name=\"p35-36\" /> At the ''Arupadhatu'' level (or the three circular platforms), Buddha statues are placed inside perforated [[stupa]]s. The first circular platform has 32 stupas, the second 24 and the third 16, which adds up to 72 stupas.<ref name=\"p35-36\" /> Of the original 504 Buddha statues, over 300 are damaged (mostly headless), and 43 are missing. Since the monument's discovery, heads have been acquired as collector's items, mostly by Western museums.<ref name=\"lgraW\" /> Some of these Buddha heads are now displayed in numbers of museums, such as the [[Tropenmuseum]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Guimet Museum|Mus\u00e9e Guimet]] in Paris, and [[The British Museum]] in [[London]].<ref name=\"1pgW0\" /> Germany has in 2014 returned its collection and funded their reattachment and further conservation of the site.<ref name=\"thejakartapost\">{{cite news |last1=Muryanto |first1=Bambang |title=Buddhas to be reunited with their heads |url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/20/buddhas-be-reunited-with-their-heads.html |accessdate=31 December 2019 |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:WLANL - Pachango - Tropenmuseum - Kop Borobudur.jpg|thumb|upright|Head from a Borobudur Buddha statue in [[Tropenmuseum]], Amsterdam.]]\n[[File:Headless buddha.jpg|thumb|upright|Headless Buddha statue in Borobudur. Since its discovery, numbers of heads have been stolen and installed in museums abroad.]]\n[[File:Borobudur Lion Guardian.jpg|thumb|upright|Lion gate guardian]]\nAt first glance, all the Buddha statues appear similar, but there is a subtle difference between them in the ''[[mudra]]s,'' or the position of the hands. There are five groups of ''mudra'': North, East, South, West and Zenith, which represent the five cardinal compass points according to [[Mahayana]]. The first four balustrades have the first four ''mudras'': North, East, South and West, of which the Buddha statues that face one compass direction have the corresponding ''mudra''. Buddha statues at the fifth balustrades and inside the 72 stupas on the top platform have the same ''mudra'': [[Zenith]]. Each ''mudra'' represents one of the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas]]; each has its own symbolism.<ref name=\"KdQFg\" />\n\nFollowing the order of ''Pradakshina'' (clockwise circumumbulation) starting from the East, the ''mudras'' of the Borobudur buddha statues are:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px;\"|Statue\n! style=\"width:70px;\"|Mudra\n! style=\"width:140px;\"|Symbolic meaning\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Dhyani Buddha\n! style=\"width:60px;\"|Cardinal Point\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Location of the Statue\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur TMnr 10016277.jpg|70px]]\n|''Bhumisparsa mudra''\n|Calling the Earth to witness\n|[[Aksobhya]]\n|East\n|''Rupadhatu'' niches on the first four eastern balustrades\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur TMnr 60013976.jpg|70px]]\n|''Vara mudra''\n|Benevolence, alms giving\n|[[Ratnasambhava]]\n|South\n|''Rupadhatu'' niches on the first four southern balustrades\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur voorstellende Dhyani Boeddha Amitabha TMnr 10016276.jpg|70px]]\n|''Dhyana mudra''\n|Concentration and meditation\n|[[Amitabha]]\n|West\n|''Rupadhatu'' niches on the first four western balustrades\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur voorstellende Dhyani Boeddha Amogasiddha TMnr 10016274.jpg|70px]]\n|''Abhaya mudra''\n|Courage, fearlessness\n|[[Amoghasiddhi]]\n|North\n|''Rupadhatu'' niches on the first four northern balustrades\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur voorstellende Dhyani Boeddha Vairocana TMnr 10015947.jpg|70px]]\n|''Vitarka mudra''\n|Reasoning and virtue\n|[[Vairochana]]\n|Zenith\n|''Rupadhatu'' niches in all directions on the fifth (uppermost) balustrade\n|-\n|[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Boeddhabeeld van de Borobudur TMnr 60019836.jpg|70px]]\n|''[[Dharmachakra|Dharmachakra mudra]]''\n|Turning the Wheel of ''dharma'' (law)\n|[[Vairochana]]\n|Zenith\n|''Arupadhatu'' in 72 perforated stupas on three rounded platforms\n|}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM President Soekarno en de Indiase premier Nehru kijken toe hoe Indira Gandhi bloemen in ontvangst neemt tijdens een bezoek aan de Borobudur TMnr 10015646.jpg|thumb|right|Sukarno took [[Nehru]] to visit Borobudur in June 1950.]]\nThe aesthetic and technical mastery of Borobudur, and also its sheer size, has evoked the sense of grandeur and pride for Indonesians. Just like [[Angkor Wat]] for Cambodian, Borobudur has become a powerful symbol for Indonesia \u2014 to testify for its past greatness. [[Sukarno]] made a point of showing the site to foreign dignitaries. The [[Suharto]] regime \u2014 realized its important symbolic and economic meanings \u2014 diligently embarked on a massive project to restore the monument with the help from UNESCO. Many museums in Indonesia contain a scale model replica of Borobudur. The monument has become almost an icon, grouped with the [[wayang]] puppet play and [[gamelan]] music into a vague classical Javanese past from which Indonesians are to draw inspiration.<ref name=\"M Wood\" />\n[[File:Coat of arms of Central Java.svg|thumb|left|upright|Emblem of [[Central Java]] displaying Borobudur.]]\nSeveral archaeological relics taken from Borobudur or its replica have been displayed in some museums in Indonesia and abroad. Other than [[Karmawibhangga Museum]] within Borobudur temple ground, some museums boast to host relics of Borobudur, such as [[National Museum (Indonesia)|Indonesian National Museum]] in Jakarta, [[Tropenmuseum]] in Amsterdam, [[British Museum]] in London, and [[Bangkok National Museum|Thai National Museum]] in Bangkok. [[Louvre]] museum in Paris, [[National Museum (Malaysia)|Malaysian National Museum]] in Kuala Lumpur, and [[Museum of World Religions]] in Taipei also displayed the replica of Borobudur.<ref name=\"World Religions\" /> The monument has drawn global attention to the classical Buddhist civilization of ancient Java.\n\nThe rediscovery and reconstruction of Borobudur has been hailed by [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Indonesian Buddhist]] as the sign of the Buddhist revival in Indonesia. In 1934, [[Narada Thera]], a missionary monk from [[Sri Lanka]], visited Indonesia for the first time as part of his journey to spread the Dharma in Southeast Asia. This opportunity was used by a few local Buddhists to revive Buddhism in Indonesia. A [[bodhi tree]] planting ceremony was held in Southeastern side of Borobudur on 10 March 1934 under the blessing of Narada Thera, and some Upasakas were ordained as monks.<ref name=\"Buddhanet\" /> Once a year, thousands of Buddhist from Indonesia and neighboring countries flock to Borobudur to commemorate national [[Vesak]] ceremony.<ref name=\"AptiJ\" />\n\nThe emblem of [[Central Java]] province and [[Magelang Regency]] bears the image of Borobudur. It has become the symbol of Central Java, and also Indonesia on a wider scale. Borobudur has become the name of several establishments, such as Borobudur University, [[Borobudur Hotel]] in Central Jakarta, and several Indonesian restaurants abroad. Borobudur has been featured in [[Rupiah]] banknote, stamps, numbers of books, publications, documentaries and Indonesian tourism promotion materials. The monument has become one of the main [[Tourism in Indonesia|tourism attraction in Indonesia]], vital for generating local economy in the region surrounding the temple. The tourism sector of the city of [[Yogyakarta]] for example, flourishes partly because of its proximity to Borobudur and Prambanan temples.\n\n==Gallery==\n===Gallery of reliefs===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Borobudur ship.JPG|<small>Relief panel of a [[Borobudur ship|ship at Borobudur]]. </small>\nFile:Musician Borobudur.jpg|<small>Musicians performing a musical ensemble, probably the early form of [[gamelan]].</small>\nFile:Apsara Borobudur.jpg|<small>The [[Apsara]] of Borobudur. </small>\nFile:Sailendra King and Queen, Borobudur.jpg|<small>The scene of King and Queen with their subjects.</small>\nFile:Borobudur relief 3.jpg|<small>One relief on a corridor wall.</small>\nFile:Borobudur Keris.jpg|<small>A weapon, probably the early form of [[kris|keris]].</small>\nFile:Borobodur2.jpg|<small>A detailed carved relief stone.</small>\nFile:Tara Borobudur 3.jpg|<small>[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] holding a [[Fly-whisk|Chamara]]</small>\nFile:Tara Borobudur 2.jpg|<small>Surasundari holding a lotus</small>\nFile:029 LalitavistaraDeva listening to Dhamma.jpg|<small>Close up of a relief</small>\nFile:Borobudur Relief Panel I.a65 (cropped), 1022a.jpg|<small>Great Departure from Lalitavistara</small>\n</gallery>\n\n===Gallery of Borobudur===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:World Heritage inscription of Borobudur Temple 1991.jpg|<small>World Heritage inscription of Borobudur Temple</small>\nFile:The procedures visiting Borobudur Temple.jpg|<small>The procedures signage for visiting Borobudur Temple</small>\nFile:The inscription of Borobudur restoration in 1973.jpg|<small>The inscription of Borobudur restoration in 1973 by the former Indonesian president Soeharto</small>\nFile:Scaterred Antefix - decorative architectural ornament either on the top of balustrade on Borobudur temple wall.jpg|<small>The scattered parts of Borobudur Temple at Karmawibhangga Museum.

He served as [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] for a period of almost twenty years, both before and after the execution of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. \n\nHe is best remembered for his dignified defiance of the king on 4 January 1642 when Charles entered the chamber of the House of Commons, supported by 400 armed men, in an attempt to seize [[Five Members|five members]] whom he accused of [[treason]]. When Charles asked Lenthall where the five were, Lenthall famously replied \"I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me\". It was the first time in English history that a speaker of the House of Commons had declared his allegiance to the liberty of parliament rather than the will of the monarch.\n\n==Early life==\nLenthall was born in [[Henley-on-Thames]], [[Oxfordshire]],<ref>{{NHLE |num=1218864 |desc=Speaker's House |grade=II |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref> the second son of William Lenthall (d. 1596) and Frances Southwell,{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} and was educated at [[Thame]] school.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He matriculated at [[Merton College, Oxford#St Alban Hall|St Alban Hall]] [[University of Oxford]] in 1607 but left in 1609 without taking a degree.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He moved to [[Lincoln's Inn]] and was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1616, becoming a [[bencher]] of the inn in 1633.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He built up a successful legal practice, becoming [[Recorder (judge)|recorder]] of Woodstock in 1621, an Oxfordshire [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|magistrate]] in 1631, and recorder of Gloucester in 1638.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}}\n==Early parliamentary career and Short Parliament==\n{{main|Short Parliament}}\n\nLenthall's parliamentary career began in 1624 when he sat as [[Member of parliament|member]] for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|New Woodstock]] in Oxfordshire.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He failed to be re-elected in 1625,{{sfn|Thrush|2010|pp=98\u201399}} but again represented the constituency during the 1640 [[Short Parliament]], on several occasions being called upon to chair grand committees of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House]] on important subjects, including [[ship money]] and parliamentary grievances.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} The Short Parliament was dissolved on 5 May 1640 after only three weeks.\n      \n==Long Parliament==\n{{main|Long Parliament}}\nWhen [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] recalled parliament once more on 4 November 1640, at the start of what became known as the [[Long Parliament]], Lenthall again attended on behalf of New Woodstock.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} Discovering that his preferred candidate for [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|speaker]], [[Thomas Gardiner (Royalist)|Sir Thomas Gardiner]], had failed to be returned, the king reviewed the list of available lawyers and approved Lenthall as the new speaker,{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} a position that Lenthall was to hold for most of the next twenty years.\n\nFrom the start, Lenthall had his critics. [[Henry Mildmay|Sir Henry Mildmay]] criticised him for letting too many speak during a debate, he was accused of partiality and procedural errors, and at one point was made to look foolish over a point of precedence.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} However, the journal of [[Simonds d'Ewes|Sir Simonds d'Ewes]] (who was not generally supportive) suggests that in the opening months of the Long Parliament Lenthall was very much in control of proceedings.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n\nDuring 1640\u20131641 Lenthall proved himself a competent speaker. He introduced or codified a variety of procedural rules including the establishment of the duration of [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|parliamentary privilege]] before and after sittings, the imposition of a penalty for speaking when another member had the floor, and the rule that while one piece of business was before the House a motion on another could not be made.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n\nBy late 1641 Lenthall was finding the House's long sittings physically exhausting and he became increasingly desperate to be relieved of the speakership. He was also concerned about his personal finances, pleading the prospect of financial ruin if he were to continue. In the event, however, he was to remain in post, with only a few gaps, for many more years.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n===The king's attempted seizure of the Five Members===\n\n[[File:Attempted Arrest of the Five members by Charles West Cope.jpg|thumb|Lenthall kneels to [[Charles I of England|Charles]] during the attempted arrest of the [[Five Members]]]]\n{{main|Five Members}}\nThe relationship between the House of Commons and [[Charles I of England|the king]] became increasingly fraught during 1641, and at the end of the year Charles launched in the [[House of Lords]] accusations of [[treason]] against [[Five Members|five leading members]] of the Commons.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} The Commons sat to consider the allegations on 3 January 1642, and held them to be a breach of the House's [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|privilege]].{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} Provoked, and determined that the Five Members should not escape arrest, Charles decided to go to the House of Commons himself to apprehend them.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} The next day, 4 January, he arrived in person, accompanied by about 400 armed men, and entered the Commons chamber.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=213}} Addressing Lenthall, he said \"Mr Speaker, I must for a time make bold with your chair\". Lenthall vacated it. Calling first for one of the members, and then another, Charles was met with total silence. He asked the speaker where they were.  Kneeling, Lenthall responded with extraordinary courage:{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\n{{Quote\n|text=May it please your majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me whose servant I am here; and I humbly beg your majesty's pardon that I cannot give any other answer than this to what your majesty is pleased to demand of me.\n}}\nIt was the first time that a speaker had declared his allegiance to the liberty of parliament rather than the will of the monarch.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nThe King paused. \"'Tis no matter, I think my eyes are as good as another's\". He studied the benches for 'a pretty while' then lamented \"all my birds have flown\". He left the chair and walked out 'in a more discontented and angry passion than he came in',{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} followed by shouts of \"Privilege! Privilege!\" from the members.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=213}}\n\nCharles's intended show of strength had failed, he left London less than a week later,{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} and within months the country was plunged into civil war.\n\nLenthall's defence of his office was acknowledged by the House on 9 April, when it awarded him the sum of \u00a36000.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} In the last speech that Lenthall delivered to the king he talked of reconciliation, and invited Charles to rid himself of false counsellors.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n\n===Civil War===\n\n[[File:William Lenthall.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of William Lenthall by [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen]]]]\n\nParliament continued to sit during the [[English Civil War|civil war]], acting now without the king's authority. Lenthall remained in the chair, supporting the Parliamentary cause but without much sympathy toward those diehard protestants who were seeking radical ecclesiastical reform.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} In November 1642, he argued forcefully that the Commons should send peace proposals to the king.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}}\n\nLenthall's appointment to a series of high offices during this period brought some relief to his preoccupation with his personal finances: during the 1640s he became [[Master of the Rolls]], a [[Lord Chancellor|commissioner of the Great Seal]], and [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]].{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} Nevertheless, his worries continued especially since with the coming of war his estates near [[Oxford]] were at risk of confiscation by the [[Cavalier|royalists.]]{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} In June 1649 a labourer broke into his London house and stole \u00a31900; he was later caught, tried, and sentenced to hang.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}}\n\nBy 1647 popular dissent was growing against the power of the [[New Model Army]] and the oppressions of local committees.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} The Long Parliament found itself increasingly unpopular, having imposed punitive taxation and chosen a course which had led to slaughter without any identifiable achievement.{{sfn|Field|2011|p=113}} On 26 July a mob invaded parliament to force it to agree to the army's [[Solemn Engagement]]{{sfn|Hibbert|1993|p=256}} (its refusal to disband until its grievances were met). The speaker was held in the chair by force{{sfn|Hibbert|1993|p=256}} and was compelled to put to the vote a resolution inviting the king to London.{{sfn|Hibbert|1993|p=256}}\n\nOn 31 July 1647 Lenthall published a personal declaration stating that votes in the Commons had been forced, rendering them void.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} He declared that he would take himself to the army, and would return only when free to resume his office.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} Along with fifty-seven other members, eight peers and the speaker of the Lords, he left London.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=379}} The fugitive members were well-received by the soldiers, and they were invited by their commander [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Baron Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]] to review 15,000 men on [[Hounslow Heath]] on 3 August.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=379}}  Fairfax's regiments encircled London the next day, and under his protection Lenthall and the other fugitives were escorted in triumph back to parliament.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=379}}  Lenthall was re-installed in the chair,{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} and all votes passed during his absence were subsequently annulled.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=379}}\n\nLenthall sympathized with the Independents in parliament, and was portrayed by royalist newspapers in 1648 as being their tool, plotting to manipulate the House in their interests.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} But he did not always act as expected, for example using his casting vote in favour of continuing negotiations with the king.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}}\n\n===Pride's Purge===\n\n{{main|Pride's Purge}}\nOn 6 December 1648, in an event known as [[Pride's Purge]], troops of the New Model Army under the command of [[Thomas Pride|Colonel Thomas Pride]] forcibly removed from parliament all those who were not Independents or Army supporters.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} Lenthall remained silent, and had probably been warned in advance.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} He was certainly consulted on several occasions by Independent leaders during the December crisis.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} \n\n=== Rump Parliament ===\n{{Main|Rump Parliament}}\nThe Purge had reduced the Commons to a [[Rump Parliament|rump]] of a little over 200 [[Roundhead|hard-line members]].{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=213}} Lenthall remained in post during the debates and resolutions that led ultimately to [[Execution of Charles I|Charles's execution]] on 30 January 1649, though there is no evidence that he was otherwise active in the events leading up to the [[regicide]].{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}}\n\nIn February 1649, the House voted to abolish both the [[House of Lords|House of Peers]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]],{{sfn|Field|2011|p=118}} and Lenthall found himself speaker of a new supreme [[Unicameralism|unicameral parliament]]. Though holding little real power, Lenthall as its representative became the leading citizen of England.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Speaker during the Commonwealth\"}} Although the first to take the engagement of loyalty to the new [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], he remained cautious and conservative in his approach to public affairs.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Speaker during the Commonwealth\"}}\n\nIn December 1651 [[Oliver Cromwell]] arranged a meeting at the speaker's house to discuss options for future government.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=521}} Lenthall, along with the other lawyers present, argued against the idea of a pure [[republic]] and in favour of a mixed constitution incorporating some role for a monarch.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=521}}\n===Cromwell's dismissal of the Rump===\n[[File:WilliamLenthall1652.jpg|thumb|upright|Lenthall in about 1652]]\nThe Rump Parliament had undertaken to dissolve itself \"as soon as may possibly stand with the safety of the people\".{{sfn|Field|2011|p=119}} But it failed to do so, and on 20 April 1653 it was forcibly dissolved by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] and other leading army officers.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Speaker during the Commonwealth\"}} Supported by [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Colonel Thomas Harrison]] and 30 or 40 musketeers, Cromwell ordered the chamber to be cleared.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=530}} Lenthall once again rose to the occasion, announcing to Harrison that he would not come down unless he was pulled out.{{sfn|Hibbert|1993|p=305}} Harrison stretched out an arm and Lenthall submitted,{{sfn|Hibbert|1993|p=305}} doubtless realising the futility of resistance.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Speaker during the Commonwealth\"}}\n\nLenthall had become associated with the shortcomings of the Rump, and he found no place in the [[Barebone's Parliament|Nominated Assembly]] that sat between July and December 1653.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Speaker during the Commonwealth\"}}\n=== First Protectorate Parliament ===\n{{main|First Protectorate Parliament}}\nThe [[First Protectorate Parliament]] was summoned in 1654 by Cromwell, in his new role as [[Lord Protector]]. Lenthall was returned as member for [[Oxfordshire]], and on 4 September was once again confirmed as speaker.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cSpeaker and Cromwellian office-holder\"}}\n\n=== Second Protectorate Parliament ===\n{{main|Second Protectorate Parliament}}\n\nIn the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]], summoned by Cromwell on 17 September 1656,{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|pp=640\u2013641}} Lenthall was again returned as member for Oxfordshire,{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cSpeaker and Cromwellian office-holder\"}} but this time was not selected as speaker. He nevertheless took a full part in the proceedings, being the senior member on the committee charged with settling the new constitutional arrangements.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cSpeaker and Cromwellian office-holder\"}} He was supportive of the Protector and was rewarded \u2013 after some agitation on his part \u2013 with a seat in Cromwell's new [[Cromwell's Other House|Other House]], taking up his place as Lord Lenthall 10 December 1657.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cSpeaker and Cromwellian office-holder\"}}\n\n===Revival of the Rump Parliament===\nAfter the death of Oliver Cromwell on 3 September 1658 his son [[Richard Cromwell]] succeeded him as Lord Protector. The Protectorate rapidly collapsed, and on 6 May 1659 Lenthall was visited by senior army officers who asked him to help with the revival of the Rump Parliament, and to return as speaker.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cCollapse of the republic and the restoration of monarchy\"}} Lenthall was reluctant to give up his seat in the Other House{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=725}} and pleaded ill health, but when he was bypassed and parliament summoned without his aid he felt himself obliged to resume his role as speaker the following day.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cCollapse of the republic and the restoration of monarchy\"}}\n\nLenthall now presided over a revived parliament of only 78 members{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=727}}, and in spite of his parallel role as head of the army, division between parliament and the army deepened.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cCollapse of the republic and the restoration of monarchy\"}}  On 12 October 1659 the army surrounded and occupied the precincts of the House, and for a night and a day a stand-off with the parliamentary defenders ensued. Lenthall himself was denied access by the blockading soldiers, and had to turn back.

He served as [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] for a period of almost twenty years, both before and after the execution of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. \n\nHe is best remembered for his dignified defiance of the king on 4 January 1642 when Charles entered the chamber of the House of Commons, supported by 400 armed men, in an attempt to seize [[Five Members|five members]] whom he accused of [[treason]]. When Charles asked Lenthall where the five were, Lenthall famously replied \"I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me\". It was the first time in English history that a speaker of the House of Commons had declared his allegiance to the liberty of parliament rather than the will of the monarch.\n\n==Early life==\nLenthall was born in [[Henley-on-Thames]], [[Oxfordshire]],<ref>{{NHLE |num=1218864 |desc=Speaker's House |grade=II |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref> the second son of William Lenthall (d. 1596) and Frances Southwell,{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} and was educated at [[Thame]] school.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He matriculated at [[Merton College, Oxford#St Alban Hall|St Alban Hall]] [[University of Oxford]] in 1607 but left in 1609 without taking a degree.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He moved to [[Lincoln's Inn]] and was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1616, becoming a [[bencher]] of the inn in 1633.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He built up a successful legal practice, becoming [[Recorder (judge)|recorder]] of Woodstock in 1621, an Oxfordshire [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|magistrate]] in 1631, and recorder of Gloucester in 1638.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}}\n==Early parliamentary career and Short Parliament==\n{{main|Short Parliament}}\n\nLenthall's parliamentary career began in 1624 when he sat as [[Member of parliament|member]] for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|New Woodstock]] in Oxfordshire.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He failed to be re-elected in 1625,{{sfn|Thrush|2010|pp=98\u201399}} but again represented the constituency during the 1640 [[Short Parliament]], on several occasions being called upon to chair grand committees of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House]] on important subjects, including [[ship money]] and parliamentary grievances.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} The Short Parliament was dissolved on 5 May 1640 after only three weeks.\n      \n==Long Parliament==\n{{main|Long Parliament}}\nWhen [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] recalled parliament once more on 4 November 1640, at the start of what became known as the [[Long Parliament]], Lenthall again attended on behalf of New Woodstock.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} Discovering that his preferred candidate for [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|speaker]], [[Thomas Gardiner (Royalist)|Sir Thomas Gardiner]], had failed to be returned, the king reviewed the list of available lawyers and approved Lenthall as the new speaker,{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} a position that Lenthall was to hold for most of the next twenty years.\n\nFrom the start, Lenthall had his critics. [[Henry Mildmay|Sir Henry Mildmay]] criticised him for letting too many speak during a debate, he was accused of partiality and procedural errors, and at one point was made to look foolish over a point of precedence.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} However, the journal of [[Simonds d'Ewes|Sir Simonds d'Ewes]] (who was not generally supportive) suggests that in the opening months of the Long Parliament Lenthall was very much in control of proceedings.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n\nDuring 1640\u20131641 Lenthall proved himself a competent speaker. He introduced or codified a variety of procedural rules including the establishment of the duration of [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|parliamentary privilege]] before and after sittings, the imposition of a penalty for speaking when another member had the floor, and the rule that while one piece of business was before the House a motion on another could not be made.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n\nBy late 1641 Lenthall was finding the House's long sittings physically exhausting and he became increasingly desperate to be relieved of the speakership. He was also concerned about his personal finances, pleading the prospect of financial ruin if he were to continue. In the event, however, he was to remain in post, with only a few gaps, for many more years.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n===The king's attempted seizure of the Five Members===\n\n[[File:Attempted Arrest of the Five members by Charles West Cope.jpg|thumb|Lenthall kneels to [[Charles I of England|Charles]] during the attempted arrest of the [[Five Members]]]]\n{{main|Five Members}}\nThe relationship between the House of Commons and [[Charles I of England|the king]] became increasingly fraught during 1641, and at the end of the year Charles launched in the [[House of Lords]] accusations of [[treason]] against [[Five Members|five leading members]] of the Commons.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} The Commons sat to consider the allegations on 3 January 1642, and held them to be a breach of the House's [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|privilege]].{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} Provoked, and determined that the Five Members should not escape arrest, Charles decided to go to the House of Commons himself to apprehend them.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} The next day, 4 January, he arrived in person, accompanied by about 400 armed men, and entered the Commons chamber.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=213}} Addressing Lenthall, he said \"Mr Speaker, I must for a time make bold with your chair\". Lenthall vacated it. Calling first for one of the members, and then another, Charles was met with total silence. He asked the speaker where they were.  Kneeling, Lenthall responded with extraordinary courage:{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\n{{Quote\n|text=May it please your majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me whose servant I am here; and I humbly beg your majesty's pardon that I cannot give any other answer than this to what your majesty is pleased to demand of me.\n}}\nIt was the first time that a speaker had declared his allegiance to the liberty of parliament rather than the will of the monarch.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nThe King paused. \"'Tis no matter, I think my eyes are as good as another's\". He studied the benches for 'a pretty while' then lamented \"all my birds have flown\".

It is situated on the river [[Soeste]], approximately {{Convert|25|km}} northwest of [[Cloppenburg]], and {{Convert|30|km}} southwest of [[Oldenburg]].\n\n==History==\nFriesoythe shares a diverse culture in Lower Saxony history. Many cultural influences of [[Culture of Germany|German]], [[Anglo-Saxon]], [[Culture of the Netherlands|Dutch]], [[East Frisia]]n, [[Culture of Denmark|Danish]] and [[Culture of Sweden|Swedish]] culture are noticeable in the town and [[citizen]]s. The town has a large following of [[Roman Catholicism]] and small percentages of [[Calvinism]] and [[Lutheranism]]. It was part of the [[Duchy of Oldenburg]] and also under rule to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] in the 18th century.\n\n=== Second World War ===\n{{Main|Razing of Friesoythe}}\nIn April 1945, the town of Friesoythe felt the full force of an attack by the [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]], under General [[Christopher Vokes]]. Most of the town's population of 4,000 moved out to the surrounding countryside on about April 11\u201312, 1945.<ref>The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on April 11th.  If the District Court ceased to function on April 11, 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between April 11th through April 12th 1945. It was clearly a German and not a Canadian initiative.

The Lake Superior Regiment suffered two dead and nineteen wounded. German casualties are not known.\n\nVokes ordered the resumption of the attack the next day by [[The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)]] commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Frederick E. Wigle. The attack went well, with the Argylls securing the town by 10:30 hours. However, at 08:30 a small number of German soldiers caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise, killing Wigle and several other soldiers.<ref>Mark Zuehlke, On To Victory: The Canadian Liberation Of The Netherlands, p.  308</ref> Lieutenant Alan Earp survived a bullet through the head.<ref>War Diary, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, April 14, 1945, pp. 10-11.

Stiletto-style heels {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on}} or shorter are called [[kitten heel]]s.\n\nNot all high slim heels merit the description stiletto. The extremely slender classic Italian-style stiletto heels of the late 1950s and very early 1960s were no more than {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter for much of their length, although the heel sometimes flared out a little at the top-piece (tip). After their demise in the mid-late 1960s, such slender heels were hard to find until recently due to changes in the way heels were mass-produced.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Shoe fetishism}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Stiefelwiki1e.jpg|190px|thumb|Stiletto heels can be found on almost every type of shoes, such as these ankle boots]]\n\nRelatively thin high heels were certainly around in the late 19th century, as numerous [[fetish art|fetish drawing]]s attest. Firm photographic evidence exists in the form of photographs of Parisian singer [[Mistinguett]] from the 1940s. These shoes were designed by [[Andre Perugia]], who began designing shoes in 1906. It seems unlikely that he invented the stiletto, but he is probably the first firmly-documented designer of the high, slim heel. The word stiletto applied to a heel is derived from a [[knife]] or [[dagger]] [[stiletto]], which is a long, thin blade, to which the heel of the shoe is similar in profile. Its usage in footwear first appeared in print in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine in 1959: \"She came ...forward, her walk made lopsided by the absence of one heel of the stilettos\".<ref name=Games2007>{{Cite book|last = Games|first = Alex|year = 2007|title = Balderdash & Piffle: One Sandwich Short of a Dog's Dinner|isbn = 978-1-84607-235-2|publisher = BBC Books|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/balderdashpiffle0000game}}</ref>\n\nHigh-heel shoes were worn by men and women [[courtier]]s. The stiletto heel came with the advent of technology using a supporting metal shaft or stem embedded into the heel, instead of wood or other, weaker materials that required a wide heel. This revival of the opulent heel style can be attributed to the designer [[Roger Vivier]] and such designs became very popular in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|title= Italian Fashion: The History of High Heels|first= Meredith|last= Paslawsky|date= November 2008|publisher= Life In Italy|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104328/http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|archivedate= 22 December 2015|accessdate= 20 December 2012|quote= In 1954, Roger Vivier designed the first stiletto heel with its infamous bold arch for the house of Dior. \"Stiletto\" is an Italian word for a small metal dagger.}}</ref>\n\nAs time went on, stiletto heels would become known more for their erotic nature than for their ability to make height. Stiletto heels are a common [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] item. As a fashion item, their popularity has changed over time. After an initial wave of popularity in the 1950s, they reached their most refined shape in the early 1960s, when the toes of the shoes which bore them became as slender and elongated as the stiletto heels themselves. As a result of the overall sharpness of outline, it was customary for women to refer to the whole shoe as a \"stiletto\", not just the heel, via [[synecdoche]] (''[[pars pro toto]]''). Although they faded from the scene after the [[The Beatles|Beatle]] era began, their popularity continued at street level, and women stubbornly refused to give them up even after they could no longer readily find them in the mainstream shops. A version of the stiletto heel was reintroduced in 1974 by [[Manolo Blahnik]], who dubbed his \"new\" heel the \"Needle\". Similar heels were stocked at the big [[Biba]] store in London, by [[Russell & Bromley]] and by smaller boutiques. Old, unsold stocks of pointed-toe stilettos and contemporary efforts to replicate them (lacking the true stiletto heel because of changes in the way heels were by then being mass-produced) were sold in street fashion markets and became popular with [[Punk subculture|punks]] and with other fashion \"tribes\" of the late 1970s until supplies of the inspirational original styles dwindled in the early 1980s. Subsequently, round-toe shoes with slightly thicker (sometimes cone-shaped) semi-stiletto heels, often very high in an attempt to convey slenderness were frequently worn at the office with wide-shouldered [[Suit (clothing)|power suits]]. The style survived through much of the 1980s but almost completely disappeared during the 1990s, when professional and college-age women took to wearing shoes with thick, block heels. The slender stiletto heel staged a major comeback after 2000 when young women adopted the style for dressing up office wear or adding a feminine touch to casual wear, like jeans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nStiletto heels are particularly associated with the image of the ''[[femme fatale]]''. They are often considered to be a seductive item of clothing, and often feature in popular culture in this context.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Advantages==\nSome of the benefits of wearing stilettos and other high heels include; longer, sexier, hotter and more feminine legs, it boosts your self-confidence, it makes your legs look slimmer and longer while making you look taller and it helps to strengthen & work your foot, heel, calf, knee and thigh muscles. It even makes your foot look smaller. It makes you safer by being used as a standby weapon to protect from rapists and molesters. And of course if your man is having an affair, you have something ready to kick him with or throw at him.\n\nAdditionally, it makes you look more stylish and sexy when pairing up with tights, stockings or a pantyhose, it helps to enhance your body figure by lifting up your butt, flattening your stomach areas, accentuating you breasts and overall makes you look desirable. Last but certainly not least, it gains you more and special attention from males around. In fact, one of my friends always turns around when he sees a woman in stilettos, click-clacking past and stares at her receding figure in awe, admiration and desire.\n\nIt will help you in work, making you look more important and powerful like Yahoo!'s Marissa Mayer and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, and if your job involves public relations, men will be more polite and respectful. In fact a study proved that when woman where heels above 4\", men are willing to help them 3 times more than if they were wearing heels between 2\" and 4\" and 7 times more than if they were wearing heels below 2\" or flats.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nAll high heels counter the natural functionality of the foot, sometimes causing skeletal and muscular problems if users wear them excessively; such shoes are a common cause of [[venous]] complaints such as pain, fatigue, and heavy-feeling legs, and have been found to provoke [[venous hypertension]] in the lower limbs.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Wagner|first= T.F.|title= Influence of high-heeled shoes on venous function in young women|journal= Journal of Vascular Surgery|volume= 56|issue= 4|pages= 1039\u20131044|publisher= [[Society for Vascular Surgery]]|date= October 2012|url= http://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(12)00117-6/abstract|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2012.01.039|doi-access= free}}</ref> Despite their impracticality and fluctuating demand, they persist as a fashion option.\n\nStiletto heels concentrate a large amount of force into a small area.

After their demise in the mid-late 1960s, such slender heels were hard to find until recently due to changes in the way heels were mass-produced.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Shoe fetishism}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Stiefelwiki1e.jpg|190px|thumb|Stiletto heels can be found on almost every type of shoes, such as these ankle boots]]\n\nRelatively thin high heels were certainly around in the late 19th century, as numerous [[fetish art|fetish drawing]]s attest. Firm photographic evidence exists in the form of photographs of Parisian singer [[Mistinguett]] from the 1940s. These shoes were designed by [[Andre Perugia]], who began designing shoes in 1906. It seems unlikely that he invented the stiletto, but he is probably the first firmly-documented designer of the high, slim heel. The word stiletto applied to a heel is derived from a [[knife]] or [[dagger]] [[stiletto]], which is a long, thin blade, to which the heel of the shoe is similar in profile. Its usage in footwear first appeared in print in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine in 1959: \"She came ...forward, her walk made lopsided by the absence of one heel of the stilettos\".<ref name=Games2007>{{Cite book|last = Games|first = Alex|year = 2007|title = Balderdash & Piffle: One Sandwich Short of a Dog's Dinner|isbn = 978-1-84607-235-2|publisher = BBC Books|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/balderdashpiffle0000game}}</ref>\n\nHigh-heel shoes were worn by men and women [[courtier]]s. The stiletto heel came with the advent of technology using a supporting metal shaft or stem embedded into the heel, instead of wood or other, weaker materials that required a wide heel. This revival of the opulent heel style can be attributed to the designer [[Roger Vivier]] and such designs became very popular in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|title= Italian Fashion: The History of High Heels|first= Meredith|last= Paslawsky|date= November 2008|publisher= Life In Italy|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104328/http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|archivedate= 22 December 2015|accessdate= 20 December 2012|quote= In 1954, Roger Vivier designed the first stiletto heel with its infamous bold arch for the house of Dior. \"Stiletto\" is an Italian word for a small metal dagger.}}</ref>\n\nAs time went on, stiletto heels would become known more for their erotic nature than for their ability to make height. Stiletto heels are a common [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] item. As a fashion item, their popularity has changed over time. After an initial wave of popularity in the 1950s, they reached their most refined shape in the early 1960s, when the toes of the shoes which bore them became as slender and elongated as the stiletto heels themselves. As a result of the overall sharpness of outline, it was customary for women to refer to the whole shoe as a \"stiletto\", not just the heel, via [[synecdoche]] (''[[pars pro toto]]''). Although they faded from the scene after the [[The Beatles|Beatle]] era began, their popularity continued at street level, and women stubbornly refused to give them up even after they could no longer readily find them in the mainstream shops. A version of the stiletto heel was reintroduced in 1974 by [[Manolo Blahnik]], who dubbed his \"new\" heel the \"Needle\". Similar heels were stocked at the big [[Biba]] store in London, by [[Russell & Bromley]] and by smaller boutiques. Old, unsold stocks of pointed-toe stilettos and contemporary efforts to replicate them (lacking the true stiletto heel because of changes in the way heels were by then being mass-produced) were sold in street fashion markets and became popular with [[Punk subculture|punks]] and with other fashion \"tribes\" of the late 1970s until supplies of the inspirational original styles dwindled in the early 1980s.
