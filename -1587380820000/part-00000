Holders of registered occupations are considered to be bourgeois.\n\nDuring the 13th century, bourgeois dynasties were built: Sarrazins, Barbette, Bourdon (see rue des Bourdonnais), Pisdoe or Pizdoue, etc.\n\nThe capacity of bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights in opposition to the simple inhabitants, forms the base of the urban organization of cities. This urban system in Europe dates back for many cities still existing today to [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Latin antiquity]], others were founded around the year one thousand.<ref>[[Henri Pirenne]], ''Les villes du Moyen \u00c2ge, essai d\u2019histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'', Bruxelles, Lamertin, 1927.

Its exterior design is still based on O303, however its chassis no longer comes from O303 like its predecessor, but from O404 instead. This is shown on various new technical features, including disk brakes, independent front suspensions, and the instrument panel.\n\nThe exterior design Mercedes-Benz O350 is unusual, either in opposition to its plain predecessor O340 or its flagship O404: A tapered C-pillar makes it unmistakable. At the beginning, O350 is only available as a 12m variant with normal height (known as RHD for Reisehochdecker in German). In year 1998, a variant with increased height was presented, known as O350 SHD (Superhochdecker in German). As a result, the SHD model offers more space for luggage than conventional RHD model. \n\nIn year 1999, the Tourismo series became a facelift. The type designation \"O350\" was cancelled. The oblique C-pillar is now optically integrated into the front door, which creates a smoother transition of lines. The front, headlamps and exterior mirrors were revised, and fog lights were added. Also the interior was redesigned: Almond-shaped multifunction lights in the ceiling instead of previous light bar. These buses still come from Turkish production, and are available as RHD and SHD models.\n\nIn year 2004, Mercedes-Benz celebrated the 10th anniversary of Tourismo series: Already 10,000 units were produced since its introduction. In the same year, Mercedes-Benz also offered a special edition called \"Edition 10,000\". It is about a Tourismo RHD with special equipment and many extras, which can be recognized on its chromed stripe around the three-pointed star in the front. A total of 70 units were produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omnibusarchiv.de/include.php?path=content&mode=print&contentid=592 |title=Mercedes-Benz O340 and Mercedes-Benz O350 Tourismo |website=Omnibusarchiv |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Second generation - 2006-2018==\nThe world premiere for the 2nd generation Tourismo took place at [[International Motor Show Germany|IAA]] in year 2006. It was deliberately intended to be a low-cost alternative of its more luxurious top model, the [[Mercedes-Benz Travego|Travego]]. At first, it was available in four models: Tourismo (12.14m), Tourismo M/2 (12.96m, with 2 axles), Tourismo M/3 (12.96m, with 3 axles) and Tourismo L (13.93m). There are numerous safety features on this bus: the [[Electronic stability program|ESP]], [[Traction control|ASR]], and brake assist (BA). In addition, an alcohol interlock system, tyre pressure monitoring system, and fire extinguishing system in engine compartment are standard. A rear camera is optionally available, which facilitates reverse parking.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-15-RHD.xhtml?oid=9904404 |title=Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo 15 RHD |website=Daimler |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn year 2009, as the successor of [[Mercedes-Benz Integro|Integro]] range, the Tourismo RH with lowered floor was launched. In opposition to Integro, the Tourismo RH have barely optical differences: Only the side window lines in the front section of the vehicle was changed from sharp edges to smoother curves. However, the Tourismo RH model shares its most technologies and equipment options with Tourismo series, and equipped with OM470 engine meeting Euro VI standards. The doors are also offered with high panels by default, instead of full-glazed doors, which find application on Integro. According to [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], this bus is designed to both meet the requirements of interurban and touring coach uses. Two lengths are available for customers: Tourismo RH (12.14m) and Tourismo RH M (12.98m).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-16-RHM.xhtml?oid=9904354 |title=Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo 16 RH/M |website=Daimler |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nTourismo K, the compact variant of Tourismo series, was introduced in year 2013. This midi touring coach is 10.32 meters long and offers seats for up to 32 passengers. It has the same height with Tourismo RH series, but its second door is located at the rear, which is advantageous for sufficient underfloor luggage room space. The onboard toilet is also at the rear, just behind the second door. The Tourismo K is equipped with an OM936 Euro VI engine, which delivers 260kW (or 354hp), and shares its equipment options with Tourismo series in general.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.auto.de/magazin/mercedes-benz-tourismo-k-kurzware-fuer-die-businessklasse/ |title=Mercedes-Benz Tourismo K: A short ware for the business class (in German) |website=Auto.de |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Tourismo-K-MA-LO-1001-Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-K.xhtml?oid=9905054 |title=Tourismo K (MA LO 1001): Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo K |website=Daimler |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Third generation - 2017-present==\nThe 3rd generation tourismo experienced its world premiere in [[Brussels]] in June 2017. There is a major change on its exterior design, which resembles that of [[Mercedes-Benz Actros|Actros]], a heavy-duty truck of [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Besides that, it received a new interior design and several technological improvements. The options for interior equipment include seats, seat covers, side walls, curtains, luggage carrier shelves and central ceiling panel, which can be customized individually. Additional driving safety is guaranteed by new safety features like Emergency Brake Assist, Stop-Assist (for stop-and-go traffic e.g. [[traffic jam]]), Attention Assist, and Front Collision Guard (FCG). \n\nIn comparison to its predecessor, its fuel consumption was reduced by around 4.5% due to more advanced body aerodynamics and lighter, completely redesigned body. With \"Efficiency Package\", the fuel consumption can even go down by 7%. Some new features such as Predictive Powertrain Control (PPC) or Eco Driver Feedback (EDF), can be equipped on request. Operators can select 2 cockpit variants: The Basic Plus and the Comfort Plus. They all contain a multifunction [[steering wheel]] and a instrument cluster with TFT colour screen, except that the Comfort Plus is additionally fitted with a Coach Multimedia System. \n\nThe 3rd generation Tourismo is available in four models: Tourismo (12.2m), Tourismo M/2 (13.1m, 2 axles), Tourismo M/3 (13.1m, 3 axles) and Tourismo L (13.9m).

It was initially introduced as the successor of low-cost variant presented in year 1992 ([[Mercedes-Benz O340|O340]]) to the more luxurious [[Mercedes-Benz O404]] and produced in [[Hasdere, Gazipa\u015fa]], [[Turkey]]. In 2006 a revised version was launched.<ref>{{cite news| title= Mercedes-Benz Tourismo| work= Bus & Coach Buyer| number= 1371 |date= 25 March 2016 | pages= 24\u201326}}</ref> By 2014, 21,000 had been sold.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www2.mercedes-benz.co.uk/content/unitedkingdom/mpc/mpc_unitedkingdom_website/en/home_mpc/bus/home/buses_world/update/news_2014/20years_tourismo.html |title= 20 years, two generations and over 21,000 buses| publisher= Mercedes-Benz |website= mercedes-benz.co.uk| date= 21 November 2014| access-date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.busandcoachbuyer.com/tourismo-turns-20/ |title= Tourismo turns 20| work= Bus & Coach Buyer| date= 28 November 2014| access-date= }}</ref>\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz Tourismo, Berlin (20180910 131351).jpg|thumb|Rear view]]\n\n==First generation - 1994-2006==\nAs the successor of O340, the O350 was unveiled at Hannover International Motor show in year 1994. Its exterior design is still based on O303, however its chassis no longer comes from O303 like its predecessor, but from O404 instead. This is shown on various new technical features, including disk brakes, independent front suspensions, and the instrument panel.\n\nThe exterior design Mercedes-Benz O350 is unusual, either in opposition to its plain predecessor O340 or its flagship O404: A tapered C-pillar makes it unmistakable. At the beginning, O350 is only available as a 12m variant with normal height (known as RHD for Reisehochdecker in German). In year 1998, a variant with increased height was presented, known as O350 SHD (Superhochdecker in German). As a result, the SHD model offers more space for luggage than conventional RHD model. \n\nIn year 1999, the Tourismo series became a facelift. The type designation \"O350\" was cancelled. The oblique C-pillar is now optically integrated into the front door, which creates a smoother transition of lines. The front, headlamps and exterior mirrors were revised, and fog lights were added. Also the interior was redesigned: Almond-shaped multifunction lights in the ceiling instead of previous light bar. These buses still come from Turkish production, and are available as RHD and SHD models.\n\nIn year 2004, Mercedes-Benz celebrated the 10th anniversary of Tourismo series: Already 10,000 units were produced since its introduction. In the same year, Mercedes-Benz also offered a special edition called \"Edition 10,000\". It is about a Tourismo RHD with special equipment and many extras, which can be recognized on its chromed stripe around the three-pointed star in the front. A total of 70 units were produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omnibusarchiv.de/include.php?path=content&mode=print&contentid=592 |title=Mercedes-Benz O340 and Mercedes-Benz O350 Tourismo |website=Omnibusarchiv |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Second generation - 2006-2018==\nThe world premiere for the 2nd generation Tourismo took place at [[International Motor Show Germany|IAA]] in year 2006. It was deliberately intended to be a low-cost alternative of its more luxurious top model, the [[Mercedes-Benz Travego|Travego]]. At first, it was available in four models: Tourismo (12.14m), Tourismo M/2 (12.96m, with 2 axles), Tourismo M/3 (12.96m, with 3 axles) and Tourismo L (13.93m). There are numerous safety features on this bus: the [[Electronic stability program|ESP]], [[Traction control|ASR]], and brake assist (BA). In addition, an alcohol interlock system, tyre pressure monitoring system, and fire extinguishing system in engine compartment are standard. A rear camera is optionally available, which facilitates reverse parking.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-15-RHD.xhtml?oid=9904404 |title=Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo 15 RHD |website=Daimler |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn year 2009, as the successor of [[Mercedes-Benz Integro|Integro]] range, the Tourismo RH with lowered floor was launched. In opposition to Integro, the Tourismo RH have barely optical differences: Only the side window lines in the front section of the vehicle was changed from sharp edges to smoother curves. However, the Tourismo RH model shares its most technologies and equipment options with Tourismo series, and equipped with OM470 engine meeting Euro VI standards. The doors are also offered with high panels by default, instead of full-glazed doors, which find application on Integro. According to [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], this bus is designed to both meet the requirements of interurban and touring coach uses. Two lengths are available for customers: Tourismo RH (12.14m) and Tourismo RH M (12.98m).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-16-RHM.xhtml?oid=9904354 |title=Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo 16 RH/M |website=Daimler |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nTourismo K, the compact variant of Tourismo series, was introduced in year 2013. This midi touring coach is 10.32 meters long and offers seats for up to 32 passengers. It has the same height with Tourismo RH series, but its second door is located at the rear, which is advantageous for sufficient underfloor luggage room space. The onboard toilet is also at the rear, just behind the second door. The Tourismo K is equipped with an OM936 Euro VI engine, which delivers 260kW (or 354hp), and shares its equipment options with Tourismo series in general.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.auto.de/magazin/mercedes-benz-tourismo-k-kurzware-fuer-die-businessklasse/ |title=Mercedes-Benz Tourismo K: A short ware for the business class (in German) |website=Auto.de |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Tourismo-K-MA-LO-1001-Vehicle-profile-Mercedes-Benz-Tourismo-K.xhtml?oid=9905054 |title=Tourismo K (MA LO 1001): Vehicle profile: Mercedes-Benz Tourismo K |website=Daimler |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Third generation - 2017-present==\nThe 3rd generation tourismo experienced its world premiere in [[Brussels]] in June 2017. There is a major change on its exterior design, which resembles that of [[Mercedes-Benz Actros|Actros]], a heavy-duty truck of [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Besides that, it received a new interior design and several technological improvements. The options for interior equipment include seats, seat covers, side walls, curtains, luggage carrier shelves and central ceiling panel, which can be customized individually. Additional driving safety is guaranteed by new safety features like Emergency Brake Assist, Stop-Assist (for stop-and-go traffic e.g. [[traffic jam]]), Attention Assist, and Front Collision Guard (FCG). \n\nIn comparison to its predecessor, its fuel consumption was reduced by around 4.5% due to more advanced body aerodynamics and lighter, completely redesigned body. With \"Efficiency Package\", the fuel consumption can even go down by 7%. Some new features such as Predictive Powertrain Control (PPC) or Eco Driver Feedback (EDF), can be equipped on request. Operators can select 2 cockpit variants: The Basic Plus and the Comfort Plus. They all contain a multifunction [[steering wheel]] and a instrument cluster with TFT colour screen, except that the Comfort Plus is additionally fitted with a Coach Multimedia System. \n\nThe 3rd generation Tourismo is available in four models: Tourismo (12.2m), Tourismo M/2 (13.1m, 2 axles), Tourismo M/3 (13.1m, 3 axles) and Tourismo L (13.9m). For the first time, they all are available either as left- or right-hand drive variants.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, though he later pleaded guilty to robbery with hurt, and sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Abdul Nasir was eventually found guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. However, it was not the end of Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two officers before being abducted. Abdul Nasir was later convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane in January 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray ordered Abdul Nasir's life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

On 7 September that year, Fabian was arrested, followed by Ellarry the next day. In September 2011, Fabian was found guilty of murder and given the mandatory death sentence. However, in 2012, the mandatory death penalty law was revised. It reduces the sentence of death, for those convicted of drug trafficking or murder, to life imprisonment if conditions were met.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/murderer-fails-to-escape-the-gallows-6-other-cases-involving-the-revised|title=Murderer fails to escape the gallows: 6 other cases involving the revised death penalty laws|last=Abu Baker|first=Jalelah|date=16 January 2015|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321155910/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/murderer-fails-to-escape-the-gallows-6-other-cases-involving-the-revised|archive-date=21 March 2018|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref> This enabled Fabian to undergo a retrial and on 17 July 2013, he became the first person to have his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment under the revised death penalty.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, though he later pleaded guilty to robbery with hurt, and sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Abdul Nasir was eventually found guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. However, it was not the end of Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two officers before being abducted. Abdul Nasir was later convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane in January 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray ordered Abdul Nasir's life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

On 7 September that year, Fabian was arrested, followed by Ellarry the next day. In September 2011, Fabian was found guilty of murder and given the mandatory death sentence. However, in 2012, the mandatory death penalty law was revised. It reduces the sentence of death, for those convicted of drug trafficking or murder, to life imprisonment if conditions were met.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/murderer-fails-to-escape-the-gallows-6-other-cases-involving-the-revised|title=Murderer fails to escape the gallows: 6 other cases involving the revised death penalty laws|last=Abu Baker|first=Jalelah|date=16 January 2015|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321155910/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/murderer-fails-to-escape-the-gallows-6-other-cases-involving-the-revised|archive-date=21 March 2018|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref> This enabled Fabian to undergo a retrial and on 17 July 2013, he became the first person to have his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment under the revised death penalty.

[[Guru Nanak]], born in 1469 in the Lahore district, married in 1485 with Sulkhani, daughter of Mool Chand, a Khatri of Pakhoke (Dera Baba Nanak) in the [[Batala]] Tehsil. There is still a wall known as Jhoolana Mahal which swings in Gurdaspur. The Sikh [[Guru Hargobind]] refounded [[Sri Hargobindpur]] which had been formerly known by the name of Rahila. [[Banda Singh Bahadur]], the disciple of Guru Gobind Singh used this district as a base to raid the country up to Lahore, the emperor [[Bahadur Shah I|Bahadur Shah]] conducted an expedition against him in 1711 but with only temporary effect. Banda Bahadar fought his last battle with the Mughal at Gurdas Nangal in the district and was captured. The history of the district then degenerates into an account of their struggles with the rival [[Ramgarhia]] Misl and [[Kanhaiya Misl]]s for supremacy in this part of the [[Doab]], the power of the former was broken in 1808 and of the latter in 1811.\n\n[[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] thus assumed way over the whole district.

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as \u27e8viridiarium\u27e9 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] completely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as \u27e8viridiarium\u27e9 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.
