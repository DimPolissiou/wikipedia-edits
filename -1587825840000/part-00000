They were later joined by the county's only other municipality, [[Payne, Georgia|Payne City]], in 2015.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.macon.com/news/politics-government/article30224283.html|title=Payne City officially dissolved|last=Lee|first=Maggie|date=2015-04-01|website=The Telegraph {{!}} Macon.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-17}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (mostly [[Creek people|Creek]]) had inhabited the area which would become Bibb County for many centuries. They were forcibly relocated to today's [[Oklahoma]] in the [[Indian Removal]] in the 1830s, during the administration of President [[Andrew Jackson]]. The Indian tribes affected refer to this as the \"[[Trail of Tears]]\",\nsince many died during the march west.\n\nBibb is one of the counties of the [[Black Belt in the American South|\"Black Belt\"]], which originally referred to the fertile dark soil in the uplands. The area was developed by white settlers and African American slaves into [[cotton]] [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] during the antebellum years. Cotton generated high profits, since was in demand in the textile mills of the northern states as well as in England. By the 1860 census, shortly before the [[American Civil War]], more than a million enslaved African Americans lived in Georgia, and they constituted a majority of the population in much of the Black Belt.\n\nBibb County was created by act of the [[Georgia Legislature|State Legislature of Georgia]] on December 9, 1822, with Macon to be incorporated as a town/city in December 1823; designated the County Seat. It was carved from the earlier territories of the counties of [[Jones County, Georgia|Jones]], [[Monroe County, Georgia|Monroe]], [[Houston County, Georgia|Houston]], and [[Twiggs County, Georgia|Twiggs]] counties. The County Seat has never been changed since, and no other subsequent county in the state has ever been created (\"erected\") out of land from Bibb County.\n\nThe county was named for Dr. [[William Wyatt Bibb]], a [[physician]] from [[Elbert County, Georgia|Elbert County]], who was elected to and served in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate]] from [[History of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], moved to the new [[Alabama Territory]], before being elected as the first [[Governor of Alabama|Governor of the new State of Alabama]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], an estimated ten percent of the white males in the county lost their lives while serving the [[Confederate Army|Confederate States Army]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vKMMkmNPSgC&pg=PA123 |title=Cotton, Fire, and Dreams|work=google.com}}</ref> The war ended slavery in Georgia, but it also left much of the state in ruins.\n\n===Civil War to present===\n{{Main|Macon, Georgia#History|l1 = Macon, Georgia - History}}\nAfter the Civil War and during the 20th century, the county seat of Macon continued to serve as the county's principal population center and hub of most significant landmarks and historical events.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, voters in the City of Macon (57.8 percent approval) and Bibb County (56.7 percent approval) passed a referendum to merge the governments of the city and the county, based on the authorization of House Bill 1171 passed by the [[Georgia General Assembly]] earlier in the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/sum/hb1171.htm|title=HB 1171 - Macon-Bibb County; create and incorporate new political body corporate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030001652/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/sum/hb1171.htm|archivedate=2012-10-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> Four previous consolidation attempts (in 1933, 1960, 1972, and 1976) had failed.<ref name=\"City-County Consolidation Proposals, 1921 - Present\">[http://www.naco.org/Counties/Documents/City%20County%20Consolidations.01.01.2011.pdf City-County Consolidation Proposals, 1921 - Present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719083354/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Documents/City%20County%20Consolidations.01.01.2011.pdf|date=2012-07-19}}, ''National Association of Counties''.

They were forcibly relocated to today's [[Oklahoma]] in the [[Indian Removal]] in the 1830s, during the administration of President [[Andrew Jackson]]. The Indian tribes affected refer to this as the \"[[Trail of Tears]]\",\nsince many died during the march west.\n\nBibb is one of the counties of the [[Black Belt (U.S. Region)|\"Black Belt\"]], which originally referred to the fertile dark soil in the uplands. The area was developed by white settlers and African American slaves into [[cotton]] [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] during the antebellum years. Cotton generated high profits, since was in demand in the textile mills of the northern states as well as in England. By the 1860 census, shortly before the [[American Civil War]], more than a million enslaved African Americans lived in Georgia, and they constituted a majority of the population in much of the Black Belt.\n\nBibb County was created by act of the [[Georgia Legislature|State Legislature of Georgia]] on December 9, 1822, with Macon to be incorporated as a town/city in December 1823; designated the County Seat. It was carved from the earlier territories of the counties of [[Jones County, Georgia|Jones]], [[Monroe County, Georgia|Monroe]], [[Houston County, Georgia|Houston]], and [[Twiggs County, Georgia|Twiggs]] counties. The County Seat has never been changed since, and no other subsequent county in the state has ever been created (\"erected\") out of land from Bibb County.\n\nThe county was named for Dr. [[William Wyatt Bibb]], a [[physician]] from [[Elbert County, Georgia|Elbert County]], who was elected to and served in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate]] from [[History of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], moved to the new [[Alabama Territory]], before being elected as the first [[Governor of Alabama|Governor of the new State of Alabama]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], an estimated ten percent of the white males in the county lost their lives while serving the [[Confederate Army|Confederate States Army]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vKMMkmNPSgC&pg=PA123 |title=Cotton, Fire, and Dreams|work=google.com}}</ref> The war ended slavery in Georgia, but it also left much of the state in ruins.\n\n===Civil War to present===\n{{Main|Macon, Georgia#History|l1 = Macon, Georgia - History}}\nAfter the Civil War and during the 20th century, the county seat of Macon continued to serve as the county's principal population center and hub of most significant landmarks and historical events.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, voters in the City of Macon (57.8 percent approval) and Bibb County (56.7 percent approval) passed a referendum to merge the governments of the city and the county, based on the authorization of House Bill 1171 passed by the [[Georgia General Assembly]] earlier in the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/sum/hb1171.htm|title=HB 1171 - Macon-Bibb County; create and incorporate new political body corporate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030001652/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/sum/hb1171.htm|archivedate=2012-10-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> Four previous consolidation attempts (in 1933, 1960, 1972, and 1976) had failed.<ref name=\"City-County Consolidation Proposals, 1921 - Present\">[http://www.naco.org/Counties/Documents/City%20County%20Consolidations.01.01.2011.pdf City-County Consolidation Proposals, 1921 - Present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719083354/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Documents/City%20County%20Consolidations.01.01.2011.pdf|date=2012-07-19}}, ''National Association of Counties''.

The states of Jafarabad and Janjira were united in a personal way.\n\n[[Jafrabad]] town, the capital and only municipality, is located 275&nbsp;km south of [[Ahmedabad]] and 240 southwest of [[Baroda]]. The state was formed by the city and 11 villages and initially consisted of two districts located on both sides of the estuary of the Ranai river. Jafrabad state had an area of 68&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a population in 1881 of 4,746 and in 1901 of 6,038 inhabitants. The majority of the population were Muslims (80%) and the rest Hindus. The state and the town took their name from Sultan Muzaffar Jafar from Gujarat who built fortifications.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==History==\nJafarabad State was founded around 1650. On 6 December 1733 the ruler of Jafarabad State signed a defensive and offensive treaty with the [[British East India Company]].\nIn 1759, the Jafarabad and Janjira states entered into a [[personal union]]. Finally in 1834 Jafarabad State became a [[British protectorate]].<ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_A-J.html Princely States of India]</ref>\n\nAround 1731 when the [[Mughal Empire]] rule was relaxed in Gujarat, the local ''Thanedar'' (ruler) who was an ally in the Muslim Mughal garrison became independent. Thereafter the ''Thanedar'' and the local [[Koli people|Kolis]] were devoted to piracy, repeatedly attacking ships and disturbing commercial traffic from [[Surat]]. [[Sidi Hilal]], the prince of the dynasty of [[Janjira State|Janjira]] which was then ruling Surat, attacked the Kolis, destroyed their boats and captured them demanding a hefty fine.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Robbins, Kenneth X. |author2=McLeod, John |title=African elites in India: Habshi Amarat |publisher=Mapin |year=2006 |pages=272 Pages |isbn=1890206970}}</ref> The Thanedar of Jafarabad could not afford to pay the fine and hence Jafarabad town was sold to Sidi Hilal in 1759.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSidi Hilal soon realized that he could not keep the city given the situation of lawlessness in the Kathiawar peninsula and in 1762 he transferred Jafarabad to the [[Nawab]] of Janjira, who paid the debts and appointed him governor.\n\nUnder British protectorate the Nawabs of Janjira were considered separate second class rulers among the rulers of Kathiawar, but they were later promoted to first class.

It was located in the [[Kathiawar Peninsula]] on the [[Gujarat]] coast. The state had formerly been part of the [[Baroda Agency]] and later of the [[Kathiawar Agency]] of the [[Bombay Presidency]].\n\nJafrabad State was a dependency of the [[Nawab]] of [[Janjira State]],<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Jafarabad |volume=15 |page=125}}</ref> located 320&nbsp;km to the [[South-southeast|SSE]] on the [[Konkan coast]]. The states of Jafarabad and Janjira were united in a personal way.\n\n[[Jafrabad]] town, the capital and only municipality, is located 275&nbsp;km south of [[Ahmedabad]] and 240 southwest of [[Baroda]]. The state was formed by the city and 11 villages and initially consisted of two districts located on both sides of the estuary of the Ranai river. Jafrabad state had an area of 68&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a population in 1881 of 4,746 and in 1901 of 6,038 inhabitants. The majority of the population were Muslims (80%) and the rest Hindus. The state and the town took their name from Sultan Muzaffar Jafar from Gujarat who built fortifications.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==History==\nJafarabad State was founded around 1650. On 6 December 1733 the ruler of Jafarabad State signed a defensive and offensive treaty with the [[British East India Company]].\nIn 1759, the Jafarabad and Janjira states entered into a [[personal union]]. Finally in 1834 Jafarabad State became a [[British protectorate]].<ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_A-J.html Princely States of India]</ref>\n\nAround 1731 when the [[Mughal Empire]] rule was relaxed in Gujarat, the local ''Thanedar'' (ruler) who was an ally in the Muslim Mughal garrison became independent. Thereafter the ''Thanedar'' and the local [[Koli people|Kolis]] were devoted to piracy, repeatedly attacking ships and disturbing commercial traffic from [[Surat]]. [[Sidi Hilal]], the prince of the dynasty of [[Janjira State|Janjira]] which was then ruling Surat, attacked the Kolis, destroyed their boats and captured them demanding a hefty fine.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Robbins, Kenneth X. |author2=McLeod, John |title=African elites in India: Habshi Amarat |publisher=Mapin |year=2006 |pages=272 Pages |isbn=1890206970}}</ref> The Thanedar of Jafarabad could not afford to pay the fine and hence Jafarabad town was sold to Sidi Hilal in 1759.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSidi Hilal soon realized that he could not keep the city given the situation of lawlessness in the Kathiawar peninsula and in 1762 he transferred Jafarabad to the [[Nawab]] of Janjira, who paid the debts and appointed him governor.\n\nUnder British protectorate the Nawabs of Janjira were considered separate second class rulers among the rulers of Kathiawar, but they were later promoted to first class. In the nineteenth century the rulers maintained a military force of 123 men. \nJafarabad State acceded to the [[Indian Union]] on 8 March 1948.<ref>Great Britain India Office.

Until modern ''[[Haskalah]]'' (Jewish Enlightenment) and [[Jewish emancipation]], Jewish philosophy was preoccupied with attempts to reconcile coherent new ideas into the tradition of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], thus organizing emergent ideas that are not necessarily Jewish into a uniquely Jewish scholastic framework and world-view. With their acceptance into modern society, Jews with secular educations embraced or developed entirely new philosophies to meet the demands of the world in which they now found themselves.\n\nMedieval re-discovery of [[ancient Greek philosophy]] among the [[Geonim]] of 10th century Babylonian academies brought rationalist philosophy into [[Tanakh|Biblical]]-[[Talmud]]ic Judaism. The philosophy was generally in competition with [[Kabbalah]]. Both schools would become part of classic [[Rabbinic literature]], though the decline of scholastic [[rationalism]] coincided with historical events which drew Jews to the Kabbalistic approach. For [[Ashkenazi Jews]], emancipation and encounter with secular thought from the 18th century onwards altered how philosophy was viewed. [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] communities had later more ambivalent interaction with secular culture than in Western Europe. In the varied responses to modernity, Jewish philosophical ideas were developed across the range of emerging [[Jewish religious movements|religious movements]]. These developments could be seen as either continuations of or breaks from the canon of [[Rabbinic]] philosophy of the Middle Ages, as well as the other historical [[dialectic]] aspects of Jewish thought, and resulted in diverse contemporary Jewish attitudes to philosophical methods.\n\n== Ancient Jewish philosophy ==\n\n=== Philosophy in the Bible ===\n{{seealso|Solomon}}\n[[Rabbinic literature]] sometimes views Abraham as a [[philosopher]]. Some have suggested that [[Abraham]] introduced a philosophy learned from [[Melchizedek]];<ref>\"The Melchizedek Tradition: A Critical Examination of the Sources to the Fifth Century ad and in the Epistle to the Hebrews\", by Fred L. Horton, Jr., Pg. 54, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-521-01871-4}}</ref> Some Jews ascribe the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' \"Book of Creation\" to Abraham.<ref>\"Sefer Yetzirah\", By Aryeh Kaplan, xii, Red Wheel, 1997, {{ISBN|0-87728-855-0}}</ref>  A [[midrash]]<ref>Bereishit Rabba (39,1)</ref> describes how Abraham understood this world to have a creator and director by comparing this world to \"a house with a light in it\", what is now called the [[Teleological argument|argument from design]].  [[Psalms]] contains invitations to admire the wisdom of God through his works; from this, some scholars suggest, Judaism harbors a Philosophical under-current.<ref>\"Medieval Philosophy and the Classical Tradition: In Islam, Judaism and Christianity\" by John Inglis, Page 3</ref> [[Ecclesiastes]] is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; its author seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world and life's meaning.<ref>\"Introduction to Philosophy\" by Dr Tom Kerns</ref>\n\n=== Philo of Alexandria ===\n[[File:PhiloThevet.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Philo]]]]\n[[Philo]] attempted to fuse and harmonize Greek and Jewish philosophy through allegory, which he learned from Jewish exegesis and [[Stoicism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=281&letter=P |title=Philo Jud\u00e6us |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> Philo attempted to make his philosophy the means of defending and justifying Jewish religious ''truths''. These ''truths'' he regarded as fixed and determinate, and philosophy was used as an aid to ''truth'', and a means of arriving at it. To this end Philo chose from philosophical tenets of Greeks, refusing those that did not harmonize with Judaism such as Aristotle's doctrine of the ''eternity and indestructibility of the world''.\n\nDr. [[Bernard Revel]], in dissertation on Karaite [[halakha]], points to writings of a 10th-century [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]], [[Jacob Qirqisani]], who quotes Philo, illustrating how Karaites made use of Philo's works in development of Karaite Judaism. Philo's works became important to Medieval Christian scholars who leveraged the work of Karaites to lend credence to their claims that \"these are the beliefs of Jews\" - a technically correct, yet deceptive, attribution.\n\n== Jewish scholarship after destruction of Second Temple ==\nWith the Roman destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, [[Second Temple Judaism]] was in disarray,<ref>\"Christianity, Judaism and other Greco-Roman cults: studies for Morton Smith at sixty\", Volume 12, Part 1, Pg 110, Volume 12 of Studies in Judaism in late antiquity, by Jacob Neusner ann  Morton Smith, Brill 1975, {{ISBN|90-04-04215-6}}</ref> but Jewish traditions were preserved especially thanks to the shrewd maneuvers of [[Johanan ben Zakai]], who saved the [[Sanhedrin]] and moved it to [[Yavne]]. Philosophical speculation was not a central part of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], although some have seen the [[Mishnah]] as a philosophical work.<ref>Jacob Neusner, ''Judaism as Philosophy''</ref> [[Rabbi Akiva]] has also been viewed as a philosophical figure:<ref>\"Beginnings in Jewish Philosophy\", By Meyer Levin, Pg 49, Behrman House 1971, {{ISBN|0-87441-063-0}}</ref> his statements include 1.) ''\"How favored is man, for he was created after an image \"for in an image, Elokim made man\" ''(Gen. ix. 6)''\"'', 2.) ''\"Everything is foreseen; but freedom ''[of will]'' is given to every man\"'', 3.) ''\"The world is governed by mercy... but the divine decision is made by the preponderance of the good or bad in one's actions\"''.\n\nAfter the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], Rabbinic scholars gathered in [[Tiberias]] and [[Safed]] to re-assemble and re-assess Judaism, its laws, theology, liturgy, beliefs and leadership structure. In 219 CE, the [[Sura Academy]] (from which [[Jewish Kalam]] emerged many centuries later) was founded by [[Abba Arika]]. For the next five centuries, Talmudic academies focused upon reconstituting Judaism and little, if any, philosophic investigation was pursued.\n\n=== Who influences whom? ===\n{{further|Early Islamic philosophy}}\nRabbinic Judaism had limited philosophical activity until it was challenged by [[Islam]], Karaite Judaism, and [[Christianity]]\u2014with Tanach, Mishnah, and Talmud, there was no need for a philosophic framework.  From an economic viewpoint, [[Radhanite]] trade dominance was being usurped by coordinated Christian and Islamic forced-conversions, and torture, compelling Jewish scholars to understand nascent economic threats.  These investigations triggered new ideas and intellectual exchange among Jewish and Islamic scholars in the areas of jurisprudence, mathematics, astronomy, logic and philosophy.  Jewish scholars influenced Islamic scholars and Islamic scholars influenced Jewish scholars.  Contemporary scholars continue to debate who was Muslim and who was Jew\u2014some \"Islamic scholars\" were \"Jewish scholars\" prior to forced conversion to Islam, some Jewish scholars willingly converted to Islam, such as [[Abdullah ibn Salam]], while others later reverted to Judaism, and still others, born and raised as Jews, were ambiguous in their religious beliefs such as [[ibn al-Rawandi]], although they lived according to the customs of their neighbors.\n\nAround 700 CE, \u02bfAmr ibn \u02bfUbayd Abu \u02bfUthman al-Basri introduces two streams of thought that influence Jewish, Islamic and Christian scholars:\n#[[Qadariyah]]\n# [[Bahshamiyya]] [[Mu\u02bftazila]]\n\nThe story of the Bahshamiyya Mu\u02bftazila and Qadariyah is as important, if not more so, as the intellectual symbiosis of Judaism and Islam in Islamic Spain.\n\nAround 733 CE, [[Mar]] Natronai ben Habibai moves to [[Kairouan]], then to Spain, transcribing the [[Talmud]] ''Bavli'' for the Academy at Kairouan from memory\u2014later taking a copy with him to Spain.<ref>\"Geonica\", By Ginzberg Louis, Pg. 18, {{ISBN|1-110-35511-4}}</ref>\n\n==== Karaism ====\n{{main|Karaite Judaism}}\nBorrowing from the [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800\u20131400)|Mutakallamin]] of [[Basra]], the Karaites were the first Jewish group to subject Judaism to Mu\u02bftazila. Rejecting the Talmud and Rabbinical tradition, Karaites took liberty to reinterpret the [[Tanakh]]. This meant abandoning foundational Jewish belief structures. Some scholars suggest that the major impetus for the formation of Karaism was a reaction to the rapid rise of Shi'i Islam, which recognized Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith but claimed that it detracted from monotheism by deferring to Rabbinic authority. Karaites absorbed certain aspects of Jewish sects such as the followers of [[Abu Isa]] (Shi'ism), [[Maliki]] (Sunnis) and Yudghanites (Sufis), who were influenced by East-Islamic scholarship yet deferred to the [[Ash'ari]] when contemplating the sciences.\n\n==== Philosophic synthesis begins ====\n{{further|Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800\u20131400)}}\n{{Location map many | Iraq\n| caption=[[Asuristan]] (shown: modern [[Iraq]]), also called [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Babylonia]]: Centers of Ancient Jewish scholarship\n| label=[[Pumbedita]]\n| position=left\n| lat=33.419  | long= 43.312\n| label2=[[Sura (city)|Sura]]\n| pos2=left\n| lat2=31.883  | long2= 44.45\n| label3=[[Baghdad]]\n| pos3=right\n| lat3=33.325  | long3= 44.422\n| label4=[[Basra]]\n| pos4=left\n| lat4=30.5  | long4= 47.816\n| width=150 | float=right\n}}\nThe spread of Islam throughout the Middle East and North Africa rendered Muslim all that was once Jewish.  Greek philosophy, science, medicine and mathematics was absorbed by Jewish scholars living in the Arab world due to Arabic translations of those texts; remnants of the [[Library of Alexandria]].  Early Jewish converts to Islam brought with them stories from their heritage, known as ''[[Isra'iliyyat]]'', which told of the ''Banu Isra'il'', the pious men of ancient Israel.  One of the most famous early mystics of [[Sufism]], [[Hasan of Basra]], introduced numerous ''Isra'iliyyat'' legends into Islamic scholarship, stories that went on to become representative of Islamic mystical ideas of piety of Sufism.\n\n[[Hai Gaon]] of [[Pumbedita Academy]] begins a new phase in Jewish scholarship and investigation (''hakirah''); Hai Gaon augments Talmudic scholarship with non-Jewish studies.  Hai Gaon was a savant with an exact knowledge of the theological movements of his time so much so that [[Moses ibn Ezra]] called him a [[kalam|mutakallim]].  Hai was competent to argue with followers of Qadariyyah and Mutazilites, sometimes adopting their polemic methods.  Through correspondence with Talmudic Academies at Kairouan, Cordoba and Lucena, Hai Gaon passes along his discoveries to Talmudic scholars therein.\n\nThe teachings of the [[Brethren of Purity]] were carried to the West by a Spanish Arab of Madrid, Muhammad Abu'l-Qasim al-Majnti al-Andalusi, who died in AD 1004\u20131005. Thanks to [[Averroes]], Spain became a center of philosophical learning as is reflected by the explosion of philosophical inquiry among Jews, Muslims and Christians.<ref>\"A literary History of Persia\" Book IV, Chapter X.

BROWNE, M.A.</ref>\n\n== Jewish philosophy before Maimonides ==\n\n=== \"Hiwi the Heretic\" ===\nAccording to Sa'adya Gaon, the Jewish community of [[Balkh]] (Afghanistan) was divided into two groups: \"Jews\" and \"people that are called Jews\"; [[Hiwi al-Balkhi]] was a member of the latter.  Hiwi is generally considered to be the very first \"Jewish\" philosopher to subject the Pentateuch to critical analysis.<ref>Fleischer, Ezra. \"A Fragment from Hivi Al-Balkhi's Criticism of the Bible.\" Tarbiz 51, no. 1 (1981): 49-57.</ref>  Hiwi is viewed by some scholars as an intellectually conflicted man torn between Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Gnostic Christianity, and Manichaean thought.<ref>\"The Messiah in Isaiah 53: The Commentaries of Sa'adya Gaon, Salmon Ben Yeruham, and Yefet Ben Eli 52:13-53:12\", Trade paperback (1998)   by Sa'adia, Joseph Alobaidi</ref><ref>Rosenthal, J. \"Hiwi Al-Balkhi: A Comparative Study.\" Jewish Quarterly Review 38; 39 (1947-48; 1948-49): 317-42, 419-30; 79-94.</ref>\n\nHiwi espoused the belief that miraculous acts, described in the Pentateuch, are simply examples of people using their skills of reasoning to undertake, and perform, seemingly miraculous acts.<ref>Gil, Moshe. Hivi Ha-Balkhi Ha-Kofer Me-Horasan, Ketavim. Merhaviah: Sifriyyat Po'alim, 1965</ref>  As examples of this position, he argued that the parting of the Red Sea was a natural phenomenon, and that Moses' claim to greatness lay merely in his ability to calculate the right moment for the crossing.  He also emphasized that the Egyptian magicians were able to reproduce several of Moses' \"miracles,\" proving that they could not have been so unique.  According to scholars, Hiwi's gravest mistake was having the Pentateuch redacted to reflect his own views - then had those redacted texts, which became popular,  distributed to children.<ref>Davidson, Israel, ed. Sa'adya's Polemic against Hiwi Al-Balkhi: A Fragment Edited from a Genizah Ms, Texts and Studies of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1915.</ref>  Since his views contradicted the views of both Rabbanite and Karaite scholars, Hiwi was declared a heretic.  In this context, however, we can also regard Hiwi, while flawed, as the very first critical biblical commentator; zealous rationalistic views of Hiwi parallel those of [[Ibn al-Rawandi]].\n\nSa\u02bfadya Gaon dedicated an entire treatise, written in rhyming Hebrew, to a refutation of \u1e24\u012bw\u012b's arguments, two fragments of which, preserved in the Cairo Geniza, have been published (Davidson, 1915; Schirmann, 1965).<ref>{{cite web|author=Marzena Zawanowska|title=\" \u1e24\u012bw\u012b al-Balkh\u012b.\" Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World.

Sa'adya Gaon denounced Hiwi as an extreme rationalist, a \"Mulhidun\", or atheist/deviator.  Abraham Ibn Daud described HIwi as a sectarian who \"denied the Torah, yet used it to formulate a new Torah of his liking\".<ref>Malter, Henry. Sa'adya Gaon: His Life and Works, Morris Loeb Series. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1921.</ref>\n\n=== Sa'adya Gaon ===\n[[Saadia Gaon]], son of a [[proselyte]], is considered the greatest early Jewish philosopher. During his early years in [[Tulunids|Tulunid]] Egypt, the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] ruled Egypt; the leaders of the [[Tulunids]] were Ismaili Imams.  Their influence upon the Jewish academies of Egypt resonate in the works of Sa'adya.  Sa'adya's ''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth]]'' (\"Beliefs and Opinions\") was originally called ''Kitab al-Amanat wal-l'tikadat'' (\"Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma\"); it was the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the dogmas of Judaism, completed at Sura Academy in 933 CE.\n\nLittle known is that Saadia traveled to [[Tiberias]] in 915CE to study with Ab\u016b 'l-Kath\u012br Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn Zakariyy\u0101\u02be al-Katib al-Tabari (Tiberias), a Jewish theologian and Bible translator from Tiberias whose main claim to fame is the fact that Saadia Gaon studied with him at some point. He is not mentioned in any Jewish source, and apart from the Andalusian heresiographer and polemicist [[Ibn Hazm]], who mentions him as a Jewish mutakallim (rational theologian), our main source of information is the ''Kit\u0101b al-Tanb\u012bh'' by the Muslim historian [[Al-Masudi|al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b]] (d. 956). In his brief survey of Arabic translations of the Bible, al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b states that the Israelites rely for exegesis and translation of the Hebrew books\u2014i.e., the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, twenty-four books in all, he says\u2014on a number of Israelites whom they praise highly, almost all of whom he has met in person. He mentions Ab\u016b \u02bel-Kath\u012br as one of them, and also Saadia (\"Sa\u02bf\u012bd ibn Ya\u02bfq\u016bb al-Fayy\u016bm\u012b\").  Regardless of what we do not know, Saadia traveled to Tiberias (home of the learned scribes and exegetes) to learn and he chose Ab\u016b 'l-Kath\u012br Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn Zakariyy\u0101\u02be al-Katib al-Tabariya. The extent of Ab\u016b \u02bel-Kath\u012br's influence on Saadia's thought cannot be established, however.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Camilla Adang]]|title=\" Ab\u016b 'l-Kath\u012br Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn Zakariyy\u0101\u02be.\" Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World.

For lack of further information, some scholars have tried to identify Ab\u016b \u02bel-Kath\u012br with the Hebrew grammarian Ab\u016b \u02bfAl\u012b Judah ben \u02bfAll\u0101n, likewise of Tiberias, who seems to have been a Karaite Jew. However, al-Mas\u016bd\u012b unequivocally describes Abu \u02bel-Kath\u012br (as well as his student Saadia) as an ashma\u02bfth\u012b (Rabbanite).\n\nIn \"Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma\" Saadia declares the rationality of the Jewish religion with the caveat that reason must capitulate wherever it contradicts tradition.

He was a [[proselyte]] of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] (not [[Karaite Judaism]], as some argue); al-Mukkamas was a student of physician, and renowned Christian philosopher, Hana.  His close interaction with Hana, and his familial affiliation with Islam gave al-Mukkamas a unique view of religious belief and theology.\n\nIn 1898 [[Abraham Harkavy]] discovered, in Imperial Library of St. Petersburg, fifteen of the twenty chapters of David's philosophical work entitled ''Ishrun Ma\u1e33alat'' (Twenty Chapters) of which 15 survive.  One of the oldest surviving witnesses to early Kal\u0101m, it begins with epistemological investigations, turns to proofs of the creation of the world and the subsequent existence of a Creator, discusses the unity of the Creator (including the divine attributes), and concludes with theodicy (humanity and revelation) and a refutation of other religions (mostly lost).\n\nIn 915 CE, Sa'adya Gaon left for Palestine, where, according to al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b (Tanb\u012bh, 113), he perfected his education at the feet of Ab\u016b 'l-Kath\u012br Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn Zakariyy\u0101\u02be al-Katib al-Tabari (d. 320/932).

Some suggest it was a reaction to a social slight inflicted upon him because he was a Jew, while others suggest he was forcibly converted at the edge of a sword (which prompted Maimonides to comment upon [[Anusim]]). Despite his conversion to Islam, his works continued to be studied at the Jewish Baghdad Academy, a well-known academy, into the thirteenth century. He was a follower of Avicenna's teaching, who proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.\n\nHis writings include ''Kit\u0101b al-Mu\u02bftabar'' (\"The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection\"); a philosophical commentary on the Kohelet, written in Arabic using Hebrew aleph bet; and the treatise \"On the Reason Why the Stars Are Visible at Night and Hidden in Daytime.\" According to Hibat Allah, ''Kit\u0101b al-Mu\u02bftabar'' consists in the main of critical remarks jotted down by him over the years while reading philosophical text, and published at the insistence of his friends, in the form of a philosophical work.\n\n=== Nethan'el al-Fayyumi ===\n{{Location map many | Yemen\n|caption= Sana'a in Modern [[Yemen]]\n| label=[[Sana'a#History|Sana'a]], [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] [[Yemenite Jews|Yemen]]\n| position=right\n| lat=15.3691 | long= 44.185\n| width=100 | float=right\n}}\n[[Natan'el al-Fayyumi]]<ref>A history of Jewish philosophy in the Middle Ages By Colette Sirat</ref> of Yemen, was the twelfth-century author of ''Bustan al-Uqul'' (\"Garden of Intellects\"), a Jewish version of [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'i]] doctrines. Like the Ismailis, Natan'el al-Fayyumi argued that God sent different prophets to various nations of the world, containing legislations suited to the particular temperament of each individual nation.  Ismaili doctrine holds that a single universal religious truth lies at the root of the different religions. Some Jews accepted this model of religious pluralism, leading them to view [[Muhammad]] as a legitimate prophet, though not Jewish, sent to preach to the [[Arabs]], just as the Hebrew prophets had been sent to deliver their messages to Israel; others refused this notion in entirety.

When his family fled Spain, for Fez, Maimonides enrolled in the Academy of Fez and studied under Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan \u2014 a student of [[Isaac Alfasi]].  Maimonides strove to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy and science with the teachings of Torah.  In some ways his position was parallel to that of [[Averroes]]; in reaction to the attacks on Avicennian Aristotelism, Maimonides embraced and defended a stricter Aristotelism without Neoplatonic additions.  The principles which inspired all of Maimonides' philosophical activity was identical those of [[Abraham Ibn Daud]]: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human intellect in science and philosophy. Maimonides departed from the teachings of Aristotle by suggesting that the world is not eternal, as Aristotle taught, but was created ''[[ex nihilo]]''.  In \"Guide for the Perplexed\" (1:17 & 2:11)\" Maimonides explains that Israel lost its [[Tradition|Mesorah]] in exile, and with it \"we lost our science and philosophy \u2014 only to be rejuvenated in Al Andalus within the context of interaction and intellectual investigation of Jewish, Christian and Muslim texts.\n\n== Medieval Jewish philosophy after Maimonides ==\nMaimonides writings almost immediately came under attack from Karaites, Dominican Christians, Tosafists of Provence, [[Ashkenaz]] and [[Al Andalus]].  His genius was obvious, protests centered around his writings.  Scholars suggest that [[Maimonides]] instigated the [[Maimonidean Controversy]] when he verbally attacked ''Samuel ben Ali Ha-Levi al-Dastur'' (\"Gaon of Baghdad\") as \"one whom people accustom from his youth to believe that there is none like him in his generation,\" and he sharply attack the \"monetary demands\" of the academies.  ''al-Dastur''was an anti-Maimonidean operating in Babylon to undermine the works of [[Maimonides]] and those of Maimonides' patrons (the Al-Constantini Family from North Africa).  To illustrate the reach of the Maimonidean Controversy, ''al-Dastur'', the chief opponent of Maimonides in the East, was excommunicated by ''Daud Ibn Hodaya al Daudi'' (Exilarch of Mosul).  Maimonides' attacks on Ibn al-Dastur may not have been entirely altruistic given the position of Maimonides' in-laws in competing Yeshivas.\n\nIn Western Europe, the controversy was halted by the burning of Maimonides' works by Christian Dominicans, in 1232. [[Avraham son of Rambam]], continued fighting for his father's beliefs in the East; desecration of Maimonides' tomb, at [[Tiberias]] by Jews, was a profound shock to Jews throughout the Diaspora and caused all to pause and reflect upon what was being done to the fabric of Jewish Culture.  This compelled many Anti-Maimonideans to recant their assertions and realize what cooperation with Christians meant to them, their texts and their communities.\n\nMaimonidean controversy flared up again<ref>Stroumsa, S.

It is entitled ''Ma'amar bimehuyav ha-metsiut ve'eykhut sidur ha-devarim mimenu vehidush ha'olam'' (\"A Treatise as to (1) Necessary Existence (2) The Procedure of Things from the Necessary Existence and (3) The Creation of the World\").\n\n=== Jacob Anatoli ===\n[[Jacob Anatoli|Jacob ben Abba Mari ben Simson Anatoli]] is generally regarded as a pioneer in the application of the Maimonidean Rationalism to the study of Jewish texts.

Due to these family ties Anatoli was introduced to the philosophy of Maimonides, the study of which was such a great revelation to him that he, in later days, referred to it as the beginning of his intelligent and true comprehension of the Scriptures, while he frequently alluded to Ibn Tibbon as one of the two masters who had instructed and inspired him.  Anatoli wrote the ''Malmad'' exhibiting his broad knowledge of classic Jewish exegetes, as well as Plato, Aristotle, Averroes, and the Vulgate, as well as with a large number of Christian institutions, some of which he ventures to criticize, such as celibacy and monastic castigation, as well as certain heretics and he repeatedly appeals to his readers for a broader cultivation of the classic languages and the non-Jewish branches of learning.  To Anatoli all men are, in truth, formed in the image of God, though the Jews stand under a particular obligation to further the true cognition of God simply by reason of their election\u2014\"the Greeks had chosen wisdom as their pursuit; the Romans, power; and the Jews, religiousness\"\n\n=== Hillel ben Samuel ===\nFirstly, [[Hillel ben Samuel]]'s importance in the history of medieval Jewish philosophy lies in his attempt to deal, systematically, with the question of the immortality of the soul.  Secondly, Hillel played a major role in the controversies of 1289\u201390 concerning the philosophical works of Maimonides.  Thirdly, Hillel was the first devotee of Jewish learning and Philosophy in Italy, bringing a close to a period of relative ignorance of Hakira in Verona (Italy).  And finally, Hillel is one of the early Latin translators of \"the wise men of the nations\" (non-Jewish scholars).\n\nDefending Maimonides, Hillel addressed a letter to his friend Maestro Gaio asking him to use his influence with the Jews of Rome against Maimonides' opponents (Solomon Petit).  He also advanced the bold idea of gathering together Maimonides' defenders and opponents in Alexandria, in order to bring the controversy before a court of Babylonian rabbis, whose decision would be binding on both factions.  Hillel was certain the verdict would favor Maimonides.\n\nHillel wrote a commentary on the 25 propositions appearing at the beginning of the second part of the Guide of the Perplexed, and three philosophical treatises, which were appended to Tagmulei ha-Nefesh: the first on knowledge and free will; the second on the question of why mortality resulted from the sin of Adam; the third on whether or not the belief in the fallen angels is a true belief.\n\n=== Shemtob Ben Joseph Ibn Falaquera ===\n{{Location map many | France\n|caption= [[Narbonne#History|Narbonne]] in modern [[History of the Jews in France#Carolingian Period|France]]\n| label=[[Narbonne#History|Narbonne]]\n| position=top\n| lat=43.1836| long= 3.0042\n| width=100 | float=right\n}}\n[[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]] was a Spanish-born philosopher who pursued reconciliation between Jewish dogma and philosophy.

He was also a student of philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and especially of medicine, which he practiced for a number of years at Palma, in Majorca.  ''Magen Avot'' deals with concepts such as the nature of God, the eternity of the Torah, the coming of the Messiah, and the Resurrection of the dead.

Albo freely criticizes Maimonides' thirteen principles of belief and Crescas' six principles.  According to Albo, \"belief in the Messiah is only a 'twig' unnecessary to the soundness of the trunk\"; not essential to Judaism.  Nor is it true, according to Albo, that every law is binding.  Though every ordinance has the power of conferring happiness in its observance, it is not true that every law must be observed, or that through the neglect of a part of the law, a Jew would violate the divine covenant or be damned.  Contemporary Orthodox Jews, however, vehemently disagree with Albo's position believing that all Jews are divinely obligated to fulfill every applicable commandment.\n\n=== Hoter ben Solomon ===\n{{Location map many | Yemen\n|caption= Sana'a in modern [[Yemen]]\n| label=[[Sana'a#History|Sana'a]], [[Rasulid]] [[Yemenite Jews|Yemen]]\n| position=right\n| lat=15.3691 | long= 44.185\n| width=100 | float=right\n}}\n[[Hoter ben Shlomo]] was a scholar and philosopher in Yemen heavily influenced by Nethanel ben al-Fayyumi, Maimonides, Saadia Gaon and al-Ghazali.

Conversions outside Judaism, coerced or otherwise, had a strong impact upon young Isaac, later compelling him to forfeit his immense wealth in an attempt to redeem Iberian Jewry from coercion of the [[Alhambra Decree]].

His work ''Dialoghi d'amore'' (\"Dialogues of Love\"), written in Italian, was one of the most important philosophical works of his time. In an attempt to circumvent a plot, hatched by local Catholic Bishops to kidnap his son, Judah sent his son from Castile, to Portugal with a nurse, but by order of the king, the son was seized and baptized.  This was a devastating insult to Judah and his family, and was a source of bitterness throughout Judah's life and the topic of his writings years later; especially since this was not the first time the Abravanel Family was subjected to such embarrassment at the hands of the Catholic Church.\n\nJudah's ''Dialoghi'' is regarded as the finest of Humanistic Period works.  His neoplatonism is derived from the Hispanic Jewish community, especially the works of [[Ibn Gabirol]].  Platonic notions of reaching towards a nearly impossible ideal of beauty, wisdom, and perfection encompass the whole of his work.  In ''Dialoghi d'amore'', Judah defines love in philosophical terms.  He structures his three dialogues as a conversation between two abstract \"characters\": Philo, representing love or appetite, and Sophia, representing science or wisdom, Philo+Sophia (philosophia).\n\n=== Criticisms of Kabbalah ===\nThe word \"Kabbalah\" was used in medieval Jewish texts to mean \"tradition\", see [[Abraham Ibn Daud]]'s ''Sefer Ha-Qabbalah'' also known as the \"Book of our Tradition\".  \"Book of our Tradition\" does not refer to mysticism of any kind - it chronicles \"our tradition of scholarship and study\" in two Babylonian Academies, through the Geonim, into Talmudic Yeshivas of Spain.  In Talmudic times there was a mystic tradition in Judaism, known as ''Maaseh Bereshith'' (the work of creation) and ''Maaseh Merkavah'' (the work of the chariot); Maimonides interprets these texts as referring to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of Torah.\n\nIn the 13th century, however, a mystical-esoteric system emerged which became known as \"the [[Kabbalah]].\"  Many of the beliefs associated with Kabbalah had long been rejected by philosophers.  [[Saadia Gaon]] had taught in his book ''Emunot v'Deot'' that Jews who believe in [[gilgul]] have adopted a non-Jewish belief.  [[Maimonides]] rejected many texts of ''[[Heichalot]]'', particularly ''[[Shi'ur Qomah]]'' whose anthropomorphic vision of God he considered heretical.\n\nIn the 13th century, *Meir ben Simon of Narbonne wrote an epistle (included in ''Milhhemet Mitzvah'') against early Kabbalists, singled out ''[[Sefer Bahir]]'', rejecting the attribution of its authorship to the tanna R. Nehhunya ben ha-Kanah and describing some of its content as follow -\n\n::''\"... And we have heard that a book had already been written for them, which they call  Bahir, that is 'bright' but no light shines through it. This book has come into our hands and we have found that they falsely attribute it to Rabbi Nehunya ben Haqqanah. haShem forbid! There is no truth in this...

He was the father and teacher of a long line of rationalist philosophers and scholars.  Non-Jewish students of Delmedigo classified him as an \"Averroist\", however, he saw himself as a follower of Maimonides. Scholastic association of Maimonides and Ibn Rushd would have been a natural one; Maimonides, towards the end of his life, was impressed with the Ibn Rushd commentaries and recommended them to his students. The followers of Maimonides (Maimonideans) had therefore been, for several generations before Delmedigo, the leading users, translators and disseminators of the works of Ibn Rushd in Jewish circles, and advocates for Ibn Rushd even after Islamic rejection of his radical views.  Maimonideans regarded Maimonides and Ibn Rushd as following the same general line.  In his book, Delmedigo portrays himself as defender of Maimonidean Judaism, and \u2014 like many Maimonideans \u2014 he emphasized the rationality of Jewish tradition.\n{{Location map many | Greece\n|caption= Thessaloniki in modern [[Greece]]\n| label=[[History of the Jews of Thessaloniki|Salonika]], [[Ottoman Empire]]\n| position=bottom\n| lat=40.633| long= 22.95\n| width=100| float=left\n}}\n\n=== Moses Almosnino ===\n[[Moses Almosnino]] was born [[Thessaloniki]] 1515 - died Constantinople abt 1580.

The center-of-mass of Rationalism shifted to France, Italy, Germany, Crete, Sicily and Netherlands.  Expulsion from Spain and the coordinated pogroms of Europe resulted in the cross-pollination of variations on Rationalism incubated within diverse communities.  This period is also marked by the intellectual exchange among leaders of the Christian Reformation and Jewish scholars.  Of particular note is the line of Rationalists who migrated out of Germany, and present-day Italy into Crete, and other areas of the [[Ottoman Empire]] seeking safety and protection from the endless pogroms fomented by the [[House of Habsburg]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] against Jews.\n\nRationalism was incubating in places far from Spain. From stories told by Rabbi [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm]], German-speaking Jews, descendants of Jews who migrated back to Jerusalem after Charlemagne's invitation was revoked in Germany many centuries earlier, who lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century, were influenced by prevailing [[Mutazilite]] scholars of Jerusalem.

When the knights of the [[First Crusade]] came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members rescued German-speaking Jews in Palestine and brought them back to the safety of Worms, Germany, to repay the favor.<ref>\"Seder ha-Dorot\", p. 252, 1878 ed.</ref> Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of halakic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the eleventh century.<ref>Epstein, in \"Monatsschrift\", xlvii. 344; Jerusalem: Under the Arabs</ref>\n\nAll of the foregoing resulted in an explosion of new ideas and philosophic paths.\n\n=== Yosef Shlomo ben Eliyahu Dal Medigo ===\n[[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]] was  a physician and teacher \u2013 Baruch Spinoza was a student of his works.<ref>\"Bless\u00e9d Spinoza: a biography of the philosopher\", by Lewis Browne, The Macmillan Company, 1932, University of Wisconsin - Madison</ref>\n\n=== Baruch Spinoza ===\n[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Baruch Spinoza]]]]\n[[Baruch Spinoza]] founded [[Spinozism]], broke with [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic Jewish]] tradition, and was placed in ''[[Herem (censure)|herem]]'' by the [[Beit Din]] of [[Amsterdam]]. The influence in his work from [[Maimonides]] and [[Leone Ebreo]] is evident. [[Elia del Medigo]] claims to be a student of the works of Spinoza. Some contemporary critics (e.g., Wachter, ''Der Spinozismus im Judenthum'') claimed to detect the influence of the [[Kabbalah]], while others (e.g., [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]) regarded Spinozism as a revival of [[Averroism]] \u2013 a talmudist manner of referencing to Maimonidean Rationalism. In the centuries that have lapsed since the ''herem'' declaration, scholars{{Who|date=March 2014}} have re-examined the works of Spinoza and find them to reflect a body of work and thinking that is not unlike some contemporary streams of Judaism. For instance, while Spinoza was accused of [[pantheism]], scholars{{Who|date=March 2014}} have come to view his work as advocating [[panentheism]], a valid contemporary view easily accommodated by contemporary Judaism.\n\n=== Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi ===\nRabbi [[Tzvi Ashkenazi|Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi]] was a student of his father, but most notably also a student of his grandfather Rabbi [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm]].\n\n=== Jacob Emden ===\nRabbi [[Jacob Emden]] was a student of his father Rabbi [[Tzvi Ashkenazi|Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi]] a Rabbi in Amsterdam. Emden, a steadfast Talmudist, was a prominent opponent of the [[Sabbateans]] (Messianic Kabbalists who followed Sabbatai Tzvi).

He has been referred to as the father of Reform Judaism, though Reform spokesmen have been \"resistant to claim him as their spiritual father\".<ref>Wein (1997), p. 44. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=11f9xBbOBBEC&pg=PA44 Google books])</ref> Mendelssohn came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both [[German people|Germans]] and Jews.  His most significant book was ''[[Jerusalem (Mendelssohn)|Jerusalem oder \u00fcber religi\u00f6se Macht und Judentum]]'' (''Jerusalem''), first published in 1783.\n\nAlongside Mendelssohn, other important Jewish philosophers of the eighteenth century included:\n* [[Menachem Mendel Lefin]], anti-Hasidic [[Haskalah]] philosopher\n* [[Salomon Maimon]], Enlightenment philosopher\n* [[Isaac Satanow]], a [[Haskalah]] philosopher\n* [[Naphtali Ullman]], [[Haskalah]] philosopher<ref>Shmuel Feiner, ''The Jewish Enlightenment'' 72-3</ref>\n\nImportant Jewish philosophers of the nineteenth century included:\n* [[Elijah Benamozegh]], a [[Sephardic]] rabbi and philosopher\n* [[Hermann Cohen]], a [[neo-Kantian]] Jewish philosopher\n* [[Moses Hess]], a secular Jewish philosopher and one of the founders of [[socialism]]\n* [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], leader of the [[Torah im Derech Eretz]] school of 19th century neo-Orthodoxy\n* [[Samuel Hirsch]], a leader of [[Reform Judaism]]\n* [[Nachman Krochmal]], [[Haskalah]] philosopher in [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]]\n* [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] a [[Sephardic]] rabbi and philosopher\n* [[Karl Marx]], German [[economist]] and Jewish philosopher.\n\n=== Traditionalist attitudes towards philosophy ===\n{{main|Haredi Judaism|Hasidic philosophy}}\n[[Haredi]] traditionalists who emerged in reaction to the [[Haskalah]] considered the fusion of religion and philosophy as difficult because classical philosophers start with no preconditions for which conclusions they must reach in their investigation, while classical religious believers have a set of religious principles of faith that they hold one must believe.  Most Haredim contended that one cannot simultaneously be a philosopher and a true adherent of a revealed religion.  In this view, all attempts at synthesis ultimately fail.  Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]], for example, viewed all philosophy as untrue and heretical.  In this he represents one strand of [[Hasidic]] thought, with creative emphasis on the emotions.\n\nOther exponents of [[Hasidic philosophy|Hasidism]] had a more positive attitude towards philosophy.  In the [[Chabad]] writings of [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], Hasidut is seen as able to unite all parts of Torah thought, from the schools of philosophy to mysticism, by uncovering the illuminating Divine essence that permeates and transcends all approaches.  Interpreting the verse from [[Book of Job|Job]], \"from my flesh I see [[HaShem]]\", Shneur Zalman explained the inner meaning, or \"soul\", of the Jewish mystical tradition in intellectual form, by means of analogies drawn from the human realm.  As explained and continued by the later leaders of Chabad, this enabled the human mind to grasp concepts of Godliness, and so enable the heart to feel the love and awe of God, emphasised by all the founders of hasidism, in an internal way.  This development, the culminating level of the Jewish mystical tradition, in this way bridges philosophy and mysticism, by expressing the transcendent in human terms.\n\n== 20th and 21st-century Jewish philosophy ==\n[[File:Martin Buber portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]]]\n\n=== Jewish existentialism ===\n{{main|Jewish existentialism}}\nOne of the major trends in modern Jewish philosophy was the attempt to develop a theory of Judaism through [[existentialism]].  Among the early Jewish existentialist philosophers was [[Lev Shestov]] (Jehuda Leib Schwarzmann), a Russian-Jewish philosopher.  One of the most influential Jewish existentialists in the first half of the 20th century was [[Franz Rosenzweig]].  While researching his doctoral dissertation on the 19th-century German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], Rosenzweig reacted against Hegel's idealism and developed an existential approach.  Rosenzweig, for a time, considered conversion to Christianity, but in 1913, he turned to Jewish philosophy. He became a philosopher and student of [[Hermann Cohen]].  Rozensweig's major work, ''Star of Redemption'', is his new philosophy in which he portrays the relationships between haShem, humanity and world as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. Orthodox rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and Conservative rabbis [[Neil Gillman]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and [[Elliot N. Dorff]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} have also been described as existentialists.\n\nThe [[France|French]] philosopher and [[Talmudic]] commentator [[Emmanuel Levinas]], whose approach grew out of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition in philosophy, has also been described as a Jewish existentialist.<ref>Benjamin A.

[[Dor Daim]], and [[Dor Daim#Talmide ha-Rambam|Rambamists]] are two groups who reject mysticism as a \"superstitious innovation\" to an otherwise clear and succinct set of Laws and rules.  According to these rationalists, there is shame and disgrace attached to failure to investigate matters of religious principle using the fullest powers of human reason and intellect.  One cannot be considered wise, or perceptive, if one does not attempt to understand the origins, and establish the correctness, of one's beliefs.\n\n=== Holocaust theology ===\n{{main|Holocaust theology}}\nJudaism has traditionally taught that God is [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omniscience|omniscient]] and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]]. Yet, these claims are in jarring contrast with the fact that there is much [[evil]] in the world. Perhaps the most difficult question that monotheists have confronted is \"how can one reconcile the existence of this view of God with the existence of evil?\" or \"how can there be good without bad?\"  \"how can there be a God without a devil?\" This is [[the problem of evil]].  Within all monotheistic faiths many answers ([[theodicy|theodicies]]) have been proposed.  However, in light of the magnitude of evil seen in the [[Holocaust]], many people have re-examined classical views on this subject. How can people still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust?  This set of Jewish philosophies is discussed in the article on [[Holocaust theology]].\n\n=== Reconstructionist theology ===\n{{main|Reconstructionist Judaism}}\nPerhaps the most controversial form of Jewish philosophy that developed in the early 20th century was the religious naturalism of Rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]].  His theology was a variant of [[John Dewey]]'s [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophy.  Dewey's naturalism combined atheist beliefs with religious terminology in order to construct a philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional Judaism.  In agreement with the classical medieval Jewish thinkers, Kaplan affirmed that haShem is not personal, and that all anthropomorphic descriptions of haShem are, at best, imperfect metaphors.  Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that haShem is the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled.  Kaplan wrote that \"to believe in haShem means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society.\"\n\n=== Process theology ===\nA recent trend has been to reframe Jewish theology through the lens of [[process philosophy]], more specifically [[process theology]]. Process philosophy suggests that fundamental elements of the universe are occasions of experience.  According to this notion, what people commonly think of as concrete objects are actually successions of these occasions of experience. Occasions of experience can be collected into groupings; something complex such as a human being is thus a grouping of many smaller occasions of experience. In this view, everything in the universe is characterized by experience (not to be confused with consciousness); there is no mind-body duality under this system, because \"mind\" is simply seen as a very developed kind of experiencing entity.\n\nIntrinsic to this worldview is the notion that all experiences are influenced by prior experiences, and will influence all future experiences.  This process of influencing is never deterministic; an occasion of experience consists of a process of comprehending other experiences, and then reacting to it.  This is the \"process\" in \"process philosophy\". Process philosophy gives God a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them; thus process philosophy is a form of [[panentheism]].\n\nThe original ideas of process theology were developed by [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897\u20132000), and influenced a number of [[Judaism|Jewish]] theologians, including [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher Samuel Alexander (1859\u20131938), and [[Rabbis]] [[Max Kadushin]], Milton Steinberg and Levi A. Olan, Harry Slominsky, and [[Bradley Shavit Artson]].  [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] has also been linked to this tradition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Donald J.|title=The Human and the Holy: The Spirituality of Abraham Joshua Heschel|year=1989|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0823212361|pages=82\u201383|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdfdS5YwOHoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n=== Kabbalah and philosophy ===\nKabbalah continued to be central to [[Haredi Orthodox Judaism]], which generally rejected philosophy, although the [[Chabad]] strain of [[Chasidism]] showed a more positive attitude towards philosophy. Meanwhile, non-Orthodox Jewish thought in the latter 20th century saw resurgent interest in [[Kabbalah]]. In academic studies, [[Gershom Scholem]] began the critical investigation of Jewish mysticism, while in non-Orthodox [[Jewish denominations]], [[Jewish Renewal]] and [[Neo-Hasidism]], spiritualised worship. Many philosophers do not consider this a form of philosophy, as Kabbalah is a collection of esoteric methods of textual interpretation. Mysticism is generally understood as an alternative to philosophy, not a variant of philosophy.\n\nAmong modern the modern critics of Kabbalah was [[Yihhyah Qafahh]], who wrote a book entitled ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem]]'', (''Wars of the Name'') against what he perceived as the false teachings of the Zohar and the false Kabbalah of Isaac Luria. He is credited with spearheading the [[Dor Daim]]. [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] publicly shared the views expressed in Rabbi [[Yihhyah Qafahh]]'s book ''Milhhamoth ha-Shem'' and elaborated upon these views in his many writings.\n\n=== Contemporary Jewish philosophy ===\n\n==== Philosophers associated with Orthodox Judaism ====\n{{main|Orthodox Jewish philosophy}}\n* [[Eliezer Berkovits]]\n* [[Monsieur Chouchani]]\n* [[Eliyahu Dessler]]\n* [[Israel Eldad]]\n* [[Elimelech of Lizhensk]]\n* [[David Hartman (rabbi)|David Hartman]]\n* [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]]\n* [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]\n* [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]]\n* [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk]]\n* [[Nachman of Breslov]]\n* [[Franz Rosenzweig]]\n* [[Tamar Ross]]\n* [[Daniel Rynhold]]\n* [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]]\n* [[Joseph Soloveitchik]]\n* [[Michael Wyschogrod]]\n* [[Chaim Volozhin]]\n* [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]]\n\n==== Philosophers associated with Conservative Judaism ====\n<!-- [[File:SelmaHeschelMarch.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] marching with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]]] -->\n{{main|Conservative Judaism}}\n* [[Bradley Shavit Artson]]\n* [[Elliot N.

These include:\n* [[Theodor W. Adorno]]\n* [[Joseph Agassi]], an Israeli philosopher of science who developed [[Karl Popper]]'s ideas<ref>As early as 1934 [[Karl Popper]] wrote of the search for truth as \"one of the strongest motives for scientific discovery.\" Still, he describes in ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972) early concerns about the much-criticized notion of truth as correspondence. Then came the semantic theory of truth formulated by the logician Alfred Tarski and published in 1933. Popper writes of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski's theory, to his intense joy. The theory met critical objections to truth as correspondence and thereby rehabilitated it. The theory also seemed, in Popper's eyes, to support metaphysical realism and the regulative idea of a search for truth. Popper coined the term critical rationalism to describe his philosophy.

With their acceptance into modern society, Jews with secular educations embraced or developed entirely new philosophies to meet the demands of the world in which they now found themselves.\n\nMedieval re-discovery of [[ancient Greek philosophy]] among the [[Geonim]] of 10th century Babylonian academies brought rationalist philosophy into [[Tanakh|Biblical]]-[[Talmud]]ic Judaism. The philosophy was generally in competition with [[Kabbalah]]. Both schools would become part of classic [[Rabbinic literature]], though the decline of scholastic [[rationalism]] coincided with historical events which drew Jews to the Kabbalistic approach. For [[Ashkenazi Jews]], emancipation and encounter with secular thought from the 18th century onwards altered how philosophy was viewed. [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] communities had later more ambivalent interaction with secular culture than in Western Europe. In the varied responses to modernity, Jewish philosophical ideas were developed across the range of emerging [[Jewish religious movements|religious movements]]. These developments could be seen as either continuations of or breaks from the canon of [[Rabbinic]] philosophy of the Middle Ages, as well as the other historical [[dialectic]] aspects of Jewish thought, and resulted in diverse contemporary Jewish attitudes to philosophical methods.\n\n== Ancient Jewish philosophy ==\n\n=== Philosophy in the Bible ===\n{{seealso|Solomon}}\n[[Rabbinic literature]] sometimes views Abraham as a [[philosopher]]. Some have suggested that [[Abraham]] introduced a philosophy learned from [[Melchizedek]];<ref>\"The Melchizedek Tradition: A Critical Examination of the Sources to the Fifth Century ad and in the Epistle to the Hebrews\", by Fred L.

[[Psalms]] contains invitations to admire the wisdom of God through his works; from this, some scholars suggest, Judaism harbors a Philosophical under-current.<ref>\"Medieval Philosophy and the Classical Tradition: In Islam, Judaism and Christianity\" by John Inglis, Page 3</ref> [[Ecclesiastes]] is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; its author seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world and life's meaning.<ref>\"Introduction to Philosophy\" by Dr Tom Kerns</ref>\n\n=== Philo of Alexandria ===\n[[File:PhiloThevet.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Philo]]]]\n[[Philo]] attempted to fuse and harmonize Greek and Jewish philosophy through allegory, which he learned from Jewish exegesis and [[Stoicism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=281&letter=P |title=Philo Jud\u00e6us |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> Philo attempted to make his philosophy the means of defending and justifying Jewish religious ''truths''. These ''truths'' he regarded as fixed and determinate, and philosophy was used as an aid to ''truth'', and a means of arriving at it. To this end Philo chose from philosophical tenets of Greeks, refusing those that did not harmonize with Judaism such as Aristotle's doctrine of the ''eternity and indestructibility of the world''.\n\nDr. [[Bernard Revel]], in dissertation on Karaite [[halakha]], points to writings of a 10th-century [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]], [[Jacob Qirqisani]], who quotes Philo, illustrating how Karaites made use of Philo's works in development of Karaite Judaism. Philo's works became important to Medieval Christian scholars who leveraged the work of Karaites to lend credence to their claims that \"these are the beliefs of Jews\" - a technically correct, yet deceptive, attribution.\n\n== Jewish scholarship after destruction of Second Temple ==\nWith the Roman destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, [[Second Temple Judaism]] was in disarray,<ref>\"Christianity, Judaism and other Greco-Roman cults: studies for Morton Smith at sixty\", Volume 12, Part 1, Pg 110, Volume 12 of Studies in Judaism in late antiquity, by Jacob Neusner ann  Morton Smith, Brill 1975, {{ISBN|90-04-04215-6}}</ref> but Jewish traditions were preserved especially thanks to the shrewd maneuvers of [[Johanan ben Zakai]], who saved the [[Sanhedrin]] and moved it to [[Yavne]]. Philosophical speculation was not a central part of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], although some have seen the [[Mishnah]] as a philosophical work.<ref>Jacob Neusner, ''Judaism as Philosophy''</ref> [[Rabbi Akiva]] has also been viewed as a philosophical figure:<ref>\"Beginnings in Jewish Philosophy\", By Meyer Levin, Pg 49, Behrman House 1971, {{ISBN|0-87441-063-0}}</ref> his statements include 1.) ''\"How favored is man, for he was created after an image \"for in an image, Elokim made man\" ''(Gen. ix. 6)''\"'', 2.) ''\"Everything is foreseen; but freedom ''[of will]'' is given to every man\"'', 3.) ''\"The world is governed by mercy... but the divine decision is made by the preponderance of the good or bad in one's actions\"''.\n\nAfter the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], Rabbinic scholars gathered in [[Tiberias]] and [[Safed]] to re-assemble and re-assess Judaism, its laws, theology, liturgy, beliefs and leadership structure. In 219 CE, the [[Sura Academy]] (from which [[Jewish Kalam]] emerged many centuries later) was founded by [[Abba Arika]]. For the next five centuries, Talmudic academies focused upon reconstituting Judaism and little, if any, philosophic investigation was pursued.\n\n=== Who influences whom? ===\n{{further|Early Islamic philosophy}}\nRabbinic Judaism had limited philosophical activity until it was challenged by [[Islam]], Karaite Judaism, and [[Christianity]]\u2014with Tanach, Mishnah, and Talmud, there was no need for a philosophic framework.  From an economic viewpoint, [[Radhanite]] trade dominance was being usurped by coordinated Christian and Islamic forced-conversions, and torture, compelling Jewish scholars to understand nascent economic threats.  These investigations triggered new ideas and intellectual exchange among Jewish and Islamic scholars in the areas of jurisprudence, mathematics, astronomy, logic and philosophy.  Jewish scholars influenced Islamic scholars and Islamic scholars influenced Jewish scholars.  Contemporary scholars continue to debate who was Muslim and who was Jew\u2014some \"Islamic scholars\" were \"Jewish scholars\" prior to forced conversion to Islam, some Jewish scholars willingly converted to Islam, such as [[Abdullah ibn Salam]], while others later reverted to Judaism, and still others, born and raised as Jews, were ambiguous in their religious beliefs such as [[ibn al-Rawandi]], although they lived according to the customs of their neighbors.\n\nAround 700 CE, \u02bfAmr ibn \u02bfUbayd Abu \u02bfUthman al-Basri introduces two streams of thought that influence Jewish, Islamic and Christian scholars:\n#[[Qadariyah]]\n# [[Bahshamiyya]] [[Mu\u02bftazila]]\n\nThe story of the Bahshamiyya Mu\u02bftazila and Qadariyah is as important, if not more so, as the intellectual symbiosis of Judaism and Islam in Islamic Spain.\n\nAround 733 CE, [[Mar]] Natronai ben Habibai moves to [[Kairouan]], then to Spain, transcribing the [[Talmud]] ''Bavli'' for the Academy at Kairouan from memory\u2014later taking a copy with him to Spain.<ref>\"Geonica\", By Ginzberg Louis, Pg. 18, {{ISBN|1-110-35511-4}}</ref>\n\n==== Karaism ====\n{{main|Karaite Judaism}}\nBorrowing from the [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800\u20131400)|Mutakallamin]] of [[Basra]], the Karaites were the first Jewish group to subject Judaism to Mu\u02bftazila. Rejecting the Talmud and Rabbinical tradition, Karaites took liberty to reinterpret the [[Tanakh]]. This meant abandoning foundational Jewish belief structures. Some scholars suggest that the major impetus for the formation of Karaism was a reaction to the rapid rise of Shi'i Islam, which recognized Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith but claimed that it detracted from monotheism by deferring to Rabbinic authority. Karaites absorbed certain aspects of Jewish sects such as the followers of [[Abu Isa]] (Shi'ism), [[Maliki]] (Sunnis) and Yudghanites (Sufis), who were influenced by East-Islamic scholarship yet deferred to the [[Ash'ari]] when contemplating the sciences.\n\n==== Philosophic synthesis begins ====\n{{further|Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800\u20131400)}}\n{{Location map many | Iraq\n| caption=[[Asuristan]] (shown: modern [[Iraq]]), also called [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Babylonia]]: Centers of Ancient Jewish scholarship\n| label=[[Pumbedita]]\n| position=left\n| lat=33.419  | long= 43.312\n| label2=[[Sura (city)|Sura]]\n| pos2=left\n| lat2=31.883  | long2= 44.45\n| label3=[[Baghdad]]\n| pos3=right\n| lat3=33.325  | long3= 44.422\n| label4=[[Basra]]\n| pos4=left\n| lat4=30.5  | long4= 47.816\n| width=150 | float=right\n}}\nThe spread of Islam throughout the Middle East and North Africa rendered Muslim all that was once Jewish.  Greek philosophy, science, medicine and mathematics was absorbed by Jewish scholars living in the Arab world due to Arabic translations of those texts; remnants of the [[Library of Alexandria]].  Early Jewish converts to Islam brought with them stories from their heritage, known as ''[[Isra'iliyyat]]'', which told of the ''Banu Isra'il'', the pious men of ancient Israel.  One of the most famous early mystics of [[Sufism]], [[Hasan of Basra]], introduced numerous ''Isra'iliyyat'' legends into Islamic scholarship, stories that went on to become representative of Islamic mystical ideas of piety of Sufism.\n\n[[Hai Gaon]] of [[Pumbedita Academy]] begins a new phase in Jewish scholarship and investigation (''hakirah''); Hai Gaon augments Talmudic scholarship with non-Jewish studies.  Hai Gaon was a savant with an exact knowledge of the theological movements of his time so much so that [[Moses ibn Ezra]] called him a [[kalam|mutakallim]].  Hai was competent to argue with followers of Qadariyyah and Mutazilites, sometimes adopting their polemic methods.  Through correspondence with Talmudic Academies at Kairouan, Cordoba and Lucena, Hai Gaon passes along his discoveries to Talmudic scholars therein.\n\nThe teachings of the [[Brethren of Purity]] were carried to the West by a Spanish Arab of Madrid, Muhammad Abu'l-Qasim al-Majnti al-Andalusi, who died in AD 1004\u20131005. Thanks to [[Averroes]], Spain became a center of philosophical learning as is reflected by the explosion of philosophical inquiry among Jews, Muslims and Christians.<ref>\"A literary History of Persia\" Book IV, Chapter X.

Hiwi is generally considered to be the very first \"Jewish\" philosopher to subject the Pentateuch to critical analysis.<ref>Fleischer, Ezra. \"A Fragment from Hivi Al-Balkhi's Criticism of the Bible.\" Tarbiz 51, no. 1 (1981): 49-57.</ref>  Hiwi is viewed by some scholars as an intellectually conflicted man torn between Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Gnostic Christianity, and Manichaean thought.<ref>\"The Messiah in Isaiah 53: The Commentaries of Sa'adya Gaon, Salmon Ben Yeruham, and Yefet Ben Eli 52:13-53:12\", Trade paperback (1998)   by Sa'adia, Joseph Alobaidi</ref><ref>Rosenthal, J. \"Hiwi Al-Balkhi: A Comparative Study.\" Jewish Quarterly Review 38; 39 (1947-48; 1948-49): 317-42, 419-30; 79-94.</ref>\n\nHiwi espoused the belief that miraculous acts, described in the Pentateuch, are simply examples of people using their skills of reasoning to undertake, and perform, seemingly miraculous acts.<ref>Gil, Moshe. Hivi Ha-Balkhi Ha-Kofer Me-Horasan, Ketavim. Merhaviah: Sifriyyat Po'alim, 1965</ref>  As examples of this position, he argued that the parting of the Red Sea was a natural phenomenon, and that Moses' claim to greatness lay merely in his ability to calculate the right moment for the crossing.  He also emphasized that the Egyptian magicians were able to reproduce several of Moses' \"miracles,\" proving that they could not have been so unique.  According to scholars, Hiwi's gravest mistake was having the Pentateuch redacted to reflect his own views - then had those redacted texts, which became popular,  distributed to children.<ref>Davidson, Israel, ed.

In this context, however, we can also regard Hiwi, while flawed, as the very first critical biblical commentator; zealous rationalistic views of Hiwi parallel those of [[Ibn al-Rawandi]].\n\nSa\u02bfadya Gaon dedicated an entire treatise, written in rhyming Hebrew, to a refutation of \u1e24\u012bw\u012b's arguments, two fragments of which, preserved in the Cairo Geniza, have been published (Davidson, 1915; Schirmann, 1965).<ref>{{cite web|author=Marzena Zawanowska|title=\" \u1e24\u012bw\u012b al-Balkh\u012b.\" Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World.

Sa'adya Gaon denounced Hiwi as an extreme rationalist, a \"Mulhidun\", or atheist/deviator.  Abraham Ibn Daud described HIwi as a sectarian who \"denied the Torah, yet used it to formulate a new Torah of his liking\".<ref>Malter, Henry. Sa'adya Gaon: His Life and Works, Morris Loeb Series. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1921.</ref>\n\n=== Sa'adya Gaon ===\n[[Saadia Gaon]], son of a [[proselyte]], is considered the greatest early Jewish philosopher. During his early years in [[Tulunids|Tulunid]] Egypt, the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] ruled Egypt; the leaders of the [[Tulunids]] were Ismaili Imams.  Their influence upon the Jewish academies of Egypt resonate in the works of Sa'adya.  Sa'adya's ''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth]]'' (\"Beliefs and Opinions\") was originally called ''Kitab al-Amanat wal-l'tikadat'' (\"Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma\"); it was the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the dogmas of Judaism, completed at Sura Academy in 933 CE.\n\nLittle known is that Saadia traveled to [[Tiberias]] in 915CE to study with Ab\u016b 'l-Kath\u012br Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn Zakariyy\u0101\u02be al-Katib al-Tabari (Tiberias), a Jewish theologian and Bible translator from Tiberias whose main claim to fame is the fact that Saadia Gaon studied with him at some point. He is not mentioned in any Jewish source, and apart from the Andalusian heresiographer and polemicist [[Ibn Hazm]], who mentions him as a Jewish mutakallim (rational theologian), our main source of information is the ''Kit\u0101b al-Tanb\u012bh'' by the Muslim historian [[Al-Masudi|al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b]] (d. 956). In his brief survey of Arabic translations of the Bible, al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b states that the Israelites rely for exegesis and translation of the Hebrew books\u2014i.e., the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, twenty-four books in all, he says\u2014on a number of Israelites whom they praise highly, almost all of whom he has met in person. He mentions Ab\u016b \u02bel-Kath\u012br as one of them, and also Saadia (\"Sa\u02bf\u012bd ibn Ya\u02bfq\u016bb al-Fayy\u016bm\u012b\").  Regardless of what we do not know, Saadia traveled to Tiberias (home of the learned scribes and exegetes) to learn and he chose Ab\u016b 'l-Kath\u012br Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn Zakariyy\u0101\u02be al-Katib al-Tabariya. The extent of Ab\u016b \u02bel-Kath\u012br's influence on Saadia's thought cannot be established, however.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Camilla Adang]]|title=\" Ab\u016b 'l-Kath\u012br Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn Zakariyy\u0101\u02be.\" Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World.

For lack of further information, some scholars have tried to identify Ab\u016b \u02bel-Kath\u012br with the Hebrew grammarian Ab\u016b \u02bfAl\u012b Judah ben \u02bfAll\u0101n, likewise of Tiberias, who seems to have been a Karaite Jew. However, al-Mas\u016bd\u012b unequivocally describes Abu \u02bel-Kath\u012br (as well as his student Saadia) as an ashma\u02bfth\u012b (Rabbanite).\n\nIn \"Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma\" Saadia declares the rationality of the Jewish religion with the caveat that reason must capitulate wherever it contradicts tradition. Dogma takes precedence over reason. Saadia closely followed the rules of the [[Kalam|Mu\u02bftazila]] school of Abu Ali al-Jubba'i in composing his works.<ref>s.v. al-Djubba'i, {{Cite book | edition = New | publisher = E. J.

Sl-Mukkamas was first to introduce the ''methods'' of [[Kalam]] into Judaism and the first Jew to mention Aristotle in his writings.  He was a [[proselyte]] of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] (not [[Karaite Judaism]], as some argue); al-Mukkamas was a student of physician, and renowned Christian philosopher, Hana.  His close interaction with Hana, and his familial affiliation with Islam gave al-Mukkamas a unique view of religious belief and theology.\n\nIn 1898 [[Abraham Harkavy]] discovered, in Imperial Library of St. Petersburg, fifteen of the twenty chapters of David's philosophical work entitled ''Ishrun Ma\u1e33alat'' (Twenty Chapters) of which 15 survive.  One of the oldest surviving witnesses to early Kal\u0101m, it begins with epistemological investigations, turns to proofs of the creation of the world and the subsequent existence of a Creator, discusses the unity of the Creator (including the divine attributes), and concludes with theodicy (humanity and revelation) and a refutation of other religions (mostly lost).\n\nIn 915 CE, Sa'adya Gaon left for Palestine, where, according to al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b (Tanb\u012bh, 113), he perfected his education at the feet of Ab\u016b 'l-Kath\u012br Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn Zakariyy\u0101\u02be al-Katib al-Tabari (d. 320/932).

Some suggest it was a reaction to a social slight inflicted upon him because he was a Jew, while others suggest he was forcibly converted at the edge of a sword (which prompted Maimonides to comment upon [[Anusim]]). Despite his conversion to Islam, his works continued to be studied at the Jewish Baghdad Academy, a well-known academy, into the thirteenth century. He was a follower of Avicenna's teaching, who proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.\n\nHis writings include ''Kit\u0101b al-Mu\u02bftabar'' (\"The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection\"); a philosophical commentary on the Kohelet, written in Arabic using Hebrew aleph bet; and the treatise \"On the Reason Why the Stars Are Visible at Night and Hidden in Daytime.\" According to Hibat Allah, ''Kit\u0101b al-Mu\u02bftabar'' consists in the main of critical remarks jotted down by him over the years while reading philosophical text, and published at the insistence of his friends, in the form of a philosophical work.\n\n=== Nethan'el al-Fayyumi ===\n{{Location map many | Yemen\n|caption= Sana'a in Modern [[Yemen]]\n| label=[[Sana'a#History|Sana'a]], [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] [[Yemenite Jews|Yemen]]\n| position=right\n| lat=15.3691 | long= 44.185\n| width=100 | float=right\n}}\n[[Natan'el al-Fayyumi]]<ref>A history of Jewish philosophy in the Middle Ages By Colette Sirat</ref> of Yemen, was the twelfth-century author of ''Bustan al-Uqul'' (\"Garden of Intellects\"), a Jewish version of [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'i]] doctrines. Like the Ismailis, Natan'el al-Fayyumi argued that God sent different prophets to various nations of the world, containing legislations suited to the particular temperament of each individual nation.  Ismaili doctrine holds that a single universal religious truth lies at the root of the different religions. Some Jews accepted this model of religious pluralism, leading them to view [[Muhammad]] as a legitimate prophet, though not Jewish, sent to preach to the [[Arabs]], just as the Hebrew prophets had been sent to deliver their messages to Israel; others refused this notion in entirety. Natan'el's son Yaqub turned to Maimonides, asking urgently for counsel on how to deal with forced conversions to Islam and religious persecutions at the hand of [[Saladin]].

When his family fled Spain, for Fez, Maimonides enrolled in the Academy of Fez and studied under Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan \u2014 a student of [[Isaac Alfasi]].  Maimonides strove to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy and science with the teachings of Torah.  In some ways his position was parallel to that of [[Averroes]]; in reaction to the attacks on Avicennian Aristotelism, Maimonides embraced and defended a stricter Aristotelism without Neoplatonic additions.  The principles which inspired all of Maimonides' philosophical activity was identical those of [[Abraham Ibn Daud]]: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human intellect in science and philosophy. Maimonides departed from the teachings of Aristotle by suggesting that the world is not eternal, as Aristotle taught, but was created ''[[ex nihilo]]''.  In \"Guide for the Perplexed\" (1:17 & 2:11)\" Maimonides explains that Israel lost its [[Tradition|Mesorah]] in exile, and with it \"we lost our science and philosophy \u2014 only to be rejuvenated in Al Andalus within the context of interaction and intellectual investigation of Jewish, Christian and Muslim texts.\n\n== Medieval Jewish philosophy after Maimonides ==\nMaimonides writings almost immediately came under attack from Karaites, Dominican Christians, Tosafists of Provence, [[Ashkenaz]] and [[Al Andalus]].  His genius was obvious, protests centered around his writings.  Scholars suggest that [[Maimonides]] instigated the [[Maimonidean Controversy]] when he verbally attacked ''Samuel ben Ali Ha-Levi al-Dastur'' (\"Gaon of Baghdad\") as \"one whom people accustom from his youth to believe that there is none like him in his generation,\" and he sharply attack the \"monetary demands\" of the academies.  ''al-Dastur''was an anti-Maimonidean operating in Babylon to undermine the works of [[Maimonides]] and those of Maimonides' patrons (the Al-Constantini Family from North Africa).  To illustrate the reach of the Maimonidean Controversy, ''al-Dastur'', the chief opponent of Maimonides in the East, was excommunicated by ''Daud Ibn Hodaya al Daudi'' (Exilarch of Mosul).  Maimonides' attacks on Ibn al-Dastur may not have been entirely altruistic given the position of Maimonides' in-laws in competing Yeshivas.\n\nIn Western Europe, the controversy was halted by the burning of Maimonides' works by Christian Dominicans, in 1232. [[Avraham son of Rambam]], continued fighting for his father's beliefs in the East; desecration of Maimonides' tomb, at [[Tiberias]] by Jews, was a profound shock to Jews throughout the Diaspora and caused all to pause and reflect upon what was being done to the fabric of Jewish Culture.  This compelled many Anti-Maimonideans to recant their assertions and realize what cooperation with Christians meant to them, their texts and their communities.\n\nMaimonidean controversy flared up again<ref>Stroumsa, S. (1993) 'On the Maimonidean Controversy in the East: the Role of Abu 'l-Barakat al-Baghdadi', in H. Ben-Shammai (ed.) Hebrew and Arabic Studies in Honour of Joshua Blau, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

At the center of many of these debates are 1) \"Guide for the Perplexed\", 2) \"13 Principles of Faith\", 3) \"Mishnah Torah\", and 4) his commentary on [[Anusim]].\n\n[[File:Ceuta (neutral).PNG|thumb|120px|left|[[Ceuta|Ceuta, North African Spain]]]]\n\n=== Yosef ben Yehuda of Ceuta ===\n{{Location map many | Syria\n|caption= [[Aleppo]] in modern [[Syria]]\n| label=[[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] [[History of the Jews in Syria#Aleppo|Aleppo]]\n| position=right\n| lat=36.2166 | long= 37.166\n| width=100 | float=right\n}}[[Joseph ben Judah of Ceuta]] was the son of Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan and a student of Maimonides for whom the ''Guide for the Perplexed'' is written.

Philosophically, Yosef's dissertation, in Arabic, on the problem of \"Creation\" is suspected to have been written before contact with Maimonides. It is entitled ''Ma'amar bimehuyav ha-metsiut ve'eykhut sidur ha-devarim mimenu vehidush ha'olam'' (\"A Treatise as to (1) Necessary Existence (2) The Procedure of Things from the Necessary Existence and (3) The Creation of the World\").\n\n=== Jacob Anatoli ===\n[[Jacob Anatoli|Jacob ben Abba Mari ben Simson Anatoli]] is generally regarded as a pioneer in the application of the Maimonidean Rationalism to the study of Jewish texts.   He was the son-in-law of [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]], translator of Maimonides.  Due to these family ties Anatoli was introduced to the philosophy of Maimonides, the study of which was such a great revelation to him that he, in later days, referred to it as the beginning of his intelligent and true comprehension of the Scriptures, while he frequently alluded to Ibn Tibbon as one of the two masters who had instructed and inspired him.  Anatoli wrote the ''Malmad'' exhibiting his broad knowledge of classic Jewish exegetes, as well as Plato, Aristotle, Averroes, and the Vulgate, as well as with a large number of Christian institutions, some of which he ventures to criticize, such as celibacy and monastic castigation, as well as certain heretics and he repeatedly appeals to his readers for a broader cultivation of the classic languages and the non-Jewish branches of learning.  To Anatoli all men are, in truth, formed in the image of God, though the Jews stand under a particular obligation to further the true cognition of God simply by reason of their election\u2014\"the Greeks had chosen wisdom as their pursuit; the Romans, power; and the Jews, religiousness\"\n\n=== Hillel ben Samuel ===\nFirstly, [[Hillel ben Samuel]]'s importance in the history of medieval Jewish philosophy lies in his attempt to deal, systematically, with the question of the immortality of the soul.  Secondly, Hillel played a major role in the controversies of 1289\u201390 concerning the philosophical works of Maimonides.  Thirdly, Hillel was the first devotee of Jewish learning and Philosophy in Italy, bringing a close to a period of relative ignorance of Hakira in Verona (Italy).  And finally, Hillel is one of the early Latin translators of \"the wise men of the nations\" (non-Jewish scholars).\n\nDefending Maimonides, Hillel addressed a letter to his friend Maestro Gaio asking him to use his influence with the Jews of Rome against Maimonides' opponents (Solomon Petit).  He also advanced the bold idea of gathering together Maimonides' defenders and opponents in Alexandria, in order to bring the controversy before a court of Babylonian rabbis, whose decision would be binding on both factions.  Hillel was certain the verdict would favor Maimonides.\n\nHillel wrote a commentary on the 25 propositions appearing at the beginning of the second part of the Guide of the Perplexed, and three philosophical treatises, which were appended to Tagmulei ha-Nefesh: the first on knowledge and free will; the second on the question of why mortality resulted from the sin of Adam; the third on whether or not the belief in the fallen angels is a true belief.\n\n=== Shemtob Ben Joseph Ibn Falaquera ===\n{{Location map many | France\n|caption= [[Narbonne#History|Narbonne]] in modern [[History of the Jews in France#Carolingian Period|France]]\n| label=[[Narbonne#History|Narbonne]]\n| position=top\n| lat=43.1836| long= 3.0042\n| width=100 | float=right\n}}\n[[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]] was a Spanish-born philosopher who pursued reconciliation between Jewish dogma and philosophy.

''Magen Avot'' deals with concepts such as the nature of God, the eternity of the Torah, the coming of the Messiah, and the Resurrection of the dead.

Albo freely criticizes Maimonides' thirteen principles of belief and Crescas' six principles.  According to Albo, \"belief in the Messiah is only a 'twig' unnecessary to the soundness of the trunk\"; not essential to Judaism.  Nor is it true, according to Albo, that every law is binding.  Though every ordinance has the power of conferring happiness in its observance, it is not true that every law must be observed, or that through the neglect of a part of the law, a Jew would violate the divine covenant or be damned.

[[Isaac Abravanel]] was steeped in Rationalism by the Ibn Yahya family, who had a residence immediately adjacent to the ''Great Synagogue of Lisbon'' (also built by the Ibn Yahya Family). His most important work, ''Rosh Amanah'' (\"The Pinnacle of Faith\"), defends Maimonides' thirteen articles of belief against attacks of Hasdai Crescas and Yosef Albo.  ''Rosh Amanah'' ends with the statement that \"Maimonides compiled these articles merely in accordance with the fashion of other nations, which set up axioms or fundamental principles for their science\".\n\n[[Isaac Abravanel]] was born and raised in Lisbon; a student of the Rabbi of Lisbon, ''Yosef ben Shlomo Ibn Yahya''.<ref>\"Isaac Abarbanel's stance toward tradition: defense, dissent, and dialogue\" By Eric Lawee</ref>  Rabbi Yosef was a poet, religious scholar, rebuilder of ''Ibn Yahya Synagogue of Calatayud'', well versed in rabbinic literature and in the learning of his time, devoting his early years to the study of Jewish philosophy.

Samuel fled Castile-Le\u00f3n, Spain, in 1397 for Lisbon, Portugal, and reverted to Judaism - shedding his ''[[Converso]]'' after living among Christians for six years.   Conversions outside Judaism, coerced or otherwise, had a strong impact upon young Isaac, later compelling him to forfeit his immense wealth in an attempt to redeem Iberian Jewry from coercion of the [[Alhambra Decree]].  There are parallels between what he writes, and documents produced by Inquisitors, that present [[conversos]] as ambivalent to Christianity and sometimes even ironic in their expressions regarding their new religion - [[crypto-jews]].\n\n=== Leone Ebreo ===\n[[Judah Leon Abravanel]] was Portuguese physician, poet and philosopher. His work ''Dialoghi d'amore'' (\"Dialogues of Love\"), written in Italian, was one of the most important philosophical works of his time. In an attempt to circumvent a plot, hatched by local Catholic Bishops to kidnap his son, Judah sent his son from Castile, to Portugal with a nurse, but by order of the king, the son was seized and baptized.  This was a devastating insult to Judah and his family, and was a source of bitterness throughout Judah's life and the topic of his writings years later; especially since this was not the first time the Abravanel Family was subjected to such embarrassment at the hands of the Catholic Church.\n\nJudah's ''Dialoghi'' is regarded as the finest of Humanistic Period works.  His neoplatonism is derived from the Hispanic Jewish community, especially the works of [[Ibn Gabirol]].  Platonic notions of reaching towards a nearly impossible ideal of beauty, wisdom, and perfection encompass the whole of his work.  In ''Dialoghi d'amore'', Judah defines love in philosophical terms.  He structures his three dialogues as a conversation between two abstract \"characters\": Philo, representing love or appetite, and Sophia, representing science or wisdom, Philo+Sophia (philosophia).\n\n=== Criticisms of Kabbalah ===\nThe word \"Kabbalah\" was used in medieval Jewish texts to mean \"tradition\", see [[Abraham Ibn Daud]]'s ''Sefer Ha-Qabbalah'' also known as the \"Book of our Tradition\".  \"Book of our Tradition\" does not refer to mysticism of any kind - it chronicles \"our tradition of scholarship and study\" in two Babylonian Academies, through the Geonim, into Talmudic Yeshivas of Spain.  In Talmudic times there was a mystic tradition in Judaism, known as ''Maaseh Bereshith'' (the work of creation) and ''Maaseh Merkavah'' (the work of the chariot); Maimonides interprets these texts as referring to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of Torah.\n\nIn the 13th century, however, a mystical-esoteric system emerged which became known as \"the [[Kabbalah]].\"  Many of the beliefs associated with Kabbalah had long been rejected by philosophers.  [[Saadia Gaon]] had taught in his book ''Emunot v'Deot'' that Jews who believe in [[gilgul]] have adopted a non-Jewish belief.  [[Maimonides]] rejected many texts of ''[[Heichalot]]'', particularly ''[[Shi'ur Qomah]]'' whose anthropomorphic vision of God he considered heretical.\n\nIn the 13th century, *Meir ben Simon of Narbonne wrote an epistle (included in ''Milhhemet Mitzvah'') against early Kabbalists, singled out ''[[Sefer Bahir]]'', rejecting the attribution of its authorship to the tanna R. Nehhunya ben ha-Kanah and describing some of its content as follow -\n\n::''\"... And we have heard that a book had already been written for them, which they call  Bahir, that is 'bright' but no light shines through it. This book has come into our hands and we have found that they falsely attribute it to Rabbi Nehunya ben Haqqanah. haShem forbid! There is no truth in this...

He was the father and teacher of a long line of rationalist philosophers and scholars.  Non-Jewish students of Delmedigo classified him as an \"Averroist\", however, he saw himself as a follower of Maimonides. Scholastic association of Maimonides and Ibn Rushd would have been a natural one; Maimonides, towards the end of his life, was impressed with the Ibn Rushd commentaries and recommended them to his students. The followers of Maimonides (Maimonideans) had therefore been, for several generations before Delmedigo, the leading users, translators and disseminators of the works of Ibn Rushd in Jewish circles, and advocates for Ibn Rushd even after Islamic rejection of his radical views.  Maimonideans regarded Maimonides and Ibn Rushd as following the same general line.  In his book, Delmedigo portrays himself as defender of Maimonidean Judaism, and \u2014 like many Maimonideans \u2014 he emphasized the rationality of Jewish tradition.\n{{Location map many | Greece\n|caption= Thessaloniki in modern [[Greece]]\n| label=[[History of the Jews of Thessaloniki|Salonika]], [[Ottoman Empire]]\n| position=bottom\n| lat=40.633| long= 22.95\n| width=100| float=left\n}}\n\n=== Moses Almosnino ===\n[[Moses Almosnino]] was born [[Thessaloniki]] 1515 - died Constantinople abt 1580.

The center-of-mass of Rationalism shifted to France, Italy, Germany, Crete, Sicily and Netherlands.  Expulsion from Spain and the coordinated pogroms of Europe resulted in the cross-pollination of variations on Rationalism incubated within diverse communities.  This period is also marked by the intellectual exchange among leaders of the Christian Reformation and Jewish scholars.  Of particular note is the line of Rationalists who migrated out of Germany, and present-day Italy into Crete, and other areas of the [[Ottoman Empire]] seeking safety and protection from the endless pogroms fomented by the [[House of Habsburg]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] against Jews.\n\nRationalism was incubating in places far from Spain. From stories told by Rabbi [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm]], German-speaking Jews, descendants of Jews who migrated back to Jerusalem after Charlemagne's invitation was revoked in Germany many centuries earlier, who lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century, were influenced by prevailing [[Mutazilite]] scholars of Jerusalem. A German-speaking Palestinian Jew saved the life of a young German man surnamed \"Dolberger\". When the knights of the [[First Crusade]] came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members rescued German-speaking Jews in Palestine and brought them back to the safety of Worms, Germany, to repay the favor.<ref>\"Seder ha-Dorot\", p. 252, 1878 ed.</ref> Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of halakic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the eleventh century.<ref>Epstein, in \"Monatsschrift\", xlvii. 344; Jerusalem: Under the Arabs</ref>\n\nAll of the foregoing resulted in an explosion of new ideas and philosophic paths.\n\n=== Yosef Shlomo ben Eliyahu Dal Medigo ===\n[[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]] was  a physician and teacher \u2013 Baruch Spinoza was a student of his works.<ref>\"Bless\u00e9d Spinoza: a biography of the philosopher\", by Lewis Browne, The Macmillan Company, 1932, University of Wisconsin - Madison</ref>\n\n=== Baruch Spinoza ===\n[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Baruch Spinoza]]]]\n[[Baruch Spinoza]] founded [[Spinozism]], broke with [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic Jewish]] tradition, and was placed in ''[[Herem (censure)|herem]]'' by the [[Beit Din]] of [[Amsterdam]].

Some contemporary critics (e.g., Wachter, ''Der Spinozismus im Judenthum'') claimed to detect the influence of the [[Kabbalah]], while others (e.g., [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]) regarded Spinozism as a revival of [[Averroism]] \u2013 a talmudist manner of referencing to Maimonidean Rationalism.

Most Haredim contended that one cannot simultaneously be a philosopher and a true adherent of a revealed religion.  In this view, all attempts at synthesis ultimately fail.  Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]], for example, viewed all philosophy as untrue and heretical.  In this he represents one strand of [[Hasidic]] thought, with creative emphasis on the emotions.\n\nOther exponents of [[Hasidic philosophy|Hasidism]] had a more positive attitude towards philosophy.  In the [[Chabad]] writings of [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], Hasidut is seen as able to unite all parts of Torah thought, from the schools of philosophy to mysticism, by uncovering the illuminating Divine essence that permeates and transcends all approaches.  Interpreting the verse from [[Book of Job|Job]], \"from my flesh I see [[HaShem]]\", Shneur Zalman explained the inner meaning, or \"soul\", of the Jewish mystical tradition in intellectual form, by means of analogies drawn from the human realm.  As explained and continued by the later leaders of Chabad, this enabled the human mind to grasp concepts of Godliness, and so enable the heart to feel the love and awe of God, emphasised by all the founders of hasidism, in an internal way.  This development, the culminating level of the Jewish mystical tradition, in this way bridges philosophy and mysticism, by expressing the transcendent in human terms.\n\n== 20th and 21st-century Jewish philosophy ==\n[[File:Martin Buber portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Buber]]]]\n\n=== Jewish existentialism ===\n{{main|Jewish existentialism}}\nOne of the major trends in modern Jewish philosophy was the attempt to develop a theory of Judaism through [[existentialism]].

One of the most influential Jewish existentialists in the first half of the 20th century was [[Franz Rosenzweig]].  While researching his doctoral dissertation on the 19th-century German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], Rosenzweig reacted against Hegel's idealism and developed an existential approach.  Rosenzweig, for a time, considered conversion to Christianity, but in 1913, he turned to Jewish philosophy. He became a philosopher and student of [[Hermann Cohen]].  Rozensweig's major work, ''Star of Redemption'', is his new philosophy in which he portrays the relationships between haShem, humanity and world as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption.

[[Dor Daim]], and [[Dor Daim#Talmide ha-Rambam|Rambamists]] are two groups who reject mysticism as a \"superstitious innovation\" to an otherwise clear and succinct set of Laws and rules.  According to these rationalists, there is shame and disgrace attached to failure to investigate matters of religious principle using the fullest powers of human reason and intellect.  One cannot be considered wise, or perceptive, if one does not attempt to understand the origins, and establish the correctness, of one's beliefs.\n\n=== Holocaust theology ===\n{{main|Holocaust theology}}\nJudaism has traditionally taught that God is [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omniscience|omniscient]] and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]]. Yet, these claims are in jarring contrast with the fact that there is much [[evil]] in the world. Perhaps the most difficult question that monotheists have confronted is \"how can one reconcile the existence of this view of God with the existence of evil?\" or \"how can there be good without bad?\"  \"how can there be a God without a devil?\" This is [[the problem of evil]].  Within all monotheistic faiths many answers ([[theodicy|theodicies]]) have been proposed.  However, in light of the magnitude of evil seen in the [[Holocaust]], many people have re-examined classical views on this subject. How can people still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust?  This set of Jewish philosophies is discussed in the article on [[Holocaust theology]].\n\n=== Reconstructionist theology ===\n{{main|Reconstructionist Judaism}}\nPerhaps the most controversial form of Jewish philosophy that developed in the early 20th century was the religious naturalism of Rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]].  His theology was a variant of [[John Dewey]]'s [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophy.  Dewey's naturalism combined atheist beliefs with religious terminology in order to construct a philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional Judaism.  In agreement with the classical medieval Jewish thinkers, Kaplan affirmed that haShem is not personal, and that all anthropomorphic descriptions of haShem are, at best, imperfect metaphors.  Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that haShem is the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled.  Kaplan wrote that \"to believe in haShem means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society.\"\n\n=== Process theology ===\nA recent trend has been to reframe Jewish theology through the lens of [[process philosophy]], more specifically [[process theology]]. Process philosophy suggests that fundamental elements of the universe are occasions of experience.  According to this notion, what people commonly think of as concrete objects are actually successions of these occasions of experience. Occasions of experience can be collected into groupings; something complex such as a human being is thus a grouping of many smaller occasions of experience. In this view, everything in the universe is characterized by experience (not to be confused with consciousness); there is no mind-body duality under this system, because \"mind\" is simply seen as a very developed kind of experiencing entity.\n\nIntrinsic to this worldview is the notion that all experiences are influenced by prior experiences, and will influence all future experiences.  This process of influencing is never deterministic; an occasion of experience consists of a process of comprehending other experiences, and then reacting to it.  This is the \"process\" in \"process philosophy\". Process philosophy gives God a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them; thus process philosophy is a form of [[panentheism]].\n\nThe original ideas of process theology were developed by [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897\u20132000), and influenced a number of [[Judaism|Jewish]] theologians, including [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher Samuel Alexander (1859\u20131938), and [[Rabbis]] [[Max Kadushin]], Milton Steinberg and Levi A. Olan, Harry Slominsky, and [[Bradley Shavit Artson]].  [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] has also been linked to this tradition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Donald J.|title=The Human and the Holy: The Spirituality of Abraham Joshua Heschel|year=1989|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0823212361|pages=82\u201383|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdfdS5YwOHoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n=== Kabbalah and philosophy ===\nKabbalah continued to be central to [[Haredi Orthodox Judaism]], which generally rejected philosophy, although the [[Chabad]] strain of [[Chasidism]] showed a more positive attitude towards philosophy. Meanwhile, non-Orthodox Jewish thought in the latter 20th century saw resurgent interest in [[Kabbalah]]. In academic studies, [[Gershom Scholem]] began the critical investigation of Jewish mysticism, while in non-Orthodox [[Jewish denominations]], [[Jewish Renewal]] and [[Neo-Hasidism]], spiritualised worship. Many philosophers do not consider this a form of philosophy, as Kabbalah is a collection of esoteric methods of textual interpretation. Mysticism is generally understood as an alternative to philosophy, not a variant of philosophy.\n\nAmong modern the modern critics of Kabbalah was [[Yihhyah Qafahh]], who wrote a book entitled ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem]]'', (''Wars of the Name'') against what he perceived as the false teachings of the Zohar and the false Kabbalah of Isaac Luria. He is credited with spearheading the [[Dor Daim]]. [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] publicly shared the views expressed in Rabbi [[Yihhyah Qafahh]]'s book ''Milhhamoth ha-Shem'' and elaborated upon these views in his many writings.\n\n=== Contemporary Jewish philosophy ===\n\n==== Philosophers associated with Orthodox Judaism ====\n{{main|Orthodox Jewish philosophy}}\n* [[Eliezer Berkovits]]\n* [[Monsieur Chouchani]]\n* [[Eliyahu Dessler]]\n* [[Israel Eldad]]\n* [[Elimelech of Lizhensk]]\n* [[David Hartman (rabbi)|David Hartman]]\n* [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]]\n* [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]\n* [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]]\n* [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk]]\n* [[Nachman of Breslov]]\n* [[Franz Rosenzweig]]\n* [[Tamar Ross]]\n* [[Daniel Rynhold]]\n* [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]]\n* [[Joseph Soloveitchik]]\n* [[Michael Wyschogrod]]\n* [[Chaim Volozhin]]\n* [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]]\n\n==== Philosophers associated with Conservative Judaism ====\n<!-- [[File:SelmaHeschelMarch.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] marching with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]]] -->\n{{main|Conservative Judaism}}\n* [[Bradley Shavit Artson]]\n* [[Elliot N.

These include:\n* [[Theodor W. Adorno]]\n* [[Joseph Agassi]], an Israeli philosopher of science who developed [[Karl Popper]]'s ideas<ref>As early as 1934 [[Karl Popper]] wrote of the search for truth as \"one of the strongest motives for scientific discovery.\" Still, he describes in ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972) early concerns about the much-criticized notion of truth as correspondence. Then came the semantic theory of truth formulated by the logician Alfred Tarski and published in 1933. Popper writes of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski's theory, to his intense joy. The theory met critical objections to truth as correspondence and thereby rehabilitated it. The theory also seemed, in Popper's eyes, to support metaphysical realism and the regulative idea of a search for truth. Popper coined the term critical rationalism to describe his philosophy.

Nunb was puppeteered by [[Mike Quinn (puppeteer)|Mike Quinn]] and was portrayed by [[Richard Bonehill]] in wide shots. The character was voiced by [[Bill Kipsang Rotich|Kipsang Rotich]], a [[Kenya]]n student who spoke in his native [[Kalenjin language|Kalenjin]], as well as in the [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]]. Quinn and Rotich both returned to the role for the 2015 film ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', 2017's ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'' in 2019.\n\nWithin the fictional ''Star Wars'' universe, Nien Nunb is an arms dealer of the [[Sullustan]] species who joins the [[Rebel Alliance]] in fighting the evil [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. Three decades later, Nunb is a starfighter pilot in the Resistance against the [[First Order]], including the Battle of Starkiller Base.\n\n==Creation and portrayal==\nNunb's name originated from the fact that he was referred to as \"Number Nine\" on creature packaging. In an interview, [[Richard Marquand]] described Nien Nunb as, \"\u2026a [[Muppet]], a guy under the deck does his thing. He's got some dialogue to do. He's got this funny, twitchy face. He's a terrific character in my mind\". Nien Nunb was based of a monkey.\n\nNien Nunb was brought to life by both a puppeteer and as a costumed-actor during the film. Initially, he was just to appear in the briefing room scenes, and the [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] celebration. For these appearances he was portrayed by stuntman [[Richard Bonehill]], in costume and mask. However, Nunb was later chosen, by series creator [[George Lucas]], to appear in the [[Millennium Falcon]], as [[Lando Calrissian]]'s co-pilot. Since the character now had dialogue, it was decided that the mask would be reworked into a [[puppet]], with mechanisms to allow for moving lips and eyes. For these scenes, in the cockpit, the role was handed over to puppeteer [[Mike Quinn (puppeteer)|Mike Quinn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://starwarsinterviews1.blogspot.co.uk/2010/01/mike-quinn-interview.html |title=Mike Quinn Interview: Nien Nunb |website=Star Wars Interviews |date=January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe character was voiced by [[Bill Kipsang Rotich]], a Kenyan student and native [[Kalenjin language|Kalenjin]] speaker, who spoke in [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]] and [[Haya language|Haya]] for the role. After voicing the character, Rotich became a local celebrity in his home country, as many Kenyan viewers could hear their own languages in a ''Star Wars'' film, and understand the character's dialogue.<ref>{{cite web |title=We have found Bill Kipsang Rotich of Hollywood 'Star Wars' movie |url=http://www.sde.co.ke/thenairobian/article/2000182537/we-have-found-bill-kipsang-rotich-of-hollywood-star-wars-movie |first=Kevin |last=Tunoi |date=November 14, 2014 |website=SDE}}</ref>\n\nQuinn returned to the role for ''The Force Awakens'', without Bonehill, who died in February 2015.

Before the battle, when the Alliance Fleet gathers near Sullust, Nunb expresses concern about the plan of attack and whether General [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), [[Princess Leia Organa]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]), and their team would be able to successfully destroy the Death Star's shield generator on the moon of Endor before the fleet arrived. Calrissian assures him that Solo would have the shield down on schedule.\n\nWith Nunb and Calrissian in the cockpit of the ''Millennium Falcon'' leading the attack, the Alliance Fleet arrives over Endor to find that the shield generator is still operational, quickly realizing that the battle is a trap set by [[Emperor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) to engage and destroy the Rebel Alliance once and for all. The fleet remains over Endor and engages Imperial forces in the hopes that Solo and his team would still be able to complete their mission and destroy the generator. The fleet keeps to fighting Imperial [[TIE fighter]]s and [[Star Destroyer]]s, particularly once they learn that the Death Star is operational. Once Solo's team destroys the shield generator, the ''Millennium Falcon'' enters the Death Star's superstructure and fires the shot that begins a chain reaction that destroys the battle station. Nunb and Calrissian escape the Death Star just before it is consumed in a massive explosion. Nunb joins his fellow Rebels and the native [[Ewok]]s on the surface of Endor in celebrating the destruction of the Death Star and the downfall of the Empire.\n\n====''The Force Awakens'' (2015)====\nActor Mike Quinn confirmed on October 19, 2015 via [[Facebook]] that he would return in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''. Later on December 6, Nien Nunb's appearance was seen in a TV spot for the film. Kipsang Rotich also reprised his role as the voice for Nien Nunb.\n\nIn the film, when the [[First Order]] destroys the Hosnian system with the Starkiller Base superweapon, the Resistance base on D'Qar becomes the next target. Quickly establishing a plan to destroy Starkiller Base, Nunb, along with the rest of the Starfighter Corps, flies to the planet in an attempt to destroy its thermal oscillator and disable the weapon. During the battle, many Resistance pilots are killed before the oscillator is destroyed by [[Poe Dameron]] ([[Oscar Isaac]]). Nunb is one of seven surviving X-wing pilots, and he celebrates with the rest of the Resistance upon returning to D'Qar.\n\n====''The Last Jedi'' (2017)====\nQuinn reprised his role as Nien Nunb in ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'', the second installment of the sequel trilogy. Rotich, on the other hand, did not, because Nien Nunb does not have any lines in this film. <ref>{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Ward |url=http://makingstarwars.net/2016/02/star-wars-mega-legend-mike-quinn-nien-nunb-to-return-for-star-wars-episode-viii/ |title=Star Wars Mega Legend Mike Quinn (Nien Nunb) to return for Star Wars: Episode VIII! |website=Making Star Wars |date=February 4, 2016 |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the film, Nien Nunb evacuates alongside his fellow soldiers from the Resistance base of D'Qar, and is present aboard the ''Raddus'' during the battle of the Resistance's bombers against the First Order. Nunb later escapes offscreen alongside Leia and other Resistance members to the old Rebellion base on the planet of Crait.

Introduced in the 1983 film ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'', he was brought to life both as a puppet and a costumed actor during the film. Nunb was puppeteered by [[Mike Quinn (puppeteer)|Mike Quinn]] and was portrayed by [[Richard Bonehill]] in wide shots. The character was voiced by [[Bill Kipsang Rotich|Kipsang Rotich]], a [[Kenya]]n student who spoke in his native [[Kalenjin language|Kalenjin]], as well as in the [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]]. Quinn and Rotich both returned to the role for the 2015 film ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', 2017's ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'' in 2019.\n\nWithin the fictional ''Star Wars'' universe, Nien Nunb is an arms dealer of the [[Sullustan]] species who joins the [[Rebel Alliance]] in fighting the evil [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. Three decades later, Nunb is a starfighter pilot in the Resistance against the [[First Order]], including the Battle of Starkiller Base.\n\n==Creation and portrayal==\nNunb's name originated from the fact that he was referred to as \"Number Nine\" on creature packaging. In an interview, [[Richard Marquand]] described Nien Nunb as, \"\u2026a [[Muppet]], a guy under the deck does his thing. He's got some dialogue to do. He's got this funny, twitchy face. He's a terrific character in my mind\".\n\nNien Nunb was brought to life by both a puppeteer and as a costumed-actor during the film. Initially, he was just to appear in the briefing room scenes, and the [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] celebration. For these appearances he was portrayed by stuntman [[Richard Bonehill]], in costume and mask. However, Nunb was later chosen, by series creator [[George Lucas]], to appear in the [[Millennium Falcon]], as [[Lando Calrissian]]'s co-pilot. Since the character now had dialogue, it was decided that the mask would be reworked into a [[puppet]], with mechanisms to allow for moving lips and eyes. For these scenes, in the cockpit, the role was handed over to puppeteer [[Mike Quinn (puppeteer)|Mike Quinn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://starwarsinterviews1.blogspot.co.uk/2010/01/mike-quinn-interview.html |title=Mike Quinn Interview: Nien Nunb |website=Star Wars Interviews |date=January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe character was voiced by [[Bill Kipsang Rotich]], a Kenyan student and native [[Kalenjin language|Kalenjin]] speaker, who spoke in [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]] and [[Haya language|Haya]] for the role. After voicing the character, Rotich became a local celebrity in his home country, as many Kenyan viewers could hear their own languages in a ''Star Wars'' film, and understand the character's dialogue.<ref>{{cite web |title=We have found Bill Kipsang Rotich of Hollywood 'Star Wars' movie |url=http://www.sde.co.ke/thenairobian/article/2000182537/we-have-found-bill-kipsang-rotich-of-hollywood-star-wars-movie |first=Kevin |last=Tunoi |date=November 14, 2014 |website=SDE}}</ref>\n\nQuinn returned to the role for ''The Force Awakens'', without Bonehill, who died in February 2015.

Before the battle, when the Alliance Fleet gathers near Sullust, Nunb expresses concern about the plan of attack and whether General [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), [[Princess Leia Organa]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]), and their team would be able to successfully destroy the Death Star's shield generator on the moon of Endor before the fleet arrived. Calrissian assures him that Solo would have the shield down on schedule.\n\nWith Nunb and Calrissian in the cockpit of the ''Millennium Falcon'' leading the attack, the Alliance Fleet arrives over Endor to find that the shield generator is still operational, quickly realizing that the battle is a trap set by [[Emperor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) to engage and destroy the Rebel Alliance once and for all. The fleet remains over Endor and engages Imperial forces in the hopes that Solo and his team would still be able to complete their mission and destroy the generator. The fleet keeps to fighting Imperial [[TIE fighter]]s and [[Star Destroyer]]s, particularly once they learn that the Death Star is operational. Once Solo's team destroys the shield generator, the ''Millennium Falcon'' enters the Death Star's superstructure and fires the shot that begins a chain reaction that destroys the battle station. Nunb and Calrissian escape the Death Star just before it is consumed in a massive explosion. Nunb joins his fellow Rebels and the native [[Ewok]]s on the surface of Endor in celebrating the destruction of the Death Star and the downfall of the Empire.\n\n====''The Force Awakens'' (2015)====\nActor Mike Quinn confirmed on October 19, 2015 via [[Facebook]] that he would return in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''. Later on December 6, Nien Nunb's appearance was seen in a TV spot for the film. Kipsang Rotich also reprised his role as the voice for Nien Nunb.\n\nIn the film, when the [[First Order]] destroys the Hosnian system with the Starkiller Base superweapon, the Resistance base on D'Qar becomes the next target. Quickly establishing a plan to destroy Starkiller Base, Nunb, along with the rest of the Starfighter Corps, flies to the planet in an attempt to destroy its thermal oscillator and disable the weapon. During the battle, many Resistance pilots are killed before the oscillator is destroyed by [[Poe Dameron]] ([[Oscar Isaac]]). Nunb is one of seven surviving X-wing pilots, and he celebrates with the rest of the Resistance upon returning to D'Qar.\n\n====''The Last Jedi'' (2017)====\nQuinn reprised his role as Nien Nunb in ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'', the second installment of the sequel trilogy. Rotich, on the other hand, did not, because Nien Nunb does not have any lines in this film. <ref>{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Ward |url=http://makingstarwars.net/2016/02/star-wars-mega-legend-mike-quinn-nien-nunb-to-return-for-star-wars-episode-viii/ |title=Star Wars Mega Legend Mike Quinn (Nien Nunb) to return for Star Wars: Episode VIII! |website=Making Star Wars |date=February 4, 2016 |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the film, Nien Nunb evacuates alongside his fellow soldiers from the Resistance base of D'Qar, and is present aboard the ''Raddus'' during the battle of the Resistance's bombers against the First Order. Nunb later escapes offscreen alongside Leia and other Resistance members to the old Rebellion base on the planet of Crait. On Crait, Nien pilots a ski speeder along with Poe Dameron, rogue [[Imperial stormtrooper|stormtrooper]] [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]] ([[John Boyega]]), Resistance mechanic [[Rose Tico]] ([[Kelly Marie Tran]]) and X-wing pilot C\u2019ai Threnalli.

They cover a large area of basaltic and rhyolitic lava flows that erupted during an episode of widespread basaltic volcanism during the [[Cretaceous]] period. The flood basalts are characterized by [[lava flows]], [[Dike (geology)|dykes]], [[sill (geology)|sill]]s, and [[intrusive rock|intrusions]], and other volcanic features include [[Volcanic plug|plug]]s, [[scoria]], and [[spatter cones]]. [[Tholeiitic]] basalt constitutes the primary rock type. <ref name=Mahoney></ref><ref name=Melluso_1></ref><ref name=Melluso_2></ref>\n\n==Geologic Setting==\nThe formation of three major sedimentary basins on the western edge of Madagascar occurred as a result of [[extensional tectonics|crustal extension]] in the center of [[Gondwana]] since [[Permo-Carboniferous]] times. These basins include Morondava, Mahajanga, and Ambilobe basins. The Morondava basin overlies the [[Precambrian]] [[Basement (geology)|basement]] and is composed of a thick sequence of [[Carboniferous]] to Late [[Triassic]] [[sedimentary rocks]] from the [[Karoo Supergroup]] as well as Middle [[Jurassic]] to [[Cenozoic]] rocks. The Mahajanga, the second largest basin in Madagascar, extends 400 km along the northwestern coast and is filled by a thick sequence of sediments from the [[Karoo Supergroup]] deposited during the Late [[Permian]] to early [[Jurassic]]. During the Late [[Cretaceous]], a sequence of flood basalts up to 200 m thick covered Permo-Triassic and Lower Cretaceous sedimentary sequences. These basalt flows cover a wide area of the basin and form the Antanimena and Bongolava-Manasamody plateaus. During the Early Cenozoic, Madagascar experienced [[Tectonic uplift|regional uplift]] and [[Rift|intracontinental rifting]].

While age constraints on the flood basalts vary depending on the source, most concur that the volcanism occurred between 85 to 92 Ma using [[argon-argon dating]] processes. In northern Madagascar, ages ranged from 88 to 92 Ma, while in southern Madagascar, ages ranged from 85 to 88 Ma. Argon-argon and [[uranium-lead dating]] both indicate that the volcanism first ended in the northern part of the island. The extent of the volcanism covers the rifted margin of the eastern coast of Madagascar, the Mahajanga and Morondava basins in western Madagascar. It extends down to the Precambrian basement.

The basalts can be split to form two subprovinces based on concentration of [[compatibility (geochemistry)|incompatible elements]] and geographical position. The western subprovince is composed of [[mafic]] and [[intermediate composition|intermediate]] rocks. They have a low abundance of high field strength elements, negative Nb anomalies, and a wide range of initial <sup>144</sup>Nd/<sup>143</sup>Nd.

A [[megalith]] carved from a rock cliff face, it is considered one of the most remarkable cave temples in the world because of its size, architecture and sculptural treatment,<ref name=\"UNESCO_SecII_2003\"/> and \"the climax of the rock-cut phase of [[Indian architecture]]\".<ref>Michell, 362</ref>  The top of the superstructure over the sanctuary is 32.6 metres (107 feet) above the level of the court below,<ref>Michell, 365</ref> although the rock face slopes downwards from the rear of the temple to the front.\n\nThe Kailasa temple (Cave 16) is the largest of the 34 Buddhist, Jain and Hindu cave temples and monasteries known collectively as the [[Ellora Caves]], ranging for over 2 kilometres (1.5 miles) along the sloping [[basalt]] cliff at the site.<ref>Michell, 357</ref>  Most of the excavation of the temple is generally attributed to the eighth century [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta]] king [[Krishna I]] ({{reign|{{circa|756}}|773}}), with some elements completed later.

The temple contains a number of [[relief]] and free-standing sculptures on a grand scale equal to the architecture, though only traces remain of the paintings which originally decorated it.<ref>Michell, 362-366</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nKailasa temple lacks a dedicatory inscription, but there is no doubt that it was commissioned by a Rashtrakuta ruler.{{sfn|Deepak Kannal|1996|p=101}} Its construction is generally attributed to the Rashtrakuta king Krishna I (r. 756-773 CE), based on two epigraphs that link the temple to \"Krishnaraja\" ([[IAST]] K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ar\u0101ja):{{sfn|Deepak Kannal|1996|p=101}}{{sfn|Lisa Owen|2012|p=135}}\n\n* The [[Vadodara]] copper-plate inscription (c. 812-813 CE) of Karkaraja II (a ruler of a [[branches of Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta branch]] of [[Gujarat]]) records the grant of a village in present-day Gujarat. It mentions Krishnaraja as the patron of Kailasanatha, and also mentions a Shiva temple at Elapura (Ellora). It states that the king constructed a temple so wondrous that even the gods and the architect were astonished.{{sfn|Lisa Owen|2012|p=135}} Most scholars believe that this is a reference to the Kailasa Shiva temple at Elora.{{sfn|Lisa Owen|2012|p=136}}\n* The [[Kadaba]] grant of Govinda Prabhutavarsha similarly appears to credit Krishnaraja with the construction of the temple.{{sfn|Deepak Kannal|1996|p=101}}\n\nHowever, the attribution of the temple to Krishna I is not completely certain because these epigraphs are not physically connected to the caves, and do not date Krishnaraja's reign.{{sfn|Lisa Owen|2012|p=135}} Moreover, the land grants issued by Krishna's successors do not contain any references to the Kailasa temple.{{sfn|Lisa Owen|2012|p=136}}\n\nThe Kailasa temple features the use of multiple distinct architectural and sculptural styles. This, combined with its relatively large size, has led some scholars to believe that its construction spanned the reigns of multiple kings.{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=86}}{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=33}} Some of the temple [[relief]]s feature the same style as the one used in the [[Ellora Caves#The Dashavatara|Dashavatara cave]] (Cave 15), which is located next to the temple. The Dashavatara cave contains an inscription of Krishna's predecessor and nephew [[Dantidurga]] (c.\u2009735\u2013756 CE).{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=89}} Based on this, [[art historian]] [[Hermann Goetz (art historian)|Hermann Goetz]] (1952) theorized that the construction of the Kailasa temple began during the reign of Dantidurga. Krishna consecrated its first complete version, which was much smaller than the present-day temple.{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=106}} According to Goetz, Dantidurga's role in the temple construction must have been deliberately suppressed, as Krishna sidelined Dantidurga's sons to claim the throne after his death.{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=92}} Based on analysis of the different styles, Goetz further hypothesized that the later Rashtrakuta rulers also extended the temple. These rulers include [[Dhruva Dharavarsha]], [[Govinda III]], [[Amoghavarsha]], and [[Krishna III]]. According to Goetz, the 11th century [[Paramara]] ruler [[Bhoja]] commissioned the elephant-lion [[frieze]] on the lower [[plinth]] during his invasion of Deccan, and added a new layer of paintings. Finally, [[Ahilyabai Holkar]] commissioned the last layer of paintings in the temple.{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=107}}\n\n[[Madhukar Keshav Dhavalikar|M. K. Dhavalikar]] (1982) analyzed the architecture of the temple, and concluded that the major part of the temple was completed during the reign of Krishna I, although he agreed with Goetz that some other parts of the temple complex can be dated to the later rulers. According to Dhavalikar, the following components were completed by Krishna: the main shrine, its gateway, the [[nandi (bull)|nandi]]-[[mandapa]], the lower-storey, the elephant-lion frieze, the court elephants and the victory pillars.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=42}} Dhavalikar admits that the most important sculpture of the temple, which depicts [[Ravana]] shaking the [[Mount Kailash|Kailasa mountain]], appears to have been built after the main edifice. This sculpture is considered as one of the finest pieces of Indian art, and it is possible that the temple came to be known as Kailasa after it. Dhavalikar theorizes that this sculpture was carved around 3-4 decades after the completion of the main shrine, on the basis of its similarity to the [[tandava]] sculpture in the Lankeshvar cave.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=39-40}} H. Goetz dated this relief to the reign of [[Krishna III]].{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=107}} Like Goetz, Dhavalikar attributes some other structures in the temple complex to the later rulers. These include the Lankeshvar cave and the shrine of the river goddesses (possibly constructed during the reign of [[Govinda III]]).{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=41}} Dhavalikar further theorizes that the excavation of the Dashavatara cave, which began during the reign of Dantidurga, was completed during the reign of Krishna I. This explains the similarities between the sculptures in the two caves.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=44}}\n\n=== Pallava-Chalukya influence ===\n\nDhavalikar pointed out that no major part of the monolithic temple appears to have been an afterthought: architectural evidence suggests that the entire temple was planned at the beginning.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=35}} The main shrine is very similar to (although much larger than) the [[Pattadakal#Virupaksha Temple|Virupaksha Temple at Pattadakal]], which itself is a replica of the [[Kanchi Kailasanathar Temple|Kailasa temple at Kanchi]].{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=33}} The Pattadakal Virupaksha Temple was commissioned by the [[Chalukyas of Badami]] to commemorate their victory over the [[Pallava]]s, who had constructed the Kailasa temple at Kanchi. According to the Virupaksha temple inscriptions, the Chalukyas brought the Pallava artists to Pattadakal after defeating the Pallavas. Dhavalikar theorizes that after defeating the Chalukyas, Krishna must have been impressed by the Virupaksha Temple located in their territory. As a result, he brought the sculptors and architects of the Virupaksha Temple (including some Pallava artists) to his own territory, and engaged them in the construction of the Kailasa temple at Ellora.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|pp=37-38}}\n\nIf one assumes that the architects of the Virupaksha temple helped construct the Kailasa temple at Ellora, the construction of a massive temple during the reign of a single monarch does not seem impossible. The architects already had a blueprint and a prototype, which must have significantly reduced the effort involved in constructing a new temple. Moreover, quarrying a monolithic temple would have actually involved less effort than transporting large stones to build a new temple of similar size. Assuming that one person can cut around 4 cubic feet of rock every day, Dhavalikar estimated that 250 labourers would have managed to construct the Kailasa temple at Ellora within 5.5 years.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=35}} The presence of non-Rashtrakuta styles in the temple can be attributed to the involvement of Chalukya and Pallava artists.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|pp=38-39}}\n\n=== Construction method ===\n[[File:Kailasa temple overview, Ellora.jpg|thumb|One side of the courtyard, from the top of the [[gopuram]]]] \nThe Kailasa Temple is notable for its ''vertical'' excavation\u2014carvers started at the top of the original rock and excavated downward.

His queen prayed to the god [[Grishneshwar|Ghrishneshwar]] (Shiva) at Elapura to cure her husband. She vowed to construct a temple if her wish was granted, and promised to observe a [[fasting|fast]] until she could see the [[shikhara]] (top) of this temple. After the king was cured, she requested him to build a temple immediately, but multiple architects declared that it would take months to build a temple complete with a shikhara. One architect named Kokasa assured the king that the queen would be able to see the shikhara of a temple within a week's time. He started building the temple from the top, by carving a rock. He was able to finish the shikhara within a week's time, enabling the queen to give up her fast. The temple was named Manikeshwar after the queen. M. K. Dhavalikar theorises that Kokasa was indeed the chief architect of the Kailasa temple, which may have been originally known as Manikeshwar. Multiple 11th-13th century inscriptions from central India mention architects born in the illustrious family of Kokasa.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=42-43}}\n\n===Rumours about futile attempt of destruction===\n\nIts a rumour that, In 1682, during the reign of Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, the temple was ordered to be demolished. For the task he sent over 1000 soldiers{{not in source given|date=April 2020}} especially to destroy Kailasa Temple; they worked day and night for over 3 years, but could barely manage to disfigure a few statues here and there. Despite of his repeated{{not in source given|date=April 2020}} efforts to tear down Kailasa Temple, Aurangzeb tasted defeat. He finally gave up, fearing the sacredness{{not in source given|date=April 2020}} of this divine place of worship.<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/interesting-facts-about-worlds-largest-monolithic-structure-the-kailash-temple-in-ellora/amp_articleshow/66499518.cms</ref>{{better source needed|reason=See [[WP:HISTRS]] and [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_287#Times_of_India_RFC]]|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Architecture==\n\nThe Kailasa temple architecture is different from the earlier style prevalent in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region. As stated above, it appears to be based on the [[Pattadakal#Virupaksha Temple|Virupaksha Temple at Pattadakal]] and the [[Kanchi Kailasanathar Temple|Kailasa temple at Kanchi]], but it is not an exact imitation of these two temples.{{sfn|Deepak Kannal|1996|p=102}} The southern influence on the temple architecture can be attributed to the involvement of Chalukya and Pallava artists in its construction.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|pp=38-40}} The indigenous Deccan artisans appear to have played a subordinate role in the temple's construction.{{sfn|Deepak Kannal|1996|p=108}}\n\nThe entrance to the temple courtyard features a low [[gopuram]].<ref name=\"UNESCO_SecII_2003\"/> Most of the deities at the left of the entrance are [[Shaiva]]ite (affiliated with [[Shiva]]) while on the right hand side the deities are [[Vaishnava]]ites (affiliated with [[Vishnu]]). A two-storeyed gateway opens to reveal a U-shaped courtyard. The dimensions of the courtyard are 82 m x 46 m at the base.<ref name=\"UNESCO_SecII_2003\"/> The courtyard is edged by a columned arcade three stories high. The arcades are punctuated by huge sculpted panels, and alcoves containing enormous sculptures of a variety of deities. Originally flying bridges of stone connected these galleries to central temple structures, but these have fallen. Some of the most famous sculptures are Shiva the ascetic, Shiva the dancer, Shiva being warned by [[Parvati]] about the demon [[Ravana]], and river goddess.<ref>{{cite book|title=Medieval India the study of a civilization|first=Irfan|last=Habib|page=49|publisher=National Book Trust, India|location=|isbn=978-81-237-5255-6|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nWithin the courtyard, there is a central shrine dedicated to [[Shiva]], and an image of his mount [[Nandi bull|Nandi]] (the sacred bull).

As is traditional in Shiva temples, Nandi sits on a porch in front of the central temple. The Nandi mandapa and main Shiva temple are each about 7 metres high, and built on two storeys. The lower stories of the Nandi Mandapa are both solid structures, decorated with elaborate illustrative carvings. The base of the temple has been carved to suggest that elephants are holding the structure aloft. A rock bridge connects the Nandi Mandapa to the porch of the temple.

It states that the king constructed a temple so wondrous that even the gods and the architect were astonished.{{sfn|Lisa Owen|2012|p=135}} Most scholars believe that this is a reference to the Kailasa Shiva temple at Elora.{{sfn|Lisa Owen|2012|p=136}}\n* The [[Kadaba]] grant of Govinda Prabhutavarsha similarly appears to credit Krishnaraja with the construction of the temple.{{sfn|Deepak Kannal|1996|p=101}}\n\nHowever, the attribution of the temple to Krishna I is not completely certain because these epigraphs are not physically connected to the caves, and do not date Krishnaraja's reign.{{sfn|Lisa Owen|2012|p=135}} Moreover, the land grants issued by Krishna's successors do not contain any references to the Kailasa temple.{{sfn|Lisa Owen|2012|p=136}}\n\nThe Kailasa temple features the use of multiple distinct architectural and sculptural styles. This, combined with its relatively large size, has led some scholars to believe that its construction spanned the reigns of multiple kings.{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=86}}{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=33}} Some of the temple [[relief]]s feature the same style as the one used in the [[Ellora Caves#The Dashavatara|Dashavatara cave]] (Cave 15), which is located next to the temple. The Dashavatara cave contains an inscription of Krishna's predecessor and nephew [[Dantidurga]] (c.\u2009735\u2013756 CE).{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=89}} Based on this, [[art historian]] [[Hermann Goetz (art historian)|Hermann Goetz]] (1952) theorized that the construction of the Kailasa temple began during the reign of Dantidurga. Krishna consecrated its first complete version, which was much smaller than the present-day temple.{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=106}} According to Goetz, Dantidurga's role in the temple construction must have been deliberately suppressed, as Krishna sidelined Dantidurga's sons to claim the throne after his death.{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=92}} Based on analysis of the different styles, Goetz further hypothesized that the later Rashtrakuta rulers also extended the temple. These rulers include [[Dhruva Dharavarsha]], [[Govinda III]], [[Amoghavarsha]], and [[Krishna III]]. According to Goetz, the 11th century [[Paramara]] ruler [[Bhoja]] commissioned the elephant-lion [[frieze]] on the lower [[plinth]] during his invasion of Deccan, and added a new layer of paintings. Finally, [[Ahilyabai Holkar]] commissioned the last layer of paintings in the temple.{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=107}}\n\n[[Madhukar Keshav Dhavalikar|M. K. Dhavalikar]] (1982) analyzed the architecture of the temple, and concluded that the major part of the temple was completed during the reign of Krishna I, although he agreed with Goetz that some other parts of the temple complex can be dated to the later rulers. According to Dhavalikar, the following components were completed by Krishna: the main shrine, its gateway, the [[nandi (bull)|nandi]]-[[mandapa]], the lower-storey, the elephant-lion frieze, the court elephants and the victory pillars.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=42}} Dhavalikar admits that the most important sculpture of the temple, which depicts [[Ravana]] shaking the [[Mount Kailash|Kailasa mountain]], appears to have been built after the main edifice. This sculpture is considered as one of the finest pieces of Indian art, and it is possible that the temple came to be known as Kailasa after it. Dhavalikar theorizes that this sculpture was carved around 3-4 decades after the completion of the main shrine, on the basis of its similarity to the [[tandava]] sculpture in the Lankeshvar cave.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=39-40}} H. Goetz dated this relief to the reign of [[Krishna III]].{{sfn|H. Goetz|1952|p=107}} Like Goetz, Dhavalikar attributes some other structures in the temple complex to the later rulers. These include the Lankeshvar cave and the shrine of the river goddesses (possibly constructed during the reign of [[Govinda III]]).{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=41}} Dhavalikar further theorizes that the excavation of the Dashavatara cave, which began during the reign of Dantidurga, was completed during the reign of Krishna I. This explains the similarities between the sculptures in the two caves.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=44}}\n\n=== Pallava-Chalukya influence ===\n\nDhavalikar pointed out that no major part of the monolithic temple appears to have been an afterthought: architectural evidence suggests that the entire temple was planned at the beginning.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=35}} The main shrine is very similar to (although much larger than) the [[Pattadakal#Virupaksha Temple|Virupaksha Temple at Pattadakal]], which itself is a replica of the [[Kanchi Kailasanathar Temple|Kailasa temple at Kanchi]].{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=33}} The Pattadakal Virupaksha Temple was commissioned by the [[Chalukyas of Badami]] to commemorate their victory over the [[Pallava]]s, who had constructed the Kailasa temple at Kanchi. According to the Virupaksha temple inscriptions, the Chalukyas brought the Pallava artists to Pattadakal after defeating the Pallavas. Dhavalikar theorizes that after defeating the Chalukyas, Krishna must have been impressed by the Virupaksha Temple located in their territory. As a result, he brought the sculptors and architects of the Virupaksha Temple (including some Pallava artists) to his own territory, and engaged them in the construction of the Kailasa temple at Ellora.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|pp=37-38}}\n\nIf one assumes that the architects of the Virupaksha temple helped construct the Kailasa temple at Ellora, the construction of a massive temple during the reign of a single monarch does not seem impossible. The architects already had a blueprint and a prototype, which must have significantly reduced the effort involved in constructing a new temple. Moreover, quarrying a monolithic temple would have actually involved less effort than transporting large stones to build a new temple of similar size. Assuming that one person can cut around 4 cubic feet of rock every day, Dhavalikar estimated that 250 labourers would have managed to construct the Kailasa temple at Ellora within 5.5 years.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=35}} The presence of non-Rashtrakuta styles in the temple can be attributed to the involvement of Chalukya and Pallava artists.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|pp=38-39}}\n\n=== Construction method ===\n[[File:Kailasa temple overview, Ellora.jpg|thumb|One side of the courtyard, from the top of the [[gopuram]]]] \nThe Kailasa Temple is notable for its ''vertical'' excavation\u2014carvers started at the top of the original rock and excavated downward.

The earliest extant text to mention this legend is ''Katha-Kalapataru'' by Krishna Yajnavalki (c. 1470-1535 CE).<ref>{{cite book |author1=Himanshu Prabha Ray |author2=Carla M.

His queen prayed to the god [[Grishneshwar|Ghrishneshwar]] (Shiva) at Elapura to cure her husband. She vowed to construct a temple if her wish was granted, and promised to observe a [[fasting|fast]] until she could see the [[shikhara]] (top) of this temple. After the king was cured, she requested him to build a temple immediately, but multiple architects declared that it would take months to build a temple complete with a shikhara. One architect named Kokasa assured the king that the queen would be able to see the shikhara of a temple within a week's time. He started building the temple from the top, by carving a rock. He was able to finish the shikhara within a week's time, enabling the queen to give up her fast. The temple was named Manikeshwar after the queen. M. K. Dhavalikar theorises that Kokasa was indeed the chief architect of the Kailasa temple, which may have been originally known as Manikeshwar. Multiple 11th-13th century inscriptions from central India mention architects born in the illustrious family of Kokasa.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|p=42-43}}\n\n===Futile attempt of destruction===\n\nIn 1682, during the reign of Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, the temple was ordered to be demolished. For the task he sent over 1000 soldiers{{not in source given|date=April 2020}} especially to destroy Kailasa Temple; they worked day and night for over 3 years, but could barely manage to disfigure a few statues here and there. Despite of his repeated{{not in source given|date=April 2020}} efforts to tear down Kailasa Temple, Aurangzeb tasted defeat. He finally gave up, fearing the sacredness{{not in source given|date=April 2020}} of this divine place of worship.<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/interesting-facts-about-worlds-largest-monolithic-structure-the-kailash-temple-in-ellora/amp_articleshow/66499518.cms</ref>{{better source needed|reason=See [[WP:HISTRS]] and [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_287#Times_of_India_RFC]]|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Architecture==\n\nThe Kailasa temple architecture is different from the earlier style prevalent in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region. As stated above, it appears to be based on the [[Pattadakal#Virupaksha Temple|Virupaksha Temple at Pattadakal]] and the [[Kanchi Kailasanathar Temple|Kailasa temple at Kanchi]], but it is not an exact imitation of these two temples.{{sfn|Deepak Kannal|1996|p=102}} The southern influence on the temple architecture can be attributed to the involvement of Chalukya and Pallava artists in its construction.{{sfn|M. K. Dhavalikar|1982|pp=38-40}} The indigenous Deccan artisans appear to have played a subordinate role in the temple's construction.{{sfn|Deepak Kannal|1996|p=108}}\n\nThe entrance to the temple courtyard features a low [[gopuram]].<ref name=\"UNESCO_SecII_2003\"/> Most of the deities at the left of the entrance are [[Shaiva]]ite (affiliated with [[Shiva]]) while on the right hand side the deities are [[Vaishnava]]ites (affiliated with [[Vishnu]]). A two-storeyed gateway opens to reveal a U-shaped courtyard. The dimensions of the courtyard are 82 m x 46 m at the base.<ref name=\"UNESCO_SecII_2003\"/> The courtyard is edged by a columned arcade three stories high. The arcades are punctuated by huge sculpted panels, and alcoves containing enormous sculptures of a variety of deities. Originally flying bridges of stone connected these galleries to central temple structures, but these have fallen. Some of the most famous sculptures are Shiva the ascetic, Shiva the dancer, Shiva being warned by [[Parvati]] about the demon [[Ravana]], and river goddess.<ref>{{cite book|title=Medieval India the study of a civilization|first=Irfan|last=Habib|page=49|publisher=National Book Trust, India|location=|isbn=978-81-237-5255-6|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nWithin the courtyard, there is a central shrine dedicated to [[Shiva]], and an image of his mount [[Nandi bull|Nandi]] (the sacred bull). The central shrine housing the [[lingam]] features a flat-roofed [[mandapa]] supported by 16 pillars, and a [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]] [[shikhara]].<ref name=\"UNESCO_SecII_2003\"/> The shrine &ndash; complete with pillars, windows, inner and outer rooms, gathering halls, and an enormous stone lingam at its heart &ndash; is carved with niches, plasters, windows as well as images of deities, ''mithuna''s (erotic male and female figures) and other figures. As is traditional in Shiva temples, Nandi sits on a porch in front of the central temple. The Nandi mandapa and main Shiva temple are each about 7 metres high, and built on two storeys. The lower stories of the Nandi Mandapa are both solid structures, decorated with elaborate illustrative carvings. The base of the temple has been carved to suggest that elephants are holding the structure aloft. A rock bridge connects the Nandi Mandapa to the porch of the temple. The base of the temple hall features scenes from ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]''.{{sfn|M. K.

Its rulers belonged to the [[Holkar|Holkar dynasty]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Indore |volume=14 |pages=500\u2013501 |first=James Sutherland |last=Cotton}}</ref> [[Indore]] was a 19-[[Salute state|gun salute]] [[princely state]] (a rare high rank) during the [[British Raj|British rule in India]].\n\nIndore state was located in the present-day Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. The capital of the state was the city of [[Indore]]. The state had an area of 24,605&nbsp;km\u00b2 and a population of 1,325,089 in 1931. Other important towns besides Indore were [[Rampura, Neemuch|Rampura]], [[Khargon]], [[Maheshwar]], [[Mehidpur]], [[Barwaha]], and [[Bhanpura]]; there were a total of 3,368 villages.<ref>Great Britain India Office. ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1908.</ref>\n\n==History==\nBy 1720, the headquarters of the local ''pargana'' (an Indian local administrative unit) was transferred from Kampel to Indore due to the increasing commercial activity in the city. On 18 May 1724, the ''Nizam'' accepted the rights of the Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I to collect ''chauth'' (taxes) from the area. In 1733, the ''Peshwa'' assumed full control of Malwa and appointed his commander Malhar Rao Holkar as the ''Subhedar'' (Governor) of the province.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nOn 29 July 1732, Bajirao Peshwa-I granted Holkar State by merging 28 and a half ''parganas'' to Malhar Rao Holkar, the founding ruler of the Holkar dynasty. His daughter-in-law Ahilyabai Holkar moved the state's capital to Maheshwar in 1767, but Indore remained an important commercial and military centre.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAfter the defeat of the Holkar rulers in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], an agreement was signed on 6 January 1818 with the [[British Empire|British]] and the Indore State became a [[British protectorate]]. The Holkar dynasty was able to continue to rule Indore as a [[princely state]] mainly owing to the efforts of ''Dewan'' (chief minister) Tatya Jog.\n\nThe capital was moved from [[Maheshwar]] to Indore on 3 November 1818 and the [[Indore Residency]], a political [[Residencies of British India|residency]] with a British resident, was established in the city. Later, Indore would be established as the headquarters of the British [[Central India Agency]]. In 1906, electrical infrastructure was installed in the city while a fire brigade was established in 1909. By 1918, the first master plan of the city was drawn by architect and town planner [[Patrick Geddes]].\n\nDuring the period of [[Tukojirao Holkar II|Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar II]] (1852\u201386), efforts were made for the planned development and industrial development of Indore. During the reigns of [[Shivajirao Holkar|Maharaja Shivaji Rao Holkar]], [[Tukojirao Holkar III|Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III]], and [[Yeshwantrao Holkar II|Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar]], business flourished thanks to the railways that had been introduced in the state in 1875.\n\nIn 1926, Maharaja Tukoji Rao III Holkar XIII abdicated after being implicated in a murder case involving a court dancer and her lover.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jhala|first1=Angma Dey|title=Courtly Indian Women in Late Imperial India (\"The Body, Gender and Culture\")  by|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=London New York|isbn=978-1138663640|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EeUvCgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=maratha&ots=dzQiJfhA8f&sig=9IvD-pK_plcD2vLnPLCqAUIHbdU#v=snippet&q=maratha%20tukoji&f=false|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[independence of India]] in 1947, Indore State, along with a number of neighbouring princely states, acceded to India. [[Yashwant Rao Holkar II]], the last ruler of the state, signed the [[instrument of accession]] to the [[Dominion of India|Indian Union]] on 1 January 1950. The territories of the state became part of the new Indian state of [[Madhya Bharat]].\n\n===Rulers===\nThe kings of Indore held the title of '[[Maharaja]]' Holkar.

Its rulers belonged to the [[Holkar|Holkar dynasty]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Indore |volume=14 |pages=500\u2013501 |first=James Sutherland |last=Cotton}}</ref> [[Indore]] was a 19-[[Salute state|gun salute]] [[princely state]] (a rare high rank) during the [[British Raj|British rule in India]].\n\nIndore state was located in the present-day Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. The capital of the state was the city of [[Indore]]. The state had an area of 24,605&nbsp;km\u00b2 and a population of 1,325,089 in 1931. Other important towns besides Indore were [[Rampura, Neemuch|Rampura]], [[Khargon]], [[Maheshwar]], [[Mehidpur]], [[Barwaha]], and [[Bhanpura]]; there were a total of 3,368 villages.<ref>Great Britain India Office. ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1908.</ref>\n\n==History==\nBy 1720, the headquarters of the local ''pargana'' (an Indian local administrative unit) was transferred from Kampel to Indore due to the increasing commercial activity in the city. On 18 May 1724, the ''Nizam'' accepted the rights of the Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I to collect ''chauth'' (taxes) from the area. In 1733, the ''Peshwa'' assumed full control of Malwa and appointed his commander Malhar Rao Holkar as the ''Subhedar'' (Governor) of the province.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nOn 29 July 1732, Bajirao Peshwa-I granted Holkar State by merging 28 and a half ''parganas'' to Malhar Rao Holkar, the founding ruler of the Holkar dynasty. His daughter-in-law Ahilyabai Holkar moved the state's capital to Maheshwar in 1767, but Indore remained an important commercial and military centre.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAfter the defeat of the Holkar rulers in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], an agreement was signed on 6 January 1818 with the [[British Empire|British]] and the Indore State became a [[British protectorate]]. The Holkar dynasty was able to continue to rule Indore as a [[princely state]] mainly owing to the efforts of ''Dewan'' (chief minister) Tatya Jog.\n\nThe capital was moved from [[Maheshwar]] to Indore on 3 November 1818 and the [[Indore Residency]], a political [[Residencies of British India|residency]] with a British resident, was established in the city. Later, Indore would be established as the headquarters of the British [[Central India Agency]]. In 1906, electrical infrastructure was installed in the city while a fire brigade was established in 1909. By 1918, the first master plan of the city was drawn by architect and town planner [[Patrick Geddes]].\n\nDuring the period of [[Tukojirao Holkar II|Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar II]] (1852\u201386), efforts were made for the planned development and industrial development of Indore. During the reigns of [[Shivajirao Holkar|Maharaja Shivaji Rao Holkar]], [[Tukojirao Holkar III|Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III]], and [[Yeshwantrao Holkar II|Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar]], business flourished thanks to the railways that had been introduced in the state in 1875.\n\nIn 1926, Maharaja Tukoji Rao III Holkar XIII abdicated after being implicated in a murder case involving a court dancer and her lover.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jhala|first1=Angma Dey|title=Courtly Indian Women in Late Imperial India (\"The Body, Gender and Culture\")  by|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=London New York|isbn=978-1138663640|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EeUvCgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=maratha&ots=dzQiJfhA8f&sig=9IvD-pK_plcD2vLnPLCqAUIHbdU#v=snippet&q=maratha%20tukoji&f=false|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[independence of India]] in 1947, Indore State, along with a number of neighbouring princely states, acceded to India. [[Yashwant Rao Holkar II]], the last ruler of the state, signed the [[instrument of accession]] to the [[Indian Union]] on 1 January 1950. The territories of the state became part of the new Indian state of [[Madhya Bharat]].\n\n===Rulers===\nThe kings of Indore held the title of '[[Maharaja]]' Holkar. The rulers of the state were entitled to a 19 [[gun salute]] by the British authorities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/i/indore.html |title=Indore Princely State (19 gun salute) |access-date=13 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606041013/http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/i/indore.html |archive-date=6 June 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Maharajas====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
