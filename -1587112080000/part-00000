He says that the real Sunnis (''Ahlul Sunnah'') are the ones who follow the [[Sunnah]] of Muhammad, that is Shia Muslims. He continues that Sunnis today follow the Sunnah and teachings of Abu Bakr instead, having rejected [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Ahlulbayt]]. He explains in one of his lectures titled ''Bakris think they are Sunnis, but in reality are not'' that when people wanted to distance themselves from the Shia, and follow [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyya]], they started calling themselves the Jama'ah. He explains that the reality behind why people called themselves [[Sunnis|Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah]] only began after the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] ruler [[Umar bin Abdul Aziz]] forbade the Sunnah (tradition) of cursing [[Ali bin Abi Talib]] publicly (as previously invented by the [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]]). It was upon then that people protested to this new prohibition, declaring that [[Umar bin Abdul Aziz]] had prohibited the Sunnah of cursing [[Ali bin Abi Talib]]. Thus they began calling themselves Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah; stressing that they adhere to the Sunnah of cursing [[Ali bin Abi Talib]], and that they are the Jama'ah of [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]].\n\nHe also refers to those people who claim that they belong to [[Shi'a]] but fail to disassociate themselves from [[Abu bakr]], [[Umar|Omar ibn khattab]], [[Aisha]] and other controversial historical personalities like [[Khalid ibn Walid]] as Batris.\n\nHe described [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]] (the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Marja'|marja]] who died on 4 July 2010)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=2&article_id=116761#ixzz0sr3wTEpL |title=Politics - Tuesday official mourning day for Fadlallah |publisher=The Daily Star |date=6 July 2010 |accessdate=27 September 2010}}</ref> as Batri.

He continues that Sunnis today follow the Sunnah and teachings of Abu Bakr instead, having rejected [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Ahlulbayt]]. He explains in one of his lectures titled ''Bakris think they are Sunnis, but in reality are not'' that when people wanted to distance themselves from the Shia, and follow [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyya]], they started calling themselves the Jama'ah. He explains that the reality behind why people called themselves [[Sunnis|Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah]] only began after the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] ruler [[Umar bin Abdul Aziz]] forbade the Sunnah (tradition) of cursing [[Ali bin Abi Talib]] publicly (as previously invented by the [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]]). It was upon then that people protested to this new prohibition, declaring that [[Umar bin Abdul Aziz]] had prohibited the Sunnah of cursing [[Ali bin Abi Talib]]. Thus they began calling themselves Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah; stressing that they adhere to the Sunnah of cursing [[Ali bin Abi Talib]], and that they are the Jama'ah of [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]].\n\nHe also refers to those people who claim that they belong to [[Shi'a]] but fail to disassociate themselves from [[Abu bakr]], [[Umar|Omar ibn khattab]], [[Aisha]] and other controversial historical personalities like [[Khalid ibn Walid]] as Batris.\n\nHe described [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]] (the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Marja'|marja]] who died on 4 July 2010)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=2&article_id=116761#ixzz0sr3wTEpL |title=Politics - Tuesday official mourning day for Fadlallah |publisher=The Daily Star |date=6 July 2010 |accessdate=27 September 2010}}</ref> as Batri.

The report defines it very narrowly, encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom, which can trace their history back to [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconforming Protestants]], [[Puritans]], [[English Separatists|Separatists]], [[Independent (religion)|Independents]], [[17th century denominations in England|English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War]], and other [[English dissenters]] not satisfied with the degree to which the [[Church of England]] had been reformed.\n\nCongregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and various island nations in the Pacific region. It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the [[London Missionary Society]]. A number of [[evangelical]] Congregational churches are members of the [[World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations [[Brownists|formed on a theory of union]] published by the theologian and English separatist [[Robert Browne (Brownist)|Robert Browne]] in 1582.<ref>Browne, Robert, ''A booke which sheweth the life and manners of all true Christians and howe unlike they are unto Turkes and Papistes, and heathen folke.'' 1582</ref> Other accounts trace these origins further back to the [[London Underground Church]] of the 1560s. Ideas of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconforming Protestants]] during the [[Puritan|Puritan Reformation]] of the [[Church of England]] laid foundation for these churches. In [[Kingdom of England|England]], the early Congregationalists were called ''[[Ecclesiastical separatism|Separatists]]'' or ''[[Independent (religion)|Independents]]'' to distinguish them from the similarly [[Calvinistic]] [[Presbyterians]], whose churches embrace a [[Presbyterian polity|polity based on the governance of elders]]. Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using [[Episcopal polity|episcopalian church governance]], which is usually led by a [[bishop]].\n\n[[Congregationalism in the United States]] traces its origins to the Puritans of [[New England]], who wrote the [[Cambridge Platform]] of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others. Within the United States, the model of Congregational churches was carried by migrating settlers from New England into [[New York (state)|New York]], then into the [[Old North West]], and further. With their insistence on independent local bodies, they became important in many [[social reform]] movements, including [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], [[Temperance movement|temperance]], and women's [[suffrage]]. Modern Congregationalism in the United States is largely split into three bodies: the [[United Church of Christ]], the [[National Association of Congregational Christian Churches]] and the [[Conservative Congregational Christian Conference]], which is the most theologically conservative.\n\n== Origins ==\nCongregationalists believe their model of [[church governance]] fulfills the description of the early church and allows people the most direct relationship with God.\n\n[[File:Brief 1.jpg|thumb|Wycliffe speaking to Lollard preachers]]\nCongregationalism is more easily identified as a movement than a single denomination, given its distinguishing commitment to the complete autonomy of the local congregation. The idea that each distinct congregation fully constitutes the visible Body of the church can, however, be traced to [[John Wycliffe]] and the [[Lollard]] movement, which followed Wycliffe's removal from teaching authority in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nIn the reign of Elizabeth I, the puritan movement pressed for the abolition of all Catholic ceremonies remaining in the Church of England, such as clerical vestments, the wedding ring and the sign of the cross. From 1570, more radical puritans also pressed  for presbyterian structural reform - replacing episcopal hierarchy with an egalitarian network of local ministers cooperating through regional synods. \n\nThe Congregationalists went further, saying that each congregation should be independent and appoint its own ministers by a majority vote, authority being vested not in the minister or the bishop but in the people.\n\nIt is not certain when or by whom this idea first developed. It may have been in the [[London Underground Church]] under Richard Fitz in the late 1560s and 1570s. The Congregational historian Albert Peel argued that it was but accepted that the evidence for a fully thought out congregational ecclesiology is not was not overwhelming.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The First Congregational Churches|last=Peel|first=Albert|publisher=CUP|year=1920|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=38-40}}</ref> [[File:Catalogue of Sects.GIF|thumb|upright=1.15|left|''A Catalogue of the Severall Sects and Opinions in England and other Nations: With a briefe Rehearsall of their false and dangerous Tenents'', a propaganda [[broadsheet]] denouncing English dissenters from 1647.]]\n\n[[Robert Browne (Brownist)|Robert Browne]] (1550\u20131633) was the first person to set out explicit congregational principles.  \u2018The meetings together \u2026 of every whole church, and of the elders therein, is above the apostle, above the prophet, the evangelist, the pastor, the teacher, and every particular elder.\u2019  \u2018The voice of the whole people, guided by the elders and the forwardest, is said [in Scripture] to be the voice of God.\u2019<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Journey of the Mayflower|last=Tomkins|first=Stephen|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|year=2020|isbn=|location=London & New York|pages=98}}</ref>\n\n[[Henry Barrow]] (c. 1550\u20131593), [[John Greenwood (Puritan)|John Greenwood]]  (died 1593), [[John Penry]] (1559\u20131593), [[William Brewster (Pilgrim)|William Brewster]] (c. 1566\u20131644), [[Thomas Jollie]] (1629\u20131703) and [[John Robinson (pastor)|John Robinson]] (1576\u20131625) were notable people who established dissenting churches separate from the Church of England.\n\nThe underground churches in England and exiles from Holland provided about 35 out of the 102 passengers on the ''[[Mayflower]]'', which sailed from [[London]] in July 1620. They became known in history as the [[Pilgrim Fathers]]. The early Congregationalists sought to separate themselves from the Anglican church in every possible way and even eschewed having church buildings. They met in homes for many years.\n\nIn 1639 [[William Wroth]], then [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of the parish church at [[Llanvaches]] in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], established the first [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Independent Church]] in [[Wales]] \"according to the New England pattern\", i.e. Congregational.

The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1646) was officially claimed to be the statement of faith for both the Church of England (Anglican/Episcopal) and Church of Scotland (Presbyterian), which was politically expedient  for those in the Presbyterian dominated English Parliament who approved of the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] (1643).\n\nAfter the [[Second English Civil War|Second Civil War]], the [[New Model Army]] which was dominated by Congregationalists (or [[Independents (religion)|Independents]]) seized control of the parliament with [[Pride's purge]] (1648), arranged for the  [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] in January 1649 and subsequently introduced a republican [[Commonwealth (England)|Commonwealth]] dominated by Independents such as [[Oliver Cromwell]]. This government lasted until 1660 when the [[Restoration (England)|monarch was restored]] and [[Episcopal polity|Episcopalism]] was re-established (see the [[penal law (British)|Penal Laws]] and [[Great Ejection]]). In 1662, two years after the Restoration, two thousand Independent, Presbyterian and congregational ministers were evicted from their parishes as dissenters and not being in Holy Orders conferred by bishops. In 1658 (during the [[interregnum (England)|interregnum]]) the Congregationalists created their own version of the Westminster Confession, called the [[Savoy Declaration]], which remains the principal [[subordinate standard]] of Congregationalism.\n\nA summary of Congregationalism in Scotland see the paper presented to a joint meeting of the ministers of the United Reformed Church (Scottish Synod) and the Congregational Federation in Scotland by Rev'd A.

The work in South America began in 1921 when four Argentine churches urgently requested that denominational recognition be given to George Geier, who was serving them.

Like the Royal Family, it too saw Protestantism closely linked to the West and hence more politically dangerous than traditional Orthodox Christianity. This prompted repressive legislation in the form of \"Regulations for the Organization and Administration of the Evangelical Churches in the People's Republic of Bulgaria\" and resulted in the harshest government repression, possibly the worst in the entire [[Eastern Bloc]], intended to extinguish Protestantism altogether. Mass arrests of pastors (and often their families), torture, long prison sentences (including four life sentences) and even disappearance were common. Similar tactics were used on parishioners. In fifteen highly publicized mock show-trials between 8 February and 8 March 1949, all the accused pastors confessed to a range of charges against them, including treason, spying (for both the US and Yugoslavia), black marketing, and various immoral acts. State appointed pastors were foist on surviving congregations. As late as the 1980s, imprisonment and exile were still employed to destroy the remaining Protestant churches.

The report defines it very narrowly, encompassing mainly denominations in the United States and the United Kingdom, which can trace their history back to [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconforming Protestants]], [[Puritans]], [[English Separatists|Separatists]], [[Independent (religion)|Independents]], [[17th century denominations in England|English religious groups coming out of the English Civil War]], and other [[English dissenters]] not satisfied with the degree to which the [[Church of England]] had been reformed.\n\nCongregationalist tradition has a presence in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and various island nations in the Pacific region. It has been introduced either by immigrant dissenter Protestants or by missionary organization such as the [[London Missionary Society]]. A number of [[evangelical]] Congregational churches are members of the [[World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, many Congregational churches claim their descent from Protestant denominations [[Brownists|formed on a theory of union]] published by the theologian and English separatist [[Robert Browne (Brownist)|Robert Browne]] in 1582.<ref>Browne, Robert, ''A booke which sheweth the life and manners of all true Christians and howe unlike they are unto Turkes and Papistes, and heathen folke.'' 1582</ref> Other accounts trace these origins further back to the [[London Underground Church]] of the 1560s. Ideas of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconforming Protestants]] during the [[Puritan|Puritan Reformation]] of the [[Church of England]] laid foundation for these churches. In [[Kingdom of England|England]], the early Congregationalists were called ''[[Ecclesiastical separatism|Separatists]]'' or ''[[Independent (religion)|Independents]]'' to distinguish them from the similarly [[Calvinistic]] [[Presbyterians]], whose churches embrace a [[Presbyterian polity|polity based on the governance of elders]]. Congregationalists also differed with the Reformed churches using [[Episcopal polity|episcopalian church governance]], which is usually led by a [[bishop]].\n\n[[Congregationalism in the United States]] traces its origins to the Puritans of [[New England]], who wrote the [[Cambridge Platform]] of 1648 to describe the autonomy of the church and its association with others. Within the United States, the model of Congregational churches was carried by migrating settlers from New England into [[New York (state)|New York]], then into the [[Old North West]], and further. With their insistence on independent local bodies, they became important in many [[social reform]] movements, including [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], [[Temperance movement|temperance]], and women's [[suffrage]]. Modern Congregationalism in the United States is largely split into three bodies: the [[United Church of Christ]], the [[National Association of Congregational Christian Churches]] and the [[Conservative Congregational Christian Conference]], which is the most theologically conservative.\n\n== Origins ==\nCongregationalists believe their model of [[church governance]] fulfills the description of the early church and allows people the most direct relationship with God.\n\n[[File:Brief 1.jpg|thumb|Wycliffe speaking to Lollard preachers]]\nCongregationalism is more easily identified as a movement than a single denomination, given its distinguishing commitment to the complete autonomy of the local congregation. The idea that each distinct congregation fully constitutes the visible Body of the church can, however, be traced to [[John Wycliffe]] and the [[Lollard]] movement, which followed Wycliffe's removal from teaching authority in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nIn the reign of Elizabeth I, the puritan movement pressed for the abolition of all Catholic ceremonies remaining in the Church of England, such as clerical vestments, the wedding ring and the sign of the cross. From 1570, more radical puritans also pressed  for presbyterian structural reform - replacing episcopal hierarchy with an egalitarian network of local ministers cooperating through regional synods. \n\nThe Congregationalists went further, saying that each congregation should be independent and appoint its own ministers by a majority vote, authority being vested not in the minister or the bishop but in the people.\n\nIt is not certain when or by whom this idea first developed. It may have been in the [[London Underground Church]] under Richard Fitz in the late 1560s and 1570s.

Mass arrests of pastors (and often their families), torture, long prison sentences (including four life sentences) and even disappearance were common. Similar tactics were used on parishioners. In fifteen highly publicized mock show-trials between 8 February and 8 March 1949, all the accused pastors confessed to a range of charges against them, including treason, spying (for both the US and Yugoslavia), black marketing, and various immoral acts.

The House of Aisin Gioro ruled [[China proper]] from 1644 until the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911\u20131912, which established a [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|republican government]] in its place. The word ''aisin'' means ''gold'' in the [[Manchu language]], and \"gioro\" is the name of the Aisin Gioro's [[Ancestral home (Chinese)|ancestral home]] in present-day [[Yilan, Heilongjiang|Yilan]], [[Heilongjiang|Heilongjiang Province]]. In Manchu custom, families are identified first by their ''hala'' (\u54c8\u62c9), i.e. their family or clan name, and then by ''muk\u016bn'' (\u7a46\u6606), the more detailed classification, typically referring to individual families. In the case of Aisin Gioro, Aisin is the ''muk\u016bn'', and Gioro is the ''hala''. Other members of the Gioro clan include [[Irgen Gioro]] (\u4f0a\u723e\u6839\u89ba\u7f85), \u0160u\u0161u Gioro (\u8212\u8212\u89ba\u7f85) and Sirin Gioro (\u897f\u6797\u89ba\u7f85).\n\nThe [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] (''jin'' means gold in Chinese) of the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], ancestors of the Manchus, was known as ''aisin gurun'', and the Qing dynasty was initially named ([[File:amaga aisin gurun1.png|40px]]) ''amaga aisin gurun,'' or the [[Later Jin (1616\u20131636)|Later Jin dynasty]]. Since the fall of the Qing Empire, a number of members of the family have changed their surnames to ''[[Jin (Chinese surname)|Jin]]'' ({{zh|c=\u91d1}}) since it has the same meaning as \"Aisin\". For example, [[Puyi]]'s younger brother changed his name from Aisin Gioro Puren (\u611b\u65b0\u89ba\u7f85\u6ea5\u4efb) to [[Jin Youzhi]] (\u91d1\u53cb\u4e4b) and his children in turn adopt ''Jin'' as their family name.\n\n==Family generation names==\nBefore the founding of the [[Qing dynasty]], the naming of children in the Aisin Gioro clan was essentially arbitrary and followed no particular rules. The [[Manchu people]] originally did not use [[generation name]]s before they moved into China proper; prior to the [[Shunzhi Emperor|Shunzhi era]], children of the imperial clan were given only a Manchu name, for example [[Dorgon]].<ref>{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|quote=In the beginning, among the first couple of generations, Manchu men had polysyllabic personal names (e.g., Nurhaci) that in their native language may have been meaningful but when transliterated by sound into Chinese characters were gibberish; furthermore, they did not arrange their personal names in generational order, as Han often did.|location=|isbn=978-0-295-98040-9|page=55|title=Manchus & Han: ethnic relations and political power in late Qing and early republican China, 1861-1928|edition=reprint, illustrated|author=Edward J.

The Manchus were not so careful about this sort of thing... The Chinese practice of using the same first character for the given names of children of same generation was initially adopted during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. The children of Kangxi all sported the same prefix-character, yin (written \"in\" in Manchu), and every generation afterward was marked by the same initial character (or, in Manchu, the same initial sounds) in the given name. While some Manchu families followed suit, many others did not, or did so inconsistently: for example, the brother of an early-eighteenth-century general, Erentei, was named Torio, while the Xi'an general Cangseli named his son Cangyung, using the same sound, \"cang\" (\"chang\" in Chinese), for his and the following generation.|location=|page=244|title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Mark C.

By the time of the Guangxu emperor (r. 1875-1908), all the males of his generation in the imperial clan had the character zai in their personal names, such as Zaitian (the emperor), Zaifeng (1883-1952; his brother and future regent), and Zaizhen (1876-1948; his cousin). By contrast, the previous generation had used the character yi (e.g., Yikuang, Yixin, and Yihuan), while the following generation used the character pu (e.g., the future Xuantong emperor Puyi [1906-67] and his brother Pujie [1907-94]).|location=|page=55|title=Manchus & Han: ethnic relations and political power in late Qing and early republican China, 1861-1928|edition=reprint, illustrated|author=Edward J. M. Rhoads}}</ref> During the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], all of the emperor's sons were to be named with a [[generation name|generation prefix]] preceding the given name. There were three characters initially used, ''Cheng'' (\u627f), ''Bao'' (\u4fdd) and ''Chang'' (\u9577), before finally settling on ''Yin'' (\u80e4) over a decade into the Kangxi era. The generation prefix of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]]'s sons switched from ''Fu'' (\u798f) to ''Hong'' (\u5f18). Following the Yongzheng Emperor, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] decreed that all subsequent male offspring would have a generation prefix placed in their name according to a \"generation poem\", for which he composed the first four characters, ''Yong Mian Yi Zai'' (\u6c38\u7dbf\u5955\u8f09). Moreover, direct descendants of the emperor will often share a similar [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]] or meaning in the final character. A common radical was shared in the second character of the first name of princes who were in line to the throne, however, princes who were not in line to the throne did not necessarily share the radical in their name.<ref>{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|quote=In a further refinement of the generational principle, the second character in the personal name of each person in the direct line of succession contained a radical that distinguished these name from all others of their generation in the imperial clan.

Nurhachi created large, permanent civil-military units called \"[[Eight Banners|banners]]\" to replace the small hunting groups used in his early campaigns. A banner was composed of smaller companies; it included some 7,500 warriors and their households, including slaves, under the command of a chieftain. Each banner was identified by a coloured flag that was yellow, white, blue, or red, either plain or with a border design. Originally there were four, then eight, Manchu banners; new banners were created as the Manchu conquered new regions, and eventually there were Manchu, Mongol, and Chinese banners, eight for each ethnic group. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were actually of Manchu ancestry. The [[Qing conquest of the Ming|Manchu conquest of the Ming dynasty]] was thus achieved with a multiethnic army led by Manchu nobles and Han Chinese generals. Han Chinese soldiers were organised into the Army of the Green Standard, which became a sort of imperial constabulary force posted throughout China and on the frontiers.\n\nThe change of the name from Jurchen to Manchu was made to hide the fact that the ancestors of the Manchus, the Jianzhou Jurchens, were ruled by the Chinese.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hummel |editor1-first=Arthur W. |chapter=Abahai |title=Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period, 1644-1912 (2 vols) |date=2010 |publisher=Global Oriental |isbn=978-9004218017 |page=2 |edition=reprint |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_V5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&#v=onepage&qf=false}} [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/ABAHAI.html Via Dartmouth.edu]</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Grossnick |first1=Roy A. |title=Early Manchu Recruitment of Chinese Scholar-officials |date=1972 |publisher=University of Wisconsin--Madison |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RpdRAAAAMAAJ&q=In+1635,+doubtless+on+the+advice+of+his+Chinese+councilors,+Abahai+forbade+the+use+of+the+names,&dq=In+1635,+doubtless+on+the+advice+of+his+Chinese+councilors,+Abahai+forbade+the+use+of+the+names,}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Till |first1=Barry |title=The Manchu era (1644-1912): arts of China's last imperial dynasty |date=2004 |publisher=Art Gallery of Greater Victoria |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XUVJAQAAIAAJ&q=In+1635,+doubtless+on+the+advice+of+his+Chinese+councilors,+Abahai+forbade+the+use+of+the+names,&dq=In+1635,+doubtless+on+the+advice+of+his+Chinese+councilors,+Abahai+forbade+the+use+of+the+names,}}</ref> The Qing dynasty carefully hid the 2 original editions of the books of \"''Qing Taizu Wu Huangdi Shilu''\" and the \"''Manzhou Shilu Tu''\" (Taizu Shilu Tu) in the Qing palace, forbidden from public view because they showed that the Manchu Aisin Gioro family had been ruled by the Ming dynasty.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hummel |editor1-first=Arthur W. |chapter=Nurhaci |title=Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period, 1644-1912 (2 vols) |date=2010 |publisher=Global Oriental |isbn=978-9004218017 |page=598 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_V5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA598#v=onepage&q&f=false |edition=reprint}} [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/NURHACI.html Via Dartmouth.edu]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Augustan, Volumes 17-20 |date=1975 |publisher=Augustan Society |page=34 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Oh9ZAAAAMAAJ&q=They+reveal+the+real+origin+of+the+Aisin+Gioro+family&dq=They+reveal+the+real+origin+of+the+Aisin+Gioro+family}}</ref> In the Ming period, the Koreans of [[Joseon]] referred to the Jurchen inhabited lands north of the Korean peninsula, above the rivers Yalu and Tumen to be part of Ming China, as the \"superior country\" (sangguk) which they called Ming China.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kim |first1=Sun Joo |title=The Northern Region of Korea: History, Identity, and Culture |date=2011 |publisher=University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0295802176 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KcYthUKyeS0C&pg=PA19}}</ref> The Qing deliberately excluded references and information that showed the Jurchens (Manchus) as subservient to the Ming dynasty, from the [[History of Ming]] to hide their former subservient relationship to the Ming.

The House of Aisin Gioro ruled [[China proper]] from 1644 until the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911\u20131912, which established a [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|republican government]] in its place. The word ''aisin'' means ''gold'' in the [[Manchu language]], and \"gioro\" is the name of the Aisin Gioro's [[Ancestral home (Chinese)|ancestral home]] in present-day [[Yilan, Heilongjiang|Yilan]], [[Heilongjiang|Heilongjiang Province]]. In Manchu custom, families are identified first by their ''hala'' (\u54c8\u62c9), i.e. their family or clan name, and then by ''muk\u016bn'' (\u7a46\u6606), the more detailed classification, typically referring to individual families. In the case of Aisin Gioro, Aisin is the ''muk\u016bn'', and Gioro is the ''hala''. Other members of the Gioro clan include [[Irgen Gioro]] (\u4f0a\u723e\u6839\u89ba\u7f85), \u0160u\u0161u Gioro (\u8212\u8212\u89ba\u7f85) and Sirin Gioro (\u897f\u6797\u89ba\u7f85).\n\nThe [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] (''jin'' means gold in Chinese) of the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], ancestors of the Manchus, was known as ''aisin gurun'', and the Qing dynasty was initially named ([[File:amaga aisin gurun1.png|40px]]) ''amaga aisin gurun,'' or the [[Later Jin (1616\u20131636)|Later Jin dynasty]]. Since the fall of the Qing Empire, a number of members of the family have changed their surnames to ''[[Jin (Chinese surname)|Jin]]'' ({{zh|c=\u91d1}}) since it has the same meaning as \"Aisin\". For example, [[Puyi]]'s younger brother changed his name from Aisin Gioro Puren (\u611b\u65b0\u89ba\u7f85\u6ea5\u4efb) to [[Jin Youzhi]] (\u91d1\u53cb\u4e4b) and his children in turn adopt ''Jin'' as their family name.\n\n==Family generation names==\nBefore the founding of the [[Qing dynasty]], the naming of children in the Aisin Gioro clan was essentially arbitrary and followed no particular rules. The [[Manchu people]] originally did not use [[generation name]]s before they moved into China proper; prior to the [[Shunzhi Emperor|Shunzhi era]], children of the imperial clan were given only a Manchu name, for example [[Dorgon]].<ref>{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|quote=In the beginning, among the first couple of generations, Manchu men had polysyllabic personal names (e.g., Nurhaci) that in their native language may have been meaningful but when transliterated by sound into Chinese characters were gibberish; furthermore, they did not arrange their personal names in generational order, as Han often did.|location=|isbn=978-0-295-98040-9|page=55|title=Manchus & Han: ethnic relations and political power in late Qing and early republican China, 1861-1928|edition=reprint, illustrated|author=Edward J.

The Manchus were not so careful about this sort of thing... The Chinese practice of using the same first character for the given names of children of same generation was initially adopted during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. The children of Kangxi all sported the same prefix-character, yin (written \"in\" in Manchu), and every generation afterward was marked by the same initial character (or, in Manchu, the same initial sounds) in the given name. While some Manchu families followed suit, many others did not, or did so inconsistently: for example, the brother of an early-eighteenth-century general, Erentei, was named Torio, while the Xi'an general Cangseli named his son Cangyung, using the same sound, \"cang\" (\"chang\" in Chinese), for his and the following generation.|location=|page=244|title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Mark C.

By the time of the Guangxu emperor (r. 1875-1908), all the males of his generation in the imperial clan had the character zai in their personal names, such as Zaitian (the emperor), Zaifeng (1883-1952; his brother and future regent), and Zaizhen (1876-1948; his cousin). By contrast, the previous generation had used the character yi (e.g., Yikuang, Yixin, and Yihuan), while the following generation used the character pu (e.g., the future Xuantong emperor Puyi [1906-67] and his brother Pujie [1907-94]).|location=|page=55|title=Manchus & Han: ethnic relations and political power in late Qing and early republican China, 1861-1928|edition=reprint, illustrated|author=Edward J. M. Rhoads}}</ref> During the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], all of the emperor's sons were to be named with a [[generation name|generation prefix]] preceding the given name. There were three characters initially used, ''Cheng'' (\u627f), ''Bao'' (\u4fdd) and ''Chang'' (\u9577), before finally settling on ''Yin'' (\u80e4) over a decade into the Kangxi era. The generation prefix of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]]'s sons switched from ''Fu'' (\u798f) to ''Hong'' (\u5f18). Following the Yongzheng Emperor, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] decreed that all subsequent male offspring would have a generation prefix placed in their name according to a \"generation poem\", for which he composed the first four characters, ''Yong Mian Yi Zai'' (\u6c38\u7dbf\u5955\u8f09). Moreover, direct descendants of the emperor will often share a similar [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]] or meaning in the final character. A common radical was shared in the second character of the first name of princes who were in line to the throne, however, princes who were not in line to the throne did not necessarily share the radical in their name.<ref>{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|quote=In a further refinement of the generational principle, the second character in the personal name of each person in the direct line of succession contained a radical that distinguished these name from all others of their generation in the imperial clan.

Nurhachi created large, permanent civil-military units called \"[[Eight Banners|banners]]\" to replace the small hunting groups used in his early campaigns. A banner was composed of smaller companies; it included some 7,500 warriors and their households, including slaves, under the command of a chieftain. Each banner was identified by a coloured flag that was yellow, white, blue, or red, either plain or with a border design. Originally there were four, then eight, Manchu banners; new banners were created as the Manchu conquered new regions, and eventually there were Manchu, Mongol, and Chinese banners, eight for each ethnic group. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were actually of Manchu ancestry. The [[Qing conquest of the Ming|Manchu conquest of the Ming dynasty]] was thus achieved with a multiethnic army led by Manchu nobles and Han Chinese generals. Han Chinese soldiers were organised into the Army of the Green Standard, which became a sort of imperial constabulary force posted throughout China and on the frontiers.\n\nThe change of the name from Jurchen to Manchu was made to hide the fact that the ancestors of the Manchus, the Jianzhou Jurchens, were ruled by the Chinese.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hummel |editor1-first=Arthur W. |chapter=Abahai |title=Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period, 1644-1912 (2 vols) |date=2010 |publisher=Global Oriental |isbn=978-9004218017 |page=2 |edition=reprint |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_V5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&#v=onepage&qf=false}} [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/ABAHAI.html Via Dartmouth.edu]</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Grossnick |first1=Roy A. |title=Early Manchu Recruitment of Chinese Scholar-officials |date=1972 |publisher=University of Wisconsin--Madison |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RpdRAAAAMAAJ&q=In+1635,+doubtless+on+the+advice+of+his+Chinese+councilors,+Abahai+forbade+the+use+of+the+names,&dq=In+1635,+doubtless+on+the+advice+of+his+Chinese+councilors,+Abahai+forbade+the+use+of+the+names,}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Till |first1=Barry |title=The Manchu era (1644-1912): arts of China's last imperial dynasty |date=2004 |publisher=Art Gallery of Greater Victoria |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XUVJAQAAIAAJ&q=In+1635,+doubtless+on+the+advice+of+his+Chinese+councilors,+Abahai+forbade+the+use+of+the+names,&dq=In+1635,+doubtless+on+the+advice+of+his+Chinese+councilors,+Abahai+forbade+the+use+of+the+names,}}</ref> The Qing dynasty carefully hid the 2 original editions of the books of \"''Qing Taizu Wu Huangdi Shilu''\" and the \"''Manzhou Shilu Tu''\" (Taizu Shilu Tu) in the Qing palace, forbidden from public view because they showed that the Manchu Aisin Gioro family had been ruled by the Ming dynasty.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hummel |editor1-first=Arthur W. |chapter=Nurhaci |title=Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period, 1644-1912 (2 vols) |date=2010 |publisher=Global Oriental |isbn=978-9004218017 |page=598 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_V5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA598#v=onepage&q&f=false |edition=reprint}} [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/NURHACI.html Via Dartmouth.edu]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Augustan, Volumes 17-20 |date=1975 |publisher=Augustan Society |page=34 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Oh9ZAAAAMAAJ&q=They+reveal+the+real+origin+of+the+Aisin+Gioro+family&dq=They+reveal+the+real+origin+of+the+Aisin+Gioro+family}}</ref> In the Ming period, the Koreans of [[Joseon]] referred to the Jurchen inhabited lands north of the Korean peninsula, above the rivers Yalu and Tumen to be part of Ming China, as the \"superior country\" (sangguk) which they called Ming China.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kim |first1=Sun Joo |title=The Northern Region of Korea: History, Identity, and Culture |date=2011 |publisher=University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0295802176 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KcYthUKyeS0C&pg=PA19}}</ref> The Qing deliberately excluded references and information that showed the Jurchens (Manchus) as subservient to the Ming dynasty, from the [[History of Ming]] to hide their former subservient relationship to the Ming.

However, there were 12 princes who were awarded the [[Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty#Rule of inheritance|''shi xi wang ti'' (perpetual heritability, a.k.a. \"iron-cap\")]] privilege, which meant that their titles can be passed on to subsequent generations without the downgrading effect.\n\nThe 12 \"iron-cap\" princely peerages are listed as follows.
