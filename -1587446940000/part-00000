It is actuated by controlling the environmental temperature and by positioning a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] tip.\n\nAnother definition{{whose?|date=June 2019}} is a robot that allows precise interactions with nanoscale objects, or can manipulate with [[nanoscale]] resolution. Such devices are more related to [[microscopy]] or [[scanning probe microscopy]], instead of the description of nanorobots as [[molecular machines]]. Using the microscopy definition, even a large apparatus such as an [[atomic force microscope]] can be considered a nanorobotic instrument when configured to perform nanomanipulation. For this viewpoint, macroscale robots or microrobots that can move with nanoscale precision can also be considered nanorobots.\n\n==Nanorobotics theory==\n\n[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]].]]\nAccording to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micro-machines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) \"''[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the surgeon]]''\".

These nano-robot swarms, both those unable to [[Self-replicating machine|replicate]] (as in [[utility fog]]) and those able to replicate unconstrained in the natural environment (as in [[grey goo]] and [[synthetic biology]]), are found in many science fiction stories, such as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] [[Nanoprobe (Star Trek)|nano-probes]] in ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' episode \"[[The New Breed (The Outer Limits)|The New Breed]]\".\nSome proponents of nano-robotics, in reaction to the [[grey goo]] scenarios that they earlier helped to propagate, hold the view that nano-robots able to replicate outside of a restricted factory environment do not form a necessary part of a purported productive nanotechnology, and that the process of self-replication, were it ever to be developed, could be made inherently safe. They further assert that their current plans for developing and using molecular manufacturing do not in fact include free-foraging replicators.<ref>\n[http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/selfRep.html Zyvex: \"Self replication and nanotechnology\"]\n\"artificial self replicating systems will only function in carefully controlled artificial environments\n...\nWhile self replicating systems are the key to low cost, there is no need (and little desire) to have such systems function in the outside world. Instead, in an artificial and controlled environment, they can manufacture simpler and more rugged systems that can then be transferred to their final destination. ... The resulting medical device will be simpler, smaller, more efficient and more precisely designed for the task at hand than a device designed to perform the same function and self replicate. ... A single device able to do [both] would be harder to design and less efficient.\"\n</ref><ref>\n[http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/ \"Foresight Guidelines for Responsible Nanotechnology Development\"]\n\"Autonomous self-replicating assemblers are not necessary to achieve significant manufacturing capabilities.\"\n\"The simplest, most efficient, and safest approach to productive nanosystems is to make specialized nanoscale tools and put them together in factories big enough to make what is needed. ... The machines in this would work like the conveyor belts and assembly robots in a factory, doing similar jobs. If you pulled one of these machines out of the system, it would pose no risk, and be as inert as a light bulb pulled from its socket.\"\n</ref>\n\nA detailed theoretical discussion of nanorobotics, including specific design issues such as sensing, power communication, [[navigation]], manipulation, locomotion, and onboard computation, has been presented in the medical context of [[nanomedicine]] by [[Robert Freitas]].<ref>R.A.

Nanoscale 3D printing involves many of the same process, incorporated at a much smaller scale. To print a structure in the 5-400&nbsp;\u00b5m scale, the precision of the 3D printing machine needs to be improved greatly. A two-step process of 3D printing, using a 3D printing and laser etched plates method was incorporated as an improvement technique.<ref name=\"nanoseoul\">{{Citation|title=Nano Robot by 3D Printing (Seoul National University, Korea).wmv |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2015-12-04 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4IavKUzK2c}}</ref> To be more precise at a nanoscale, the 3D printing process uses a laser etching machine, which etches the details needed for the segments of nanorobots into each plate. The plate is then transferred to the 3D printer, which fills the etched regions with the desired nanoparticle. The 3D printing process is repeated until the nanorobot is built from the bottom up. This 3D printing process has many benefits. First, it increases the overall accuracy of the printing process.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Second, it has the potential to create functional segments of a nanorobot.<ref name=\"nanoseoul\" /> The 3D printer uses a liquid resin, which is hardened at precisely the correct spots by a focused laser beam. The focal point of the laser beam is guided through the resin by movable mirrors and leaves behind a hardened line of solid polymer, just a few hundred nanometers wide. This fine resolution enables the creation of intricately structured sculptures as tiny as a grain of sand. This process takes place by using photoactive resins, which are hardened by the laser at an extremely small scale to create the structure. This process is quick by nanoscale 3D printing standards. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. This approach uses a focused laser to trace the desired 3D object into a block of gel. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100&nbsp;nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts.<ref>{{Cite web|title= Nanotechnology and 3D-printing|url= http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=37541.php|website= www.nanowerk.com|accessdate= 2015-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==Potential uses==\n\n===Nanomedicine===\n{{Main|Nanomedicine}}\n\nPotential uses for nanorobotics in [[medicine]] include early diagnosis and targeted drug-delivery for [[cancer]],<ref name=\"NCI\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070223180114/http://nano.cancer.gov/resource_center/sci_biblio_enabled-therapeutics_abstracts.asp Nanotechnology in Cancer]. nano.cancer.gov</ref><ref name=\"PhysOrg\">Zyga, Lisa (December 5, 2007) [http://www.physorg.com/news116071209.html \"Virtual 3D nanorobots could lead to real cancer-fighting technology\"].

It is actuated by controlling the environmental temperature and by positioning a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] tip.\n\nAnother definition{{whose?|date=June 2019}} is a robot that allows precise interactions with nanoscale objects, or can manipulate with [[nanoscale]] resolution. Such devices are more related to [[microscopy]] or [[scanning probe microscopy]], instead of the description of nanorobots as [[molecular machines]]. Using the microscopy definition, even a large apparatus such as an [[atomic force microscope]] can be considered a nanorobotic instrument when configured to perform nanomanipulation. For this viewpoint, macroscale robots or microrobots that can move with nanoscale precision can also be considered nanorobots.\n\n==Nanorobotics theory==\n\n[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]].]]\nAccording to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micro-machines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) \"''[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the surgeon]]''\".

These nano-robot swarms, both those unable to [[Self-replicating machine|replicate]] (as in [[utility fog]]) and those able to replicate unconstrained in the natural environment (as in [[grey goo]] and [[synthetic biology]]), are found in many science fiction stories, such as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] [[Nanoprobe (Star Trek)|nano-probes]] in ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' episode \"[[The New Breed (The Outer Limits)|The New Breed]]\".\nSome proponents of nano-robotics, in reaction to the [[grey goo]] scenarios that they earlier helped to propagate, hold the view that nano-robots able to replicate outside of a restricted factory environment do not form a necessary part of a purported productive nanotechnology, and that the process of self-replication, were it ever to be developed, could be made inherently safe. They further assert that their current plans for developing and using molecular manufacturing do not in fact include free-foraging replicators.<ref>\n[http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/selfRep.html Zyvex: \"Self replication and nanotechnology\"]\n\"artificial self replicating systems will only function in carefully controlled artificial environments\n...\nWhile self replicating systems are the key to low cost, there is no need (and little desire) to have such systems function in the outside world. Instead, in an artificial and controlled environment, they can manufacture simpler and more rugged systems that can then be transferred to their final destination. ... The resulting medical device will be simpler, smaller, more efficient and more precisely designed for the task at hand than a device designed to perform the same function and self replicate. ... A single device able to do [both] would be harder to design and less efficient.\"\n</ref><ref>\n[http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/ \"Foresight Guidelines for Responsible Nanotechnology Development\"]\n\"Autonomous self-replicating assemblers are not necessary to achieve significant manufacturing capabilities.\"\n\"The simplest, most efficient, and safest approach to productive nanosystems is to make specialized nanoscale tools and put them together in factories big enough to make what is needed. ...

Nanoscale 3D printing involves many of the same process, incorporated at a much smaller scale. To print a structure in the 5-400&nbsp;\u00b5m scale, the precision of the 3D printing machine needs to be improved greatly. A two-step process of 3D printing, using a 3D printing and laser etched plates method was incorporated as an improvement technique.<ref name=\"nanoseoul\">{{Citation|title=Nano Robot by 3D Printing (Seoul National University, Korea).wmv |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2015-12-04 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4IavKUzK2c}}</ref> To be more precise at a nanoscale, the 3D printing process uses a laser etching machine, which etches the details needed for the segments of nanorobots into each plate. The plate is then transferred to the 3D printer, which fills the etched regions with the desired nanoparticle. The 3D printing process is repeated until the nanorobot is built from the bottom up. This 3D printing process has many benefits. First, it increases the overall accuracy of the printing process.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Second, it has the potential to create functional segments of a nanorobot.<ref name=\"nanoseoul\" /> The 3D printer uses a liquid resin, which is hardened at precisely the correct spots by a focused laser beam. The focal point of the laser beam is guided through the resin by movable mirrors and leaves behind a hardened line of solid polymer, just a few hundred nanometers wide. This fine resolution enables the creation of intricately structured sculptures as tiny as a grain of sand. This process takes place by using photoactive resins, which are hardened by the laser at an extremely small scale to create the structure. This process is quick by nanoscale 3D printing standards. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. This approach uses a focused laser to trace the desired 3D object into a block of gel. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100&nbsp;nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts.<ref>{{Cite web|title= Nanotechnology and 3D-printing|url= http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=37541.php|website= www.nanowerk.com|accessdate= 2015-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==Potential uses==\n\n===Nanomedicine===\n{{Main|Nanomedicine}}\n\nPotential uses for nanorobotics in [[medicine]] include early diagnosis and targeted drug-delivery for [[cancer]],<ref name=\"NCI\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070223180114/http://nano.cancer.gov/resource_center/sci_biblio_enabled-therapeutics_abstracts.asp Nanotechnology in Cancer]. nano.cancer.gov</ref><ref name=\"PhysOrg\">Zyga, Lisa (December 5, 2007) [http://www.physorg.com/news116071209.html \"Virtual 3D nanorobots could lead to real cancer-fighting technology\"].

While not originally fitted with air-conditioning, most of the cars were fitted with air conditioning from 1975. The bogies of the trailer cars were changed from TR201 to TR212 for the cars built from 1968. Cars fitted with TR212 bogies feature disc brakes, because they needed to run on higher speeds on the J\u014dban and Hanwa Lines.\n* KuMoHa 103: 1-155\n* MoHa 103: 1-278\n* MoHa 102: 1-433\n* KuHa 103: 1-177 & 501-638 (TR212 bogies fitted: 115-177 & 617-638)\n* SaHa 103: 1-305 (TR212 bogies fitted: 226-305)\n\n====Air-conditioned prototype====\nThis single 10-car unit was built in 1970.

In 2000, four cars were scrapped at the Narashino Depot; the remaining six cars were scrapped at Keiy\u014d Rolling Stock Center in 2005.\n* MoHa 103: 279-281\n* MoHa 102: 434-436\n* KuHa 103: 178-179\n* SaHa 103: 306-307\n\n====Sets without air-conditioning====\nBuilt during 1972 and 1973, these units were similar to the air-conditioned prototype but without air-conditioning. This type was used mainly in Osaka area.

The cars were withdrawn from service between 1988 and 1991.\n* Moha 103: 901-902\n* Moha 102: 901-902\n* Kuha 103: 901-904\n\n====Standard series====\nThese were built between 1964 and 1970. While not originally fitted with air-conditioning, most of the cars were fitted with air conditioning from 1975. The bogies of the trailer cars were changed from TR201 to TR212 for the cars built from 1968. Cars fitted with TR212 bogies feature disc brakes, because they needed to run on higher speeds on the J\u014dban and Hanwa Lines.\n* KuMoHa 103: 1-155\n* MoHa 103: 1-278\n* MoHa 102: 1-433\n* KuHa 103: 1-177 & 501-638 (TR212 bogies fitted: 115-177 & 617-638)\n* SaHa 103: 1-305 (TR212 bogies fitted: 226-305)\n\n====Air-conditioned prototype====\nThis single 10-car unit was built in 1970. It was equipped with various air conditioning units and tested on the [[Yamanote Line]] in Tokyo. It was subsequently modified to become a standard air-conditioned set in 1978. In 2000, four cars were scrapped at the Narashino Depot; the remaining six cars were scrapped at Keiy\u014d Rolling Stock Center in 2005.\n* MoHa 103: 279-281\n* MoHa 102: 434-436\n* KuHa 103: 178-179\n* SaHa 103: 306-307\n\n====Sets without air-conditioning====\nBuilt during 1972 and 1973, these units were similar to the air-conditioned prototype but without air-conditioning. This type was used mainly in Osaka area. Most cars were fitted with air-conditioning from 1976.\n* MoHa 103: 282-330 & 364-374\n* MoHa 102: 437-486 & 520-530\n* KuHa 103: 180-212\n* SaHa 103: 308-323\n\n====Air-conditioned sets====\nBuilt in 1973, they were similar to the air-conditioned prototype. They were fitted with motorized destination blinds on both sides.\n* MoHa 103: 331-413 (excluding 364-374)\n* MoHa 102: 487-569 (excluding 520-530)\n* KuHa 103: 213-268\n* SaHa 103: 324-359\n\n====ATC equipped sets====\nBuilt between 1974 and 1980. The front end design was changed with the driver's cab raised so that an [[Automatic Train Control|ATC]] signalling system could be included.

The order to design the submarine was issued in 1966 and design was completed in 1974. The keel was laid down on 22 April 1978 at [[Severodvinsk]]. ''K-278'' was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 3 June 1983 and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 28 December 1983.\n\n''K-278'' had a double hull, the inner one being composed of [[titanium]], which gave her an operating depth far greater than that of the best American submarines.<ref name=\"Montgomery\">George Montgomery: [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/95unclass/Montgomery.html ''The Komsomolets Disaster.''] 1994, posted as [[CIA]] Report 14 April 2007.</ref> The pressure hull was composed of seven compartments with the second and third protected by stronger forward and aft bulkheads creating a \"safety zone\" in case of an emergency. An [[escape capsule]] was fitted in the [[sail (submarine)|sail]] above these compartments to enable the crew to abandon ship in the event of an underwater emergency. Initial Western intelligence estimates of ''K-278'''s speed were based on the assumption that it was powered by a pair of [[liquid metal cooled reactor|liquid-metal lead-bismuth]] reactors. When the [[Soviet Union]] revealed that the submarine used a single OK-650b-3 conventional [[pressurized water reactor|pressurized-water reactor]], these speed estimates were lowered.<ref group=Note>The [[OK-650 reactor]] was also installed on Project 971 (Akula), Project 945 (Sierra), and in pairs on the Project 941 (Typhoon) submarines.</ref>\n\n==Crew==\nAccording to Norman Polmar and Kenneth J. Moore, two Western experts on Soviet submarine design and operations, the Project 685's advanced design included many automated systems which, in turn, allowed for fewer crew members than would be expected for a submarine of its size. The manning table approved by the [[Soviet Ministry of Defense]] in 1982 called for a crew of just 57 men. This was later increased to 64: 30 officers, 22 warrant officers, and 12 petty officers and seamen.<ref>Norman Polmar, and Kenneth J.

A additional number succumbed to inhalation of toxic gases aboard the rescue ship.<ref name=ACT/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn addition to her eight standard torpedoes ''K-278'' was carrying two torpedoes armed with nuclear warheads. Under pressure from Norway, the [[Soviet Union]] used [[Mir (submersible)|deep sea submersibles]] operated from the oceanographic research ship ''[[Akademik Mstislav Keldysh|Keldysh]]'' to search for ''K-278''. In June 1989, two months after the sinking, the wreck was located. Soviet officials stated that any possible leaks were insignificant and posed no threat to the environment.\n\nIn 1993, Vice Admiral (ret.) Chernov, commander of the submarine group of which the ''Komsomolets'' was part, founded the [[Komsomolets Nuclear Submarine Memorial Society|''Komsomolets'' Nuclear Submarine Memorial Society]], a charity to support the widows and orphans of his former command. Since then, the Society's charter has expanded to provide assistance to the families of all Soviet and Russian submariners lost at sea. 7 April has become a day of commemoration for all submariners lost at sea.\n\nAn expedition in mid-1994 revealed some [[plutonium]] leakage from one of the two nuclear-armed torpedoes. On 24 June 1995, ''Keldysh'' set out again from St. Petersburg to the ''Komsomolets'' datum to seal the hull fractures in Compartment 1 and cover the nuclear warheads, and declared success at the end of a subsequent expedition in July 1996. Furfurol, the jelly-like sealant, was projected to make the wreck radiation safe for 20 to 30 years, that is, until 2015 or 2025.<ref>Matthew Bodner: [https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2014/11/14/soviet-nuclear-submarine-wrecks-at-bottom-of-arctic-ocean-video-a41348 ''Soviet Nuclear Submarine Wrecks at Bottom of Arctic Ocean.''] The Moscow Times, 14 Nov. 2014.</ref>\n\nNorwegian authorities from the Marine Environmental Agency and Radiation Agency are taking water and ground samples from the vicinity of the wreck on a yearly basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imr.no/nyhetsarkiv/2008/august/atomubaten_komsomolets_radioaktiv/nb-no |last=Michalsen |first=Kathrine |title=Sjekker atomub\u00e5ten \"Komsomolets\" for radioaktiv lekkasje |publisher=Havforskningsinstituttet |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2019-01-16}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2019, a joint Norwegian-Russian expedition took water samples out of a ventilation pipe and from several meters above, and analyzed them for caesium-137. That pipe had been identified as a leak in several [[Mir (submersible)|Mir]] missions up to 1998 and 2007. The activity levels in the six samples out of the pipe ranged between less than (the on-board [[detection limit]] of) 10 [[Becquerel|Bq]]/l to 100 Bq/l (on 8 July) and 800 Bq/l (9 July).

Because of the loss of life, a public enquiry was conducted and, as a result, many formerly classified details were revealed by the Soviet news media.{{Citation needed lead|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe wrecked submarine is on the floor of the [[Barents Sea]], about 1.7&nbsp;km (1 mile) deep, with its nuclear reactor and two nuclear warhead-armed torpedoes still on board.\n\n==Design==\nThe Project 685 was designed by the Rubin Design Bureau in response to a challenge to develop an advanced submarine that could carry a mix of torpedoes and cruise missiles with conventional or nuclear warheads. The order to design the submarine was issued in 1966 and design was completed in 1974. The keel was laid down on 22 April 1978 at [[Severodvinsk]]. ''K-278'' was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 3 June 1983 and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 28 December 1983.\n\n''K-278'' had a double hull, the inner one being composed of [[titanium]], which gave her an operating depth far greater than that of the best American submarines.<ref name=\"Montgomery\">George Montgomery: [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/95unclass/Montgomery.html ''The Komsomolets Disaster.''] 1994, posted as [[CIA]] Report 14 April 2007.</ref> The pressure hull was composed of seven compartments with the second and third protected by stronger forward and aft bulkheads creating a \"safety zone\" in case of an emergency. An [[escape capsule]] was fitted in the [[sail (submarine)|sail]] above these compartments to enable the crew to abandon ship in the event of an underwater emergency. Initial Western intelligence estimates of ''K-278'''s speed were based on the assumption that it was powered by a pair of [[liquid metal cooled reactor|liquid-metal lead-bismuth]] reactors. When the [[Soviet Union]] revealed that the submarine used a single OK-650b-3 conventional [[pressurized water reactor|pressurized-water reactor]], these speed estimates were lowered.<ref group=Note>The [[OK-650 reactor]] was also installed on Project 971 (Akula), Project 945 (Sierra), and in pairs on the Project 941 (Typhoon) submarines.</ref>\n\n==Crew==\nAccording to Norman Polmar and Kenneth J. Moore, two Western experts on Soviet submarine design and operations, the Project 685's advanced design included many automated systems which, in turn, allowed for fewer crew members than would be expected for a submarine of its size. The manning table approved by the [[Soviet Ministry of Defense]] in 1982 called for a crew of just 57 men. This was later increased to 64: 30 officers, 22 warrant officers, and 12 petty officers and seamen.<ref>Norman Polmar, and Kenneth J.

The reactor [[scram]]med and propulsion was lost. Electrical problems spread as cables burned through, and control of the boat was threatened. An emergency [[ballast tank]] blow was performed and the submarine surfaced eleven minutes after the fire began. Distress calls were made, and most of the crew abandoned ship.\n\nThe fire continued to burn, fed by the [[compressed air]] system.

Only one of the five to reach the surface was able to leave the capsule and survive before it sank again in the rough seas.\n\n[[Air-sea rescue|Rescue aircraft]] arrived quickly and dropped small rafts, but winds and sea conditions precluded their use.

A additional number succumbed to inhalation of toxic gases aboard the rescue ship.<ref name=ACT/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn addition to her eight standard torpedoes ''K-278'' was carrying two torpedoes armed with nuclear warheads. Under pressure from Norway, the [[Soviet Union]] used [[Mir (submersible)|deep sea submersibles]] operated from the oceanographic research ship ''[[Akademik Mstislav Keldysh|Keldysh]]'' to search for ''K-278''. In June 1989, two months after the sinking, the wreck was located. Soviet officials stated that any possible leaks were insignificant and posed no threat to the environment.\n\nIn 1993, Vice Admiral (ret.) Chernov, commander of the submarine group of which the ''Komsomolets'' was part, founded the [[Komsomolets Nuclear Submarine Memorial Society|''Komsomolets'' Nuclear Submarine Memorial Society]], a charity to support the widows and orphans of his former command. Since then, the Society's charter has expanded to provide assistance to the families of all Soviet and Russian submariners lost at sea. 7 April has become a day of commemoration for all submariners lost at sea.\n\nAn expedition in mid-1994 revealed some [[plutonium]] leakage from one of the two nuclear-armed torpedoes. On 24 June 1995, ''Keldysh'' set out again from St. Petersburg to the ''Komsomolets'' datum to seal the hull fractures in Compartment 1 and cover the nuclear warheads, and declared success at the end of a subsequent expedition in July 1996. Furfurol, the jelly-like sealant, was projected to make the wreck radiation safe for 20 to 30 years, that is, until 2015 or 2025.<ref>Matthew Bodner: [https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2014/11/14/soviet-nuclear-submarine-wrecks-at-bottom-of-arctic-ocean-video-a41348 ''Soviet Nuclear Submarine Wrecks at Bottom of Arctic Ocean.''] The Moscow Times, 14 Nov. 2014.</ref>\n\nNorwegian authorities from the Marine Environmental Agency and Radiation Agency are taking water and ground samples from the vicinity of the wreck on a yearly basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imr.no/nyhetsarkiv/2008/august/atomubaten_komsomolets_radioaktiv/nb-no |last=Michalsen |first=Kathrine |title=Sjekker atomub\u00e5ten \"Komsomolets\" for radioaktiv lekkasje |publisher=Havforskningsinstituttet |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2019-01-16}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2019, a joint Norwegian-Russian expedition took water samples out of a ventilation pipe and from several meters above, and analyzed them for caesium-137. That pipe had been identified as a leak in several [[Mir (submersible)|Mir]] missions up to 1998 and 2007. The activity levels in the six samples out of the pipe ranged between less than (the on-board [[detection limit]] of) 10 [[Becquerel|Bq]]/l to 100 Bq/l (on 8 July) and 800 Bq/l (9 July). No activity could be detected in the free-water samples. Due to dilution, there is no threat to the environment. The Norwegian limit on caesium-137 in food products is 600 Bq/kg. The background activity of caesium-137 in the water body is as low as 0.001 Bq/l. More sensitive measurements of the samples are underway.<ref>Hilde Elise Heldal, Stine Hommedal: [https://www.hi.no/en/hi/news/2019/july/researchers-discovered-leak-from-komsomolets ''Researchers discovered leak from Komsomolets.''] Institute of Marine Research, 10 July 2019, updates 11 July and 29 August 2019, and personal communication 29 August 2019.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of sunken nuclear submarines]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050217030152/http://www.bellona.no/en/10118.html Project 685 (Plavnik) \u2013 Mike Class]\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/685.htm GlobalSecurity article]\n* [https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/row/rus/685.htm Federation of American Scientists]\n* [http://ship.bsu.by/main.asp?id=101188 \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050207144612/http://submarine.id.ru/memory/K278.htm \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u2013 K-278]\n* [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969797001058 The Sunken Nuclear Submarine Komsomolets and its effects on the Environment (by Steinar H\u00f8ibr\u00e5ten, Per E.
