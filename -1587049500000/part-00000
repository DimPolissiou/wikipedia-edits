After the end of [[World War II]], his father was expelled from Austria. The family found a new home in [[Kempten im Allg\u00e4u]], [[Bavaria]]. Furrer stayed there until he joined the [[University of Kiel]] to study physics. He later transferred to the [[Free University of Berlin]], where he received a [[diploma]] in 1969, and a [[doctorate]] in 1972. During his time as a student in Berlin, he was involved in the building of the 145 m long \"[[Tunnel 57]]\" below the [[Berlin Wall]], which was the escape route of 57 people from East Berlin to the West.\n\nIn 1974 he became assistant professor in [[Stuttgart]] and in 1979 qualified for full professorship. He spent time during 1980\u20131981 at the [[University of Chicago]] and during 1981 at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in [[Chicago]], USA.\n\nIn 1977 Furrer applied for selection as an astronaut for the first [[Spacelab]] mission. He made it into the final round of candidates, although [[Ulf Merbold]] was finally selected. In 1982, the astronauts for the first German Spacelab mission were selected from the finalists for the first mission, and Furrer was one of the two chosen. He was a payload specialist on [[STS-61-A]] (D1), which was launched on 30 October 1985. The other payload specialists on the flight were [[Ernst Messerschmid]] and [[Wubbo Ockels]] (Netherlands).\n\nAfter his spaceflight he became a professor in 1987 as well as the Director of the Institute of Space Sciences at the Free University of Berlin.\n\nFurrer was an avid pilot. He earned his pilot license in 1974, doing several long-distance trips with one engine planes - including a flight over the inland ice of [[Greenland]] in 1979 and a solo flight from Germany to [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]] in 1981. His love for planes finally cost him his life, as he died in a plane crash during a flight show on the [[Johannisthal Air Field]] (Berlin). He was a passenger on a flight of the historic [[Messerschmitt Bf 108|Bf 108]] after the end of the official flight show when the pilot Gerd Kahdemann lost control of the plane shortly after 6:00&nbsp;p.m. \u2013 both Kahdemann and Furrer were killed instantly.\n\n== Checkpoint Charlie Museum ==\nFrom the files of the GDR State Security Service:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\nConcerning FURRER it is known that, as a member of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13th August e.V.

Scholars have adopted the term Levant to identify the region due to it being a \"wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus\" that does not have the \"political overtones\" of Syria-Palestine.{{efn|\"Nevertheless, despite such a well-reasoned basis for the identification of Levantine archaeology, the adoption of this term by many scholars has been, for the most part, simply the result of individual attempts to consider a wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus than that which is suggested by the use of terms like Canaan, Israel, or even Syria-Palestine. Regardless of the manner in which the term has come into common use, for a couple of additional reasons it seems clear that the Levant will remain the term of choice. In the first place scholars have shown a penchant for the term Levant, despite the fact that the term \u2018Syria-Palestine\u2019 has been advocated since the late 1970s. This is evident from the fact that no journal or series today has adopted a title that includes \u2018Syria-Palestine\u2019. However, the journal ''Levant'' has been published since 1969 and since 1990, ''\u00c4gypten und Levante'' has also attracted a plethora of papers relating to the archaeology of this region. Furthermore, a search through any electronic database of titles reveals an overwhelming adoption of the term \u2018Levant\u2019 when compared to \u2018Syria-Palestine\u2019 for archaeological studies. Undoubtedly, this is mostly due to the fact that \u2018Syria-Palestine\u2019 was a Roman administrative division of the Levant created by Hadrian (Millar 1993). The term \u2018Syria-Palestine\u2019 also carries political overtones that inadvertently evoke current efforts to establish a full-fledged Palestinian state. Scholars have recognized, therefore, that\u2014for at least the time being\u2014they can spare themselves further headaches by adopting the term Levant to identify this region\" {{harv|Burke|2010|p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}}<!--efn--> }}{{efn|\"At the beginning of this Introduction I have indicated how difficult it is to choose a general accepted name for the region this book deals with. In Europe we are used to the late Roman name 'Palestine,' and the designation 'Palestinian Archaeology' has a long history. According to Byzantine usage it included CisJordan and TransJordan and even Lebanon and Sinai. In modern times, however, the name 'Palestine' has exclusively become the political designation for a restricted area. Furthermore, in the period this book deals with a region called 'Palestine' did not yet exist. Also the ancient name 'Canaan' cannot be used as it refers to an older period in history. Designations as: 'The Land(s) of the Bible' or 'the Holy Land' evoke the suspicion of a theological bias. 'The Land of Israel' does not apply to the situation because it never included Lebanon or the greater part of modern Jordan. Therefore I have joined those who today advocate the designation 'Southern Levant.'

Scholars have adopted the term Levant to identify the region due to it being a \"wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus\" that does not have the \"political overtones\" of Syria-Palestine.{{efn|\"Nevertheless, despite such a well-reasoned basis for the identification of Levantine archaeology, the adoption of this term by many scholars has been, for the most part, simply the result of individual attempts to consider a wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus than that which is suggested by the use of terms like Canaan, Israel, or even Syria-Palestine. Regardless of the manner in which the term has come into common use, for a couple of additional reasons it seems clear that the Levant will remain the term of choice. In the first place scholars have shown a penchant for the term Levant, despite the fact that the term \u2018Syria-Palestine\u2019 has been advocated since the late 1970s. This is evident from the fact that no journal or series today has adopted a title that includes \u2018Syria-Palestine\u2019. However, the journal ''Levant'' has been published since 1969 and since 1990, ''\u00c4gypten und Levante'' has also attracted a plethora of papers relating to the archaeology of this region. Furthermore, a search through any electronic database of titles reveals an overwhelming adoption of the term \u2018Levant\u2019 when compared to \u2018Syria-Palestine\u2019 for archaeological studies. Undoubtedly, this is mostly due to the fact that \u2018Syria-Palestine\u2019 was a Roman administrative division of the Levant created by Hadrian (Millar 1993). The term \u2018Syria-Palestine\u2019 also carries political overtones that inadvertently evoke current efforts to establish a full-fledged Palestinian state. Scholars have recognized, therefore, that\u2014for at least the time being\u2014they can spare themselves further headaches by adopting the term Levant to identify this region\" {{harv|Burke|2010|p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}}<!--efn--> }}{{efn|\"At the beginning of this Introduction I have indicated how difficult it is to choose a general accepted name for the region this book deals with. In Europe we are used to the late Roman name 'Palestine,' and the designation 'Palestinian Archaeology' has a long history. According to Byzantine usage it included CisJordan and TransJordan and even Lebanon and Sinai. In modern times, however, the name 'Palestine' has exclusively become the political designation for a restricted area. Furthermore, in the period this book deals with a region called 'Palestine' did not yet exist. Also the ancient name 'Canaan' cannot be used as it refers to an older period in history. Designations as: 'The Land(s) of the Bible' or 'the Holy Land' evoke the suspicion of a theological bias. 'The Land of Israel' does not apply to the situation because it never included Lebanon or the greater part of modern Jordan.

They then pushed forward on the flank of the Chinese positions. At dawn an artillery duel began between the Japanese and Chinese that lasted about a half-hour. During the artillery barrage a Japanese regiment crept forward and launched a direct assault on the Chinese positions near the river, advancing in close order through fields of millet and corn with a barrage of fire from the Chinese trenches pouring onto them.<ref>Thompson, Larry Clinton, ''William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary''.

However, the Japanese victory on the west bank forced the Chinese to retreat, which they did in good order. The Chinese preserved most of their artillery by withdrawing it early in the battle, an action that, according to a [[United States War Department]] report, \"must have predisposed the rest of their army to its prompt retreat\".<ref name=\"War Department p. 571\">War Department, Adjutant General\u2019s Office, p. 571</ref>\n\nAbout 50 Chinese were killed in the battle.

It was the seventh number-one single on the newly formed chart. Following the success of their debut, the group signed with [[Imperial Records]]. Their next single, \"I Don't Need You Anymore\", reached number 91. They released several more recordings, including an album, ''The Teddy Bears Sing!'', but failed to reach the top 100 in US sales. The group disbanded in 1959.<ref name=bronson1992-46>Fred Bronson, ''The Billboard Book of Number One Hits'', Billboard Publications, 1992, p. 46</ref>\n\nWhile recording the Teddy Bears's album, Spector had met [[Lester Sill]], a former promotion man who was a mentor to [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]]. Sill and his partner, [[Lee Hazlewood]] supported Spector's next project, the Spectors Three. In 1960, Sill arranged for Spector to work as an apprentice to Leiber and Stoller in New York. Spector co-wrote the [[Ben E. King]] Top 10 hit \"[[Spanish Harlem (song)|Spanish Harlem]]\" with Jerry Leiber and also worked as a session musician, playing the guitar solo on [[the Drifters]]' song \"[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]\".\n\n=== 1960\u20131969: Record producer ===\nSpector's first true recording artist and project as producer was Ronnie Crawford. Spector's production work during this time included releases by [[LaVern Baker]], [[Ruth Brown]], and Billy Storm, as well as the Top Notes' original recording of \"[[Twist and Shout]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Godin|title=The Topnotes|url=http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/topnotes.htm|publisher=Soulful Kinda Music|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> Leiber and Stoller recommended Spector to produce [[Ray Peterson]]'s \"[[Corrine, Corrina]]\", which reached number 9 in January 1961. Later, he produced another major hit for [[Curtis Lee]], \"Pretty Little Angel Eyes\", which made it to number 7. Returning to Hollywood, Spector agreed to produce one of Lester Sill's acts. After both [[Liberty Records]] and [[Capitol Records]] turned down the master of \"Be My Boy\" by [[the Paris Sisters]], Sill formed a new label, [[Gregmark Records]], with [[Lee Hazlewood]], and released it. It reached only number 56, but the follow-up, \"[[I Love How You Love Me]]\", was a hit, reaching number 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits: Eighth Edition|author=[[Joel Whitburn]]|year=2004|publisher=Record Research|page=480}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1961, Spector formed a record company with Lester Sill, who by this time had ended his business partnership with Hazlewood. [[Philles Records]] combined the first names of its two founders, Phil Spector and Lester Sill. Through Hill and Range Publishers, Spector found three groups he wanted to produce: the Ducanes, the Creations, and [[the Crystals]]. The first two signed with other companies, but Spector managed to secure the Crystals for his new label. Their first single, \"[[There's No Other (Like My Baby)]]\" was a success, hitting number 20. Their next release, \"Uptown\", made it to number 13.\n\nSpector continued to work freelance with other artists. In 1962, he produced \"Second Hand Love\" by [[Connie Francis]], which reached #7. In the early 1960s, he briefly worked with [[Atlantic Records]]' [[R&B]] artists [[Ruth Brown]] and [[LaVern Baker]]. [[Ahmet Ertegun]] of Atlantic paired Spector with future [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star [[Jean DuShon]] for \"Talk to Me\", the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of which was \"Tired of Trying\", written by DuShon.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSpector briefly took a job as head of [[A&R]] for [[Liberty Records]]. It was while working at Liberty that he heard a song written by [[Gene Pitney]], for whom he had produced a number 41 hit, \"Every Breath I Take\", a year earlier. \"[[He's a Rebel]]\" was due to be released on Liberty by [[Vikki Carr]], but Spector rushed into Gold Star Studios and recorded a cover version using [[Darlene Love]] and the Blossoms on lead vocals. The record was released on Philles, attributed to the Crystals, and quickly rose to the top of the charts.\n\nBy the time \"He's a Rebel\" went to number 1, Lester Sill was out of the company, and Spector had Philles all to himself. He created a new act, [[Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans]], featuring Darlene Love, Fanita James (a member of the Blossoms), and Bobby Sheen, a singer he had worked with at Liberty. The group had hits with \"[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]\" (number 8), \"[[Why Do Lovers Break Each Other's Heart]]\" (number 38), and \"[[Not Too Young to Get Married]]\" (number 63). Spector also released solo material by Darlene Love in 1963. In the same year, he released \"[[Be My Baby]]\" by [[the Ronettes]], which went to number 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/The-Ronettes/chart-history/HSI|work=billboard.com|title=The Ronettes Chart History}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Phil Spector.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Spector in 1965]]\n\nThe first time Spector put the same amount of effort into an LP as he did into [[Gramophone record|45s]] was when he utilized the full Philles roster and the Wrecking Crew to make what he felt would become a hit for the 1963 Christmas season. ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records]]'' was released a few days after the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]] in November 1963. <ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Be_my_baby.html?id=gS8UAQAAIAAJ| title=Be My Baby, How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness or My Life as a Fabulous Ronette |first=Ronnie|last=Spector|publisher= Harmony Books |date=1990 | isbn=9780517574997 }}</ref>\n\nOn September 28, 1963, the Ronettes appeared at the [[Cow Palace]], near [[San Francisco]]. Also on the bill were the [[The Righteous Brothers|Righteous Brothers]]. Spector, who was conducting the band for all the acts, was so impressed with [[Bill Medley]] and [[Bobby Hatfield]] that he bought their contract from [[Moonglow Records]] and signed them to Philles. In early 1965, \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" became the label's second number 1 single. Three more major hits with the duo followed: \"[[Just Once in My Life]]\" (number 9), \"[[Unchained Melody]]\" (number 4, originally the B-side of \"Hung on You\") and \"[[Ebb Tide (song)|Ebb Tide]]\" (number 5). Despite having hits, he lost interest in producing the Righteous Brothers and sold their contract and all their master recordings to [[Verve Records]].

A re-release of the single re-charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], and went to number one on the [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks|Adult Contemporary charts]]. This also put Spector back on the U.S. Top 40 charts for the first time since his last appearance in 1971 with [[John Lennon]]'s \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\", though he did have UK top 40 hits in the interim with the [[Ramones]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zzmtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT177#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=177|title=Punk Rock Blitzkrieg - My Life As A Ramone|author=[[Marky Ramone]]|publisher=Kings Road Publishing|date= 13 Jul 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MFQ with Phil Spector.jpg|thumb|right|Spector with [[Modern Folk Quartet]], for whom he produced \"[[This Could Be the Night (1966 song)|This Could Be the Night]]\" in 1966]]\n\nSpector's final signing to Philles was the husband-and-wife team of [[Ike & Tina Turner]] in 1966.

The single, which actually featured [[Tina Turner|Tina]] but not Ike, was more successful in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], reaching number 3. Spector subsequently lost enthusiasm for his label and the recording industry. Already something of a [[recluse]], he withdrew temporarily from the public eye, marrying [[Ronnie Spector|Veronica \"Ronnie\" Bennett]], lead singer of the Ronettes, in 1968. In 1967, Spector emerged briefly for a cameo as himself in an episode of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and as a drug dealer in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969).<ref>{{cite book|page=128-37|title=Phil Spector: Out Of His Head|author=[[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]]|publisher=Omnibus Press|date= 17 Nov 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s: Comeback and Beatles collaborations ===\nIn 1969, Spector made a brief return to the music business by signing a production deal with [[A&M Records]]. A Ronettes single, \"You Came, You Saw, You Conquered\" flopped, but Spector returned to the Hot 100 with \"[[Black Pearl (Checkmates, Ltd. song)|Black Pearl]]\", by [[Sonny Charles]] and the [[Checkmates, Ltd.]], which reached number 13. In 1970, [[Allen Klein]], manager of [[the Beatles]], brought Spector to England. While producing [[John Lennon]]'s hit solo single \"[[Instant Karma!]]\", which went to number 3, Spector was invited by Lennon and [[George Harrison]] to take on the task of turning the Beatles' abandoned ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' recording sessions into a usable album. He went to work, using many of his production techniques, making significant changes to the arrangements and sound of some songs.<ref name=\"kreps\">{{cite web|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|title='Let It Be' 40 Years Later: A Look Back at the Beatles' Final LP|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/let-it-be-40-years-later-a-look-back-at-the-beatles-final-lp-20100507|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=April 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170941/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/let-it-be-40-years-later-a-look-back-at-the-beatles-final-lp-20100507|archive-date=April 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe resulting album, ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'', was a massive commercial success and topped the US and UK charts. The album also yielded the number 1 US single, \"[[The Long and Winding Road]].\" (A recording of \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\", released before Spector got his hands on the tapes, was released as a single two months before the release of the album, hitting number 2 in the UK and number 1 in the US. A third single from the sessions, \"[[Get Back]]\", an international number 1 issued in 1969, shortly after the original ''Get Back'' recording sessions, was also put together without Spector's participation.) Spector's overdubbing of \"The Long and Winding Road\" infuriated its composer, [[Paul McCartney]], especially since the work was allegedly completed without his knowledge and without any opportunity for him to assess the results.<ref name=\"kreps\" />\n\n[[File:John Lennon Imagine 1971.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|1971 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ad for [[John Lennon]]'s album ''[[Imagine (John Lennon album)|Imagine]]'', co-produced by Spector.]]\n\nLennon and [[George Harrison]] were satisfied with the results, and ''Let It Be'' led to Spector co-producing albums with both ex-Beatles. For Harrison's multiplatinum album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' (number 1, 1970), Spector provided a cathedral-like sonic ambience, complete with ornate orchestrations and gospel-like choirs. The LP yielded two major hits: \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\" (number 1) and \"[[What Is Life]]\" (number 10). That same year, Spector co-produced John Lennon's ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band|Plastic Ono Band]]'' (number 6) album. In 1971, Spector was named director of A&R for [[Apple Records]]. He held the post for only a year, but during that time he co-produced the single \"[[Power to the People (song)|Power to the People]]\" with John Lennon (number 11), as well as Lennon's chart-topping album, ''[[Imagine (John Lennon album)|Imagine]]''. The album's title track hit number 3. With Harrison, Spector co-produced Harrison's \"[[Bangla Desh (song)|Bangla Desh]]\" (number 23) and wife Ronnie Spector's \"[[Try Some, Buy Some]]\" (number 77). That same year Spector recorded the music for the number 1 triple album ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|The Concert For Bangladesh]]''. The album later won the \"Album of the Year\" award at the 1972 [[Grammy Awards|Grammys]]. Despite being recorded live, Spector used up to 44 microphones simultaneously to create his trademark Wall of Sound.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LDLhgzA930UC&pg=PT108#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=108|title=The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After The Break-Up 1970-2001|author=Keith Badman|publisher=Omnibus Press|date= 28 Oct 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aln2.albumlinernotes.com/Concert_For_Bangladesh.html|work=albumlinernotes.com|title=Concert For Bangladesh}}</ref> \n\nLennon retained Spector for the 1971 [[Christmas]] single \"[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]\" and the poorly reviewed 1972 album, ''[[Some Time in New York City]]'' (number 48). Similar to the unusual pattern of success that Spector's ''A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records'' experienced, \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" also stalled in sales upon its initial release, only later to become a fixture on radio station playlists around Christmas. In 1973, Spector participated in the recording sessions for what would be Lennon's ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'' album (number 6).\n\nHe established the [[Warner-Spector Records|Warner-Spector]] label with [[Warner Bros. Records]], which undertook new Spector-produced recordings with [[Cher]], Darlene Love, Danny Potter, and Jerri Bo Keno. in addition to several reissues. A similar relationship with Britain's [[Polydor Records]] led to the formation of the Phil Spector International label in 1975. When the Cher and Keno singles (the latter's recordings were only issued in Germany) foundered on the charts, Spector released [[Dion DiMucci]]'s ''[[Born to Be with You (album)|Born to Be with You]]'' to little commercial fanfare in 1975; largely produced and recorded by Spector in 1974, it was subsequently disowned by the singer. In the 1990s and 2000s, the album enjoyed a resurgence among the [[indie rock]] cognoscenti.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4721592/A-masterpiece-Was-it.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Tom | last=Cox | title=A masterpiece?

Finally, he released an American compilation of his Philles recordings in 1977, which put most of the better-known Spector hits back into circulation after many years. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n=== 1974\u20131980: Near-fatal accident, Cohen, and the Ramones ===\n{{Main|Death of a Ladies' Man (album)|End of the Century}}\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, Spector became increasingly reclusive. The most probable and significant reason for his withdrawal, according to biographer [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]], was that in 1974 he was seriously injured when he was thrown through the windshield of his car in a crash in Hollywood.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} According to a contemporary report published in the ''[[New Musical Express]]'',{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Spector was almost killed, and it was only because the attending police officer detected a faint pulse that Spector was not declared dead at the scene.

This angered many devout Cohen fans who preferred his stark acoustic sound to the orchestral and choral wall of sound that the album contains. The recording was fraught with difficulty. After Cohen had laid down practice vocal tracks, Spector mixed the album in studio sessions, rather than allowing Cohen to take a role in the mixing, as Cohen had previously done.<ref name=\"Leibovitz\" /> Cohen remarked that the end result is \"grotesque\", but also \"semi-virtuous\"\u2014for many years, he included a reworked version of the track \"Memories\" in live concerts. [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] also participated in the background vocals on \"Don't Go Home with Your Hard-On\", which is the second time Spector indirectly \"produced\" Dylan\u2014the first being Dylan's live recordings on ''The Concert for Bangladesh''. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/leonard-cohens-prophecy-of-the-phil-spector-lana-clarkson-incident-death-of-a-ladies-man-2404836|title=Leonard Cohen's Prophecy of the Phil Spector/Lana Clarkson Incident: 'Death of a Ladies' Man'|first=Randall|last=Roberts|work=L.A.

It was the seventh number-one single on the newly formed chart. Following the success of their debut, the group signed with [[Imperial Records]]. Their next single, \"I Don't Need You Anymore\", reached number 91. They released several more recordings, including an album, ''The Teddy Bears Sing!'', but failed to reach the top 100 in US sales. The group disbanded in 1959.<ref name=bronson1992-46>Fred Bronson, ''The Billboard Book of Number One Hits'', Billboard Publications, 1992, p. 46</ref>\n\nWhile recording the Teddy Bears's album, Spector had met [[Lester Sill]], a former promotion man who was a mentor to [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]]. Sill and his partner, [[Lee Hazlewood]] supported Spector's next project, the Spectors Three. In 1960, Sill arranged for Spector to work as an apprentice to Leiber and Stoller in New York. Spector co-wrote the [[Ben E. King]] Top 10 hit \"[[Spanish Harlem (song)|Spanish Harlem]]\" with Jerry Leiber and also worked as a session musician, playing the guitar solo on [[the Drifters]]' song \"[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]\".\n\n=== 1960\u20131969: Record producer ===\nSpector's first true recording artist and project as producer was Ronnie Crawford. Spector's production work during this time included releases by [[LaVern Baker]], [[Ruth Brown]], and Billy Storm, as well as the Top Notes' original recording of \"[[Twist and Shout]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Godin|title=The Topnotes|url=http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/topnotes.htm|publisher=Soulful Kinda Music|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> Leiber and Stoller recommended Spector to produce [[Ray Peterson]]'s \"[[Corrine, Corrina]]\", which reached number 9 in January 1961. Later, he produced another major hit for [[Curtis Lee]], \"Pretty Little Angel Eyes\", which made it to number 7. Returning to Hollywood, Spector agreed to produce one of Lester Sill's acts. After both [[Liberty Records]] and [[Capitol Records]] turned down the master of \"Be My Boy\" by [[the Paris Sisters]], Sill formed a new label, [[Gregmark Records]], with [[Lee Hazlewood]], and released it. It reached only number 56, but the follow-up, \"[[I Love How You Love Me]]\", was a hit, reaching number 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits: Eighth Edition|author=[[Joel Whitburn]]|year=2004|publisher=Record Research|page=480}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1961, Spector formed a record company with Lester Sill, who by this time had ended his business partnership with Hazlewood. [[Philles Records]] combined the first names of its two founders, Phil Spector and Lester Sill. Through Hill and Range Publishers, Spector found three groups he wanted to produce: the Ducanes, the Creations, and [[the Crystals]]. The first two signed with other companies, but Spector managed to secure the Crystals for his new label. Their first single, \"[[There's No Other (Like My Baby)]]\" was a success, hitting number 20. Their next release, \"Uptown\", made it to number 13.\n\nSpector continued to work freelance with other artists. In 1962, he produced \"Second Hand Love\" by [[Connie Francis]], which reached #7. In the early 1960s, he briefly worked with [[Atlantic Records]]' [[R&B]] artists [[Ruth Brown]] and [[LaVern Baker]]. [[Ahmet Ertegun]] of Atlantic paired Spector with future [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star [[Jean DuShon]] for \"Talk to Me\", the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of which was \"Tired of Trying\", written by DuShon.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSpector briefly took a job as head of [[A&R]] for [[Liberty Records]]. It was while working at Liberty that he heard a song written by [[Gene Pitney]], for whom he had produced a number 41 hit, \"Every Breath I Take\", a year earlier. \"[[He's a Rebel]]\" was due to be released on Liberty by [[Vikki Carr]], but Spector rushed into Gold Star Studios and recorded a cover version using [[Darlene Love]] and the Blossoms on lead vocals. The record was released on Philles, attributed to the Crystals, and quickly rose to the top of the charts.\n\nBy the time \"He's a Rebel\" went to number 1, Lester Sill was out of the company, and Spector had Philles all to himself. He created a new act, [[Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans]], featuring Darlene Love, Fanita James (a member of the Blossoms), and Bobby Sheen, a singer he had worked with at Liberty. The group had hits with \"[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]\" (number 8), \"[[Why Do Lovers Break Each Other's Heart]]\" (number 38), and \"[[Not Too Young to Get Married]]\" (number 63). Spector also released solo material by Darlene Love in 1963. In the same year, he released \"[[Be My Baby]]\" by [[the Ronettes]], which went to number 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/The-Ronettes/chart-history/HSI|work=billboard.com|title=The Ronettes Chart History}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Phil Spector.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Spector in 1965]]\n\nThe first time Spector put the same amount of effort into an LP as he did into [[Gramophone record|45s]] was when he utilized the full Philles roster and the Wrecking Crew to make what he felt would become a hit for the 1963 Christmas season. ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records]]'' was released a few days after the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]] in November 1963. <ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Be_my_baby.html?id=gS8UAQAAIAAJ| title=Be My Baby, How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness or My Life as a Fabulous Ronette |first=Ronnie|last=Spector|publisher= Harmony Books |date=1990 | isbn=9780517574997 }}</ref>\n\nOn September 28, 1963, the Ronettes appeared at the [[Cow Palace]], near [[San Francisco]]. Also on the bill were the [[The Righteous Brothers|Righteous Brothers]]. Spector, who was conducting the band for all the acts, was so impressed with [[Bill Medley]] and [[Bobby Hatfield]] that he bought their contract from [[Moonglow Records]] and signed them to Philles. In early 1965, \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" became the label's second number 1 single. Three more major hits with the duo followed: \"[[Just Once in My Life]]\" (number 9), \"[[Unchained Melody]]\" (number 4, originally the B-side of \"Hung on You\") and \"[[Ebb Tide (song)|Ebb Tide]]\" (number 5). Despite having hits, he lost interest in producing the Righteous Brothers and sold their contract and all their master recordings to [[Verve Records]]. However, the sound of the Righteous Brothers' singles was so distinctive that the act chose to replicate it after leaving Spector, notching a second number 1 hit in 1966 with the Bill Medley\u2013produced \"[[(You're My) Soul and Inspiration]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billboardtop100of.com/1966-2/ |title=1966 |work=billboard Top 100}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Spector formed another subsidiary label, [[Phi-Dan Records]], partly created to keep [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] Danny Davis occupied.

A re-release of the single re-charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], and went to number one on the [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks|Adult Contemporary charts]]. This also put Spector back on the U.S. Top 40 charts for the first time since his last appearance in 1971 with [[John Lennon]]'s \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\", though he did have UK top 40 hits in the interim with the [[Ramones]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zzmtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT177#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=177|title=Punk Rock Blitzkrieg - My Life As A Ramone|author=[[Marky Ramone]]|publisher=Kings Road Publishing|date= 13 Jul 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MFQ with Phil Spector.jpg|thumb|right|Spector with [[Modern Folk Quartet]], for whom he produced \"[[This Could Be the Night (1966 song)|This Could Be the Night]]\" in 1966]]\n\nSpector's final signing to Philles was the husband-and-wife team of [[Ike & Tina Turner]] in 1966.

The single, which actually featured [[Tina Turner|Tina]] but not Ike, was more successful in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], reaching number 3. Spector subsequently lost enthusiasm for his label and the recording industry. Already something of a [[recluse]], he withdrew temporarily from the public eye, marrying [[Ronnie Spector|Veronica \"Ronnie\" Bennett]], lead singer of the Ronettes, in 1968. In 1967, Spector emerged briefly for a cameo as himself in an episode of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and as a drug dealer in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969).<ref>{{cite book|page=128-37|title=Phil Spector: Out Of His Head|author=[[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]]|publisher=Omnibus Press|date= 17 Nov 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s: Comeback and Beatles collaborations ===\nIn 1969, Spector made a brief return to the music business by signing a production deal with [[A&M Records]]. A Ronettes single, \"You Came, You Saw, You Conquered\" flopped, but Spector returned to the Hot 100 with \"[[Black Pearl (Checkmates, Ltd. song)|Black Pearl]]\", by [[Sonny Charles]] and the [[Checkmates, Ltd.]], which reached number 13. In 1970, [[Allen Klein]], manager of [[the Beatles]], brought Spector to England. While producing [[John Lennon]]'s hit solo single \"[[Instant Karma!]]\", which went to number 3, Spector was invited by Lennon and [[George Harrison]] to take on the task of turning the Beatles' abandoned ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' recording sessions into a usable album. He went to work, using many of his production techniques, making significant changes to the arrangements and sound of some songs.<ref name=\"kreps\">{{cite web|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|title='Let It Be' 40 Years Later: A Look Back at the Beatles' Final LP|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/let-it-be-40-years-later-a-look-back-at-the-beatles-final-lp-20100507|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=April 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405170941/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/let-it-be-40-years-later-a-look-back-at-the-beatles-final-lp-20100507|archive-date=April 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe resulting album, ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'', was a massive commercial success and topped the US and UK charts. The album also yielded the number 1 US single, \"[[The Long and Winding Road]].\" (A recording of \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\", released before Spector got his hands on the tapes, was released as a single two months before the release of the album, hitting number 2 in the UK and number 1 in the US. A third single from the sessions, \"[[Get Back]]\", an international number 1 issued in 1969, shortly after the original ''Get Back'' recording sessions, was also put together without Spector's participation.) Spector's overdubbing of \"The Long and Winding Road\" infuriated its composer, [[Paul McCartney]], especially since the work was allegedly completed without his knowledge and without any opportunity for him to assess the results.<ref name=\"kreps\" />\n\n[[File:John Lennon Imagine 1971.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|1971 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ad for [[John Lennon]]'s album ''[[Imagine (John Lennon album)|Imagine]]'', co-produced by Spector.]]\n\nLennon and [[George Harrison]] were satisfied with the results, and ''Let It Be'' led to Spector co-producing albums with both ex-Beatles. For Harrison's multiplatinum album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' (number 1, 1970), Spector provided a cathedral-like sonic ambience, complete with ornate orchestrations and gospel-like choirs. The LP yielded two major hits: \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\" (number 1) and \"[[What Is Life]]\" (number 10). That same year, Spector co-produced John Lennon's ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band|Plastic Ono Band]]'' (number 6) album. In 1971, Spector was named director of A&R for [[Apple Records]]. He held the post for only a year, but during that time he co-produced the single \"[[Power to the People (song)|Power to the People]]\" with John Lennon (number 11), as well as Lennon's chart-topping album, ''[[Imagine (John Lennon album)|Imagine]]''. The album's title track hit number 3. With Harrison, Spector co-produced Harrison's \"[[Bangla Desh (song)|Bangla Desh]]\" (number 23) and wife Ronnie Spector's \"[[Try Some, Buy Some]]\" (number 77). That same year Spector recorded the music for the number 1 triple album ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|The Concert For Bangladesh]]''. The album later won the \"Album of the Year\" award at the 1972 [[Grammy Awards|Grammys]]. Despite being recorded live, Spector used up to 44 microphones simultaneously to create his trademark Wall of Sound.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LDLhgzA930UC&pg=PT108#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=108|title=The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After The Break-Up 1970-2001|author=Keith Badman|publisher=Omnibus Press|date= 28 Oct 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aln2.albumlinernotes.com/Concert_For_Bangladesh.html|work=albumlinernotes.com|title=Concert For Bangladesh}}</ref> \n\nLennon retained Spector for the 1971 [[Christmas]] single \"[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]\" and the poorly reviewed 1972 album, ''[[Some Time in New York City]]'' (number 48). Similar to the unusual pattern of success that Spector's ''A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records'' experienced, \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" also stalled in sales upon its initial release, only later to become a fixture on radio station playlists around Christmas. In 1973, Spector participated in the recording sessions for what would be Lennon's ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'' album (number 6).\n\nHe established the [[Warner-Spector Records|Warner-Spector]] label with [[Warner Bros. Records]], which undertook new Spector-produced recordings with [[Cher]], Darlene Love, Danny Potter, and Jerri Bo Keno. in addition to several reissues. A similar relationship with Britain's [[Polydor Records]] led to the formation of the Phil Spector International label in 1975. When the Cher and Keno singles (the latter's recordings were only issued in Germany) foundered on the charts, Spector released [[Dion DiMucci]]'s ''[[Born to Be with You (album)|Born to Be with You]]'' to little commercial fanfare in 1975; largely produced and recorded by Spector in 1974, it was subsequently disowned by the singer.

This angered many devout Cohen fans who preferred his stark acoustic sound to the orchestral and choral wall of sound that the album contains. The recording was fraught with difficulty. After Cohen had laid down practice vocal tracks, Spector mixed the album in studio sessions, rather than allowing Cohen to take a role in the mixing, as Cohen had previously done.<ref name=\"Leibovitz\" /> Cohen remarked that the end result is \"grotesque\", but also \"semi-virtuous\"\u2014for many years, he included a reworked version of the track \"Memories\" in live concerts.

They have a whorl of up to 400 [[tentacles]] tightly packed around the bell margin. Hanging down from the center of the inside of the bell is a large stomach structure called a manubrium, with a mouth-opening with four frilly lips. Circulation of nutrients is facilitated by four radial canals which originate at the edges of the stomach (manubrium), and which are also connected to a ring canal, located near the bell margin. Most of the body is transparent or [[translucent]], with a whitish or greenish tinge. The (usually) four large flat sex organs ([[gonads]]) are attached to the four radial canals, and are usually opaque white. The many tentacles each contain thousands of cells called [[cnidocytes]], which contain [[nematocysts]] (also known as cnidocysts), and are used to capture prey and pass it to the mouth. Food is taken in the mouth opening, and waste is finally expelled out of the same opening.\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''C. sowerbii'' is native to the [[Yangtze]] basin in China, but has been [[Introduced species|introduced]] widely around the world (the only continent where not found is Antarctica).<ref name=NOBANIS/> It is usually found in calm, freshwater [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]s, lakes, impoundments, gravel pits or [[quarries]]. They have also been seen in slow-moving backwaters of river systems such as the [[Allegheny River]], the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Tennessee River]] in the United States and the [[Wang Thong River]] of [[Thailand]]. They prefer standing water, and are not generally seen in fast flowing streams or rivers.\n\n''C. sowerbii'' has a global distribution - it has been found in countries on almost every continent and nearly every state in the United States (no reports yet from [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Alaska]] or [[Hawaii]]) and most provinces in Canada (no reports yet from [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jellyfish.iup.edu/US.html|title=Distribution of the freshwater jellyfish|last=Peard|first=Terry|accessdate=2008-08-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728103939/http://www.jellyfish.iup.edu/US.html|archivedate=2008-07-28}}</ref>\n\nThe medusa's appearance is sporadic and unpredictable from year to year.

Jesus then amazes Simon and his companions James and John (Andrew is not mentioned) by telling them to lower their nets, whereupon they catch a huge number of fish. Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, \"We have found the [[Messiah]]\", and then brought Simon to Jesus.\n\n[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], by [[Giuseppe Cesari]] c. 1597]]\n\nThree of the four gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark and John\u2014recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. Matthew additionally describes Peter walking on water for a moment but beginning to sink when his faith wavers ([[Matthew 14]]:28\u201331).\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Last Supper]], Jesus washed his disciples' feet. Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10). Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it ([[Luke 22]]:49\u201351). This healing of the servant's ear is the last of the [[Miracles of Jesus|37 miracles attributed to Jesus]] in the Bible.\n\nSimon Peter was twice arraigned, with John, before the [[Sanhedrin]] and directly defied them ([[Acts 4]]:7\u201322, [[Acts 5]]:18\u201342). After receiving a vision from [[God]] that allowed for the eating of previously unclean animals, Peter takes a missionary journey to [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] ([[Acts 9]]:32\u2013[[Acts 10]]:2), becoming instrumental in the decision to evangelise the [[Gentile]]s ([[Acts 10]]).

Peter/Cephas is mentioned briefly in the opening chapter of one of the [[Pauline epistles]], [[Epistle to the Galatians]], which mentions a trip by [[Paul the Apostle]] to [[Jerusalem]] where he meets Peter ([[Galatians 1]]:18). Peter features again in Galatians, fourteen years later, when Paul (now with [[Barnabas]] and [[Saint Titus|Titus]]) returned to Jerusalem ([[Galatians 2]]:7-9).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke is a record of Christ telling Peter: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In a reminiscent<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

When he asks \"Who do ''you'' say that I am?\", Simon Peter answers, \"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\" Jesus then declares:\n\n{{quote|Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.

Harrington]], who suggests that Peter was an unlikely symbol of stability. While he was one of the first disciples called and was the spokesman for the group, Peter is also the exemplar of \"little faith\". In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|14}}, Peter will soon have Jesus say to him, \"O you of little faith, why did you doubt?\", and he will eventually deny Jesus three times.

This took place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor (Nero) wished to blame the Christians. This \"dies imperii\" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was \"as usual\" accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]].

([[Vercelli manuscript|Vercelli]] Acts XXXV<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html The Acts of Peter], by M. R.

According to the story, Peter, fleeing Rome to avoid execution meets the risen Jesus. In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, \"Quo vadis?\" He replies, \"''Romam eo iterum crucifigi\"'' (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\"). Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred. This story is commemorated in an [[Annibale Carracci]] painting.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]].\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter & the Rock |publisher=Time |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Cullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=\"Time\" />\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or \"this same\", when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of \"Rock\" by looking at the Aramaic language. While the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual, which is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the rock until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (\"To the Romans\", Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations.\"\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language. The textual features of these two epistles are such that a majority of scholars doubt that they were written by the same hand. Some scholars argue that theological differences imply different sources, and point to the lack of references to 2&nbsp;Peter among the early Church Fathers.\n\n[[Daniel B. Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient. ...Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline'']. Archive date: 9 December 2003. Access date: 19 August 2013.</ref>\n\nOf the two epistles, the [[First Epistle of Peter|first epistle]] is considered the earlier. A number of scholars have argued that the textual discrepancies with what would be expected of the biblical Peter are due to it having been written with the help of a secretary or as an [[amanuensis]].<ref name=\"ce-epistles\">{{cathEncy|wstitle=Epistles of St. Peter|volume=11|author=Vander Heeren, Achille}}</ref>\n\n[[Jerome]] explains:\n\n{{quote|The two Epistles attributed to St. Peter differ in style, character, and the construction of the words, which proves that according to the exigencies of the moment St. Peter made use of different interpreters.

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150; there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\"''(De Viris Illustribus 1).''<ref>{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men) Chapter 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> But he himself received the epistle, and explained the difference in style, character, and structure of words by the assumption that Peter used different interpreters in the composition of the two epistles;<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> and from his time onward the epistle was generally regarded as a part of the New Testament.\n\nEven in early times there was controversy over its authorship, and Second Peter was often not included in the [[biblical canon]]; it was only in the 4th century that it gained a firm foothold in the New Testament, in a series of synods. In the East the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] still did not admit it into the canon until the 6th century.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n====Mark====\nTraditionally, the [[Gospel of Mark#Authorship and sources|Gospel of Mark]] was said to have been written by a person named [[John Mark]], and that this person was an assistant to Peter; hence its content was traditionally seen as the closest to Peter's viewpoint. According to Eusebius' ''Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Reconciliation.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

The [[Gospel of John]] also depicts Peter fishing, even after the resurrection of Jesus, in the story of the [[Miraculous Draught of Fish|Catch of 153 fish]]. In Matthew and Mark, Jesus called Simon and his brother Andrew to be \"[[fishers of men]]\" ([[Matthew 4:18]]\u2013[[Matthew 4:19|19]], [[Mark 1]]:16\u201317).\n\nA Franciscan church is built upon the traditional site of Apostle Peter's house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2000/3/Capernaum-%20The%20Church%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Peter|title=|publisher=}}</ref>\nIn [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Simon Peter owns the boat that Jesus uses to preach to the multitudes who were pressing on him at the shore of [[Sea of Galilee|Lake Gennesaret]] ([[Luke 5]]:3). Jesus then amazes Simon and his companions James and John (Andrew is not mentioned) by telling them to lower their nets, whereupon they catch a huge number of fish. Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, \"We have found the [[Messiah]]\", and then brought Simon to Jesus.\n\n[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], by [[Giuseppe Cesari]] c. 1597]]\n\nThree of the four gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark and John\u2014recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. Matthew additionally describes Peter walking on water for a moment but beginning to sink when his faith wavers ([[Matthew 14]]:28\u201331).\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Last Supper]], Jesus washed his disciples' feet. Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10). Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it ([[Luke 22]]:49\u201351).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke is a record of Christ telling Peter: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In a reminiscent<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

This took place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor (Nero) wished to blame the Christians. This \"dies imperii\" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was \"as usual\" accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]]. In accordance with the [[apocryphal]] [[Acts of Peter]], he was crucified head down.<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html Apocryphal ''Acts of Peter Chapter 37''].</ref> Tradition also locates his burial place where the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of Saint Peter]] was later built, directly beneath the Basilica's high altar.\n\n[[File:Crucifixion of Saint Peter-Caravaggio (c.1600).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Crucifixion of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]'' (1601) by [[Caravaggio]]]]\n\n[[Pope Clement I]] (d.99), in his ''Letter to the Corinthians'' (Chapter 5), written c. 80\u201398, speaks of Peter's martyrdom in the following terms: \"Let us take the noble examples of our own generation.

([[Vercelli manuscript|Vercelli]] Acts XXXV<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html The Acts of Peter], by M. R.

According to the story, Peter, fleeing Rome to avoid execution meets the risen Jesus. In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, \"Quo vadis?\" He replies, \"''Romam eo iterum crucifigi\"'' (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\"). Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred. This story is commemorated in an [[Annibale Carracci]] painting.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]].\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or \"this same\", when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of \"Rock\" by looking at the Aramaic language. While the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual, which is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the rock until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (\"To the Romans\", Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations.\"\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. The Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. A ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.\n\nBoth [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination, ''et cetera'', reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=\"Primacy of St. Peter\" \u2013 by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\n===New Apostolic Church===\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]], which believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n[[File:Saint Peter by Gr\u00e3o Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Gr\u00e3o Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]], 1506]]\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language. The textual features of these two epistles are such that a majority of scholars doubt that they were written by the same hand. Some scholars argue that theological differences imply different sources, and point to the lack of references to 2&nbsp;Peter among the early Church Fathers.\n\n[[Daniel B. Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient. ...Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline''].

A number of scholars have argued that the textual discrepancies with what would be expected of the biblical Peter are due to it having been written with the help of a secretary or as an [[amanuensis]].<ref name=\"ce-epistles\">{{cathEncy|wstitle=Epistles of St. Peter|volume=11|author=Vander Heeren, Achille}}</ref>\n\n[[Jerome]] explains:\n\n{{quote|The two Epistles attributed to St. Peter differ in style, character, and the construction of the words, which proves that according to the exigencies of the moment St. Peter made use of different interpreters.

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150; there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\"''(De Viris Illustribus 1).''<ref>{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men) Chapter 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> But he himself received the epistle, and explained the difference in style, character, and structure of words by the assumption that Peter used different interpreters in the composition of the two epistles;<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> and from his time onward the epistle was generally regarded as a part of the New Testament.\n\nEven in early times there was controversy over its authorship, and Second Peter was often not included in the [[biblical canon]]; it was only in the 4th century that it gained a firm foothold in the New Testament, in a series of synods.

According to Eusebius' ''Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him.

He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.<ref>Higgitt, John, \"The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin\", pp. 267\u2013272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Reconciliation.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

Some Protestants, however, have rejected Peter's martyrdom as a later invention, arguing that evidence of Peter exists only in biblical accounts and not in the [[history]].\n\nIt has also been suggested that there was a serious division between Peter's [[Jewish Christian]] party and Paul's Hellenizing party, seen in e.g. the [[Incident at Antioch]], which later Christian accounts have downplayed.<ref>White, L. Michael (2004). ''From Jesus to Christianity''. Harper SanFrancisco. p. 170. {{ISBN|0-06-052655-6}}.</ref>\n\nAnother revisionist view was developed by supporters of the [[Christ myth theory]], which holds that the figure of Peter is largely a development from some mythological doorkeeper figures. According to [[Arthur Drews]] and [[George Albert Wells|G. A. Wells]], if there was a historical Peter, then all that is known about him is the brief mentions in Galatians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egodeath.com/arthurdrewslegendstpeter.htm |title=Arthur Drews \u2013 The Legend of St. Peter |publisher=Egodeath.com |date=2005-10-10 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref><ref>[[George Albert Wells]], \"St. Peter as Bishop of Rome\"</ref>\n\n==In art==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" caption=\"Depictions of Saint Peter\">\n\nFile:Saint Pierre tentant de marcher sur les eaux by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.jpg|''Saint Peter Attempting to Walk on Water'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], 1766\nFile:'The Release of St. Peter', oil on canvas painting by Bernardo Strozzi, c. 1635, Art Gallery of New South Wales.jpg|''The Release of St. Peter'' by [[Bernardo Strozzi]], 1635\nFile:Christ giving the Keys of Heaven to St. Peter by Peter Paul Rubens - Gem\u00e4ldegalerie - Berlin - Germany 2017.jpg|''Jesus gives Peter the keys to Heaven'' by [[Pieter Paul Rubens]], 1614\nFile:0 Statue de Saint Pierre par Arnolfo di Cambio - Basilique St-Pierre - Vatican (1).JPG|Peter Enthroned, by [[Arnolfo di Lapo|Arnolfo di Cambio]] (13th-century statue in [[St Peter's Basilica]], Rome) \nFile:V&A - Raphael, The Miraculous Draught of Fishes (1515).jpg|''The Miraculous Draught of Fishes'', by [[Raphael]], 1515\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna 036.jpg|''Jesus calling Simon Peter and Andrew'' by [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]], 1308\u20131311\nFile:Aparici\u00f3n del ap\u00f3stol San Pedro a San Pedro Nolasco.jpg|''An apparition of the Apostle Peter to Saint Peter'' Nolasco, by [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], 1629\nFile:Alessandro Turchi - Saint Agatha Attended by Saint Peter and an Angel in Prison - Walters 37552.jpg|[[Alessandro Turchi]], ''Saint Agatha Attended by Saint Peter and an Angel in Prison'', 1640\u20131645\nFile:Pietro Perugino 034.jpg|Fresco by [[Pietro Perugino]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]], 1480\u20131482 \nFile:St_Peter_(c.1510-20)_(V%26A).jpg|Statue of St. Peter (c.1510-1520) at the [[V&A]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Music==\n\n*[[Orlande de Lassus|Rolland de Lassus]], ''Les Larmes de Saint Pierre'', 21 spiritual madrigals (1594).\n*[[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], ''Le Reniement de Saint Pierre'' H 424 for soloists, chorus and continuo H 424 (date ?).\n\n==See also==\n{{Saint Peter}}\n*[[List of Catholic saints]]\n*[[List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources]]\n*[[List of popes]]\n*[[Peter and Paul (disambiguation)|Peter and Paul]]\n*''[[Quo Vadis (disambiguation)#On stage, film and TV|Quo Vadis]]''\n*[[Saint Peter and Islam]]\n*[[Saint Peter and Judaism]]\n*[[Saint Peter's Square]]\n*[[Saint Peter's tomb]]\n*[[San Pietro in Vincoli]]\n*[[St. Peter's Basilica]]\n*[[Sword of Saint Peter]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Ibid|date=August 2019}}\n{{Reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n<!-- B -->\n* {{Citation | last =Bockmuehl | first =Markus N.

The show is hosted by Jochen Schropp.<ref>http://www.sat1.de/tv/promi-big-brother/news/die-marke-big-brother-ist-zurueck-im-deutschen-fernsehen</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nPromis had participated in tasks and matches for treats or to avoid punishments. Daily nominations also took place (from Day 8 to 14). Furthermore, the house consists of two floors, the upper luxury floor and the lower poverty floor. Housemates on the luxury floor choose of the poor housemates to join them upstairs, whilst the public will vote one of the 7 downstairs.\n\n==House==\nThis year's ''Promi Big Brother'' contains two floors, each floor having its separate living areas, bathrooms, bedrooms and diary rooms. The upper floor is luxurious, whilst the lower floor is meager with no beds or real seatings.\n\n== Promis ==\nOriginally seven celebrity housemates entered upstairs on Day 3, whilst other five entered downstairs two days earlier (Day 1).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:20px; width:auto;\" \n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Celebrity\n!scope=\"col\" | Age on entry\n!scope=\"col\" | Notability\n!scope=\"col\" | Day entered\n!scope=\"col\" | Day exited\n!scope=\"col\" | Status\n|-\n| Aaron Troschke\n| 24\n| Famous quiz contestant and media personality <small>(heritage from [[Russia]])</small>\n| 1\n| 17\n| {{won|Winner}}\n|-\n| [[:de:Claudia Effenberg|Claudia Effenberg]]\n| 49\n| Model/footballer's wife\n| 3\n| 17\n| {{Runner-up}}\n|-\n| [[Ronald Schill]]\n| 55\n| Former politician and judge\n| 3\n| 17\n| {{CFinalist|Third place}}\n|-\n| [[:de:Paul Janke|Paul Janke]]\n| 30\n| Reality TV star (''The Bachelor'')\n| 1\n| 17\n| {{CFinalist|Fourth place}}\n|-\n| [[Michael Wendler]]\n| 42\n| Singer\n| 3\n| 17\n| {{CFinalist|Fifth place}}\n|-\n| [[Hubert Kah]]\n| 55\n| 80es pop icon\n| 3\n| 16\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| [[:de:Alexandra Rietz|Alexandra Rietz]]\n| 43\n| Scripted crime series actress\n| 1\n| 15\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| Mia Julia Br\u00fcckner\n| 27\n| Porn star / Ballermann performer\n| 1\n| 14\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| [[:de:Liz Baffoe|Liz Baffoe]]\n| 44\n| Soap actress <small>(heritage from [[Ghana]])</small>\n| 3\n| 13\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| Ela Tas\n| 22\n| Reality TV contestant <small>(heritage from [[Turkey]])</small>\n| 3\n| 12\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| Mario-Max Prinz zu Schaumburg-Lippe\n| 36\n| Royalty <small>(originally from [[Austria]])</small>\n| 3\n| 11\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|-\n| Janina Youssefian\n| 33\n| Model <small>(heritage from [[Iran]])</small>\n| 1\n| 10\n| {{eliminated|Evicted}}\n|}\n\n== Nominations table ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; line-height:15px; width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:6%;\" colspan=2|\n! style=\"width:6%;\" | {{nowrap|Day 10}}\n! style=\"width:6%;\" | {{nowrap|Day 11}}\n! style=\"width:6%;\" | {{nowrap|Day 12}}\n! style=\"width:6%;\" | {{nowrap|Day 13}}\n! style=\"width:6%;\" | {{nowrap|Day 14}}\n! style=\"width:6%;\" | {{nowrap|Day 15}}\n! style=\"width:6%;\" | {{nowrap|Day 16}}\n! style=\"width:12%;\" colspan=2 | {{nowrap|Day 17}}<br>Final\n! style=\"width:6%;\" | {{nowrap|Nominations<br>received}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=66ffff|\n!
