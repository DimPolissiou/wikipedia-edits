It was released in April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] as the lead [[Single (music)|single]] of his fifth studio album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded the song with his backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]]. A late addition to the album, it was included at the insistence of [[RCA Records|RCA]]'s Dennis Katz, who heard a demo and loved the track, believing it would make a great single. It replaced the [[Chuck Berry]] cover \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\" on the album.\n\n==Overview==\n\"Starman\" was written as a direct response to the head of RCA Dennis Katz's request for a single. It was recorded on 4 February 1972 at [[Trident Studios]] in London,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} towards the end of the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} Also recorded during this session was \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\" and \"[[Suffragette City]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Blum PopMatters\">{{cite magazine|last=Blum|first=Jordan|date=12 July 2012|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101090527/http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|archivedate=1 January 2017|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The lyrics describe Ziggy Stardust bringing a message of hope to Earth's youth through the radio, salvation by an alien 'Starman'. The story is told from the point of view of one of the youths who hears Ziggy. According to Bowie himself, speaking to [[William S. Burroughs]] for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1973, Ziggy Stardust is ''not'' the Starman but merely his earthly messenger \u2013 contrary to received opinion which often paints Ziggy as an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]].{{sfn|Pegg|2000|pp=276\u2013277}} The song has inspired interpretations ranging from an allusion to the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]],{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} to an accurate prediction of the plot for the film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977).{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\nThe music is in a gentle [[pop rock]] vein, featuring prominent [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and a [[String instrument|string]] arrangement by [[Mick Ronson]], not dissimilar to the style of Bowie's previous album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971). The chorus is loosely based on [[Harold Arlen]]'s \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" from the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', alluding to the \"Starman\"'s extraterrestrial origins (over the rainbow) (the octave leap on the word \"Starman\" is identical to that on the word \"Somewhere\" in \"Over the Rainbow\").<ref>{{cite book|last=Trynka|first=Paul|title=Starman: David Bowie \u2013 The Definitive Biography|year=2011|publisher=Sphere|location=London|isbn=978-0751542936}}</ref> Other influences cited for the track are the [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] songs \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\" (the \"boogie\" references and \"la la la\" chorus) and [[Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland]]'s \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" (the [[morse code]]-esque guitar and piano breaks).{{sfn|Pegg|2000|p=203}}\n\n==Release and critical reception==\n\"Starman\" was released as the lead single of the album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' on 28 April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2199) with \"[[Suffragette City]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> It subsequently appeared as the fourth track on the album, between \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", released on 16 June 1972 by RCA.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> It was a late addition to the album, replacing a cover of American singer-songwriter [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} From a commercial point of view, \"Starman\" was a milestone in Bowie\u2019s career, his first hit since 1969's \"[[Space Oddity]]\" three years before. ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] reported that \"many thought it was his first ''record'' since 'Space Oddity'\", and assumed that it was a sequel to the earlier single.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=8}}\n\nThe single initially sold steadily rather than spectacularly but earned many positive reviews. BBC broadcaster [[John Peel]], in his ''Disc & Music Echo'' column wrote: \"Now this is magnificent \u2013 quite superb. \"David Bowie is, with [[Kevin Ayers]], the most important, under-acknowledged innovator in contemporary popular music in Britain and if this record is overlooked it will be nothing less than stark tragedy.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=460\u2013461}} [[Chris Welch]] of ''[[Melody Maker]]'' predicted: \"[Bowie] is taking longer than most to become a superstar, but he should catch up with Rod and Marc soon.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=247}} Its turning point came when Bowie scored a place on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in July 1972 and sang \"Starman\".  Bowie's television performance with the Spiders became famous; according to author David Buckley, \"Many fans date their conversion to all things Bowie to this ''Top of the Pops'' appearance\".{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} It embedded Ziggy Stardust in the nation\u2019s consciousness, helping push \"Starman\" to No. 10 and the album, released the previous month, to No. 5. Although this performance, recorded on 5 July 1972 and broadcast on 6 July, is often cited as being the first UK TV performance of the song, it had in fact been performed on ITV's ''[[Lift Off with Ayshea]]'' three weeks earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.5years.com/loa.htm |title=The Ziggy Stardust Companion: Lift off with Ayshea \u2013 15 June 1972 |publisher=5years.com |date= |accessdate=7 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225015158/http://5years.com/loa.htm |archive-date=25 December 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The English [[gothic rock]] band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] recalled that seeing Bowie's performance on ''Top of the Pops'' was \"a significant and profound turning point in their lives\".

It was released in April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] as the lead [[Single (music)|single]] of his fifth studio album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded the song with his backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]]. A late addition to the album, it was included at the insistence of [[RCA Records|RCA]]'s Dennis Katz, who heard a demo and loved the track, believing it would make a great single. It replaced the [[Chuck Berry]] cover \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\" on the album.\n\n==Overview==\n\"Starman\" was written as a direct response to the head of RCA Dennis Katz's request for a single. It was recorded on 4 February 1972 at [[Trident Studios]] in London,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} towards the end of the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} Also recorded during this session was \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\" and \"[[Suffragette City]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Blum PopMatters\">{{cite magazine|last=Blum|first=Jordan|date=12 July 2012|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101090527/http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|archivedate=1 January 2017|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The lyrics describe Ziggy Stardust bringing a message of hope to Earth's youth through the radio, salvation by an alien 'Starman'. The story is told from the point of view of one of the youths who hears Ziggy. According to Bowie himself, speaking to [[William S. Burroughs]] for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1973, Ziggy Stardust is ''not'' the Starman but merely his earthly messenger \u2013 contrary to received opinion which often paints Ziggy as an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]].{{sfn|Pegg|2000|pp=276\u2013277}} The song has inspired interpretations ranging from an allusion to the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]],{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} to an accurate prediction of the plot for the film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977).{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\nThe music is in a gentle [[pop rock]] vein, featuring prominent [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and a [[String instrument|string]] arrangement by [[Mick Ronson]], not dissimilar to the style of Bowie's previous album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971). The chorus is loosely based on [[Harold Arlen]]'s \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" from the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', alluding to the \"Starman\"'s extraterrestrial origins (over the rainbow) (the octave leap on the word \"Starman\" is identical to that on the word \"Somewhere\" in \"Over the Rainbow\").<ref>{{cite book|last=Trynka|first=Paul|title=Starman: David Bowie \u2013 The Definitive Biography|year=2011|publisher=Sphere|location=London|isbn=978-0751542936}}</ref> Other influences cited for the track are the [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] songs \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\" (the \"boogie\" references and \"la la la\" chorus) and [[Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland]]'s \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" (the [[morse code]]-esque guitar and piano breaks).{{sfn|Pegg|2000|p=203}}\n\n==Release and critical reception==\n\"Starman\" was released as the lead single of the album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' on 28 April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2199) with \"[[Suffragette City]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> It subsequently appeared as the fourth track on the album, between \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", released on 16 June 1972 by RCA.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> It was a late addition to the album, replacing a cover of American singer-songwriter [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} From a commercial point of view, \"Starman\" was a milestone in Bowie\u2019s career, his first hit since 1969's \"[[Space Oddity]]\" three years before. ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] reported that \"many thought it was his first ''record'' since 'Space Oddity'\", and assumed that it was a sequel to the earlier single.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=8}}\n\nAccording to [[Acclaimed Music]], it is the 360th most celebrated song in popular music history, and the 11th most from 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/song/S800.htm|title=Starman ranked 360th most celebrated song|work=Acclaimed Music|access-date=15 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304055031/http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/song/S800.htm|archive-date=4 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe single initially sold steadily rather than spectacularly but earned many positive reviews. BBC broadcaster [[John Peel]], in his ''Disc & Music Echo'' column wrote: \"Now this is magnificent \u2013 quite superb. \"David Bowie is, with [[Kevin Ayers]], the most important, under-acknowledged innovator in contemporary popular music in Britain and if this record is overlooked it will be nothing less than stark tragedy.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=460\u2013461}} [[Chris Welch]] of ''[[Melody Maker]]'' predicted: \"[Bowie] is taking longer than most to become a superstar, but he should catch up with Rod and Marc soon.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=247}} Its turning point came when Bowie scored a place on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in July 1972 and sang \"Starman\".  Bowie's television performance with the Spiders became famous; according to author David Buckley, \"Many fans date their conversion to all things Bowie to this ''Top of the Pops'' appearance\".{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} It embedded Ziggy Stardust in the nation\u2019s consciousness, helping push \"Starman\" to No. 10 and the album, released the previous month, to No. 5. Although this performance, recorded on 5 July 1972 and broadcast on 6 July, is often cited as being the first UK TV performance of the song, it had in fact been performed on ITV's ''[[Lift Off with Ayshea]]'' three weeks earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.5years.com/loa.htm |title=The Ziggy Stardust Companion: Lift off with Ayshea \u2013 15 June 1972 |publisher=5years.com |date= |accessdate=7 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225015158/http://5years.com/loa.htm |archive-date=25 December 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The English [[gothic rock]] band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] recalled that seeing Bowie's performance on ''Top of the Pops'' was \"a significant and profound turning point in their lives\".

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. He most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. The 16th century French priest and traveller [[Andr\u00e9 Thevet]] also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to the species.<ref name=kinzelbach>{{cite journal |last1=Kinzelbach |first1=Ragnar K. |title=Pre-Linnaean pictures of the secretarybird, ''Sagittarius serpentarius'' (J.

The earliest [[fossil]]s associated with the family are two species from the genus ''[[Pelargopappus]]''. The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family. In spite of their age, it is not thought that the two species are ancestral to the secretarybird.<ref name=\"HBW\">{{Citation | first = Kevin | last = Caley |  editor-first = Josep | editor-last = del Hoyo | editor2-first = Andrew | editor2-last = Elliott | editor3-first = David | editor3-last = Christie | contribution = Fossil Birds | title = Handbook of the Birds of the World.

Adults have a featherless red-orange face with pale brown irises and a yellow [[cere]]. The legs and feet are pinkish grey, the upper legs clad in black feathers. The toes are short and stout so that the bird is unable to grasp objects with its feet.

The secretarybird prefers open [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s and [[shrubland]] ([[Karoo]]) rather than [[forest]]s and dense [[shrubbery]] which may impede its [[cursorial]] existence.<ref name=hbwfamily/> More specifically, it prefers areas with grass under {{cvt|0.5|m}} high and avoids those with grass over {{cvt|1|m}} high.

They can breed at any time of the year, more frequently in the late dry season. During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with guttural croaking. Males and females can also perform a grounded display by chasing each other with their wings up and back, much like the way they defend their territory.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family.

Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method.

When in proximity to a lye that is dissolving in an open container of water, the use of a vapor-resistant face mask is recommended. Adding lye to water too quickly can cause the solution to boil.\n\n=== Storage ===\nSolid lyes are [[deliquescent]]s and have a strong affinity for air moisture. Solid lyes will deliquesce or dissolve when exposed to open air, absorbing a relatively large amount of water vapour. Accordingly, lyes are stored in air-tight plastic containers. Glass is not a good material to be used for storage as lyes are mildly corrosive to it. Similar to the case of other corrosives, the containers should be labeled to indicate the potential danger of the contents and stored away from children, pets, heat, and moisture.\n\n=== Hazardous reactions ===\nThe majority of safety concerns with lye are also common with most corrosives, such as their potentially destructive effects on [[tissue (biology)|living tissue]]s; examples are the [[skin]], [[flesh]], and the [[cornea]]. Solutions containing lyes can cause [[chemical burn]]s, permanent injuries, scarring and [[blindness]], immediately upon contact. Lyes may be harmful or even fatal if swallowed; ingestion can cause [[esophageal stricture]]. Moreover, the [[solvation]] of dry [[solid]] lyes is highly [[exothermic]]; the resulting [[heat]] may cause additional burns or ignite flammables.\n\nThe reaction between sodium hydroxide and a few metals is also hazardous. [[Aluminium]] reacts with lyes to produce [[hydrogen]] gas. Since hydrogen is [[flammable]], mixing a large quantity of a lye such as sodium hydroxide with aluminum in a closed container is dangerous\u2014especially when the system is at a high temperature, which speeds up the reaction. In addition to aluminum, lyes may also react with [[magnesium]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], [[chromium]], [[brass]] or [[bronze]]\u2014producing hydrogen gas.  Both the potassium and sodium forms are able to dissolve copper.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = McDaniel\n  | first = Robert\n  | title = The Elegant Art of Handmade Soap: Making, Scenting, Coloring, and Shaping\n  | publisher = Krause Publications\n  | location = Iola, WI\n  | year = 1997\n  | isbn = 0-87341-832-8\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/fdcact/fdcact4.htm |title=Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.usp.org/fcc/ |title=Food Chemicals Codex |publisher=United States Pharmacopeia |access-date=2008-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201141105/http://www.usp.org/fcc/ |archive-date=2012-02-01 |url-status=dead }}\n\n[[Category:Bases (chemistry)]]\n[[Category:Hydroxides]]\n[[Category:Household chemicals]]\n[[Category:Deliquescent substances]]\n[[Category:Desiccants]]\n[[Category:Soaps]]\n[[Category:Sodium compounds]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n[[File:Potassium hydroxide.jpg|thumbnail|Pellets of potash lye ([[potassium hydroxide]])]]\n[[File:SodiumHydroxide.jpg|thumbnail|Pellets of soda lye ([[sodium hydroxide]])]]\nA '''lye''' is a [[Alkali metal hydroxide|metal hydroxide]] traditionally obtained by [[leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] ashes, or a strong [[alkali]] which is highly [[water soluble|soluble in water]] producing [[corrosive|caustic]] [[base (chemistry)|basic]] solutions. \"Lye\" refers most commonly refers to [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH), but historically has been used for [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH).\n\nToday, lye is commercially manufactured using a [[Membrane (selective barrier)|membrane cell]] [[chloralkali process]].

This method is much quicker than cold process, as it doesn't take several weeks to complete.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n=== Household ===\n[[File:NaOH - drain-cleaner.jpg|thumbnail|Bottles of [[drain cleaner#Alkaline drain openers|alkaline drain cleaner]]s containing lye]]\nLyes are also valued for their cleaning effects. Sodium hydroxide is commonly the major constituent in commercial and industrial [[cleaning agent|oven cleaner]]s and clogged [[drain opener#Alkaline drain openers|drain opener]]s, due to its [[fat|grease]]-dissolving abilities. Lyes decompose greases via [[ester hydrolysis|alkaline ester hydrolysis]], yielding [[water-soluble]] residues that are easily removed by rinsing.\n\n=== Tissue digestion ===\nSodium or potassium hydroxide can be used to digest tissues of animal carcasses.  Often referred to as [[Alkaline hydrolysis (death custom)|alkaline hydrolysis]], the process involves placing the carcass or body into a sealed chamber, adding a mixture of lye and water and the application of heat to accelerate the process. After several hours the chamber will contain a liquid with coffee-like appearance,<ref name=\"Ayres\">{{citation|last1=Ayres |first1=Chris |date=27 February 2010 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/americas/article2002276.ece |title=Clean green finish that sends a loved one down the drain |publisher=Times Online |accessdate=2013-02-20|newspaper=The Times }}</ref><ref name=\"carcassdisposal\">{{citation |last1=Thacker |first1=H.

When in proximity to a lye that is dissolving in an open container of water, the use of a vapor-resistant face mask is recommended. Adding lye to water too quickly can cause the solution to boil.\n\n=== Storage ===\nSolid lyes are [[deliquescent]]s and have a strong affinity for air moisture. Solid lyes will deliquesce or dissolve when exposed to open air, absorbing a relatively large amount of water vapour. Accordingly, lyes are stored in air-tight plastic containers. Glass is not a good material to be used for storage as lyes are mildly corrosive to it. Similar to the case of other corrosives, the containers should be labeled to indicate the potential danger of the contents and stored away from children, pets, heat, and moisture.\n\n=== Hazardous reactions ===\nThe majority of safety concerns with lye are also common with most corrosives, such as their potentially destructive effects on [[tissue (biology)|living tissue]]s; examples are the [[skin]], [[flesh]], and the [[cornea]]. Solutions containing lyes can cause [[chemical burn]]s, permanent injuries, scarring and [[blindness]], immediately upon contact. Lyes may be harmful or even fatal if swallowed; ingestion can cause [[esophageal stricture]]. Moreover, the [[solvation]] of dry [[solid]] lyes is highly [[exothermic]]; the resulting [[heat]] may cause additional burns or ignite flammables.\n\nThe reaction between sodium hydroxide and a few metals is also hazardous. [[Aluminium]] reacts with lyes to produce [[hydrogen]] gas. Since hydrogen is [[flammable]], mixing a large quantity of a lye such as sodium hydroxide with aluminum in a closed container is dangerous\u2014especially when the system is at a high temperature, which speeds up the reaction. In addition to aluminum, lyes may also react with [[magnesium]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], [[chromium]], [[brass]] or [[bronze]]\u2014producing hydrogen gas.  Both the potassium and sodium forms are able to dissolve copper.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = McDaniel\n  | first = Robert\n  | title = The Elegant Art of Handmade Soap: Making, Scenting, Coloring, and Shaping\n  | publisher = Krause Publications\n  | location = Iola, WI\n  | year = 1997\n  | isbn = 0-87341-832-8\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/fdcact/fdcact4.htm |title=Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.usp.org/fcc/ |title=Food Chemicals Codex |publisher=United States Pharmacopeia |access-date=2008-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201141105/http://www.usp.org/fcc/ |archive-date=2012-02-01 |url-status=dead }}\n\n[[Category:Bases (chemistry)]]\n[[Category:Hydroxides]]\n[[Category:Household chemicals]]\n[[Category:Deliquescent substances]]\n[[Category:Desiccants]]\n[[Category:Soaps]]\n[[Category:Sodium compounds]]\n", "name_user": "Xvdces", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lye"}
