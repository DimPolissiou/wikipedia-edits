The word means \"the place where it comes out\"; that is, where the [[Aniak River]] flows into the Kuskokwim. The local [[Yup'ik people]] had deserted the original village at Aniak by the early 19th century, when Russian explorers first arrived in the area.\n\n20th-century prospectors believed that the early Russian traders discovered [[gold]] in a tributary to the Kuskokwim called \"Yellow River\" in 1832. Many think that the Yellow River these traders referred to is the Aniak River.<ref>Brown, Charles M. Alaska's Kuskokwim River Region. Bureau of Land Management. Anchorage, Alaska: Bureau of Land Management, State Office, 1983. 101.</ref> A [[mercury (element)|mercury]] deposit was discovered by Russian traders near the trading post called [[Kolmakov Redoubt]] {{convert|22|mi|km}} east of Aniak in 1838.<ref>Spurr, J.E., 1900, A reconnaissance in southwestern Alaska in 1898: U.S. Geological Survey 20th Annual Report, Part 7, p. 31-264.</ref> Placer gold was found by Russian traders in New York Creek {{convert|30|mi|km}} east of Aniak in 1844.<ref>Berry, M.J., 1973, A history of mining on the Kenai Peninsula: Seattle, Washington, Alaska Northwest Publishing Company, 214 p.</ref> The Russians, however, did not engage in any significant mining activities, and it wasn't until after the purchase of Alaska in 1867 that the American prospectors began seriously investigating the potential for prospecting along the Kuskokwim river. A handful of prospecting parties began venturing into the area, however they had to travel great distances to an area where trading posts were few and far between, so the activity was limited especially given the exposure of other late 19th century strikes in Alaska which were better served by existing infrastructure.\n\nThe euphoria caused by the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in 1897-98 would set the stage for a change however with thousands of prospectors across the territory poised to make a rush upon rumor of each potential new strike. One such rush was the Yellow River Stampede of 1900 in which many prospectors left [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] to venture into the Kuskokwim basin upon rumors that someone had found the Yellow River strike despite the fact that the location of that strike was unknown. Finding precious little gold and experiencing substantial hardship, many of these folks would return to Nome following the difficult winter of 1901, but some stayed behind to continue their search. A 1906 gold discovery at the head of the [[Innoko River]], a tributary of the [[Yukon River]], caused another gold rush in 1907 with many of the prospectors choosing to access the site via the Kuskokwim River instead and trading posts were established at the [[Takotna River]] which required riverboat service to travel the Kuskokwim river. With riverboat service now available on the Kuskokwim River, prospecting activity picked up and some strikes were starting to occur in the Kuskokwim basin. Strikes were made at Crooked Creek, George River, New York Creek, and Aniak River among others. Most strikes were short lived.  However, the Kuskokwim River was now seeing an increase in river traffic that needed servicing.\n\nIn 1910, a lone prospector named \"Old Man\" Keeler reportedly found placer gold in the Aniak River basin. In 1911, three prospectors, Harry Buhro, E. W. \"Kid\" Fisher, and Fred Labelle, who had been working the George River area decided to give the Aniak River basin area a try and discovered gold at Marvel, Fisher, and Dome creeks.<ref>Maddren, A.G., Iditarod Pioneer. US Geological Survey Bulletin 622. 1911. p. 301.</ref> These creeks feed into the Aniak River about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south of Aniak. Initially prospectors would reach this site by poling up the river in boats, however that was a difficult journey due to the nature of the river. The trip would take 15 to 20 days from the Kuskokwim river. By 1913, a hydraulic plant had been installed at Marvel Creek and in 1914 construction of a {{convert|70|mi|km|adj=on}} cat trail began starting {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} south of Aniak on the mouth of the Aniak Slough and proceeding to the diggings at Marvel Creek. The cat trail was last used in the spring of 2006 by miners still working claims.\n\nThis same year, Tom L. Johnson homesteaded the site of the long-abandoned Yup'ik village in the Aniak area and opened a store and post office there to service prospectors and miners in the vicinity. Willie Pete and Sam Simeon brought their Yup'ik families from [[Ohagamiut, Alaska|Ohagamiut]] to Aniak. In 1936 a territorial school was opened. In anticipation of the [[Lend-Lease]] program to help supply Russia with war materials, construction of an airfield began in 1939. With the airfield in place, Aniak became the transportation hub for villages in the area including [[Chuathbaluk, Alaska|Chuathbaluk]], [[Anvik, Alaska|Anvik]], [[Upper Kalskag, Alaska|Kalskag]], [[Crooked Creek, Alaska|Crooked Creek]], [[Holy Cross, Alaska|Holy Cross]] and others. In 1956 during the [[Cold War]], construction of a [[White Alice Communications System|White Alice]] Relay Station began bringing money, jobs, and communication capability to the area. The impact to the community from the relay station was immediate as the first telephone capable of long distance phone calls was installed at the Aniak Lodge in 1957 and Aniak's population more than doubled from 142 in 1950 to 308 in 1960. The 2000 census places Aniak's population at 572.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Alaska}}\n*

The word means \"the place where it comes out\"; that is, where the [[Aniak River]] flows into the Kuskokwim. The local [[Yup'ik people]] had deserted the original village at Aniak by the early 19th century, when Russian explorers first arrived in the area.\n\n20th-century prospectors believed that the early Russian traders discovered [[gold]] in a tributary to the Kuskokwim called \"Yellow River\" in 1832. Many think that the Yellow River these traders referred to is the Aniak River.<ref>Brown, Charles M. Alaska's Kuskokwim River Region. Bureau of Land Management. Anchorage, Alaska: Bureau of Land Management, State Office, 1983. 101.</ref> A [[mercury (element)|mercury]] deposit was discovered by Russian traders near the trading post called [[Kolmakov Redoubt]] {{convert|22|mi|km}} east of Aniak in 1838.<ref>Spurr, J.E., 1900, A reconnaissance in southwestern Alaska in 1898: U.S. Geological Survey 20th Annual Report, Part 7, p. 31-264.</ref> Placer gold was found by Russian traders in New York Creek {{convert|30|mi|km}} east of Aniak in 1844.<ref>Berry, M.J., 1973, A history of mining on the Kenai Peninsula: Seattle, Washington, Alaska Northwest Publishing Company, 214 p.</ref> The Russians, however, did not engage in any significant mining activities, and it wasn't until after the purchase of Alaska in 1867 that the American prospectors began seriously investigating the potential for prospecting along the Kuskokwim river. A handful of prospecting parties began venturing into the area, however they had to travel great distances to an area where trading posts were few and far between, so the activity was limited especially given the exposure of other late 19th century strikes in Alaska which were better served by existing infrastructure.\n\nThe euphoria caused by the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in 1897-98 would set the stage for a change however with thousands of prospectors across the territory poised to make a rush upon rumor of each potential new strike. One such rush was the Yellow River Stampede of 1900 in which many prospectors left [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] to venture into the Kuskokwim basin upon rumors that someone had found the Yellow River strike despite the fact that the location of that strike was unknown. Finding precious little gold and experiencing substantial hardship, many of these folks would return to Nome following the difficult winter of 1901, but some stayed behind to continue their search. A 1906 gold discovery at the head of the [[Innoko River]], a tributary of the [[Yukon River]], caused another gold rush in 1907 with many of the prospectors choosing to access the site via the Kuskokwim River instead and trading posts were established at the [[Takotna River]] which required riverboat service to travel the Kuskokwim river. With riverboat service now available on the Kuskokwim River, prospecting activity picked up and some strikes were starting to occur in the Kuskokwim basin. Strikes were made at Crooked Creek, George River, New York Creek, and Aniak River among others. Most strikes were short lived.  However, the Kuskokwim River was now seeing an increase in river traffic that needed servicing.\n\nIn 1910, a lone prospector named \"Old Man\" Keeler reportedly found placer gold in the Aniak River basin. In 1911, three prospectors, Harry Buhro, E. W. \"Kid\" Fisher, and Fred Labelle, who had been working the George River area decided to give the Aniak River basin area a try and discovered gold at Marvel, Fisher, and Dome creeks.<ref>Maddren, A.G., Iditarod Pioneer. US Geological Survey Bulletin 622. 1911. p. 301.</ref> These creeks feed into the Aniak River about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south of Aniak. Initially prospectors would reach this site by poling up the river in boats, however that was a difficult journey due to the nature of the river. The trip would take 15 to 20 days from the Kuskokwim river. By 1913, a hydraulic plant had been installed at Marvel Creek and in 1914 construction of a {{convert|70|mi|km|adj=on}} cat trail began starting {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} south of Aniak on the mouth of the Aniak Slough and proceeding to the diggings at Marvel Creek. The cat trail was last used in the spring of 2006 by miners still working claims.\n\nThis same year, Tom L. Johnson homesteaded the site of the long-abandoned Yup'ik village in the Aniak area and opened a store and post office there to service prospectors and miners in the vicinity. Willie Pete and Sam Simeon brought their Yup'ik families from [[Ohagamiut, Alaska|Ohagamiut]] to Aniak. In 1936 a territorial school was opened. In anticipation of the [[Lend-Lease]] program to help supply Russia with war materials, construction of an airfield began in 1939. With the airfield in place, Aniak became the transportation hub for villages in the area including [[Chuathbaluk, Alaska|Chuathbaluk]], [[Anvik, Alaska|Anvik]], [[Upper Kalskag, Alaska|Kalskag]], [[Crooked Creek, Alaska|Crooked Creek]], [[Holy Cross, Alaska|Holy Cross]] and others. In 1956 during the [[Cold War]], construction of a [[White Alice Communications System|White Alice]] Relay Station began bringing money, jobs, and communication capability to the area. The impact to the community from the relay station was immediate as the first telephone capable of long distance phone calls was installed at the Aniak Lodge in 1957 and Aniak's population more than doubled from 142 in 1950 to 308 in 1960. The 2000 census places Aniak's population at 572.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Alaska}}\n* [https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/dcra/DCRAExternal/community/Details/319d7670-7304-4cb9-9b6b-afe9d3f2b94f Aniak] at the Community Database Online from the [[Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development|Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs]]\n* Maps from the [[Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200242/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/alari/images/maps/6_4_19map.pdf 2000], [https://web.archive.org/web/20151222092129/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/census/placemaps/03550.pdf 2010]\n\n{{Coord|display=title|61.578821|-159.550255}}\n{{Bethel Census Area, Alaska}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Bethel Census Area, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Mining communities in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Road-inaccessible communities of Alaska]]\n", "name_user": "Menchi", "label": "safe", "comment": "langtags", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniak,_Alaska"}

Fog and low clouds are common during July and August, and may preclude access. The lake and river are ice-free from June through mid-November.  A weather station was operated between 1958 and 1973; however the climate data has many missing observations and appears slightly irregular, with March in many years being colder than February.

The spelling of the Yupik word \"Aleknagik\" has been disputed, because Yupik was an unwritten language. The name was described by the resident Yako family in 1930 as meaning \"Wrong Way Home\", because Nushagak River residents returning to their homes upriver would sometimes become lost in the fog and find themselves swept up the Wood River with the tide, inadvertently arriving at Aleknagik Lake.\n\nRecorded history may not define the exact place of Aleknagik, and various reports have reported the original site with the name \"Alaqnaqiq\" as far to the south near entrance to the Wood River. James Van Stone, an anthropologist who traveled to [[Saint Petersburg]] and read diaries of the Russian explorers from 1867, noted that explorers traveled to \"Aleknagik Lake\" (in a spelling that is Russian but sounds out to Aleknagik).\n\nIn 2005, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources applied to own the waterways and compiled an extensive history of the area in their application (see Links below).\n\nThe 1929 U.S. Census found 55 people living in the \"Wood River village\" area to the south. During 1930, there were five families living on the shores of the lake year-round, the Waskeys, Polleys, Hansons, Yakos, and Smiths. A log cabin territorial school was built on the south shore of the lake in 1933, and Josie Waskey was the first teacher. Attracted by the school, other facilities, and plentiful fish, game and timber, a number of families from the [[Goodnews Bay, Alaska|Goodnews]], [[Togiak, Alaska|Togiak]], and Kulukak areas relocated to Aleknagik. A post office was established in March 1937, with Mrs Mabel M. Smith as postmaster.<ref>Dickerson, Ora B., \"120 Years of Alaska Postmasters, 1867-1987\", Cammarata, Carl J., Scotts, Michigan, 1989, p 18.</ref>  A two-story framed school with a teacher apartment was constructed in 1938. By 1939, Aleknagik had 78 residents, over 30 buildings, and a small sawmill. In the late 1940s, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] mission and school were established on the north shore. During the 1950s, a [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] church and a [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] church were built in Aleknagik, and over 35 families lived along the lake. In 1959, the state constructed a {{convert|25|mi|km|adj=on}} road connecting the south shore to Dillingham. The road was passable only during the summer months, until the late 1980s when it was upgraded and maintained year-round. The city was incorporated in 1973. Over 24 additional square miles were annexed to the city in April 2000.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Moravian church members formed a colony on the north shore of the lake, across from the post office. The Moravian pastor and his wife's family built homes there and remain in the community.\n\nIn the late 19th century there were about 200 people in Aleknagik and the other Wood River villages. Varied illnesses killed most of the residents of the villages. The few survivors moved out of the area. In fall of 1930, there was one Yupik family living at the top of the Wood River in Aleknagik, and the village grew to about 40 people by 1931. By 1940, Aleknagik had over 30 buildings, including a community school, church, and small sawmill. The local religious mission school, run by [[Seventh-day Adventists]], brought several new families to Aleknagik. Other families came to the village because of the territorial school.\n\nIn 1938, a territorial school was constructed in Aleknagik. During this period, a Moravian church, a Russian Orthodox church and a Seventh-day Adventist mission school were established in the community. In 1959, the State of Alaska constructed a {{convert|22|mi|km|adj=on}} road connecting Aleknagik to [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]].\n\nThe Aleknagik Traditional Council, a federally-recognized tribe, is located in the community.\n\nIn August 2010, an airplane carrying former Senator [[Ted Stevens]] [[2010 Alaska Turbo Otter crash|crashed near Alegnagik]], resulting in the death of Stevens and four others.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population|align=left\n|1940= 78\n|1950= 153\n|1960= 181\n|1970= 128\n|1980= 154\n|1990= 185\n|2000= 221\n|2010= 219\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=224\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAleknagik first appeared on 1940 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village.<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/33973538v1ch11.pdf</ref> It appeared as Aleknagik Lake (uninc.) on the 1960 census, and neighboring village of Aleknagik Mission showed 50 residents (for a combined total area of 231).<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37721577v1p3ch2.pdf</ref> In 1970,<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1970a_ak-01.pdf</ref> it appeared again simply as Aleknagik and was incorporated in 1973.\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2000, there were 221 people, 70 households, and 52 families residing in the city.  The population density was 19.1 people per square mile (7.4/km\u00b2).  There were 107 housing units at an average density of 9.3 per square&nbsp;mile (3.6/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the city was 13.57% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 81.90% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 1.36% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 3.17% from two or more races.  1.36% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 70 households out of which 41.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.6% were married couples living together, 11.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.3% were non-families. 17.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 2.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 3.16 and the average family size was 3.62.\n\nIn the city, the age distribution of the population shows 37.1% under the age of 18, 9.0% from 18 to 24, 29.9% from 25 to 44, 16.3% from 45 to 64, and 7.7% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 28 years. For every 100 females, there were 121.0 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 131.7 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $22,750, and the median income for a family was $30,625. Males had a median income of $29,583 versus $75,487 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $10,973.  About 21.7% of families and 40.8% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 49.0% of those under the age of eighteen and 21.4% of those sixty five or over.\n\n==Public services==\nThe majority of residents (49 homes) have household plumbing, and most use individual wells. 12 homes do not have water or sewer service \u2013 some haul water from the community center, and a few are served by a spring water catchment system. Septic tanks, leechate fields and public sewage lagoons are used for sewage disposal. The North Shore uses eleven shared residential effluent pumps (REP units) which discharge into a piped system. There are three landfill sites. The North Shore landfill is being relocated; the South Shore landfill has an incinerator but is unfenced. A third landfill is located {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the South Shore, on the West side of the Aleknagik-Dillingham road.  Electricity is provided by Nushugak Electric Cooperative. Local hospitals or health clinics include North Shore Health Clinic (842-5512), South Shore Health Clinic (842-2185) or Kanakanak Hospital in Dillingham.  Both, North and South Shore Clinics are Primary Health Care facilities. Aleknagik is classified as a highway village, it is found in EMS Region 2I in the Bristol Bay Region. Emergency Services have limited highway, air and satellite access. Emergency service is provided by volunteers and a health aide  Auxiliary health care is provided by Aleknagik First Responders Group (907-842-2085); or Kanakanak Hospital in Dillingham (25 road miles).\n\nThere is one school located in the community, Aleknagik School, operated by the [[Southwest Region School District]].<ref>\"[http://www.swrsd.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=52&Itemid=133 Aleknagik].\" [[Southwest Region School District]].

Trapping is also an important means of income. Most families depend to some extent on subsistence activities to supplement their livelihoods. Salmon, freshwater fish, moose, caribou, and berries are harvested. Poor fish returns and prices since 1997 have significantly affected the community.\n\nAleknagik is the only village in the region coming close to a road link with Dillingham; a {{convert|25|mi|adj=on}} road connects to the south shore of Aleknagik Lake from which the city is within walking distance. The [[Aleknagik Airport|\"New Aleknagik\" airport]] is a State-owned {{convert|2070|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} by {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} gravel airstrip located on the north shore, and regular flights are scheduled through Dillingham. The north shore of the lake is not road accessible; residents use skiffs to travel to town on the south shore. Moody's Aleknagik Seaplane Base, also on the north shore, accommodates float planes. There are two additional airstrips, the public Tripod Airport, a {{Convert|1250|ft|adj=on}} turf-gravel airstrip located {{convert|2|mi|0}} southeast of Aleknagik, and the Adventist Mission School Airport, a {{convert|1200|ft|adj=on}} gravel/dirt airstrip with a crosswind runway. The State owns and operates a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} dock on the north shore of Aleknagik Lake. A [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], barge landing, boat launch ramp and boat lift are available on the north shore.

The spelling of the Yupik word \"Aleknagik\" has been disputed, because Yupik was an unwritten language. The name was described by the resident Yako family in 1930 as meaning \"Wrong Way Home\", because Nushagak River residents returning to their homes upriver would sometimes become lost in the fog and find themselves swept up the Wood River with the tide, inadvertently arriving at Aleknagik Lake.\n\nRecorded history may not define the exact place of Aleknagik, and various reports have reported the original site with the name \"Alaqnaqiq\" as far to the south near entrance to the Wood River. James Van Stone, an anthropologist who traveled to [[Saint Petersburg]] and read diaries of the Russian explorers from 1867, noted that explorers traveled to \"Aleknagik Lake\" (in a spelling that is Russian but sounds out to Aleknagik).\n\nIn 2005, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources applied to own the waterways and compiled an extensive history of the area in their application (see Links below).\n\nThe 1929 U.S. Census found 55 people living in the \"Wood River village\" area to the south. During 1930, there were five families living on the shores of the lake year-round, the Waskeys, Polleys, Hansons, Yakos, and Smiths. A log cabin territorial school was built on the south shore of the lake in 1933, and Josie Waskey was the first teacher. Attracted by the school, other facilities, and plentiful fish, game and timber, a number of families from the [[Goodnews Bay, Alaska|Goodnews]], [[Togiak, Alaska|Togiak]], and Kulukak areas relocated to Aleknagik. A post office was established in March 1937, with Mrs Mabel M. Smith as postmaster.<ref>Dickerson, Ora B., \"120 Years of Alaska Postmasters, 1867-1987\", Cammarata, Carl J., Scotts, Michigan, 1989, p 18.</ref>  A two-story framed school with a teacher apartment was constructed in 1938. By 1939, Aleknagik had 78 residents, over 30 buildings, and a small sawmill. In the late 1940s, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] mission and school were established on the north shore. During the 1950s, a [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] church and a [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] church were built in Aleknagik, and over 35 families lived along the lake. In 1959, the state constructed a {{convert|25|mi|km|adj=on}} road connecting the south shore to Dillingham. The road was passable only during the summer months, until the late 1980s when it was upgraded and maintained year-round. The city was incorporated in 1973. Over 24 additional square miles were annexed to the city in April 2000.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Moravian church members formed a colony on the north shore of the lake, across from the post office. The Moravian pastor and his wife's family built homes there and remain in the community.\n\nIn the late 19th century there were about 200 people in Aleknagik and the other Wood River villages. Varied illnesses killed most of the residents of the villages. The few survivors moved out of the area. In fall of 1930, there was one Yupik family living at the top of the Wood River in Aleknagik, and the village grew to about 40 people by 1931. By 1940, Aleknagik had over 30 buildings, including a community school, church, and small sawmill. The local religious mission school, run by [[Seventh-day Adventists]], brought several new families to Aleknagik. Other families came to the village because of the territorial school.\n\nIn 1938, a territorial school was constructed in Aleknagik. During this period, a Moravian church, a Russian Orthodox church and a Seventh-day Adventist mission school were established in the community. In 1959, the State of Alaska constructed a {{convert|22|mi|km|adj=on}} road connecting Aleknagik to [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]].\n\nThe Aleknagik Traditional Council, a federally-recognized tribe, is located in the community.\n\nIn August 2010, an airplane carrying former Senator [[Ted Stevens]] [[2010 Alaska Turbo Otter crash|crashed near Alegnagik]], resulting in the death of Stevens and four others.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population|align=left\n|1940= 78\n|1950= 153\n|1960= 181\n|1970= 128\n|1980= 154\n|1990= 185\n|2000= 221\n|2010= 219\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=224\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAleknagik first appeared on 1940 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village.<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/33973538v1ch11.pdf</ref> It appeared as Aleknagik Lake (uninc.) on the 1960 census, and neighboring village of Aleknagik Mission showed 50 residents (for a combined total area of 231).<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37721577v1p3ch2.pdf</ref> In 1970,<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1970a_ak-01.pdf</ref> it appeared again simply as Aleknagik and was incorporated in 1973.\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=U.S. Census website }}</ref> of 2000, there were 221 people, 70 households, and 52 families residing in the city.

Poor fish returns and prices since 1997 have significantly affected the community.\n\nAleknagik is the only village in the region coming close to a road link with Dillingham; a {{convert|25|mi|adj=on}} road connects to the south shore of Aleknagik Lake from which the city is within walking distance. The [[Aleknagik Airport|\"New Aleknagik\" airport]] is a State-owned {{convert|2070|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} by {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} gravel airstrip located on the north shore, and regular flights are scheduled through Dillingham. The north shore of the lake is not road accessible; residents use skiffs to travel to town on the south shore. Moody's Aleknagik Seaplane Base, also on the north shore, accommodates float planes. There are two additional airstrips, the public Tripod Airport, a {{Convert|1250|ft|adj=on}} turf-gravel airstrip located {{convert|2|mi|0}} southeast of Aleknagik, and the Adventist Mission School Airport, a {{convert|1200|ft|adj=on}} gravel/dirt airstrip with a crosswind runway. The State owns and operates a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} dock on the north shore of Aleknagik Lake. A [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], barge landing, boat launch ramp and boat lift are available on the north shore. Vehicles, skiffs, ATVs and snowmachines are the most frequent means of local transportation.\n\nSales tax in the community is 5%, and there is also a 5% accommodations tax. There is no property tax.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Alaska}}\n* [https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/dcra/DCRAExternal/community/Details/c47614a0-11f3-498d-b60d-89eee14e54af Aleknagik] at the Community Database Online from the [[Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development|Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs]]\n* Maps from the [[Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190022/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/alari/images/maps/6_7_9map.pdf 2000], [https://web.archive.org/web/20151222121041/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/census/placemaps/01420.pdf 2010]\n\n{{Coord|display=title|59.275|-158.625}}\n{{Dillingham Census Area, Alaska}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Dillingham Census Area, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Unorganized Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:History of the Alaska Province of the Moravian Church]]\n[[Category:Road-inaccessible communities of Alaska]]\n", "name_user": "Menchi", "label": "safe", "comment": "langtags", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleknagik,_Alaska"}

As of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], the population of the city was 677, up from 652 in 2000.\n\n==Location and Climate==\nAlakanuk is located at 62.688890\u00b0 North, 164.61528\u00b0 West (Sec. 14, T030N, R082W, Seward Meridian).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Alakanuk is located in the Bethel [[Recording District (Alaska)|Recording District]].\n\nAlakanuk is located at the east entrance of Alakanuk Pass, the major southern channel of the [[Yukon River]], {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the Bering Sea. It is part of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge. It lies {{convert|8|mi|km}} southwest of Emmonak, approximately {{convert|162|mi|km}} northwest of Bethel. It is the longest village on the lower Yukon - the development stretches over a {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} area along the Pass. Approximately 25 homes along the bank are being threatened by erosion.\n\nThe climate of Alakanuk is subarctic, averaging {{convert|60|in|mm}} of snowfall and {{convert|19|in|mm}} of total precipitation per year. Temperatures range from between {{convert|-25|to|79|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Heavy winds are frequent during the fall and winter.

The village was first reported by G.R. Putnam of the U.S. Coast & Geodetic Survey in 1899. It was originally settled by a Yup'ik shaman named Anguksuar and his family. A Catholic mission school was built near the village. A post office was established in 1946. In 1948, the school was relocated to St. Mary's, and many families moved from the old school site to Alakanuk. It incorporated as a second-class city in 1969.\n\nA federally recognized tribe is located in the community\u2014the Village of Alakanuk.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population|align=left\n|1940= 61\n|1950= 140\n|1960= 278\n|1970= 414\n|1980= 522\n|1990= 544\n|2000= 652\n|2010= 677\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=773\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAlakanuk first appeared on the 1940 U.S. Census as the unincorporated native village of \"Alaganuck.\"<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/33973538v1ch11.pdf</ref> It returned as Alakanuk in 1950<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/41601749v2p51-54ch2.pdf</ref> and every successive census to date (2010)<ref>https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-1-3.pdf</ref>.

In 1998, 83 homes, the school and teachers' housing were connected to a new piped system. New facilities include a water treatment plant, heated 300,000-gal. water storage tank, vacuum sewage plant, sewage lagoon, Arctic piping, and household plumbing. A new subdivision is currently underway, and nine homes will be connected to the piped utilities. The city has funding from DEC for service connections to 20 homes. Ten homes have been moved from the erosion zone on the river bank and are ready for service. The city is planning to move an additional 10 homes. AVCP is building a 9-home subdivision, including water and sewer mains and service connections, for occupancy in 2002. The city completed a feasibility study for service area 7, which is the area across the river, and would like to obtain funding to make this expansion. The landfill is reported as inactive.

Government employment and retail businesses provide limited year-round employment. Salmon, beluga whale, seal, moose and rabbit provide food sources. Some residents trap. Many residents travel to Emmonak to shop and attend social events and basketball tournaments.\n\n[[Alakanuk Airport]], a State-owned 2,200' long by 55' wide gravel airstrip, is available. An airport relocation project is underway, due to erosion. Grant Aviation, Hageland Aviation and Tanana Air Service offer passenger flight service. Alakanuk is easily accessible from the Yukon River and Bering Sea by barge and riverboat. Most passengers and mail arrive by air. There are no roads connecting Alakanuk with other population centers in the region, but ice roads are used in winter.

As of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], the population of the city was 677, up from 652 in 2000.\n\n==Location and Climate==\nAlakanuk is located at 62.688890\u00b0 North, 164.61528\u00b0 West (Sec. 14, T030N, R082W, Seward Meridian).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Alakanuk is located in the Bethel [[Recording District (Alaska)|Recording District]].\n\nAlakanuk is located at the east entrance of Alakanuk Pass, the major southern channel of the [[Yukon River]], {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the Bering Sea. It is part of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge. It lies {{convert|8|mi|km}} southwest of Emmonak, approximately {{convert|162|mi|km}} northwest of Bethel. It is the longest village on the lower Yukon - the development stretches over a {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} area along the Pass. Approximately 25 homes along the bank are being threatened by erosion.\n\nThe climate of Alakanuk is subarctic, averaging {{convert|60|in|mm}} of snowfall and {{convert|19|in|mm}} of total precipitation per year. Temperatures range from between {{convert|-25|to|79|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Heavy winds are frequent during the fall and winter. The Yukon River is used as an ice road during freeze-up, from November through May.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|41.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|32.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|8.7|sqmi|km2}} of it (21.14%) is water.\n\n==History and culture==\nAlakanuk is a Yup'ik word meaning \"wrong way\" or \"mistake village\", aptly applied to a village on this maze of watercourses. The village was first reported by G.R. Putnam of the U.S. Coast & Geodetic Survey in 1899. It was originally settled by a Yup'ik shaman named Anguksuar and his family. A Catholic mission school was built near the village. A post office was established in 1946. In 1948, the school was relocated to St. Mary's, and many families moved from the old school site to Alakanuk. It incorporated as a second-class city in 1969.\n\nA federally recognized tribe is located in the community\u2014the Village of Alakanuk.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population|align=left\n|1940= 61\n|1950= 140\n|1960= 278\n|1970= 414\n|1980= 522\n|1990= 544\n|2000= 652\n|2010= 677\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=773\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAlakanuk first appeared on the 1940 U.S. Census as the unincorporated native village of \"Alaganuck.\"<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/33973538v1ch11.pdf</ref> It returned as Alakanuk in 1950<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/41601749v2p51-54ch2.pdf</ref> and every successive census to date (2010)<ref>https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-1-3.pdf</ref>.

The population density was 20.2 people per square mile (7.8/km\u00b2).  There were 160 housing units at an average density of 4.9 per square&nbsp;mile (1.9/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the city was 1.99% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 95.40% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 0.15% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], and 2.45% from two or more races.\n\nThere were 139 households out of which 59.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.6% were married couples living together, 12.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 15.1% were non-families. 10.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 2.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 4.69 and the average family size was 5.19.\n\nIn the city, the age distribution of the population shows 44.6% under the age of 18, 12.9% from 18 to 24, 21.9% from 25 to 44, 13.7% from 45 to 64, and 6.9% who were 65 years of age or older.

For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 109.9 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $26,346, and the median income for a family was $26,500. Males had a median income of $19,792 versus $32,500 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $6,884.  About 32.5% of families and 33.8% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 34.1% of those under age 18 and 25.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Facilities, Utilities, and Health Care==\nThe City operates the water and piped sewer system and the central watering point. Approximately 90% of homes are connected. There is a sewage lagoon available for individuals to dump their [[Bucket toilet|honey bucket]]s. The City Council is the policy-making body for the utility. Water is derived from the Alakanuk Slough; it is treated, stored in a tank, and piped to most of the community. In 1998, 83 homes, the school and teachers' housing were connected to a new piped system. New facilities include a water treatment plant, heated 300,000-gal. water storage tank, vacuum sewage plant, sewage lagoon, Arctic piping, and household plumbing. A new subdivision is currently underway, and nine homes will be connected to the piped utilities. The city has funding from DEC for service connections to 20 homes. Ten homes have been moved from the erosion zone on the river bank and are ready for service. The city is planning to move an additional 10 homes. AVCP is building a 9-home subdivision, including water and sewer mains and service connections, for occupancy in 2002. The city completed a feasibility study for service area 7, which is the area across the river, and would like to obtain funding to make this expansion. The landfill is reported as inactive. Electricity is provided by AVEC. Local hospitals or health clinics include Alakanuk Health Clinic and Pearl E. Johnson Sub-Regional Clinic in Emmonak.  Alakanuk Health Clinic is a Primary Health Care facility. Alakanuk is classified as an isolated village, located in EMS Region 7A in the Yukon/Kuskokwim Region. Emergency Services have coastal and air access. Emergency service is provided by a health aide\n\n==Education==\nK-12 students attend Alakanuk School, operated by the [[Lower Yukon School District]].\n\n==Economy and Transportation==\nAlakanuk experiences a seasonal economy. 76 residents hold commercial fishing permits. Many have gill net permits, and set net fishermen sell their salmon to Seattle fish buyers. Poor fish returns since 1998 have significantly affected the community. Government employment and retail businesses provide limited year-round employment. Salmon, beluga whale, seal, moose and rabbit provide food sources. Some residents trap. Many residents travel to Emmonak to shop and attend social events and basketball tournaments.\n\n[[Alakanuk Airport]], a State-owned 2,200' long by 55' wide gravel airstrip, is available. An airport relocation project is underway, due to erosion. Grant Aviation, Hageland Aviation and Tanana Air Service offer passenger flight service. Alakanuk is easily accessible from the Yukon River and Bering Sea by barge and riverboat. Most passengers and mail arrive by air. There are no roads connecting Alakanuk with other population centers in the region, but ice roads are used in winter. Snowmachines and boats are used for local travel.\n\nTaxes:\tSales: 4%, Property: None, Special: None\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Segundo Llorente|Father Segundo Llorente]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit priest]] born in [[Spain]], was elected to the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] in 1960 as a [[write-in candidate]] while stationed in Alakanuk.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Alaska}}\n* [https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/dcra/DCRAExternal/community/Details/ce7e59f5-2ed0-4555-8468-0a18a3a36191 Alakanuk] at the Community Database Online from the [[Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development|Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs]]\n* Maps from the [[Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194705/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/alari/images/maps/6_26_6map.pdf 2000], [https://web.archive.org/web/20151222120351/http://labor.alaska.gov/research/census/placemaps/01200.pdf 2010]\n\n{{Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Cities in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Unorganized Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Road-inaccessible communities of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Yukon River]]\n", "name_user": "Menchi", "label": "safe", "comment": "langtags", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alakanuk,_Alaska"}

The republic was established in the wake of the [[Aftermath of World War I#Austria-Hungary|dissolution of Austria-Hungary]] following [[World War I]]. The First Hungarian Republic replaced the [[Kingdom of Hungary (Austria-Hungary)|Kingdom of Hungary]], and was in turn replaced by the [[Hungarian Republic (1919\u201320)|Hungarian Republic]], another short-lived state from 1919 to 1920. During the rule of Count [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]]'s pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approximately 75% of its former pre-World War I territories ({{convert|325411|km2|abbr=on}}) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation. \n\nFollowing this period, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers of World War I]] severely pressured the Hungarians into retreating behind post-war demarcation lines as a provision to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], their attempt to establish new [[nation state]]s among the former kingdom's non-Hungarian citizens&nbsp;\u2013 the principal beneficiaries of which were the [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], the [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]], and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]].

That day, King [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]] appointed the revolt's leader, [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]], as Hungarian prime minister. Almost his first act was to formally terminate the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. On 13 November, Charles [[Charles I of Austria#Proclamations|issued a proclamation]] withdrawing from Hungarian politics. A few days later the provisional government proclaimed Hungary a people's republic,<ref name=\"november16\"/> with K\u00e1rolyi as both prime minister and interim president. This event ended 400 years of rule by the [[House of Habsburg]].\n\nThe K\u00e1rolyi government's measures failed to stem popular discontent, especially when the [[Entente powers]] began distributing slices of what many considered [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|Hungary's traditional territory]] to the majority ethnic groups in [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]]. The new government and its supporters had pinned their hopes for maintaining Hungary's territorial integrity on the abandonment of [[Cisleithania]] and Germany, the securing of a separate peace, and exploiting K\u00e1rolyi's close connections in the [[French Third Republic]].\n\nThe Entente considered Hungary a partner in the defeated [[Dual Monarchy]], and dashed the Hungarians' hopes with the delivery of successive diplomatic notes. Each demanded the surrender of more land to other ethnic groups. On 20 March 1919, the French head of the Entente mission in Budapest gave K\u00e1rolyi a note<!--Vix note--> delineating the final postwar boundaries, which the Hungarians found unacceptable.<ref>{{cite book |last= Romsics|first= Ign\u00e1c|title= Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XX. sz\u00e1zadban|year= 2004|publisher= Osiris Kiad\u00f3|location= Budapest|language= Hungarian|isbn= 963-389-590-1|page= 123}}</ref> K\u00e1rolyi and Prime Minister [[D\u00e9nes Berinkey]] were now in an impossible position. They knew accepting the French note would endanger the country's territorial integrity, but were in no position to reject it. In protest, Berinkey resigned.\n\nK\u00e1rolyi informed the cabinet that only the [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] could possibly form a new government. Unknown to K\u00e1rolyi, however, the Social Democrats had merged with the [[Hungarian Communist Party]]; the latter promised that the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] would help Hungary to restore its [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|original borders]].

The republic was established in the wake of the [[Aftermath of World War I#Austria-Hungary|dissolution of Austria-Hungary]] following [[World War I]]. The First Hungarian Republic replaced the [[Kingdom of Hungary (Austria-Hungary)|Kingdom of Hungary]], and was in turn replaced by the [[Hungarian Republic (1919\u201320)|Hungarian Republic]], another short-lived state from 1919 to 1920. During the rule of Count [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]]'s pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approximately 75% of its former pre-World War I territories ({{convert|325411|km2|abbr=on}}) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation. \n\nFollowing this period, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers of World War I]] severely pressured the Hungarians into retreating behind post-war demarcation lines as a provision to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], their attempt to establish new [[nation state]]s among the former kingdom's non-Hungarian citizens&nbsp;\u2013 the principal beneficiaries of which were the [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], the [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]], and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]].

That day, King [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]] appointed the revolt's leader, [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]], as Hungarian prime minister. Almost his first act was to formally terminate the [[personal union]] between Austria and Hungary. On 13 November, Charles [[Charles I of Austria#Proclamations|issued a proclamation]] withdrawing from Hungarian politics. A few days later the provisional government proclaimed Hungary a people's republic,<ref name=\"november16\"/> with K\u00e1rolyi as both prime minister and interim president. This event ended 400 years of rule by the [[House of Habsburg]].\n\nThe K\u00e1rolyi government's measures failed to stem popular discontent, especially when the [[Entente powers]] began distributing slices of what many considered [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|Hungary's traditional territory]] to the majority ethnic groups in [[Kingdom of Romania]], the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]]. The new government and its supporters had pinned their hopes for maintaining Hungary's territorial integrity on the abandonment of [[Cisleithania]] and Germany, the securing of a separate peace, and exploiting K\u00e1rolyi's close connections in the [[French Third Republic]].\n\nThe Entente considered Hungary a partner in the defeated [[Dual Monarchy]], and dashed the Hungarians' hopes with the delivery of successive diplomatic notes. Each demanded the surrender of more land to other ethnic groups. On 20 March 1919, the French head of the Entente mission in Budapest gave K\u00e1rolyi a note<!--Vix note--> delineating the final postwar boundaries, which the Hungarians found unacceptable.<ref>{{cite book |last= Romsics|first= Ign\u00e1c|title= Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XX. sz\u00e1zadban|year= 2004|publisher= Osiris Kiad\u00f3|location= Budapest|language= Hungarian|isbn= 963-389-590-1|page= 123}}</ref> K\u00e1rolyi and Prime Minister [[D\u00e9nes Berinkey]] were now in an impossible position. They knew accepting the French note would endanger the country's territorial integrity, but were in no position to reject it. In protest, Berinkey resigned.\n\nK\u00e1rolyi informed the cabinet that only the [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] could possibly form a new government. Unknown to K\u00e1rolyi, however, the Social Democrats had merged with the [[Hungarian Communist Party]]; the latter promised that the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] would help Hungary to restore its [[Greater Hungary (political concept)|original borders]]. Although the Social Democrats held a majority in the newly merged Hungarian Socialist Party, the communists led by [[B\u00e9la Kun]] immediately seized control and announced the establishment of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] on 21 March 1919.\n\n=== Re-establishment and dissolution ===\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Republic on 1 August 1919, a social democratic government\u2014the so-called \"trade union government\"\u2014came to power under the leadership of [[Gyula Peidl]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Romsics|first=I.|date=2004|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XX. sz\u00e1zadban|location=Budapest|publisher=Osiris Kiad\u00f3|lang=hu|isbn=963-389-590-1|page=132}}</ref> A decree was issued on 2 August restoring the form of government and the official state name back to \"People's Republic\".<ref name=\"august2\"/> During its brief existence, the Peidl government began to abrogate the edicts passed by the Communist regime.<ref>{{cite book|title=Minisztertan\u00e1csi jegyz\u0151k\u00f6nyvek: 1919. augusztus 3.|publisher=DigitArchiv|page=6|lang=hu}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 August, [[Istv\u00e1n Friedrich]], leader of the White House Comrades Association\u2014a right-wing, [[counter-revolutionary]] group\u2014seized power in a bloodless coup with the backing of the [[Romanian Land Forces|Royal Romanian Army]].<ref name=\"P\u00f6l\u00f6skei\"/> The next day, [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria|Joseph August]] declared himself [[regent of Hungary]]\u2014he held the position until 23 August, when he was forced to resign<ref>{{cite web|title=Die amtliche Meldung \u00fcber den R\u00fccktritt|publisher=[[Neue Freie Presse]], Morgenblatt|date=1919-08-24|page=2|language=German|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?apm=0&aid=nfp&datum=19190824&seite=2&zoom=2}}</ref>\u2014and appointed Friedrich as Prime Minister.

Executive power is exercised by the [[President of France|President of the Republic]] and the [[Government of France|Government]]. The Government consists of the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] and ministers. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, and is responsible to Parliament. The [[Government of France|government]], including the Prime Minister, can be revoked by the [[National Ass\n\nThe independent judiciary is based upon [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system which evolved from the [[Napoleonic code]]s.  It is divided into the judicial branch (dealing with [[civil law (private law)|civil law]] and [[criminal law]]) and the administrative branch (dealing with appeals against executive decisions), each with their own independent supreme court of appeal: the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] for the judicial courts and the ''[[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Conseil d'Etat]]'' for the administrative courts.<ref>{{cite web|quote=France has a unique organisation of its courts and tribunals which are divided into two orders: the judiciary justice and the administrative justice|url=https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/1531-access-to-justice-2011-country-FR.pdf|format=PDF|page=1|title=France|work=Access to justice in Europe: an overview of challenges and opportunities|publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights}}</ref>  The French government includes various bodies that check abuses of power and independent agencies.\n\nFrance is a [[unitary state]]. However, its administrative subdivisions\u2014[[Regions of France|regions]], [[Departments of France|departments]] and [[Communes of France|communes]]\u2014have various legal functions, and the national government is prohibited from intruding into their normal operations.\n\nFrance was a founding member of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], later the [[European Union]].  As such, France has transferred part of its [[sovereignty]] to European institutions, as provided by its constitution. The French government therefore has to abide by [[Treaties of the European Union|European treaties]], [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] and [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]].\n\nThe [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] has described France as a \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|full democracy]]\" in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index|title=EIU Democracy Index 2018 - World Democracy Report|website=www.eiu.com|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==Constitution==\n{{Main|Constitution of France}}\n\nA popular [[referendum]] approved the constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic]] in 1958, greatly strengthening the authority of the presidency and the executive with respect to Parliament.\n\nThe constitution does not contain a [[bill of rights]] in itself, but its preamble mentions that France should follow the principles of the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'', as well as those of the preamble to the constitution of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. This has been judged to imply that the principles laid forth in those texts have constitutional value, and that legislation infringing on those principles should be found unconstitutional if a recourse is filed before the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]].<ref>See decisions [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1971/7144dc.htm 71-44 DC of 16 July 1971] and [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1973/7351dc.htm 73-51 DC of 27 December 1973] citing the preamble of the Constitution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.</ref> Also, recent modifications of the Constitution have added a reference in the preamble to an Environment charter that has full constitutional value, and a right for citizens to contest the constitutionality of a statute before the Constitutional Council.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX0300069L Constitutional law 2005-205 of 1 March 2005]</ref>\n\nThe foundational principles of the constitution include: the [[social equality|equality]] of all citizens before law, and the rejection of [[social class|special class privileges]] such as those that existed prior to the [[French Revolution]]; [[presumption of innocence]]; [[freedom of speech]]; [[freedom of opinion]] including [[freedom of religion]]; the guarantee of property against arbitrary seizure; the accountability of government agents to the citizenry.\n\n[[File:French government.png|512px|center|thumb|The main processes of the French national government (most of the justice system excluded for clarity)]]\n\n==Executive branch==\nFrance has a [[semi-presidential system]] of government, with both a [[President of France| President]] and a [[Prime Minister of France| Prime Minister]]. The Prime Minister is responsible to the [[French Parliament]]. A presidential candidate is required to obtain a nationwide majority of non-blank votes at either the first or second round of balloting, which implies that the [[President of France| President]] is somewhat supported by at least half of the voting population.\n\nAs a consequence, the President of France is the pre-eminent figure in French politics. He appoints the Prime Minister.<ref>Constitution, article 8</ref> Though the President may not ''de jure'' dismiss the prime Minister, nevertheless, if the Prime Minister is from the same political side, he can, in practice, have him resign on demand (and it is known that Prime Ministers are asked{{by whom?|date=March 2019}} to sign a non-dated dismissal letter before being nominated{{Citation needed|date= March 2010}}). He appoints the ministers, ministers-delegate and secretaries. When the President's political party or supporters control parliament, the President is the ''dominant'' player in executive action, choosing whomever he wishes for the government, and having it follow ''his'' political agenda (parliamentary disagreements do occur, though, even within the same party).\n\nHowever, when the President's political opponents control parliament, the President's dominance can be severely limited, as he must choose a Prime Minister and government who reflect the majority in parliament, and who will implement the agenda of the parliamentary majority. When [[Political Parties in France | parties]] from opposite ends of the political spectrum control parliament and the presidency, the power-sharing arrangement is known as [[cohabitation (government)| cohabitation]]. Before 2002, ''cohabitation'' occurred more commonly, because the term of the President was seven years and the term of the National Assembly was five years. With the term of the President shortened to five years, and with the presidential and parliamentary elections separated by only a few months, this is less likely to happen.\n\n[[Emmanuel Macron]] became President on 14 May 2017, succeeding [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]].\n\n{{main|French presidential election, 2017}}\n{{French presidential election, 2017}}\n\n=== Government ===\nThe Prime Minister [[leadership | lead]]s the [[Government of France|government]], which comprises junior and senior ministers.<ref>Constitution, article 21</ref> It has at its disposal the [[French Civil Service |civil service]], government agencies, and the [[Military of France| armed forces]].<ref name=\"Constitution, article 20\">Constitution, article 20</ref> The government is responsible to Parliament,<ref name=\"Constitution, article 20\"/> and the National Assembly may pass a motion of censure,<ref>Constitution, article 49</ref> forcing the resignation of the government. This, in practice, forces the government to reflect the same political party or coalition which has the majority in the Assembly. Ministers have to answer questions from members of Parliament, both written and oral; this is known as the ''questions au gouvernement'' (\"questions to the government\").<ref>Constitution, article 48</ref> In addition, ministers attend meetings of the houses of Parliament when laws pertaining to their areas of responsibility are being discussed.\n\n[[French government ministers| Government ministers]] cannot pass legislation without parliamentary approval, though the Prime Minister may issue autonomous regulations or subordinated regulations (''d\u00e9crets d'application'') provided they do not infringe on the Parliament domain, as detailed in the constitution. Ministers, however, can propose legislation to Parliament; since the Assembly is usually politically allied to the ministers, such legislation is, in general, very likely to pass. However, this is not guaranteed, and, on occasion, the opinion of the majority parliamentarians may differ significantly from those of the executive, which often results in a large number of amendments.\n\nThe Prime Minister can engage the responsibility of his government on a law, under article 49-3 of the Constitution. The law is then considered adopted unless the National Assembly votes a motion of censure, in which case the law is refused and the government has to resign. {{As of | 2006}}, the last time this article was invoked involved the \"[[First Employment Contract]]\" proposed by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin,<ref>National Assembly, [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2005-2006/20060143.asp transcripts of the sitting of 9 February 2006]: appearance of Dominique de Villepin announcing the application of article 49-3; [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/ta/ta0534.asp adopted text]</ref> a move that greatly backfired.<ref>The \"first employment contract\" was cancelled by a [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=SOCX0609236L law of 21 April 2006] following massive street protests; see ''[[First Employment Contract]]''.</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the government comprises members of three ranks. Ministers are the most senior members of the government; deputy ministers (''ministres d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s'') assist ministers in particular areas of their portfolio; ministers of state (''secr\u00e9taires d'\u00c9tat'') assist ministers in less important areas, and attend government meetings only occasionally. Before the founding of the [[French Fifth Republic |Fifth Republic]] in 1958, some ministers of particular political importance were called \"secretaries of state\" (''ministres d'\u00c9tat''); the practice has continued under the Fifth Republic in a purely honorific fashion: ministers styled \"Secretary of State\" are supposed{{by whom?|date=March 2019}} to be of higher importance in the ''gouvernement''.\n\nThe number of ministries and the division of responsibilities and administrations between them varies from government to government. While the name and exact responsibility of each ministry may change, one generally finds at least: \n* [[Minister of the Economy, Industry and Employment (France)| Ministry for the Economy, Industry and Employment]] (taxes, budget)\n* [[Ministry of the Interior (France)| Ministry of the Interior]] (law enforcement, relationships with local governments)\n* [[Ministry of Justice (France)| Ministry of Justice and Keeper of the Seals]] (prisons, running the court system, supervision of the prosecution service)\n* [[Ministry of National Education (France)| Ministry of National Education]]\n* [[Ministry of Defence (France)| Ministry of Defence]]\n* [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)| Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]\n* [[Minister of Transport (France)| Ministry of Transportation]]\n\n(For more on French ministries, see [[French government ministers]].)\n\nThe government has a leading role in shaping the agenda of the houses of Parliament. It may propose laws to Parliament, as well as amendments during parliamentary meetings. It may make use of some procedures to speed up parliamentary deliberations.\n\nThe government holds weekly meetings (usually on Wednesday mornings), chaired by the President, at the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]].\n\nFollowing the election of [[Emmanuel Macron]] as President, [[\u00c9douard Philippe]] became French Prime Minister on 15 May 2017.\n\n===Statutory instruments and delegated legislation===\nThe French executive has a limited power to establish regulation or legislation. (See [[#Statutory law versus executive regulations|below]] for how such regulations or legislative items interact with statute law.)\n\n====Decrees and other executive decisions====\nOnly the President and Prime Minister sign [[decree]]s (''d\u00e9crets''), which are akin to US [[Executive order (United States)|executive orders]]. Decrees can only be taken following certain procedures and with due respect to the constitution and statute law.\n\n* The President signs decrees appointing and dismissing most senior civil and military servants, for positions listed in the Constitution or in statutes. He also signs decrees establishing some regulations (''d\u00e9crets en conseil des ministres''). All such decrees must be countersigned by the Prime Minister and the ministers concerned.\n* The Prime Minister signs decrees establishing [[regulation]]s, which the concerned ministers countersign. In some areas, they constitute [[primary legislation]], in some others they must be subordinate to an existing [[statute]]. In some cases, statutes impose a compulsory advisory review by the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]]'' (''d\u00e9crets en Conseil d'\u00c9tat''), as opposed to ''d\u00e9crets simples''.<ref>''[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/missio/index_mi_cg01.shtml#1 Le r\u00f4le consultatif du Conseil d'\u00c9tat] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090429075357/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/missio/index_mi_cg01.shtml |date= 29 April 2009 }}''</ref>\n\nThe individual ministers issue ministerial orders (''arr\u00eat\u00e9s'') in their fields of competence, subordinate to statutes and decrees.\n\nContrary to a sometimes used polemical ''[[clich\u00e9]]'', that dates from the [[French Third Republic]] of 1870-1940, with its decrees-law (''d\u00e9crets-lois''), neither the President nor the Prime Minister may [[rule by decree]] (outside of the narrow case of presidential emergency powers).\n\n====Ordinances==== <!-- There are links to this header -->\n{{Main| Ordonnance}}\nThe executive cannot issue decrees in areas that the Constitution puts under the responsibility of legislation, issued by Parliament. Still, Parliament may, through a habilitation law, authorize the executive to issue [[decree| ordinances]] (''ordonnances''), with legislative value, in precisely-defined areas.<ref>Constitution, article 38</ref> Habilitation laws specify the scope of the ordinance. After the ordinance is issued, Parliament is asked{{by whom?|date=March 2019}} whether it wants to ratify it. If Parliament votes \"no\" to ratification, the ordinance is cancelled. Most of the time, ratification is made implicitly or explicitly through a Parliament act that deals with the subject concerned, rather than by the ratification act itself.<ref>On the legal r\u00e9gime of ordinances and explicit and implicit ratification, see ''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance1.html Les ordonnances : bilan au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2006]'' by the legal service of the [[French Senate]].</ref>\n\nThe use of ordinances is normally reserved for urgent matters, or for technical, uncontroversial texts (such as the ordinances that converted all sums in [[French Franc]]s to [[Euro]]s in the various laws in force in France).<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX0000009L Law 2000-517] authorized the government to adopt ordinances to convert sums from Francs to Euros in various legislative texts.</ref> There is also a practice of using ordinances to transpose [[European Directives]] into French law, to avoid late transposition of Directives, which happens often and is criticized by the [[EU Commission]]. Ordinances are also used to codify law into codes - to rearrange them for the sake of clarity without substantially modifying them. They are also sometimes used to push controversial legislation through, such as when Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] created new forms of work contracts in 2005.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=SOCX0500188R Ordinance of 2 August 2005] regarding the \"new employment contract\"</ref> The opposition then criticizes the use of ordinances in such contexts as anti-democratic and demeaning to Parliament. Note however that since the [[National Assembly of France| National Assembly]] can dismiss the government through a motion of censure, the government necessarily relies on a majority in Parliament, and this majority would be likely to adopt the controversial law anyway.\n\n===Internal limits of the executive branch; checks and balances===\nThe general rule is that government agencies and the civil service are at the disposal of the government. However, various agencies<ref>See [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/sites/sites_autorites.htm this list]</ref> are independent agencies (''autorit\u00e9s administratives ind\u00e9pendantes'')<ref>See bibliography</ref> that have been statutorily excluded from the executive's authority, although they belong in the executive branch.\n\nThese independent agencies have some specialized regulatory power, some executive power, and some [[Quasi-judicial body| quasi-judicial]] power. They are also often consulted by the government or the French Parliament seeking advice before regulating by law. They can impose sanctions that are named \"administrative sanctions\" ''sanctions administratives''. However, their decisions can still be contested in a judicial court or in an administrative court.\n\nSome examples of independent agencies:\n* The ''[[Banque de France]]'', the central bank, is independent (financial and economic code, L141 and following). This was a prerequisite for integrating the [[European System of Central Banks]].\n* The Electronic Communications & Posts Regulation Authority (''Autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation des communications \u00e9lectroniques et des postes (ARCEP)''), which was previously named Telecommunication Regulation Authority (''Autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications (ART)''), is an ''independent administrative authority'' for the open markets of telecommunications and postal services.\n* The Energy Regulation Commission (''Commission de r\u00e9gulation de l'\u00e9nergie (CRE)'') is an ''independent administrative authority'' for the open markets of gas and electricity.\n* The [[Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (France)|Financial Markets Authority]] (''Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (AMF)'') regulates [[securities]] markets.\n* The Higher Council of the Audiovisual (''Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA)'') supervises the granting and withdrawing of emission frequencies for [[radio]] and [[television]], as well as [[public broadcasting]].\n* The National Commission on Campaign Accounts and Political Financing (''Commission Nationale des Comptes de Campagne et des Financements Politiques'') regulates the financing and spending of political parties and political campaigning.\n\nPublic media corporations should not be influenced in their news reporting by the executive in power, since they have the duty to supply the public with unbiased information.{{cn|date=March 2019}} For instance, the [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP) is an independent public corporation. Its resources must come solely from its commercial sales. The majority of the seats in its board are held by representatives of the French [[Mass media| press]].\n\nThe government also provides for watchdogs over its own activities; these independent administrative authorities are headed by a commission typically composed of senior lawyers or of members of the Parliament. Each of the two chambers of the Parliament often has its own commission, but sometimes they collaborate to create a single ''Commission nationale mixte paritaire''. For example:\n* The National Commission for Computing & Freedom (''Commission nationale informatique et libert\u00e9s (CNIL)''); public services must request authorization from it before establishing a file with personal information, and they must heed its recommendations; private bodies must only declare their files; citizens have recourse before the commission against abuses.\n* The National Commission for the Control of Security Interceptions (''Commission nationale de contr\u00f4le des interceptions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (CNCIS)''); the executive, in a limited number of circumstances concerning national security, may request an authorization from the commission for [[wiretaps]] (in other circumstances, wiretaps may only be authorized within a judicially-administered criminal investigation).\n\nIn addition, the duties of public service limit the power that the executive has over the [[French Civil Service]]. For instance, appointments, except for the highest positions (the national directors of agencies and administrations), must be made solely on merit {typically determined in competitive exams) or on time in office. Certain civil servants have statuses that prohibit executive interference; for instance, [[judge]]s and [[prosecutor]]s may be named or moved only according to specific procedures. Public researchers and university professors enjoy [[academic freedom]]; by law, they enjoy complete freedom of speech within the ordinary constraints{{cn|date=March 2019}} of academia.\n\n===Some important directorates and establishments===\nThe government also provides specialized agencies for regulating critical markets or limited resources, and markets set up by regulations. Although, as part of the ''administration'', they are subordinate to the ministers, they often act with a high degree of independence.\n\n* The General Directorate of Competition, Consumption & Repression of Frauds (''Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la r\u00e9pression des fraudes (DGCCRF)'') regulates and controls the legality and safety of products and services available on the markets open to competition for all [[economic actor]]s and private consumers, and can deliver administrative ''sanctions'' in case of abuses.\n* The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (''Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'aviation civile (DGAC)'') regulates the traffic in the national air space and delivers the authorizations for airways companies and other private or public organizations and people.\n* The National Agency for Employment (''Agence nationale pour l'emploi (ANPE)'') maintained{{when?|date=March 2019}} a public registry for the allocation of social benefits to unemployed people (but {{as of | 2019 | alt = now}} a single registry is shared with the independent ''ASSEDIC'' paying them, a joint association of employers and workers unions), assists them as well as employers seeking people, and controls them. The French State names its general director and the Parliament provides for its finances and personnel, but it only fills one-third of the seats at its decision board of directors (the other seats are shared equally by unions of employers and of workers).\n* The National Agency of Frequencies (''Agence nationale des fr\u00e9quences (ANFR)''), a public establishment of an administrative character,<ref>\nCode of postal services and electronic communications, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&code=CPOSTESL.rcv&art=L43 article L43]\n</ref> regulates and maintains the allocation of radio frequency spectrum resources along with other international frequencies regulators and national regulators (the CSA and ARCEP) or public ministries, controls the operators on the national territory, and publishes compliance standards for manufacturers of radioelectric equipment.\n\n===Organization of government services===\nEach ministry has a central administration (''administration centrale''), generally divided into directorates. These directorates are usually subdivided into divisions or sub-directorates. Each directorate is headed by a director, named by the [[President in Council]]. The central administration largely stays the same, regardless of the political tendency of the executive in power.\n\nIn addition, each minister has a private office, which is composed of members whose nomination is politically determined, called the ''cabinet''. Cabinets are quite important and employ numbers of highly qualified staff to follow all administrative and political affairs. They are powerful, and have been sometimes considered as a parallel administration, especially (but not only) in all matters that are politically sensitive. Each ''cabinet'' is led by a chief-of-staff entitled ''directeur de cabinet''.\n\nThe state also has distributive services spread throughout French territory, often reflecting divisions into ''[[r\u00e9gion in France|r\u00e9gions]]'' or ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partements]]''. The [[prefect]], the representative of the national government in each ''r\u00e9gion'' or ''d\u00e9partement'', supervises the activities of the distributive services in his or her jurisdiction. Generally, the services of a certain administration in a ''r\u00e9gion'' or ''d\u00e9partement'' are managed by a high-level civil servant, often called director, but not always; for instance, the services of the ''[[Tr\u00e9sor public]]'' (Treasury) in each ''d\u00e9partement'' are headed by a treasurer-paymaster general, appointed by the President of the Republic.  In the last several{{quantify|date=March 2019}} decades, the departmental ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (see \"Local Government\" below) has taken on new responsibilities and plays an important role in administrating government services at the local level.\n\nThe government also maintains public establishments. These have a relative administrative and financial autonomy, to accomplish a defined mission. They are attached to one or more supervising authorities. These are classified into several categories:\n* public establishments of an administrative character, including, for instance:\n** universities, and most public establishments of higher education\n** establishments of a research and technical character, such as [[CNRS]] or [[INRIA]]\n* public establishments of an industrial and commercial character, including, for instance, [[Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00c9nergie Atomique|CEA]] and [[Ifremer]]\nNote that in administrations and public establishments of an administrative character operate under public law, while establishments of an industrial and commercial character operate mostly under private law. In consequence, in the former, permanent personnel are civil servants, while normally in the latter, they are contract employees.\n\nIn addition, the government owns and controls all, or the majority, of shares of some companies, like ''[[Electricit\u00e9 de France]]'', ''[[SNCF]]'' or ''[[Areva]]''.\n\n[[Social security]] organizations, though established by statute and controlled and supervised by the state, are not operated nor directly controlled by the national government. Instead, they are managed by the \"social partners\" (''partenaires sociaux'') \u2013 unions of employers such as the [[MEDEF]] and unions of employees. Their budget is separate from the national budget.\n\n==Shadow Cabinet of France==\nsince 2018 [[Shadow Cabinet of France]]\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{Main|Parliament of France}}\nThe Parliament of France, making up the [[legislative branch]], consists of two houses: the National Assembly and the Senate; the Assembly is the pre-eminent body.\n\nParliament meets for one nine-month session each year: under special circumstances the President can call an additional session. Although parliamentary powers have diminished from those existing under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], the National Assembly can still cause a government to fall if an absolute majority of the total Assembly membership votes to censure. It has never happened since the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958.\n\nThe government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament. The government also can link its term to a legislative text which it proposes, and unless a motion of censure is introduced (within 24 hours after the proposal) and passed (within 48 hours of introduction{{spaced ndash}}thus full procedures last at most 72 hours), the text is considered adopted without a vote.\n\nMembers of Parliament enjoy [[parliamentary immunity]].<ref>This immunity is called for in article 26 of the Constitution, as defined by the [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX9500101L Constitutional law of 5 August 1995]. See: National assembly, [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/connaissance/immunite.asp L'immunit\u00e9 parlementaire].</ref> Both assemblies have committees that write reports on a variety of topics. If necessary, they can establish parliamentary enquiry commissions with broad investigative power.\n\n===National Assembly===\n[[File:Paris Assemblee Nationale DSC00074.jpg|thumb|250px|The National Assembly sits in the ''[[Palais Bourbon]]'', by the [[Seine River|Seine]].]]\n{{Main|National Assembly (France)}}\n\nThe National Assembly is the principal legislative body. Its 577 deputies are directly elected for five-year terms in local majority votes, and all seats are voted on in each election.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe National Assembly may force the resignation of the government by voting a motion of censure. For this reason, the Prime Minister and their government are necessarily from the dominant party or coalition in the assembly. In the case of a president and assembly from opposing parties, this leads to the situation known as ''[[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]''. While motions of censure are periodically proposed by the opposition following government actions that it deems highly inappropriate, they are purely rhetorical; party discipline ensures that, throughout a parliamentary term, the government is never overthrown by the Assembly.\n\n====Latest election====\n{{French legislative election, 2017}}\n\n===Senate===\n[[File:French Senate amphitheater 050917 162927.jpg|thumb|250px|The Senate's amphitheater.]]\n{{Main|French Senate}}\n\nSenators are chosen by an electoral college of about 145,000 local elected officials for six-year terms, and half of the Senate is renewed every three years. Before the law of 30 July 2004, senators were elected for nine years, renewed by thirds every three years.<ref>http://www.senat.fr/lng/en/senators/the_senatorial_elections.html</ref> There are currently 321 senators, but there will be 346 in 2010; 304 represent the metropolitan and overseas ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partements]]'', five the other dependencies and 12 the French established abroad.\n\nThe Senate's legislative powers are limited; on most matters of legislation, the National Assembly has the last word in the event of a disagreement between the two houses.\n\nSince the beginning of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], the Senate has almost always had a right-wing majority. This is mostly due to the over-representation of small villages compared to big cities. This, and the indirect mode of election, prompted socialist [[Lionel Jospin]], who was Prime Minister at the time, to declare the Senate an \"anomaly\".<ref>''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1998-04-21/1998-04-21-414447 L'Humanit\u00e9]'', 21 April 1998; ''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1998-04-23/1998-04-23-414616 L'Humanit\u00e9]'', 23 April 1998; ''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2002-08-13/2002-08-13-38435 L'Humanit\u00e9]'', 13 August 2002</ref>\n\n===Legislation adoption procedures===\nStatute legislation may be proposed by the government (council of ministers), or by members of Parliament. In the first case, it is a ''projet de loi''; in the latter case, a ''proposition de loi''.\n\nAll ''projets de loi'' must undergo compulsory advisory review by the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]]'' before being submitted to parliament.<ref name=\"Constitution, article 39\">Constitution, article 39</ref> Since 2009, the bill submitted to Parliament must also come with a study of the possible impact of the law: other possible options, interactions with [[European law]], economical, social, financial and environmental consequences.<ref>Loi organique n\u00b0 2009-403 du 15 avril 2009 relative \u00e0 l'application des articles 34-1, 39 et 44 de la Constitution, [http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000020522653&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000020522634 article 8].</ref>\n\n''Propositions de loi'' cannot increase the financial load of the state without providing for funding.<ref>Constitution, article 40</ref>\n\n''Projets de loi'' start in the house of the government's choice (except in some narrow cases<ref name=\"Constitution, article 39\"/>). ''Propositions de loi'' start in the house where they originated. After the house has amended and voted on the text, it is sent to the other house, which can also amend it. If the houses do not choose to adopt the text in identical terms, it is sent before a commission made of equal numbers of members of both houses, which tries to harmonize the text. If it does not manage to do so, the National Assembly can vote the text and have the final say on it (except for laws related to the organization of the Senate).<ref>Constitution, article 46</ref>\n\nThe law is then sent to the President of France for signature.<ref name=\"Constitution, article 10\">Constitution, article 10</ref> At this point, the President of France, the speaker of either house or a delegation of 60 deputies or 60 senators can ask for the text to undergo constitutional review before being put into force;<ref>Constitution, article 61</ref> it is then sent before the Constitutional Council. The President can also, only once per law and with the countersigning of the Prime Minister, send the law back to parliament for another review.<ref name=\"Constitution, article 10\"/> Otherwise, the President must sign the law. After being countersigned by the Prime Minister and the concerned ministers,<ref>Constitution, article 19</ref> it is then sent to the ''[[Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise|Journal Officiel]]'' for publication.<ref>Civil Code, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&code=CCIVILL0.rcv&art=1 article 1]</ref>\n\n===Budget===\n{{See also|Taxation in France}}\n\n[[File:Public Deficit of France.png|thumb|450px|French government borrowing ([[budget deficits]]) as a percentage of GNP, 1960-2009.]]\nFinancing Acts (''lois de finances'') and the Social Security Financing Acts (''lois de financement de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale'') are special Acts of Parliament voted and approved through specific procedures.\n\nBecause of the importance of allowing government and social security organizations to proceed with the payment of their suppliers, employees, and recipients, without risk of a being stopped by parliamentary discord, these bills are specially constrained. In the past, parliamentarians would often add unrelated amendments (''cavaliers budg\u00e9taires'') to the finance bills, to get such amendments passed \u2013 because of the reduced time in which the budget is examined. However, these are nowadays considered unconstitutional. If Parliament cannot agree on a budget within some specified reasonable bounds, the government is entitled to adopt a budget through [[decree|ordinances]]: this threat prevents parliamentarians from threatening to bankrupt the executive.\n\nThe way the Finance Bill is organized, and the way the government has to execute the budget, were deeply reformed in 2001 by the ''Loi organique n\u00b02001-692 du 1er ao\u00fbt 2001 relative aux lois de finances'', generally known as the LOLF. Because of the major changes involved, the application of the law was gradual, and the first budget to be fully passed under LOLF will be the 2006 budget, passed in late 2005.\n\nThe LOLF divides expenses according to identifiable \"missions\" (which can be subdivided into sub-missions etc.). The performance of the administration and public bodies will be evaluated with respect to these missions.\n\nThe budget of the national government was forecast to be 290 billion [[Euro]] in 2011. This includes neither [[Social security in France#Budget|Social Security]], nor the budgets of [[D\u00e9centralisation in France#Financial Autonomy|local governments]].\n\n===Multiple offices===\n:''See [[cumul des mandats]]''\nIt has long been customary for Parliament members to hold, in addition to the office of deputy or senator, another local office such as [[Mayor (France)|city mayor]], hence titles like \"Deputy and Mayor\" (''d\u00e9put\u00e9-maire'') and \"Senator and Mayor\" (''s\u00e9nateur-maire''). This is known as the ''cumul'' of electoral offices. Proponents of the ''cumul'' allege that having local responsibilities ensures that members of parliament stay in contact with the reality of their constituency; also, they are said to be able to defend the interest of their city etc. better by having a seat in parliament.\n\nIn recent years, the ''cumul'' has been increasingly criticized. Critics contend that lawmakers that also have some local mandate cannot be assiduous to both tasks; for instance, they may neglect their duties to attend parliamentary sittings and commission in order to attend to tasks in their constituency. The premise that holders of dual office can defend the interest of their city etc. in the National Parliament is criticized in that national lawmakers should have the national interest in their mind, not the advancement of the projects of the particular city they are from. Finally, this criticism is part of a wider criticism of the political class as a cozy, closed world in which the same people make a long career from multiple positions.\n\nAs a consequence, laws that restrict the possibilities of having multiple mandates have been enacted.\n\n===Economic and Social Council===\n{{Main|French Economic and Social Council}}\n\nThe Economic and Social Council is a [[wikt:consultation|consultative]] assembly. It does not play a role in the adoption of statutes and regulations, but advises the lawmaking bodies on questions of social and economic policies.\n\nThe executive may refer any question or proposal of social or economic importance to the Economic and Social Council.\n\nThe Economic and Social Council publishes reports, which are sent to the Prime Minister, the National Assembly and the Senate. They are published in the ''[[Journal Official of the R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise|Journal Official]]''.\n\n==Judicial branch==\n{{Main|Judiciary of France}}\n\nFrench law provides for a separate judicial branch with an independent judiciary which does not answer to or is directly controlled by the other two branches of government. France has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal system, the basis of which is codified law; however, case law plays a significant role in the determination of the courts. The most distinctive feature of the French judicial system is that it is divided into judicial and administrative streams.\n\n===Judicial courts===\n\nThe judicial stream of courts adjudicates civil and criminal cases. The judicial court stream consists of inferior courts, intermediate [[Court of Appeal (France)|appellate courts]], and the French [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], the supreme court.\n\nJudges are government employees but are granted special statutory protection from the executive. Judges have security of tenure and may not be promoted (or demoted) without their consent. Their careers are overseen by the Judicial Council of France.\n\nThe public prosecutors, on the other hand, take orders from the Minister of Justice. In the past, this has bred suspicion of undue political pressure to dismiss suits or claims against government officials charged with corruption, and the status of public prosecutors and their ties to government are frequently topics of debate.\n\nTrial by [[jury]] is available only for severe criminal cases, which are the jurisdiction of the [[Cour d'assises|Courts of Assizes]]. A full Court is made up of a 3-judge panel and a petty jury of 9 jurors (vs. 12 jurors on appeal), who, together, render verdicts, and if a conviction is handed down, also determine a sentence. Jurors are selected at random from eligible voters.\n\nIn most other courts, judges are professional, except that the criminal court for minors is composed of one professional and two lay judges. Also, several specialty courts of original jurisdiction are sat by judges who are elected into office. For instance, labor tribunals are staffed with an equal number of magistrates from employers' unions and employees' unions. The same applies to land estate tribunals.\n\nPre-trial proceedings are [[inquisitorial]] by nature, but open court proceedings are [[adversarial]]. The [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in criminal proceedings is on the [[prosecution]], and the accused is constitutionally presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\n===Administrative courts===\n[[File:DSC00652 conseil etat.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]] sits in the ''Palais Royal''.]]\nCourts of administrative law adjudicate on claims and suits against government offices and agencies. The administrative stream is made up of administrative courts, courts of administrative appeal, and the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] as the court of last resort.\n\nThe Council of State hears cases against executive branch decisions and has the power to quash or set aside executive-issued statutory instruments such as orders and regulations when they violate constitutional law, enacted legislation, or codified law.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCourt proceedings mostly involve written hearings and are [[inquisitorial]], with judges having the parties submit written testimony or arguments.\n\nAny jurisdictional dispute between the judicial and administrative streams are settled by a special court called ''Tribunal des conflits'', or \"Court of Jurisdictional Dispute\", composed of an equal number of Supreme Court justices and councillors of State.\n\n===Constitutional Council===\n{{Main|Constitutional Council of France}}\n\nNeither judicial nor administrative courts are empowered to rule on the [[constitutionality]] of acts of Parliament.  While technically not part of the judicial branch, the '''Constitutional Council''' examines legislation and decides whether or not it violates the Constitution.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1994|title=Background Notes on Countries of the World 2003|url=|journal=Superintendent of Documents|volume=|pages=|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> This applies, prior to their enactment, to all forms of organic laws, but only by referral from the French President, [[List of Presidents of the Senate of France|President of the Senate]], [[List of Presidents of the National Assembly of France|President of the National Assembly]], the Prime Minister, or any of the 60 senators or 60 assembly members of the other types of laws or treaties. After their enactment, laws can all be reviewed by referral from the highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, or by the highest judicial court, the Cour de Cassation. The Constitutional Council may declare acts to be unconstitutional, even if they contradict the principles of the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (cited in the Preamble of the Constitution).\n\nCouncil members to the Constitutional Council are appointed for nine years (three every three years); three are appointed by the President, three by the President of the National Assembly, and three by the President of the Senate. The former presidents are also members for life of the Constitutional Council.\n\n===Financial courts===\nFrance's main Court of Audit (''[[Cour des Comptes]]'') and regional audit courts audit government finances, public institutions (including other courts), and public entities. The court publishes an annual report and can refer criminal matters to public prosecutors. It can also directly fine public accountants for mishandling funds, and refer civil servants who misused funds to the Court of Financial and Budgetary Discipline.\n\nThe main and regional audit courts do not judge the accountants of private organizations. However, in some circumstances, they may audit their accounting, especially when an organization has been awarded a government contract over a public utility or a service requiring the permanent use of the public domain or if an organization is a bidder on a government contract. The Court is often solicitated by various state agencies, parliamentary commissions, and public regulators, but it can also petitioned to act by any French citizen or organization operating in France.\n\nThe Court's finances are overseen by financial commissions of the two Houses of the French Parliament which also set the Court's working budget in the annual Act of finances.\n\n==Ombudsman==\nIn 1973 the position of ''m\u00e9diateur de la R\u00e9publique'' (the Republic's [[ombudsman]]) was created. The ombudsman is charged with solving, without the need to a recourse before the courts, the disagreements between citizens and the administrations and other entities charged with a mission of a public service;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=RADULESCU|first=Crina|date=January 2015|title=\"The European Ombudsman: Facilitator or Supervisor?.\"|url=http://libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=110150839&site=ehost-live&scope=site|journal=Juridical Current|volume=vol. 18 no. 1|pages=117\u2013127|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> proposing reforms to the Government and the administrations to further these goals; and actively participating in the international promotion of [[human rights]].\n\nThe ombudsman is appointed for a period of 6 years by the President of the Republic in the Council of Ministers. He cannot be removed from office and is protected for his official actions by an immunity similar to [[parliamentary immunity]]. He does not receive or accept orders from any authority. The current ombudsman is [[Jean-Paul Delevoye]].\n\n==French law==\n\n===Basic principles===\n[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|250px|The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].]]\nFrance uses a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system; that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judge interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to [[case law]]).\n\nMany fundamental principles of French Law were laid in the [[Napoleonic Code]]s. Basic principles of the [[rule of law]] were laid in the Napoleonic Code: laws can only address the future and not the past ([[ex post facto]] laws are prohibited); to be applicable, laws must have been officially published (see ''[[Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise|Journal Officiel]]'').\n\nIn agreement with the principles of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the general rule is that of freedom, and law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As [[Guy Canivet]], first president of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], said about what should be the rule in French law:<ref>Guy Canivet was saying how the rules governing prisons disregarded the basic rule of law that liberty is the general case and prohibition the exception. See Jacques Floch, [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/rap-enq/r2521-2.asp Report of the enquiry commission of the French national assembly on the situation in French prisons].</ref>\n:''Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.''\nThat is, law may lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.\n\nFrance does not recognize [[religious law]], nor does it recognize religious beliefs as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. As a consequence, France has long had neither [[blasphemy]] laws nor [[sodomy law]]s (the latter being abolished in 1789).\n\n===Statutory law versus executive regulations===\nFrench law differentiates between legislative acts (''loi''), generally passed by the [[legislative branch]], and [[regulation]]s (''r\u00e8glement'', instituted by ''d\u00e9crets''), issued by the Prime Minister. There also exist secondary regulation called ''arr\u00eat\u00e9s'', issued by ministers, subordinates acting in their names, or local authorities; these may only be taken in areas of competency and within the scope delineated by primary legislation. There are also more and more regulations issued by independent agencies, especially relating to economic matters.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of France (article 34):\n\nStatutes shall concern:\n* [[civil rights|Civic rights]] and the fundamental guarantees granted to citizens for the exercise of their [[public liberties]]; the obligations imposed for the purposes of [[defense (military)|national defence]] upon citizens in respect of their persons and their [[property]];\n* Nationality, the status and legal capacity of persons, matrimonial regimes, [[inheritance]] and gifts;\n* The determination of serious [[crime]]s and other major offences and the penalties applicable to them; [[criminal procedure]]; [[amnesty]]; the establishment of new classes of [[court]]s and tribunals and the regulations governing the members of the [[judiciary]];\n* The base, rates and methods of collection of [[tax]]es of all types; the issue of [[currency]].\n\nStatutes shall likewise determine the rules concerning:\n* The [[electoral system|electoral]] systems of [[French Parliament|parliamentary assemblies]] and local assemblies;\n* The creation of categories of public establishments;\n* The fundamental guarantees granted to civil and military personnel employed by the State;\n* The [[nationalization]] of enterprises and transfers of ownership in enterprises from the public to the private sector.\n\nStatutes shall determine the fundamental principles of:\n* The general organization of national defence;\n* The self-government of territorial units, their powers and their resources;\n* [[Education]];\n* The regime governing ownership, rights in rem, and civil and commercial obligations;\n* [[Labour law]], [[trade union|trade-union]] law and [[social security]].\n\nFinance Acts shall determine the resources and obligations of the State in the manner and with the reservations specified in an institutional Act.\nSocial Security Finance Acts shall determine the general conditions for the financial balance of Social Security and, in light of their revenue forecasts, shall determine expenditure targets in the manner and with the reservations specified in an institutional Act.\nProgramme Acts shall determine the objectives of the economic and social action of the State.\n\nThe provisions of this article may be enlarged upon and complemented by an organic law.\n\nOther areas are matters of [[regulation]]. This separation between law and regulation is enforced by the ''Conseil constitutionnel'': the government can, with the agreement of the ''Conseil constitutionnel'', modify by decrees the laws that infringe on the domain of regulations. At the same, the ''Conseil d'\u00c9tat'' nullifies decrees that infringe on the domain of the law.\n\n===Order of authority for sources of the law===\nWhen courts have to deal with incoherent texts, they apply a certain hierarchy: a text higher in the hierarchy will overrule a lower text. The general rule is that the Constitution is superior to laws which are superior to regulations. However, with the intervention of European law and international treaties, and the quasi-[[case law]] of the administrative courts, the hierarchy may become somewhat unclear. The following hierarchy of norms should thus be taken with due caution:\n\n# French Constitution, including the basic core constitutional values recognized by the laws of the Republic as defined by the Constitutional Council\n# European Union treaties and regulations\n# International treaties and agreements\n# organic laws\n# ordinary laws\n# executive orders (advised on by the Council of State)\n# other executive orders\n# rules and regulations\n#* of multiple ministers\n#* of a single minister\n#* of local authorities\n# regulations and decisions by independent agencies.\n\n==Local government==\nTraditionally, decision-making in France is highly centralized, with each of France's [[Departments of France|departments]] headed by a [[Prefect (France)|prefect]] appointed by the central government, in addition to the ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'', a locally elected council. However, in 1982, the national government passed legislation to [[Decentralisation|decentralize]] authority by giving a wide range of administrative and fiscal powers to local elected officials. In March 1986, regional councils were directly elected for the first time, and the process of decentralization has continued, albeit at a slow pace. In March 2003, a constitutional revision has changed very significantly the legal framework towards a more decentralized system and has increased the powers of local governments. Albeit France is still one of the most centralized major countries in Europe and the world.\n\nAdministrative units with a local government in [[Metropolitan France]] (that is, the parts of France lying in Europe) consist of:\n* about 36,000 ''[[commune in France|communes]]'', headed by a municipal council and a mayor, grouped in\n* 96 ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partements]]'', headed by a ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (general council) and its president, grouped in\n* 18 ''[[r\u00e9gion in France|r\u00e9gions]]'', headed by a [[Conseil r\u00e9gional|regional council]] and its [[President of the regional council|president]].\n\nThe ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' is an institution created in 1790 by the French Revolution in each of the newly created departments (they were suppressed by the Vichy government from 1942 to 1944).  A ''conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (departmental councillor) must be at least 21 years old and either live or pay taxes in locality from which he or she is elected. (Sociologist Jean Viard noted [''Le Monde'', 22 Feb 2006] that half of all ''conseillers g\u00e9n\u00e9raux'' were still ''fils de paysans'', i.e. sons of peasants, suggesting France's deep rural roots). Though the central government can theoretically dissolve a ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (in case of a dysfunctional ''conseil''), this has happened only once in the Fifth Republic.\n\nThe ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' discusses and passes laws on matters that concern the department; it is administratively responsible for departmental employees and land, manages subsidized housing, public transportation, and school subsidies, and contributes to public facilities. It is not allowed to express \"political wishes.\" The ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' meets at least three times a year and elects its president for a term of 3 years, who presides over its \"permanent commission,\" usually consisting of 5-10 other departmental councillors elected from among their number. The ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' has accrued new powers in the course of the political decentralization that has occurred past in France during the past thirty years. There are in all more than 4,000 ''conseillers g\u00e9n\u00e9raux'' in France.   \n   \nDifferent levels of administration have different duties, and shared responsibility is common; for instance, in the field of education, ''communes'' run public elementary schools, while ''d\u00e9partements'' run public junior high schools and ''r\u00e9gions'' run public high schools, but only for the building and upkeep of buildings; curricula and teaching personnel are supplied by the national Ministry of Education.\n\nThe 3 main cities, [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]] have a special statute. Paris is at the same time a ''commune'' and a ''d\u00e9partement'' with an institution, the ''Conseil de Paris'', that is elected at the same time as the other ''conseil municipaux'', but that operates also as a ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral''. The 3 cities are also divided into ''arrondissement'' each having its ''conseil d'arrondissement'' and its mayor.\n   \n[[French overseas departments and territories|French overseas possessions]] are divided into two groups:   \n* Four [[r\u00e9gions d'outre-mer|overseas ''regions'']], with some strong similarity of organization to their metropolitan counterparts; in these overseas regions all laws of France are automatically applicable, except if a specific text provides otherwise or provides some adaptation. The four ''r\u00e9gions'' are fully incorporated parts of the territory of the French Republic, and as such belong to the European Union, which means that European law is applicable;\n* [[Territoires d'outre-mer|Territories]], generally having greater autonomy. In general, French laws are not applicable, except if a specific text provides otherwise. A new Territory was created in February 2007: [[Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy]]. This Territory used to be part of the overseas department of Guadeloupe. The statute of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy provides the automatic application of French law, except mostly in the domain of taxes and immigration, which are left to the Territory. The Territories do not belong to the European Union. However, as \"overseas territories\" they have association agreements with the EU and may opt into some EU provisions.

The nation declares itself to be an \"indivisible, [[la\u00efcit\u00e9|secular]], [[Democracy|democratic]], and social [[Republic]]\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nationale|first1=Assembl\u00e9e|title=Welcome to the english website of the French National Assembly - Assembl\u00e9e nationale|url=http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/langues/welcome-to-the-english-website-of-the-french-national-assembly|website=www2.assemblee-nationale.fr|accessdate=13 April 2017|language=fr-FR}}</ref> The constitution provides for a [[separation of powers]] and proclaims France's \"attachment to the [[Human Rights|Rights of Man]] and the principles of [[national sovereignty]] as defined by the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|Declaration of 1789]].\"\n\nThe political system of [[France]] consists of an [[executive branch|executive]] branch, a [[legislative branch|legislative]] branch, and a [[judiciary|judicial branch]]. Executive power is exercised by the [[President of France|President of the Republic]] and the [[Government of France|Government]]. The Government consists of the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] and ministers. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, and is responsible to Parliament. The [[Government of France|government]], including the Prime Minister, can be revoked by the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], the lower house of Parliament, through a \"censure motion\"; this ensures that the Prime Minister is always supported by a majority of the lower house (which, on most topics, has prominence over the upper house).\n\nParliament comprises the National Assembly and the [[Senate (France)|Senate]].  It passes statutes and votes on the budget; it controls the action of the executive through formal questioning on the floor of the houses of Parliament and by establishing commissions of inquiry. The constitutionality of the statutes is checked by the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], members of which are appointed by the President of the Republic, the [[List of Presidents of the National Assembly of France|President of the National Assembly]], and the [[List of Presidents of the Senate of France|President of the Senate]]. Former presidents of the Republic also are members of the Council.\n\nThe independent judiciary is based upon [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system which evolved from the [[Napoleonic code]]s.  It is divided into the judicial branch (dealing with [[civil law (private law)|civil law]] and [[criminal law]]) and the administrative branch (dealing with appeals against executive decisions), each with their own independent supreme court of appeal: the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] for the judicial courts and the ''[[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Conseil d'Etat]]'' for the administrative courts.<ref>{{cite web|quote=France has a unique organisation of its courts and tribunals which are divided into two orders: the judiciary justice and the administrative justice|url=https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/1531-access-to-justice-2011-country-FR.pdf|format=PDF|page=1|title=France|work=Access to justice in Europe: an overview of challenges and opportunities|publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights}}</ref>  The French government includes various bodies that check abuses of power and independent agencies.\n\nFrance is a [[unitary state]]. However, its administrative subdivisions\u2014[[Regions of France|regions]], [[Departments of France|departments]] and [[Communes of France|communes]]\u2014have various legal functions, and the national government is prohibited from intruding into their normal operations.\n\nFrance was a founding member of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], later the [[European Union]].  As such, France has transferred part of its [[sovereignty]] to European institutions, as provided by its constitution. The French government therefore has to abide by [[Treaties of the European Union|European treaties]], [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] and [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]].\n\nThe [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] has described France as a \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|full democracy]]\" in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index|title=EIU Democracy Index 2018 - World Democracy Report|website=www.eiu.com|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==Constitution==\n{{Main|Constitution of France}}\n\nA popular [[referendum]] approved the constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic]] in 1958, greatly strengthening the authority of the presidency and the executive with respect to Parliament.\n\nThe constitution does not contain a [[bill of rights]] in itself, but its preamble mentions that France should follow the principles of the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'', as well as those of the preamble to the constitution of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. This has been judged to imply that the principles laid forth in those texts have constitutional value, and that legislation infringing on those principles should be found unconstitutional if a recourse is filed before the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]].<ref>See decisions [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1971/7144dc.htm 71-44 DC of 16 July 1971] and [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1973/7351dc.htm 73-51 DC of 27 December 1973] citing the preamble of the Constitution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.</ref> Also, recent modifications of the Constitution have added a reference in the preamble to an Environment charter that has full constitutional value, and a right for citizens to contest the constitutionality of a statute before the Constitutional Council.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX0300069L Constitutional law 2005-205 of 1 March 2005]</ref>\n\nThe foundational principles of the constitution include: the [[social equality|equality]] of all citizens before law, and the rejection of [[social class|special class privileges]] such as those that existed prior to the [[French Revolution]]; [[presumption of innocence]]; [[freedom of speech]]; [[freedom of opinion]] including [[freedom of religion]]; the guarantee of property against arbitrary seizure; the accountability of government agents to the citizenry.\n\n[[File:French government.png|512px|center|thumb|The main processes of the French national government (most of the justice system excluded for clarity)]]\n\n==Executive branch==\nFrance has a [[semi-presidential system]] of government, with both a [[President of France| President]] and a [[Prime Minister of France| Prime Minister]]. The Prime Minister is responsible to the [[French Parliament]]. A presidential candidate is required to obtain a nationwide majority of non-blank votes at either the first or second round of balloting, which implies that the [[President of France| President]] is somewhat supported by at least half of the voting population.\n\nAs a consequence, the President of France is the pre-eminent figure in French politics. He appoints the Prime Minister.<ref>Constitution, article 8</ref> Though the President may not ''de jure'' dismiss the prime Minister, nevertheless, if the Prime Minister is from the same political side, he can, in practice, have him resign on demand (and it is known that Prime Ministers are asked{{by whom?|date=March 2019}} to sign a non-dated dismissal letter before being nominated{{Citation needed|date= March 2010}}). He appoints the ministers, ministers-delegate and secretaries. When the President's political party or supporters control parliament, the President is the ''dominant'' player in executive action, choosing whomever he wishes for the government, and having it follow ''his'' political agenda (parliamentary disagreements do occur, though, even within the same party).\n\nHowever, when the President's political opponents control parliament, the President's dominance can be severely limited, as he must choose a Prime Minister and government who reflect the majority in parliament, and who will implement the agenda of the parliamentary majority. When [[Political Parties in France | parties]] from opposite ends of the political spectrum control parliament and the presidency, the power-sharing arrangement is known as [[cohabitation (government)| cohabitation]]. Before 2002, ''cohabitation'' occurred more commonly, because the term of the President was seven years and the term of the National Assembly was five years. With the term of the President shortened to five years, and with the presidential and parliamentary elections separated by only a few months, this is less likely to happen.\n\n[[Emmanuel Macron]] became President on 14 May 2017, succeeding [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]].\n\n{{main|French presidential election, 2017}}\n{{French presidential election, 2017}}\n\n=== Government ===\nThe Prime Minister [[leadership | lead]]s the [[Government of France|government]], which comprises junior and senior ministers.<ref>Constitution, article 21</ref> It has at its disposal the [[French Civil Service |civil service]], government agencies, and the [[Military of France| armed forces]].<ref name=\"Constitution, article 20\">Constitution, article 20</ref> The government is responsible to Parliament,<ref name=\"Constitution, article 20\"/> and the National Assembly may pass a motion of censure,<ref>Constitution, article 49</ref> forcing the resignation of the government. This, in practice, forces the government to reflect the same political party or coalition which has the majority in the Assembly. Ministers have to answer questions from members of Parliament, both written and oral; this is known as the ''questions au gouvernement'' (\"questions to the government\").<ref>Constitution, article 48</ref> In addition, ministers attend meetings of the houses of Parliament when laws pertaining to their areas of responsibility are being discussed.\n\n[[French government ministers| Government ministers]] cannot pass legislation without parliamentary approval, though the Prime Minister may issue autonomous regulations or subordinated regulations (''d\u00e9crets d'application'') provided they do not infringe on the Parliament domain, as detailed in the constitution. Ministers, however, can propose legislation to Parliament; since the Assembly is usually politically allied to the ministers, such legislation is, in general, very likely to pass. However, this is not guaranteed, and, on occasion, the opinion of the majority parliamentarians may differ significantly from those of the executive, which often results in a large number of amendments.\n\nThe Prime Minister can engage the responsibility of his government on a law, under article 49-3 of the Constitution. The law is then considered adopted unless the National Assembly votes a motion of censure, in which case the law is refused and the government has to resign. {{As of | 2006}}, the last time this article was invoked involved the \"[[First Employment Contract]]\" proposed by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin,<ref>National Assembly, [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2005-2006/20060143.asp transcripts of the sitting of 9 February 2006]: appearance of Dominique de Villepin announcing the application of article 49-3; [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/ta/ta0534.asp adopted text]</ref> a move that greatly backfired.<ref>The \"first employment contract\" was cancelled by a [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=SOCX0609236L law of 21 April 2006] following massive street protests; see ''[[First Employment Contract]]''.</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the government comprises members of three ranks. Ministers are the most senior members of the government; deputy ministers (''ministres d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s'') assist ministers in particular areas of their portfolio; ministers of state (''secr\u00e9taires d'\u00c9tat'') assist ministers in less important areas, and attend government meetings only occasionally. Before the founding of the [[French Fifth Republic |Fifth Republic]] in 1958, some ministers of particular political importance were called \"secretaries of state\" (''ministres d'\u00c9tat''); the practice has continued under the Fifth Republic in a purely honorific fashion: ministers styled \"Secretary of State\" are supposed{{by whom?|date=March 2019}} to be of higher importance in the ''gouvernement''.\n\nThe number of ministries and the division of responsibilities and administrations between them varies from government to government. While the name and exact responsibility of each ministry may change, one generally finds at least: \n* [[Minister of the Economy, Industry and Employment (France)| Ministry for the Economy, Industry and Employment]] (taxes, budget)\n* [[Ministry of the Interior (France)| Ministry of the Interior]] (law enforcement, relationships with local governments)\n* [[Ministry of Justice (France)| Ministry of Justice and Keeper of the Seals]] (prisons, running the court system, supervision of the prosecution service)\n* [[Ministry of National Education (France)| Ministry of National Education]]\n* [[Ministry of Defence (France)| Ministry of Defence]]\n* [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)| Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]\n* [[Minister of Transport (France)| Ministry of Transportation]]\n\n(For more on French ministries, see [[French government ministers]].)\n\nThe government has a leading role in shaping the agenda of the houses of Parliament. It may propose laws to Parliament, as well as amendments during parliamentary meetings. It may make use of some procedures to speed up parliamentary deliberations.\n\nThe government holds weekly meetings (usually on Wednesday mornings), chaired by the President, at the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]].\n\nFollowing the election of [[Emmanuel Macron]] as President, [[\u00c9douard Philippe]] became French Prime Minister on 15 May 2017.\n\n===Statutory instruments and delegated legislation===\nThe French executive has a limited power to establish regulation or legislation. (See [[#Statutory law versus executive regulations|below]] for how such regulations or legislative items interact with statute law.)\n\n====Decrees and other executive decisions====\nOnly the President and Prime Minister sign [[decree]]s (''d\u00e9crets''), which are akin to US [[Executive order (United States)|executive orders]]. Decrees can only be taken following certain procedures and with due respect to the constitution and statute law.\n\n* The President signs decrees appointing and dismissing most senior civil and military servants, for positions listed in the Constitution or in statutes. He also signs decrees establishing some regulations (''d\u00e9crets en conseil des ministres''). All such decrees must be countersigned by the Prime Minister and the ministers concerned.\n* The Prime Minister signs decrees establishing [[regulation]]s, which the concerned ministers countersign. In some areas, they constitute [[primary legislation]], in some others they must be subordinate to an existing [[statute]]. In some cases, statutes impose a compulsory advisory review by the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]]'' (''d\u00e9crets en Conseil d'\u00c9tat''), as opposed to ''d\u00e9crets simples''.<ref>''[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/missio/index_mi_cg01.shtml#1 Le r\u00f4le consultatif du Conseil d'\u00c9tat] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090429075357/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/missio/index_mi_cg01.shtml |date= 29 April 2009 }}''</ref>\n\nThe individual ministers issue ministerial orders (''arr\u00eat\u00e9s'') in their fields of competence, subordinate to statutes and decrees.\n\nContrary to a sometimes used polemical ''[[clich\u00e9]]'', that dates from the [[French Third Republic]] of 1870-1940, with its decrees-law (''d\u00e9crets-lois''), neither the President nor the Prime Minister may [[rule by decree]] (outside of the narrow case of presidential emergency powers).\n\n====Ordinances==== <!-- There are links to this header -->\n{{Main| Ordonnance}}\nThe executive cannot issue decrees in areas that the Constitution puts under the responsibility of legislation, issued by Parliament. Still, Parliament may, through a habilitation law, authorize the executive to issue [[decree| ordinances]] (''ordonnances''), with legislative value, in precisely-defined areas.<ref>Constitution, article 38</ref> Habilitation laws specify the scope of the ordinance. After the ordinance is issued, Parliament is asked{{by whom?|date=March 2019}} whether it wants to ratify it. If Parliament votes \"no\" to ratification, the ordinance is cancelled. Most of the time, ratification is made implicitly or explicitly through a Parliament act that deals with the subject concerned, rather than by the ratification act itself.<ref>On the legal r\u00e9gime of ordinances and explicit and implicit ratification, see ''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance1.html Les ordonnances : bilan au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2006]'' by the legal service of the [[French Senate]].</ref>\n\nThe use of ordinances is normally reserved for urgent matters, or for technical, uncontroversial texts (such as the ordinances that converted all sums in [[French Franc]]s to [[Euro]]s in the various laws in force in France).<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX0000009L Law 2000-517] authorized the government to adopt ordinances to convert sums from Francs to Euros in various legislative texts.</ref> There is also a practice of using ordinances to transpose [[European Directives]] into French law, to avoid late transposition of Directives, which happens often and is criticized by the [[EU Commission]]. Ordinances are also used to codify law into codes - to rearrange them for the sake of clarity without substantially modifying them. They are also sometimes used to push controversial legislation through, such as when Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] created new forms of work contracts in 2005.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=SOCX0500188R Ordinance of 2 August 2005] regarding the \"new employment contract\"</ref> The opposition then criticizes the use of ordinances in such contexts as anti-democratic and demeaning to Parliament. Note however that since the [[National Assembly of France| National Assembly]] can dismiss the government through a motion of censure, the government necessarily relies on a majority in Parliament, and this majority would be likely to adopt the controversial law anyway.\n\n===Internal limits of the executive branch; checks and balances===\nThe general rule is that government agencies and the civil service are at the disposal of the government. However, various agencies<ref>See [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/sites/sites_autorites.htm this list]</ref> are independent agencies (''autorit\u00e9s administratives ind\u00e9pendantes'')<ref>See bibliography</ref> that have been statutorily excluded from the executive's authority, although they belong in the executive branch.\n\nThese independent agencies have some specialized regulatory power, some executive power, and some [[Quasi-judicial body| quasi-judicial]] power. They are also often consulted by the government or the French Parliament seeking advice before regulating by law. They can impose sanctions that are named \"administrative sanctions\" ''sanctions administratives''. However, their decisions can still be contested in a judicial court or in an administrative court.\n\nSome examples of independent agencies:\n* The ''[[Banque de France]]'', the central bank, is independent (financial and economic code, L141 and following). This was a prerequisite for integrating the [[European System of Central Banks]].\n* The Electronic Communications & Posts Regulation Authority (''Autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation des communications \u00e9lectroniques et des postes (ARCEP)''), which was previously named Telecommunication Regulation Authority (''Autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications (ART)''), is an ''independent administrative authority'' for the open markets of telecommunications and postal services.\n* The Energy Regulation Commission (''Commission de r\u00e9gulation de l'\u00e9nergie (CRE)'') is an ''independent administrative authority'' for the open markets of gas and electricity.\n* The [[Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (France)|Financial Markets Authority]] (''Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (AMF)'') regulates [[securities]] markets.\n* The Higher Council of the Audiovisual (''Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA)'') supervises the granting and withdrawing of emission frequencies for [[radio]] and [[television]], as well as [[public broadcasting]].\n* The National Commission on Campaign Accounts and Political Financing (''Commission Nationale des Comptes de Campagne et des Financements Politiques'') regulates the financing and spending of political parties and political campaigning.\n\nPublic media corporations should not be influenced in their news reporting by the executive in power, since they have the duty to supply the public with unbiased information.{{cn|date=March 2019}} For instance, the [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP) is an independent public corporation. Its resources must come solely from its commercial sales. The majority of the seats in its board are held by representatives of the French [[Mass media| press]].\n\nThe government also provides for watchdogs over its own activities; these independent administrative authorities are headed by a commission typically composed of senior lawyers or of members of the Parliament. Each of the two chambers of the Parliament often has its own commission, but sometimes they collaborate to create a single ''Commission nationale mixte paritaire''. For example:\n* The National Commission for Computing & Freedom (''Commission nationale informatique et libert\u00e9s (CNIL)''); public services must request authorization from it before establishing a file with personal information, and they must heed its recommendations; private bodies must only declare their files; citizens have recourse before the commission against abuses.\n* The National Commission for the Control of Security Interceptions (''Commission nationale de contr\u00f4le des interceptions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (CNCIS)''); the executive, in a limited number of circumstances concerning national security, may request an authorization from the commission for [[wiretaps]] (in other circumstances, wiretaps may only be authorized within a judicially-administered criminal investigation).\n\nIn addition, the duties of public service limit the power that the executive has over the [[French Civil Service]]. For instance, appointments, except for the highest positions (the national directors of agencies and administrations), must be made solely on merit {typically determined in competitive exams) or on time in office. Certain civil servants have statuses that prohibit executive interference; for instance, [[judge]]s and [[prosecutor]]s may be named or moved only according to specific procedures. Public researchers and university professors enjoy [[academic freedom]]; by law, they enjoy complete freedom of speech within the ordinary constraints{{cn|date=March 2019}} of academia.\n\n===Some important directorates and establishments===\nThe government also provides specialized agencies for regulating critical markets or limited resources, and markets set up by regulations. Although, as part of the ''administration'', they are subordinate to the ministers, they often act with a high degree of independence.\n\n* The General Directorate of Competition, Consumption & Repression of Frauds (''Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la r\u00e9pression des fraudes (DGCCRF)'') regulates and controls the legality and safety of products and services available on the markets open to competition for all [[economic actor]]s and private consumers, and can deliver administrative ''sanctions'' in case of abuses.\n* The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (''Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'aviation civile (DGAC)'') regulates the traffic in the national air space and delivers the authorizations for airways companies and other private or public organizations and people.\n* The National Agency for Employment (''Agence nationale pour l'emploi (ANPE)'') maintained{{when?|date=March 2019}} a public registry for the allocation of social benefits to unemployed people (but {{as of | 2019 | alt = now}} a single registry is shared with the independent ''ASSEDIC'' paying them, a joint association of employers and workers unions), assists them as well as employers seeking people, and controls them. The French State names its general director and the Parliament provides for its finances and personnel, but it only fills one-third of the seats at its decision board of directors (the other seats are shared equally by unions of employers and of workers).\n* The National Agency of Frequencies (''Agence nationale des fr\u00e9quences (ANFR)''), a public establishment of an administrative character,<ref>\nCode of postal services and electronic communications, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&code=CPOSTESL.rcv&art=L43 article L43]\n</ref> regulates and maintains the allocation of radio frequency spectrum resources along with other international frequencies regulators and national regulators (the CSA and ARCEP) or public ministries, controls the operators on the national territory, and publishes compliance standards for manufacturers of radioelectric equipment.\n\n===Organization of government services===\nEach ministry has a central administration (''administration centrale''), generally divided into directorates. These directorates are usually subdivided into divisions or sub-directorates. Each directorate is headed by a director, named by the [[President in Council]]. The central administration largely stays the same, regardless of the political tendency of the executive in power.\n\nIn addition, each minister has a private office, which is composed of members whose nomination is politically determined, called the ''cabinet''. Cabinets are quite important and employ numbers of highly qualified staff to follow all administrative and political affairs. They are powerful, and have been sometimes considered as a parallel administration, especially (but not only) in all matters that are politically sensitive. Each ''cabinet'' is led by a chief-of-staff entitled ''directeur de cabinet''.\n\nThe state also has distributive services spread throughout French territory, often reflecting divisions into ''[[r\u00e9gion in France|r\u00e9gions]]'' or ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partements]]''. The [[prefect]], the representative of the national government in each ''r\u00e9gion'' or ''d\u00e9partement'', supervises the activities of the distributive services in his or her jurisdiction. Generally, the services of a certain administration in a ''r\u00e9gion'' or ''d\u00e9partement'' are managed by a high-level civil servant, often called director, but not always; for instance, the services of the ''[[Tr\u00e9sor public]]'' (Treasury) in each ''d\u00e9partement'' are headed by a treasurer-paymaster general, appointed by the President of the Republic.  In the last several{{quantify|date=March 2019}} decades, the departmental ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (see \"Local Government\" below) has taken on new responsibilities and plays an important role in administrating government services at the local level.\n\nThe government also maintains public establishments. These have a relative administrative and financial autonomy, to accomplish a defined mission. They are attached to one or more supervising authorities. These are classified into several categories:\n* public establishments of an administrative character, including, for instance:\n** universities, and most public establishments of higher education\n** establishments of a research and technical character, such as [[CNRS]] or [[INRIA]]\n* public establishments of an industrial and commercial character, including, for instance, [[Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00c9nergie Atomique|CEA]] and [[Ifremer]]\nNote that in administrations and public establishments of an administrative character operate under public law, while establishments of an industrial and commercial character operate mostly under private law. In consequence, in the former, permanent personnel are civil servants, while normally in the latter, they are contract employees.\n\nIn addition, the government owns and controls all, or the majority, of shares of some companies, like ''[[Electricit\u00e9 de France]]'', ''[[SNCF]]'' or ''[[Areva]]''.\n\n[[Social security]] organizations, though established by statute and controlled and supervised by the state, are not operated nor directly controlled by the national government. Instead, they are managed by the \"social partners\" (''partenaires sociaux'') \u2013 unions of employers such as the [[MEDEF]] and unions of employees. Their budget is separate from the national budget.\n\n==Shadow Cabinet of France==\nsince 2018 [[Shadow Cabinet of France]]\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{Main|Parliament of France}}\nThe Parliament of France, making up the [[legislative branch]], consists of two houses: the National Assembly and the Senate; the Assembly is the pre-eminent body.\n\nParliament meets for one nine-month session each year: under special circumstances the President can call an additional session. Although parliamentary powers have diminished from those existing under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], the National Assembly can still cause a government to fall if an absolute majority of the total Assembly membership votes to censure. It has never happened since the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958.\n\nThe government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament. The government also can link its term to a legislative text which it proposes, and unless a motion of censure is introduced (within 24 hours after the proposal) and passed (within 48 hours of introduction{{spaced ndash}}thus full procedures last at most 72 hours), the text is considered adopted without a vote.\n\nMembers of Parliament enjoy [[parliamentary immunity]].<ref>This immunity is called for in article 26 of the Constitution, as defined by the [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX9500101L Constitutional law of 5 August 1995]. See: National assembly, [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/connaissance/immunite.asp L'immunit\u00e9 parlementaire].</ref> Both assemblies have committees that write reports on a variety of topics. If necessary, they can establish parliamentary enquiry commissions with broad investigative power.\n\n===National Assembly===\n[[File:Paris Assemblee Nationale DSC00074.jpg|thumb|250px|The National Assembly sits in the ''[[Palais Bourbon]]'', by the [[Seine River|Seine]].]]\n{{Main|National Assembly (France)}}\n\nThe National Assembly is the principal legislative body. Its 577 deputies are directly elected for five-year terms in local majority votes, and all seats are voted on in each election.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe National Assembly may force the resignation of the government by voting a motion of censure. For this reason, the Prime Minister and their government are necessarily from the dominant party or coalition in the assembly. In the case of a president and assembly from opposing parties, this leads to the situation known as ''[[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]''. While motions of censure are periodically proposed by the opposition following government actions that it deems highly inappropriate, they are purely rhetorical; party discipline ensures that, throughout a parliamentary term, the government is never overthrown by the Assembly.\n\n====Latest election====\n{{French legislative election, 2017}}\n\n===Senate===\n[[File:French Senate amphitheater 050917 162927.jpg|thumb|250px|The Senate's amphitheater.]]\n{{Main|French Senate}}\n\nSenators are chosen by an electoral college of about 145,000 local elected officials for six-year terms, and half of the Senate is renewed every three years. Before the law of 30 July 2004, senators were elected for nine years, renewed by thirds every three years.<ref>http://www.senat.fr/lng/en/senators/the_senatorial_elections.html</ref> There are currently 321 senators, but there will be 346 in 2010; 304 represent the metropolitan and overseas ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partements]]'', five the other dependencies and 12 the French established abroad.\n\nThe Senate's legislative powers are limited; on most matters of legislation, the National Assembly has the last word in the event of a disagreement between the two houses.\n\nSince the beginning of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], the Senate has almost always had a right-wing majority. This is mostly due to the over-representation of small villages compared to big cities. This, and the indirect mode of election, prompted socialist [[Lionel Jospin]], who was Prime Minister at the time, to declare the Senate an \"anomaly\".<ref>''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1998-04-21/1998-04-21-414447 L'Humanit\u00e9]'', 21 April 1998; ''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1998-04-23/1998-04-23-414616 L'Humanit\u00e9]'', 23 April 1998; ''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2002-08-13/2002-08-13-38435 L'Humanit\u00e9]'', 13 August 2002</ref>\n\n===Legislation adoption procedures===\nStatute legislation may be proposed by the government (council of ministers), or by members of Parliament. In the first case, it is a ''projet de loi''; in the latter case, a ''proposition de loi''.\n\nAll ''projets de loi'' must undergo compulsory advisory review by the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]]'' before being submitted to parliament.<ref name=\"Constitution, article 39\">Constitution, article 39</ref> Since 2009, the bill submitted to Parliament must also come with a study of the possible impact of the law: other possible options, interactions with [[European law]], economical, social, financial and environmental consequences.<ref>Loi organique n\u00b0 2009-403 du 15 avril 2009 relative \u00e0 l'application des articles 34-1, 39 et 44 de la Constitution, [http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000020522653&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000020522634 article 8].</ref>\n\n''Propositions de loi'' cannot increase the financial load of the state without providing for funding.<ref>Constitution, article 40</ref>\n\n''Projets de loi'' start in the house of the government's choice (except in some narrow cases<ref name=\"Constitution, article 39\"/>). ''Propositions de loi'' start in the house where they originated. After the house has amended and voted on the text, it is sent to the other house, which can also amend it. If the houses do not choose to adopt the text in identical terms, it is sent before a commission made of equal numbers of members of both houses, which tries to harmonize the text. If it does not manage to do so, the National Assembly can vote the text and have the final say on it (except for laws related to the organization of the Senate).<ref>Constitution, article 46</ref>\n\nThe law is then sent to the President of France for signature.<ref name=\"Constitution, article 10\">Constitution, article 10</ref> At this point, the President of France, the speaker of either house or a delegation of 60 deputies or 60 senators can ask for the text to undergo constitutional review before being put into force;<ref>Constitution, article 61</ref> it is then sent before the Constitutional Council. The President can also, only once per law and with the countersigning of the Prime Minister, send the law back to parliament for another review.<ref name=\"Constitution, article 10\"/> Otherwise, the President must sign the law. After being countersigned by the Prime Minister and the concerned ministers,<ref>Constitution, article 19</ref> it is then sent to the ''[[Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise|Journal Officiel]]'' for publication.<ref>Civil Code, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&code=CCIVILL0.rcv&art=1 article 1]</ref>\n\n===Budget===\n{{See also|Taxation in France}}\n\n[[File:Public Deficit of France.png|thumb|450px|French government borrowing ([[budget deficits]]) as a percentage of GNP, 1960-2009.]]\nFinancing Acts (''lois de finances'') and the Social Security Financing Acts (''lois de financement de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale'') are special Acts of Parliament voted and approved through specific procedures.\n\nBecause of the importance of allowing government and social security organizations to proceed with the payment of their suppliers, employees, and recipients, without risk of a being stopped by parliamentary discord, these bills are specially constrained. In the past, parliamentarians would often add unrelated amendments (''cavaliers budg\u00e9taires'') to the finance bills, to get such amendments passed \u2013 because of the reduced time in which the budget is examined. However, these are nowadays considered unconstitutional. If Parliament cannot agree on a budget within some specified reasonable bounds, the government is entitled to adopt a budget through [[decree|ordinances]]: this threat prevents parliamentarians from threatening to bankrupt the executive.\n\nThe way the Finance Bill is organized, and the way the government has to execute the budget, were deeply reformed in 2001 by the ''Loi organique n\u00b02001-692 du 1er ao\u00fbt 2001 relative aux lois de finances'', generally known as the LOLF. Because of the major changes involved, the application of the law was gradual, and the first budget to be fully passed under LOLF will be the 2006 budget, passed in late 2005.\n\nThe LOLF divides expenses according to identifiable \"missions\" (which can be subdivided into sub-missions etc.). The performance of the administration and public bodies will be evaluated with respect to these missions.\n\nThe budget of the national government was forecast to be 290 billion [[Euro]] in 2011. This includes neither [[Social security in France#Budget|Social Security]], nor the budgets of [[D\u00e9centralisation in France#Financial Autonomy|local governments]].\n\n===Multiple offices===\n:''See [[cumul des mandats]]''\nIt has long been customary for Parliament members to hold, in addition to the office of deputy or senator, another local office such as [[Mayor (France)|city mayor]], hence titles like \"Deputy and Mayor\" (''d\u00e9put\u00e9-maire'') and \"Senator and Mayor\" (''s\u00e9nateur-maire''). This is known as the ''cumul'' of electoral offices. Proponents of the ''cumul'' allege that having local responsibilities ensures that members of parliament stay in contact with the reality of their constituency; also, they are said to be able to defend the interest of their city etc. better by having a seat in parliament.\n\nIn recent years, the ''cumul'' has been increasingly criticized. Critics contend that lawmakers that also have some local mandate cannot be assiduous to both tasks; for instance, they may neglect their duties to attend parliamentary sittings and commission in order to attend to tasks in their constituency. The premise that holders of dual office can defend the interest of their city etc. in the National Parliament is criticized in that national lawmakers should have the national interest in their mind, not the advancement of the projects of the particular city they are from. Finally, this criticism is part of a wider criticism of the political class as a cozy, closed world in which the same people make a long career from multiple positions.\n\nAs a consequence, laws that restrict the possibilities of having multiple mandates have been enacted.\n\n===Economic and Social Council===\n{{Main|French Economic and Social Council}}\n\nThe Economic and Social Council is a [[wikt:consultation|consultative]] assembly. It does not play a role in the adoption of statutes and regulations, but advises the lawmaking bodies on questions of social and economic policies.\n\nThe executive may refer any question or proposal of social or economic importance to the Economic and Social Council.\n\nThe Economic and Social Council publishes reports, which are sent to the Prime Minister, the National Assembly and the Senate. They are published in the ''[[Journal Official of the R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise|Journal Official]]''.\n\n==Judicial branch==\n{{Main|Judiciary of France}}\n\nFrench law provides for a separate judicial branch with an independent judiciary which does not answer to or is directly controlled by the other two branches of government. France has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal system, the basis of which is codified law; however, case law plays a significant role in the determination of the courts. The most distinctive feature of the French judicial system is that it is divided into judicial and administrative streams.\n\n===Judicial courts===\n\nThe judicial stream of courts adjudicates civil and criminal cases. The judicial court stream consists of inferior courts, intermediate [[Court of Appeal (France)|appellate courts]], and the French [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], the supreme court.\n\nJudges are government employees but are granted special statutory protection from the executive. Judges have security of tenure and may not be promoted (or demoted) without their consent. Their careers are overseen by the Judicial Council of France.\n\nThe public prosecutors, on the other hand, take orders from the Minister of Justice. In the past, this has bred suspicion of undue political pressure to dismiss suits or claims against government officials charged with corruption, and the status of public prosecutors and their ties to government are frequently topics of debate.\n\nTrial by [[jury]] is available only for severe criminal cases, which are the jurisdiction of the [[Cour d'assises|Courts of Assizes]]. A full Court is made up of a 3-judge panel and a petty jury of 9 jurors (vs. 12 jurors on appeal), who, together, render verdicts, and if a conviction is handed down, also determine a sentence. Jurors are selected at random from eligible voters.\n\nIn most other courts, judges are professional, except that the criminal court for minors is composed of one professional and two lay judges. Also, several specialty courts of original jurisdiction are sat by judges who are elected into office. For instance, labor tribunals are staffed with an equal number of magistrates from employers' unions and employees' unions. The same applies to land estate tribunals.\n\nPre-trial proceedings are [[inquisitorial]] by nature, but open court proceedings are [[adversarial]]. The [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in criminal proceedings is on the [[prosecution]], and the accused is constitutionally presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\n===Administrative courts===\n[[File:DSC00652 conseil etat.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]] sits in the ''Palais Royal''.]]\nCourts of administrative law adjudicate on claims and suits against government offices and agencies. The administrative stream is made up of administrative courts, courts of administrative appeal, and the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] as the court of last resort.\n\nThe Council of State hears cases against executive branch decisions and has the power to quash or set aside executive-issued statutory instruments such as orders and regulations when they violate constitutional law, enacted legislation, or codified law.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCourt proceedings mostly involve written hearings and are [[inquisitorial]], with judges having the parties submit written testimony or arguments.\n\nAny jurisdictional dispute between the judicial and administrative streams are settled by a special court called ''Tribunal des conflits'', or \"Court of Jurisdictional Dispute\", composed of an equal number of Supreme Court justices and councillors of State.\n\n===Constitutional Council===\n{{Main|Constitutional Council of France}}\n\nNeither judicial nor administrative courts are empowered to rule on the [[constitutionality]] of acts of Parliament.  While technically not part of the judicial branch, the '''Constitutional Council''' examines legislation and decides whether or not it violates the Constitution.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1994|title=Background Notes on Countries of the World 2003|url=|journal=Superintendent of Documents|volume=|pages=|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> This applies, prior to their enactment, to all forms of organic laws, but only by referral from the French President, [[List of Presidents of the Senate of France|President of the Senate]], [[List of Presidents of the National Assembly of France|President of the National Assembly]], the Prime Minister, or any of the 60 senators or 60 assembly members of the other types of laws or treaties. After their enactment, laws can all be reviewed by referral from the highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, or by the highest judicial court, the Cour de Cassation. The Constitutional Council may declare acts to be unconstitutional, even if they contradict the principles of the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (cited in the Preamble of the Constitution).\n\nCouncil members to the Constitutional Council are appointed for nine years (three every three years); three are appointed by the President, three by the President of the National Assembly, and three by the President of the Senate. The former presidents are also members for life of the Constitutional Council.\n\n===Financial courts===\nFrance's main Court of Audit (''[[Cour des Comptes]]'') and regional audit courts audit government finances, public institutions (including other courts), and public entities. The court publishes an annual report and can refer criminal matters to public prosecutors. It can also directly fine public accountants for mishandling funds, and refer civil servants who misused funds to the Court of Financial and Budgetary Discipline.\n\nThe main and regional audit courts do not judge the accountants of private organizations. However, in some circumstances, they may audit their accounting, especially when an organization has been awarded a government contract over a public utility or a service requiring the permanent use of the public domain or if an organization is a bidder on a government contract. The Court is often solicitated by various state agencies, parliamentary commissions, and public regulators, but it can also petitioned to act by any French citizen or organization operating in France.\n\nThe Court's finances are overseen by financial commissions of the two Houses of the French Parliament which also set the Court's working budget in the annual Act of finances.\n\n==Ombudsman==\nIn 1973 the position of ''m\u00e9diateur de la R\u00e9publique'' (the Republic's [[ombudsman]]) was created. The ombudsman is charged with solving, without the need to a recourse before the courts, the disagreements between citizens and the administrations and other entities charged with a mission of a public service;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=RADULESCU|first=Crina|date=January 2015|title=\"The European Ombudsman: Facilitator or Supervisor?.\"|url=http://libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=110150839&site=ehost-live&scope=site|journal=Juridical Current|volume=vol. 18 no. 1|pages=117\u2013127|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> proposing reforms to the Government and the administrations to further these goals; and actively participating in the international promotion of [[human rights]].\n\nThe ombudsman is appointed for a period of 6 years by the President of the Republic in the Council of Ministers. He cannot be removed from office and is protected for his official actions by an immunity similar to [[parliamentary immunity]]. He does not receive or accept orders from any authority. The current ombudsman is [[Jean-Paul Delevoye]].\n\n==French law==\n\n===Basic principles===\n[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|250px|The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].]]\nFrance uses a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system; that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judge interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to [[case law]]).\n\nMany fundamental principles of French Law were laid in the [[Napoleonic Code]]s. Basic principles of the [[rule of law]] were laid in the Napoleonic Code: laws can only address the future and not the past ([[ex post facto]] laws are prohibited); to be applicable, laws must have been officially published (see ''[[Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise|Journal Officiel]]'').\n\nIn agreement with the principles of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the general rule is that of freedom, and law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As [[Guy Canivet]], first president of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], said about what should be the rule in French law:<ref>Guy Canivet was saying how the rules governing prisons disregarded the basic rule of law that liberty is the general case and prohibition the exception. See Jacques Floch, [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/rap-enq/r2521-2.asp Report of the enquiry commission of the French national assembly on the situation in French prisons].</ref>\n:''Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.''\nThat is, law may lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.\n\nFrance does not recognize [[religious law]], nor does it recognize religious beliefs as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. As a consequence, France has long had neither [[blasphemy]] laws nor [[sodomy law]]s (the latter being abolished in 1789).\n\n===Statutory law versus executive regulations===\nFrench law differentiates between legislative acts (''loi''), generally passed by the [[legislative branch]], and [[regulation]]s (''r\u00e8glement'', instituted by ''d\u00e9crets''), issued by the Prime Minister. There also exist secondary regulation called ''arr\u00eat\u00e9s'', issued by ministers, subordinates acting in their names, or local authorities; these may only be taken in areas of competency and within the scope delineated by primary legislation. There are also more and more regulations issued by independent agencies, especially relating to economic matters.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of France (article 34):\n\nStatutes shall concern:\n* [[civil rights|Civic rights]] and the fundamental guarantees granted to citizens for the exercise of their [[public liberties]]; the obligations imposed for the purposes of [[defense (military)|national defence]] upon citizens in respect of their persons and their [[property]];\n* Nationality, the status and legal capacity of persons, matrimonial regimes, [[inheritance]] and gifts;\n* The determination of serious [[crime]]s and other major offences and the penalties applicable to them; [[criminal procedure]]; [[amnesty]]; the establishment of new classes of [[court]]s and tribunals and the regulations governing the members of the [[judiciary]];\n* The base, rates and methods of collection of [[tax]]es of all types; the issue of [[currency]].\n\nStatutes shall likewise determine the rules concerning:\n* The [[electoral system|electoral]] systems of [[French Parliament|parliamentary assemblies]] and local assemblies;\n* The creation of categories of public establishments;\n* The fundamental guarantees granted to civil and military personnel employed by the State;\n* The [[nationalization]] of enterprises and transfers of ownership in enterprises from the public to the private sector.\n\nStatutes shall determine the fundamental principles of:\n* The general organization of national defence;\n* The self-government of territorial units, their powers and their resources;\n* [[Education]];\n* The regime governing ownership, rights in rem, and civil and commercial obligations;\n* [[Labour law]], [[trade union|trade-union]] law and [[social security]].\n\nFinance Acts shall determine the resources and obligations of the State in the manner and with the reservations specified in an institutional Act.\nSocial Security Finance Acts shall determine the general conditions for the financial balance of Social Security and, in light of their revenue forecasts, shall determine expenditure targets in the manner and with the reservations specified in an institutional Act.\nProgramme Acts shall determine the objectives of the economic and social action of the State.\n\nThe provisions of this article may be enlarged upon and complemented by an organic law.\n\nOther areas are matters of [[regulation]]. This separation between law and regulation is enforced by the ''Conseil constitutionnel'': the government can, with the agreement of the ''Conseil constitutionnel'', modify by decrees the laws that infringe on the domain of regulations. At the same, the ''Conseil d'\u00c9tat'' nullifies decrees that infringe on the domain of the law.\n\n===Order of authority for sources of the law===\nWhen courts have to deal with incoherent texts, they apply a certain hierarchy: a text higher in the hierarchy will overrule a lower text. The general rule is that the Constitution is superior to laws which are superior to regulations. However, with the intervention of European law and international treaties, and the quasi-[[case law]] of the administrative courts, the hierarchy may become somewhat unclear. The following hierarchy of norms should thus be taken with due caution:\n\n# French Constitution, including the basic core constitutional values recognized by the laws of the Republic as defined by the Constitutional Council\n# European Union treaties and regulations\n# International treaties and agreements\n# organic laws\n# ordinary laws\n# executive orders (advised on by the Council of State)\n# other executive orders\n# rules and regulations\n#* of multiple ministers\n#* of a single minister\n#* of local authorities\n# regulations and decisions by independent agencies.\n\n==Local government==\nTraditionally, decision-making in France is highly centralized, with each of France's [[Departments of France|departments]] headed by a [[Prefect (France)|prefect]] appointed by the central government, in addition to the ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'', a locally elected council. However, in 1982, the national government passed legislation to [[Decentralisation|decentralize]] authority by giving a wide range of administrative and fiscal powers to local elected officials. In March 1986, regional councils were directly elected for the first time, and the process of decentralization has continued, albeit at a slow pace. In March 2003, a constitutional revision has changed very significantly the legal framework towards a more decentralized system and has increased the powers of local governments. Albeit France is still one of the most centralized major countries in Europe and the world.\n\nAdministrative units with a local government in [[Metropolitan France]] (that is, the parts of France lying in Europe) consist of:\n* about 36,000 ''[[commune in France|communes]]'', headed by a municipal council and a mayor, grouped in\n* 96 ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partements]]'', headed by a ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (general council) and its president, grouped in\n* 18 ''[[r\u00e9gion in France|r\u00e9gions]]'', headed by a [[Conseil r\u00e9gional|regional council]] and its [[President of the regional council|president]].\n\nThe ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' is an institution created in 1790 by the French Revolution in each of the newly created departments (they were suppressed by the Vichy government from 1942 to 1944).  A ''conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (departmental councillor) must be at least 21 years old and either live or pay taxes in locality from which he or she is elected. (Sociologist Jean Viard noted [''Le Monde'', 22 Feb 2006] that half of all ''conseillers g\u00e9n\u00e9raux'' were still ''fils de paysans'', i.e. sons of peasants, suggesting France's deep rural roots). Though the central government can theoretically dissolve a ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (in case of a dysfunctional ''conseil''), this has happened only once in the Fifth Republic.\n\nThe ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' discusses and passes laws on matters that concern the department; it is administratively responsible for departmental employees and land, manages subsidized housing, public transportation, and school subsidies, and contributes to public facilities. It is not allowed to express \"political wishes.\" The ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' meets at least three times a year and elects its president for a term of 3 years, who presides over its \"permanent commission,\" usually consisting of 5-10 other departmental councillors elected from among their number. The ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' has accrued new powers in the course of the political decentralization that has occurred past in France during the past thirty years. There are in all more than 4,000 ''conseillers g\u00e9n\u00e9raux'' in France.   \n   \nDifferent levels of administration have different duties, and shared responsibility is common; for instance, in the field of education, ''communes'' run public elementary schools, while ''d\u00e9partements'' run public junior high schools and ''r\u00e9gions'' run public high schools, but only for the building and upkeep of buildings; curricula and teaching personnel are supplied by the national Ministry of Education.\n\nThe 3 main cities, [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]] have a special statute. Paris is at the same time a ''commune'' and a ''d\u00e9partement'' with an institution, the ''Conseil de Paris'', that is elected at the same time as the other ''conseil municipaux'', but that operates also as a ''conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral''. The 3 cities are also divided into ''arrondissement'' each having its ''conseil d'arrondissement'' and its mayor.\n   \n[[French overseas departments and territories|French overseas possessions]] are divided into two groups:   \n* Four [[r\u00e9gions d'outre-mer|overseas ''regions'']], with some strong similarity of organization to their metropolitan counterparts; in these overseas regions all laws of France are automatically applicable, except if a specific text provides otherwise or provides some adaptation. The four ''r\u00e9gions'' are fully incorporated parts of the territory of the French Republic, and as such belong to the European Union, which means that European law is applicable;\n* [[Territoires d'outre-mer|Territories]], generally having greater autonomy. In general, French laws are not applicable, except if a specific text provides otherwise. A new Territory was created in February 2007: [[Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy]]. This Territory used to be part of the overseas department of Guadeloupe. The statute of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy provides the automatic application of French law, except mostly in the domain of taxes and immigration, which are left to the Territory. The Territories do not belong to the European Union. However, as \"overseas territories\" they have association agreements with the EU and may opt into some EU provisions. EU law applies to them only insofar is necessary to implement the association agreements.\n\nAll inhabited French territory is represented in both houses of Parliament and votes for the presidential election.\n\n==References==\n''All texts in French unless otherwise noted.''\n\n===Specific===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===General===\n* Legal reference texts\n** General reference\n*** [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr General government web site with all texts, including some that are translated to English]\n** Constitution\n*** ''[[Constitution of France|Constitution de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise]]''\n*** [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/textes/c1958web.htm original text]\n*** [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp official English translation]\n*** [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] ([[s:fr:D\u00e9claration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen|French text]], [[s:en:Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|English translation]])\n** Rules of procedure\n*** Rules of procedure of the National Assembly (original text, English version)\n** Justice\n*** ''Code civil'' (official English translation)\n*** ''Code des juridictions financi\u00e8res''\n*** ''Code de proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale'' (official English translation)\n*** ''Code de justice administrative''\n** Budget\n*** [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=ECOX0104681L The LOLF] (official English translation)\n** Ombudsman\n*** [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/PPEAP.htm Law 73-6 of 3 January 1973], creating the position of the Ombudsman (updated version)\n** Justice\n*** [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnCode?commun=&code=CCIVILL0.rcv Civil Code, statutory part]\n*** [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnCode?commun=&code=CPROCIV0.rcv Code of Civil Procedure, statutory part] (official English translation)\n*** [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnCode?commun=&code=CPENALLL.rcv Criminal Code, statutory part] official English translation)\n*** [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnCode?commun=&code=CPROCPEL.rcv Code of Criminal Procedure, statutory part] (official English translation)\n*** [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnCode?commun=&code=CJUSADML.rcv Code of Administrative Justice, statutory part]\n* Official documentation\n** General\n*** ''Vie publique&nbsp;: d\u00e9couverte des institutions''\n*** ''Les pouvoirs publics.
