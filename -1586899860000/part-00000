It was Faulkner's first short story published in a national magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~egjbp/faulkner/r_ss_roseforemily.html|title=WFotW ~ \"A Rose for Emily\": COMMENTARY & RESOURCES|website=www.mcsr.olemiss.edu|access-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420052408/http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~egjbp/faulkner/r_ss_roseforemily.html|archive-date=2017-04-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Title==\n[[Faulkner]]&nbsp;described the title \"A Rose For Emily\" as an [[allegorical]]&nbsp;title: this woman had undergone a great tragedy, and for this Faulkner pitied her.

Roses have been portrayed in Greek legends as a gift of secrecy and of confidentiality, known as ''[[sub rosa]]'', introducing that the rose is a symbol of silence between the narrator and Miss Emily, the narrator keeps Emily's secrets until her death.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe story opens with a brief first-person account of the funeral of [[Emily Grierson]], an elderly Southern woman whose funeral is the obligation of their small town. It then proceeds in a [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear fashion]] to the narrator's recollections of Emily's archaic and increasingly strange behavior throughout the years. Emily is a member of a family of the [[antebellum South]]ern aristocracy. After the Civil War, the family falls into hard times. She and her father, the last two of the clan, continue to live as if in the past; Emily's father refuses for her to marry.  Her father dies when Emily is about the age of 30, which takes her by surprise. She refuses to give up his corpse, and the townspeople write it off as her grieving process. The townspeople pity Emily not only after her father's death but also during his life when he wouldn't let Emily marry. Emily depended heavily on her father, believing he would never leave her; he was all she had.\n\nAfter her father's death, the only person seen moving about Emily's home is Tobe, a black man serving as Emily's butler. He is frequently seen entering and exiting the house for groceries. Although Emily did not have a strong relationship with her community, she did give art lessons to young children within her town at the age of forty. A prime reason why she gave art lessons was her financial problem since she was running out of money. The townspeople make cruel comments and nasty looks behind Miss Emily's back, as she wasn't respected in her town. With the acceptance of her father's death, Emily somewhat revives, even changing the style of her hair, and becomes friendly with Homer Barron. He is a Northern laborer who comes to town shortly after Mr. Grierson's death. The connection surprises some of the community while others are glad she is taking an interest; however, \"Homer likes men and claims that he is not a marrying man.\" <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\" /> This draws attention to Homer's questionable sexuality in the story. Emily shortly buys arsenic from a druggist in town, presumably to kill rats, however, the townspeople are convinced that she will use it to poison herself. Emily's distant cousins are called into town by the minister's wife to supervise Miss Emily and Homer Barron. Homer leaves town for some time, reputedly to give Emily a chance to get rid of her cousins, and returns three days later after the cousins have left. After he is observed entering Miss Emily's home one evening, Homer is never seen alive again.\n\nDespite these turnabouts in her social status, Emily continues to behave mysteriously, as she had before her father died. Her reputation is such that the city council finds itself unable to confront her about a strong smell that has begun to emanate from the house. They believed Tobe was unable to maintain the house and something was rotting, unaware that a death has occurred.  Instead, the council decide to send men to her house under the cover of darkness to sprinkle lime around the house, after which the smell dissipates. The mayor of the town, [[Colonel (title)|Colonel]] Sartorius, makes a [[gentleman's agreement]] to overlook her taxes as an act of charity, though it is done under a pretense of repayment towards her father, to assuage Emily's pride after her father's death. Years later, when the next generation has come to power, Emily insists on this informal arrangement, flatly refusing that she owes any taxes, stating \"I have no taxes in Jefferson.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Faulkner, William.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1002098944|title=A Rose for Emily and Other Stories|date=2012|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-79969-2|oclc=1002098944}}</ref> After this, the council declines to press the issue due to her stubbornness. Emily has become a [[recluse]]: she is never seen outside of the house, and only rarely accepts people into it. The community eventually comes to view her as a \"hereditary obligation\" on the town, who must be humored and tolerated.\n\nThe funeral is a large affair: Emily had become an institution, so her death sparks a great deal of curiosity about her reclusive nature and what remains of her house. After she is buried, a group of townsfolk enters her house to see what remains of her life there. Tobe walked out of the house and was never seen again, giving the townspeople access to Miss Emily's home. The door to her upstairs bedroom is locked, and some of the townsfolk break down the door to see what has been hidden for so long. Inside, among the possessions that Emily had bought for Homer, lies the decomposed corpse of Homer Barron on the bed. On the pillow beside him is the indentation of a head and a single strand of gray hair, indicating that Emily had slept with Homer's corpse. The house is an indicator revealing how Emily struggled to keep everything the same, in a frozen time period, avoiding change.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n'''Emily Grierson''' - The main character of the story. Emily's father kept her from seeing suitors and controlled her social life, keeping her in isolation until his death, when she is 30 years old.<ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Her struggle with loss and attachment is the impetus for the plot, driving her to kill Homer Barron, the man that is assumed to have married her. Emily presumably poisons and kills Homer, as she sees murder as the only way to keep Homer with her permanently. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> She treats him as her living husband even after his death, which is shown by her keeping his clothes in the room, keeping his engraved wedding items on the dresser, and the strand of her hair found beside his corpse at the end of the story that indicated she even slept beside him. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Emily's murderous act also displays her obstinate nature. This is evident in Emily's refusal to pay her taxes, her denial of her father's death, and the fact that she kills Homer to ensure that he will never leave her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> \n\n'''Homer Barron''' - Emily's romantic interest. He is later found dead and decomposed in Emily's bedroom after her funeral. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> He initially enters the story as a foreman for a road construction project occurring in the town. He is soon seen to be with Emily in her Sunday carriage rides, and it is expected for them to be married. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Homer differs from the rest of the town because he is a Northerner. The story takes place in the South shortly after the Civil War, and while Homer is not necessarily unwelcome to the town, he does stand out. This, along with the fact that he is seemingly courting Emily, sets him apart from all of the other characters in the story. It is because he is an outlier that Emily becomes attracted to him. It is generally unknown if Homer reciprocates the romantic feelings Emily has for him. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> It is stated in the story, that Homer likes men and is \"not the marrying kind\"  he has commitment issues. Furthermore this brings into light Homer's homosexuality.\n\n'''The Narrator''' - An unnamed member(s) of the town who watches the events of Emily's life unfold in its entirety. The story is presented to the reader in a non-chronological order; this suggests that the story may have been patched together by multiple tellers. Some parts of the story are repeated, such as Homer's disappearance, the idea that Emily and Homer will get married, and Emily's refusal to pay taxes, also indicating that the narrator is a voice for the town. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Getty|first=Laura|date=Summer 2005|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://mrsstaceybrown.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/4/4/12441735/rose_for_emily_literary_analysis.pdf|journal=The Explicator|volume=63|pages=230\u2013234}}</ref> Though the townspeople disapprove of most of Emily's actions, such as refusing to pay her taxes and purchasing poison, nobody intervenes.\n\n'''Colonel Sartoris''' - The former mayor who remitted Emily's taxes. While he is in the story very little, his decision to remit Emily's taxes leads to her refusal to pay them ever again, contributing to her stubborn personality. The reason for Sartoris remitting her taxes is never given, only that he told Emily it was because her father loaned the money to the town. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Mr. Grierson''' - Emily's father, the patriarchal head of the Grierson family. His control over Emily's personal life prohibited her from romantic involvement. The reason for his refusal to let Emily court men is not explained in the story.<ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> \nWhatever the reason, Mr. Grierson shapes the person that Emily becomes. His decision to ban all men from her life drives her to kill the first man she is attracted to and can be with, Homer Barron, in order to keep him with her permanently. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\n'''The cousins''' - Emily's extended relatives from Alabama. They come to town during Emily's courting of Homer Barron to check on Emily's well-being. They are thought of as even more uptight and stuffy than Emily by the townspeople. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> They are called in to prevent Emily and Homer from marrying; however, they are later sent back home so that the two can be wed. It is speculated that there may be some type of dispute between Emily and the cousins, indicated by them living far away from Emily and the fact that they did not attend Emily's father's funeral. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\n'''Tobe''' - Emily's cook/gardener, who is also acts as her secret keeper. Tobe is a loyal individual to Emily. During the years of Emily's isolation, he provides no details of her life to the townspeople and promptly disappears directly following her death. He became old and stooped from all of his work while Emily grew large and immobile. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> This could suggest that he resented Emily, or at the very least disliked working for her, as he does not mourn her or stay for her funeral.\n\n== Structure ==\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}} \n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\n\nFaulkner tells this story in a series of flashbacks and stretches the story out over decades. It starts with the announcement of Emily's death, an event that has the entire town talking. This leads the reader to assume that she was an important figure in the town. As Fassler says in his article \u201cThe Key,\u201d \u201cClearly, this lady who died unmarried was of importance to everyone. And yet the town itself is eventually divided,\u201d<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/the-key-to-writing-a-mystery-is-asking-the-perfect-question/515799/</ref> and we see that division with the events depicted in between the announcement at the beginning and the revelation at the end are told out of order, making the reader analyze the story more closely than if it was told chronologically. Based on the townspeople's thoughts of Emily displayed in this section, the reader discovers that the town was not dreading Emily's death. On the other hand, it was somewhat welcomed. Emily stuck out from the rest of the town as a figure stuck in the past, desperately trying to cling to old traditions and ways of life. With her passing on, the town can finally be free of this remnant, being wholly set in the present. Had the story been told in a linear fashion, this understanding would have been lost, something Faulkner knew and incorporated into the story. By presenting the story in terms of present and past events, he could examine how they influence each other. In terms of mathematical precision, time moves on and what exists is only the present. In terms of the more subjective time, time moves on but memories can exist no matter how much time changes. Those memories stay unhindered. Through this Faulkner could analyze the depth at which Miss Emily could change as a character. If Faulkner presented the story in a linear fashion, the chances of the reader sympathizing with Emily would be far less. By telling the story out of order, the reader sees Emily as a tragic product of her environment rather than a twisted necrophiliac.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\n\n\"A Rose for Emily\" discusses many dark themes that characterized the Old South and [[Southern Gothic]] fiction. \n\nThe story explores themes of death and resistance to change. Also, it reflects the decaying of the societal tenets of the South in the 1930s. [[Emily Grierson]] had been oppressed by her father for most of her life and hadn't questioned it because that was her way of living. Likewise, the antiquated traditions of the south (often harmful, such as in the treatment of black people) had remained acceptable, as that was their way of living. Once her father had passed, Emily, in denial, refused to give his corpse up for burial\u2014this shows her inability to functionally adapt to change. When the present mayor and aldermen insist Miss Emily pay the taxes which she had been exempted from, she refuses and continues to live in her house. Miss Emily's stubborn insistence that she \"pays no taxes in Jefferson\" and her mistaking the new mayor for Colonel Sartoris brings into question whether her acts of resistance are a conscious act of defiance or a result of a decayed mental stability. The reader is only shown Emily from an external perspective, we can not ascertain whether she acts in a rational manner or not. The death of Homer, if interpreted as having been a murder, can be seen in the context of the North-South clash. Homer, notably a northerner, is not one for the tradition of marriage. In the framework that his death was not an accident, but a murder on the part of Emily, Homer's rejection of the marriage can be seen as the North's rejection of Southern tradition. The South ends its relations with the North in retaliation. Emily continuing to sleep next to Homer's body can be seen as the south holding on to an ideal that is no longer feasible. \n\nControl and its repercussions is a persistent theme throughout the story. Emily's father was an intimidating and manipulative figure, keeping her from experiencing life in her own terms. She was never able to grow, learn, live her life, start a family, and marry the one she truly loved. Even after Emily's father died, his presence and impact on his daughter were still apparent. Discussing Emily and her father, the townspeople said \"We had long thought of them as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Literature An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, Drama, and Writing|date=2016|page=32|last1=Kennedy|first1=X.J.}}</ref> Emily is portrayed as small and powerless, placed behind the overbearing frame of her father. She wears white, a symbol of innocence and purity. Emily falls victim to the ruling hand of her father and to her place in the society: she has to uphold the [[noblesse oblige]] to which she was born into. In this way, her father's influence remains after he has passed. This control leads to Emily's isolation, both externally and internally imposed. Emily is alone, yet always being watched by the townspeople; she is both apart from and a part of the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> Her position prevents her from ever finding happiness.\n\nThe power of death is a consistent theme throughout the story. Emily herself is portrayed as a \"skeleton\" that is both \"small and spare\" which is representative of the fact that she emanates death. When it comes to death itself, Emily is in denial and most of that feeling has to do with her loneliness. After her father dies, she keeps his corpse for three days and refuses to admit that he is dead. The reader also sees this with the corpse of Homer Barron, except she is the one who inflicts death upon him. She poisons him and keeps him locked away in her room; she did not want to lose the only other person she had ever loved, so she made his stay permanent. These examples show that the power of death triumphs over everything, including \"poor Emily\", herself.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Ji-won|title=Narrator as Collective 'We':The Narrative Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\"|journal=English Language and Literature Teaching|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nDue to this inevitability in the portrayal of death, A Rose for Emily is seen as a tale based on determinism, making the short story part of the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism literary movement]]. Here, a character's fate is already determined no matter how much the individual struggles to change it. There are impersonal forces of nature that prevent him or her from taking control. As the very universe itself appear indifferent, this character descends into an inevitable death and decay. The case of Emily is the same. She had a mental illness, an unavoidable fate, which her father must have sought to finally end by refusing to let Emily marry, which would have continued his line. No matter what she did, there was the implication that she would ultimately go mad. There was also the depiction of a cursed land due to slavery and the class structure based upon it and that no matter how the people clung to the glorious past and soldier on, there was a tarnished way of life that leads to an impending ruin. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Strategies and Genre Conventions in Literary Studies: Teaching and Writing in the Disciplines|last=Wilder|first=Laura|publisher=SIU Press|year=2012|isbn=9780809330942|location=|pages=146}}</ref>\n\n== Critical response ==\n\n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\nFloyd C. Watkins wrote about the structure of \"A Rose for Emily\" in \"[[Modern Language Notes]]\". Watkins claims that this is Faulkner's best story and that he is among the best American writers of this time period. Faulkner had to carefully dissect his sections, bringing importance to every aspect of Miss Emily's life, but Watkins sees this as a \"structural problem\" but later goes on to rave about the symmetry of this short story. Watkins enjoys this story in its entirety, and is impressed by Faulkner's ordering, as building suspense was an important aspect in the response.<ref>Watkins, Floyd C. \"Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\".\" Modern Language Notes 7th ser. 69 (1954): 508-10. JSTOR. Web. 5 Apr. 2017.</ref>\n\nThis critical response by John Skinner explores the interpretations of Faulkner's short story in detail while reviewing the importance of over-analyzing a piece of literary work. William Faulkner published this story in the 1930s, Skinner had published his critical response in 1985. More than 40 years have passed and people are still ignoring his claim; \u201cA Rose for Emily\u201d should not be interpreted any further. The characters and theme of this tale have been scrutinized by many. There have been numerous interpretations of what Miss Emily stands for; Skinner gives examples of scholars including S.W. M. Johnson \u201cEmily represented a refusal to submit to, or even concede, to the inevitability of change\u201d. Whereas, William Going pictures Emily as a rose, \u201cthe treasured memory of the Confederate veterans\u201d. The point of view according to Skinner is of immediate relevance to the story as the chief character, the narrator tells the chronology of the story. This narrator gives approximately \u201cround figures\u201d for the important events of the accounts. Yet the exact chronology is of little relevance to the overall importance of the story itself. John Skinner states that Faulkner should be taken literally, appreciate his formal subtlety in his works.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skinner|first=John|date=Winter 1985|title=\"A Rose for Emily\": Against Interpretation.\"|url=|journal=The Journal of Narrative Technique|volume=15.1|pages=42\u201351}}</ref>\n\nAlice Petry introduces a different type of critical response that is not focused on the usual subjects. Rather, she focuses on the complex and provocative language. For example, Hall discusses how the sentence, \"Thus she passed from generation to generation-dear, inescapable, impervious, tranquil and perverse\" has been considered misleading, but is in fact strategically placed to provide foreshadowing and unification of plot. The five descriptive words used in the sentence each correspond to one of the five parts in the order they are seen. For example, the adjective \"inescapable\" corresponds to Part II, to the incident of the strange smell coming from Miss Emily's home. Faulkner's placement of these adjectives at the end of Part IV serves as an important unifying sentence that connects all five parts to each other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petry|first=Alice|date=Spring 1986|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=509417186&S=R&D=brb&EbscoContent=dGJyMNXb4kSeqLQ4v%2BbwOLCmr0%2BeprZSsam4SrKWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvsku1p69MuePfgeyx43zx|journal=Explicator|volume=44|pages=52\u201354}}</ref>\n\nJim Barloon of the University of St. Thomas wrote about an idea introduced to him by his students, that Homer was homosexual, possibly providing another reason for his murder. He proposes that Emily did not kill Homer because of her own insecurities, but also because he did not reciprocate her romantic feelings. Thus, she could have murdered him out of affection as well as spite. Whether or not this theory is correct, it proves that the story is still being closely analyzed decades after it was written. As Barloon states in his article, \u201cPositing that Homer Barron is gay not only raises a new set of questions but transforms [the story], or at least our perspective of it.\u201d<ref>http://www.semo.edu/cfs/teaching/10186.html</ref>\n\nThe psychology of Emily Grierson has been analyzed countless times, with many people reaching the conclusion that she was mentally ill, and from that point, the reasons why. Though many different diagnoses have been made, the most common can be summarized as follows by Nicole Smith in her psychological analysis of the character: \u201cIt is reasonable to propose that Miss Emily developed [schizophrenia] as a response to the demanding conditions in which she was living as a Southern woman from an aristocratic family.\u201d<ref>http://www.articlemyriad.com/psychological-character-analysis-rose-emily/{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> This has been thought to represent just how unbearable life in the old South could be, not only for a person similar to Emily but to the people around them as well. A contributing factor to this point would change. The story is an allegory for the change that the South dealt with after the Civil War, with Emily representing the resistance of that change. This is shown in the story through Emily's conflicts with the town and her refusal of cooperation. Tuncay Tezcan in his analysis of the story states, \u201cIt represents the numerous conflicts in the main character's life, illustrating the effect of social change on the individual.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.101 |title=A Stylistic Analysis of a Rose for Emily by William Faulkner and its Turkish Translation |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |volume=158 |pages=364\u20139 |year=2014 |last1=Tezcan |first1=Tuncay }}</ref>\n\nThere has been much discussion over the title of the story. Why have a rose for Emily? At that time, giving a rose to a woman was common if they had been through a great tragedy. Emily's tragedy is her environment, changing quickly and with volatility, causing her to cling to the past in hopes of stopping the change from occurring. This has a deep impact on her mental state, driving her to extreme acts such as murdering Homer and then sleeping with his corpse for years. The town does nothing to stop these events, merely entertain the idea. Terry Heller writes in his analysis of the story that the town, \u201c[chose] to deal with an idea of Emily, rather than with Emily herself; they are different in that they have different ideas of her and, therefore, approach her\u2026 differently.\u201d<ref>http://www.public.coe.edu/~theller/essays/rose.html{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> With nobody willing to help her, Emily died a broken person, and for that Faulkner gave her a rose, in sympathy of her ending.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n* ''A Rose for Emily''\u2014[[PBS]] adaptation with [[Anjelica Huston]].\n* [[My Chemical Romance]]'s song \"To The End\" from [[Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge]] (2005) loosely retells the story of Homer and Miss Emily.\n* [[The Zombies]]' song \"A Rose for Emily\" retells the story, and is about a strong theme present in the story: Miss Emily living and dying alone, unloved.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Petridis|first1=Alexis|title=The story behind A Rose for Emily \u2013 and why it's perfect for S-Town|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2017/apr/17/rose-for-emily-s-town-zombies-podcast-john-b-mclemore|work=The Guardian|date=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Andrea Camilleri]] has a similar theme in his novel ''[[The Scent of the Night]]'' influencing his character Detective Salvo Montalbano.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Morton, Clay (2005). \"'A Rose for Emily': Oral Plot, Typographic Story\", ''Storytelling: A Critical Journal of Popular Narrative'' 5.1.\n\n{{Faulkner}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rose For Emily, A}}\n[[Category:1930 short stories]]\n[[Category:Short stories by William Faulkner]]\n[[Category:Horror short stories]]\n[[Category:Necrophilia in fiction]]\n[[Category:Short stories adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Nonlinear narrative literature]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = A Rose for Emily\n| title_orig    = \n| translator    = \n| image         = <!--prefer 1st edition-->\n| image_caption = \n| author        = [[William Faulkner]]\n| country       = United States\n| language      = English\n| series        = \n| genre         = [[Southern gothic]]\n| published_in  = 1930\n| publication_type = \n| publisher     = \n|\n| preceded_by   = \n| followed_by   = \n}}\n\n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\n\n\"'''A Rose for Emily'''\" is a [[short story]] by American author [[William Faulkner]], first published in April 30, 1930, in an issue of ''[[The Forum (defunct magazine)|The Forum]]''. The story takes place in Faulkner's fictional city Jefferson, Mississippi, in the southern county of [[Yoknapatawpha]]. It was Faulkner's first short story published in a national magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~egjbp/faulkner/r_ss_roseforemily.html|title=WFotW ~ \"A Rose for Emily\": COMMENTARY & RESOURCES|website=www.mcsr.olemiss.edu|access-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420052408/http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~egjbp/faulkner/r_ss_roseforemily.html|archive-date=2017-04-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Title==\n[[Faulkner]]&nbsp;described the title \"A Rose For Emily\" as an [[allegorical]]&nbsp;title: this woman had undergone a great tragedy, and for this Faulkner pitied her.

Roses have been portrayed in Greek legends as a gift of secrecy and of confidentiality, known as ''[[sub rosa]]'', introducing that the rose is a symbol of silence between the narrator and Miss Emily, the narrator keeps Emily's secrets until her death.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe story opens with a brief first-person account of the funeral of [[Emily Grierson]], an elderly Southern woman whose funeral is the obligation of their small town. It then proceeds in a [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear fashion]] to the narrator's recollections of Emily's archaic and increasingly strange behavior throughout the years. Emily is a member of a family of the [[antebellum South]]ern aristocracy. After the Civil War, the family falls into hard times. She and her father, the last two of the clan, continue to live as if in the past; Emily's father refuses for her to marry.  Her father dies when Emily is about the age of 30, which takes her by surprise. She refuses to give up his corpse, and the townspeople write it off as her grieving process. The townspeople pity Emily not only after her father's death but also during his life when he wouldn't let Emily marry. Emily depended heavily on her father, believing he would never leave her; he was all she had.\n\nAfter her father's death, the only person seen moving about Emily's home is Tobe, a black man serving as Emily's butler. He is frequently seen entering and exiting the house for groceries. Although Emily did not have a strong relationship with her community, she did give art lessons to young children within her town at the age of forty. A prime reason why she gave art lessons was her financial problem since she was running out of money. The townspeople make cruel comments and nasty looks behind Miss Emily's back, as she wasn't respected in her town. With the acceptance of her father's death, Emily somewhat revives, even changing the style of her hair, and becomes friendly with Homer Barron. He is a Northern laborer who comes to town shortly after Mr. Grierson's death. The connection surprises some of the community while others are glad she is taking an interest; however, \"Homer likes men and claims that he is not a marrying man.\" <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\" /> This draws attention to Homer's questionable sexuality in the story. Emily shortly buys arsenic from a druggist in town, presumably to kill rats, however, the townspeople are convinced that she will use it to poison herself. Emily's distant cousins are called into town by the minister's wife to supervise Miss Emily and Homer Barron. Homer leaves town for some time, reputedly to give Emily a chance to get rid of her cousins, and returns three days later after the cousins have left. After he is observed entering Miss Emily's home one evening, Homer is never seen alive again.\n\nDespite these turnabouts in her social status, Emily continues to behave mysteriously, as she had before her father died. Her reputation is such that the city council finds itself unable to confront her about a strong smell that has begun to emanate from the house. They believed Tobe was unable to maintain the house and something was rotting, unaware that a death has occurred.  Instead, the council decide to send men to her house under the cover of darkness to sprinkle lime around the house, after which the smell dissipates. The mayor of the town, [[Colonel (title)|Colonel]] Sartorius, makes a [[gentleman's agreement]] to overlook her taxes as an act of charity, though it is done under a pretense of repayment towards her father, to assuage Emily's pride after her father's death. Years later, when the next generation has come to power, Emily insists on this informal arrangement, flatly refusing that she owes any taxes, stating \"I have no taxes in Jefferson.\" After this, the council declines to press the issue due to her stubbornness. Emily has become a [[recluse]]: she is never seen outside of the house, and only rarely accepts people into it. The community eventually comes to view her as a \"hereditary obligation\" on the town, who must be humored and tolerated.\n\nThe funeral is a large affair: Emily had become an institution, so her death sparks a great deal of curiosity about her reclusive nature and what remains of her house. After she is buried, a group of townsfolk enters her house to see what remains of her life there. Tobe walked out of the house and was never seen again, giving the townspeople access to Miss Emily's home. The door to her upstairs bedroom is locked, and some of the townsfolk break down the door to see what has been hidden for so long. Inside, among the possessions that Emily had bought for Homer, lies the decomposed corpse of Homer Barron on the bed. On the pillow beside him is the indentation of a head and a single strand of gray hair, indicating that Emily had slept with Homer's corpse. The house is an indicator revealing how Emily struggled to keep everything the same, in a frozen time period, avoiding change.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n'''Emily Grierson''' - The main character of the story. Emily's father kept her from seeing suitors and controlled her social life, keeping her in isolation until his death, when she is 30 years old.<ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> Her struggle with loss and attachment is the impetus for the plot, driving her to kill Homer Barron, the man that is assumed to have married her.

This is evident in Emily's refusal to pay her taxes, her denial of her father's death, and the fact that she kills Homer to ensure that he will never leave her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> \n\n'''Homer Barron''' - Emily's romantic interest. He is later found dead and decomposed in Emily's bedroom after her funeral. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> He initially enters the story as a foreman for a road construction project occurring in the town.

The story takes place in the South shortly after the Civil War, and while Homer is not necessarily unwelcome to the town, he does stand out. This, along with the fact that he is seemingly courting Emily, sets him apart from all of the other characters in the story. It is because he is an outlier that Emily becomes attracted to him. It is generally unknown if Homer reciprocates the romantic feelings Emily has for him. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> It is stated in the story, that Homer likes men and is \"not the marrying kind\"  he has commitment issues. Furthermore this brings into light Homer's homosexuality.\n\n'''The Narrator''' - An unnamed member(s) of the town who watches the events of Emily's life unfold in its entirety. The story is presented to the reader in a non-chronological order; this suggests that the story may have been patched together by multiple tellers. Some parts of the story are repeated, such as Homer's disappearance, the idea that Emily and Homer will get married, and Emily's refusal to pay taxes, also indicating that the narrator is a voice for the town. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Getty|first=Laura|date=Summer 2005|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://mrsstaceybrown.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/4/4/12441735/rose_for_emily_literary_analysis.pdf|journal=The Explicator|volume=63|pages=230\u2013234}}</ref> Though the townspeople disapprove of most of Emily's actions, such as refusing to pay her taxes and purchasing poison, nobody intervenes.\n\n'''Colonel Sartoris''' - The former mayor who remitted Emily's taxes. While he is in the story very little, his decision to remit Emily's taxes leads to her refusal to pay them ever again, contributing to her stubborn personality. The reason for Sartoris remitting her taxes is never given, only that he told Emily it was because her father loaned the money to the town. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Mr. Grierson''' - Emily's father, the patriarchal head of the Grierson family. His control over Emily's personal life prohibited her from romantic involvement. The reason for his refusal to let Emily court men is not explained in the story.<ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> \nWhatever the reason, Mr. Grierson shapes the person that Emily becomes. His decision to ban all men from her life drives her to kill the first man she is attracted to and can be with, Homer Barron, in order to keep him with her permanently. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\n'''The cousins''' - Emily's extended relatives from Alabama. They come to town during Emily's courting of Homer Barron to check on Emily's well-being. They are thought of as even more uptight and stuffy than Emily by the townspeople. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> They are called in to prevent Emily and Homer from marrying; however, they are later sent back home so that the two can be wed. It is speculated that there may be some type of dispute between Emily and the cousins, indicated by them living far away from Emily and the fact that they did not attend Emily's father's funeral. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\n'''Tobe''' - Emily's cook/gardener, who is also acts as her secret keeper. Tobe is a loyal individual to Emily. During the years of Emily's isolation, he provides no details of her life to the townspeople and promptly disappears directly following her death. He became old and stooped from all of his work while Emily grew large and immobile. <ref name=\"A Rose for Emily\">{{cite web |last1=Faulkner |first1=William |title=A Rose for Emily |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/wf_rose.html |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref> This could suggest that he resented Emily, or at the very least disliked working for her, as he does not mourn her or stay for her funeral.\n\n== Structure ==\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}} \n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\n\nFaulkner tells this story in a series of flashbacks and stretches the story out over decades. It starts with the announcement of Emily's death, an event that has the entire town talking. This leads the reader to assume that she was an important figure in the town. As Fassler says in his article \u201cThe Key,\u201d \u201cClearly, this lady who died unmarried was of importance to everyone. And yet the town itself is eventually divided,\u201d<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/the-key-to-writing-a-mystery-is-asking-the-perfect-question/515799/</ref> and we see that division with the events depicted in between the announcement at the beginning and the revelation at the end are told out of order, making the reader analyze the story more closely than if it was told chronologically. Based on the townspeople's thoughts of Emily displayed in this section, the reader discovers that the town was not dreading Emily's death. On the other hand, it was somewhat welcomed. Emily stuck out from the rest of the town as a figure stuck in the past, desperately trying to cling to old traditions and ways of life. With her passing on, the town can finally be free of this remnant, being wholly set in the present. Had the story been told in a linear fashion, this understanding would have been lost, something Faulkner knew and incorporated into the story. By presenting the story in terms of present and past events, he could examine how they influence each other. In terms of mathematical precision, time moves on and what exists is only the present. In terms of the more subjective time, time moves on but memories can exist no matter how much time changes. Those memories stay unhindered. Through this Faulkner could analyze the depth at which Miss Emily could change as a character. If Faulkner presented the story in a linear fashion, the chances of the reader sympathizing with Emily would be far less. By telling the story out of order, the reader sees Emily as a tragic product of her environment rather than a twisted necrophiliac.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\n\n\"A Rose for Emily\" discusses many dark themes that characterized the Old South and [[Southern Gothic]] fiction. \n\nThe story explores themes of death and resistance to change. Also, it reflects the decaying of the societal tenets of the South in the 1930s. [[Emily Grierson]] had been oppressed by her father for most of her life and hadn't questioned it because that was her way of living. Likewise, the antiquated traditions of the south (often harmful, such as in the treatment of black people) had remained acceptable, as that was their way of living. Once her father had passed, Emily, in denial, refused to give his corpse up for burial\u2014this shows her inability to functionally adapt to change. When the present mayor and aldermen insist Miss Emily pay the taxes which she had been exempted from, she refuses and continues to live in her house. Miss Emily's stubborn insistence that she \"pays no taxes in Jefferson\" and her mistaking the new mayor for Colonel Sartoris brings into question whether her acts of resistance are a conscious act of defiance or a result of a decayed mental stability. The reader is only shown Emily from an external perspective, we can not ascertain whether she acts in a rational manner or not. The death of Homer, if interpreted as having been a murder, can be seen in the context of the North-South clash. Homer, notably a northerner, is not one for the tradition of marriage. In the framework that his death was not an accident, but a murder on the part of Emily, Homer's rejection of the marriage can be seen as the North's rejection of Southern tradition. The South ends its relations with the North in retaliation. Emily continuing to sleep next to Homer's body can be seen as the south holding on to an ideal that is no longer feasible. \n\nControl and its repercussions is a persistent theme throughout the story. Emily's father was an intimidating and manipulative figure, keeping her from experiencing life in her own terms. She was never able to grow, learn, live her life, start a family, and marry the one she truly loved. Even after Emily's father died, his presence and impact on his daughter were still apparent. Discussing Emily and her father, the townspeople said \"We had long thought of them as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Literature An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, Drama, and Writing|date=2016|page=32|last1=Kennedy|first1=X.J.}}</ref> Emily is portrayed as small and powerless, placed behind the overbearing frame of her father. She wears white, a symbol of innocence and purity. Emily falls victim to the ruling hand of her father and to her place in the society: she has to uphold the [[noblesse oblige]] to which she was born into. In this way, her father's influence remains after he has passed. This control leads to Emily's isolation, both externally and internally imposed. Emily is alone, yet always being watched by the townspeople; she is both apart from and a part of the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/rose-emily/themes|title=A Rose for Emily Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref> Her position prevents her from ever finding happiness.\n\nThe power of death is a consistent theme throughout the story. Emily herself is portrayed as a \"skeleton\" that is both \"small and spare\" which is representative of the fact that she emanates death. When it comes to death itself, Emily is in denial and most of that feeling has to do with her loneliness. After her father dies, she keeps his corpse for three days and refuses to admit that he is dead. The reader also sees this with the corpse of Homer Barron, except she is the one who inflicts death upon him. She poisons him and keeps him locked away in her room; she did not want to lose the only other person she had ever loved, so she made his stay permanent. These examples show that the power of death triumphs over everything, including \"poor Emily\", herself.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Ji-won|title=Narrator as Collective 'We':The Narrative Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\"|journal=English Language and Literature Teaching|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nDue to this inevitability in the portrayal of death, A Rose for Emily is seen as a tale based on determinism, making the short story part of the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism literary movement]]. Here, a character's fate is already determined no matter how much the individual struggles to change it. There are impersonal forces of nature that prevent him or her from taking control. As the very universe itself appear indifferent, this character descends into an inevitable death and decay. The case of Emily is the same. She had a mental illness, an unavoidable fate, which her father must have sought to finally end by refusing to let Emily marry, which would have continued his line. No matter what she did, there was the implication that she would ultimately go mad. There was also the depiction of a cursed land due to slavery and the class structure based upon it and that no matter how the people clung to the glorious past and soldier on, there was a tarnished way of life that leads to an impending ruin. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Strategies and Genre Conventions in Literary Studies: Teaching and Writing in the Disciplines|last=Wilder|first=Laura|publisher=SIU Press|year=2012|isbn=9780809330942|location=|pages=146}}</ref>\n\n== Critical response ==\n\n{{Original research|table|date=September 2019}}\nFloyd C. Watkins wrote about the structure of \"A Rose for Emily\" in \"[[Modern Language Notes]]\". Watkins claims that this is Faulkner's best story and that he is among the best American writers of this time period. Faulkner had to carefully dissect his sections, bringing importance to every aspect of Miss Emily's life, but Watkins sees this as a \"structural problem\" but later goes on to rave about the symmetry of this short story. Watkins enjoys this story in its entirety, and is impressed by Faulkner's ordering, as building suspense was an important aspect in the response.<ref>Watkins, Floyd C. \"Structure of \"A Rose for Emily\".\" Modern Language Notes 7th ser. 69 (1954): 508-10. JSTOR. Web. 5 Apr. 2017.</ref>\n\nThis critical response by John Skinner explores the interpretations of Faulkner's short story in detail while reviewing the importance of over-analyzing a piece of literary work. William Faulkner published this story in the 1930s, Skinner had published his critical response in 1985. More than 40 years have passed and people are still ignoring his claim; \u201cA Rose for Emily\u201d should not be interpreted any further. The characters and theme of this tale have been scrutinized by many. There have been numerous interpretations of what Miss Emily stands for; Skinner gives examples of scholars including S.W. M. Johnson \u201cEmily represented a refusal to submit to, or even concede, to the inevitability of change\u201d. Whereas, William Going pictures Emily as a rose, \u201cthe treasured memory of the Confederate veterans\u201d. The point of view according to Skinner is of immediate relevance to the story as the chief character, the narrator tells the chronology of the story. This narrator gives approximately \u201cround figures\u201d for the important events of the accounts. Yet the exact chronology is of little relevance to the overall importance of the story itself. John Skinner states that Faulkner should be taken literally, appreciate his formal subtlety in his works.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skinner|first=John|date=Winter 1985|title=\"A Rose for Emily\": Against Interpretation.\"|url=|journal=The Journal of Narrative Technique|volume=15.1|pages=42\u201351}}</ref>\n\nAlice Petry introduces a different type of critical response that is not focused on the usual subjects. Rather, she focuses on the complex and provocative language. For example, Hall discusses how the sentence, \"Thus she passed from generation to generation-dear, inescapable, impervious, tranquil and perverse\" has been considered misleading, but is in fact strategically placed to provide foreshadowing and unification of plot. The five descriptive words used in the sentence each correspond to one of the five parts in the order they are seen. For example, the adjective \"inescapable\" corresponds to Part II, to the incident of the strange smell coming from Miss Emily's home. Faulkner's placement of these adjectives at the end of Part IV serves as an important unifying sentence that connects all five parts to each other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petry|first=Alice|date=Spring 1986|title=Faulkner's A ROSE FOR EMILY|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=509417186&S=R&D=brb&EbscoContent=dGJyMNXb4kSeqLQ4v%2BbwOLCmr0%2BeprZSsam4SrKWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvsku1p69MuePfgeyx43zx|journal=Explicator|volume=44|pages=52\u201354}}</ref>\n\nJim Barloon of the University of St. Thomas wrote about an idea introduced to him by his students, that Homer was homosexual, possibly providing another reason for his murder. He proposes that Emily did not kill Homer because of her own insecurities, but also because he did not reciprocate her romantic feelings. Thus, she could have murdered him out of affection as well as spite. Whether or not this theory is correct, it proves that the story is still being closely analyzed decades after it was written. As Barloon states in his article, \u201cPositing that Homer Barron is gay not only raises a new set of questions but transforms [the story], or at least our perspective of it.\u201d<ref>http://www.semo.edu/cfs/teaching/10186.html</ref>\n\nThe psychology of Emily Grierson has been analyzed countless times, with many people reaching the conclusion that she was mentally ill, and from that point, the reasons why. Though many different diagnoses have been made, the most common can be summarized as follows by Nicole Smith in her psychological analysis of the character: \u201cIt is reasonable to propose that Miss Emily developed [schizophrenia] as a response to the demanding conditions in which she was living as a Southern woman from an aristocratic family.\u201d<ref>http://www.articlemyriad.com/psychological-character-analysis-rose-emily/{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> This has been thought to represent just how unbearable life in the old South could be, not only for a person similar to Emily but to the people around them as well. A contributing factor to this point would change. The story is an allegory for the change that the South dealt with after the Civil War, with Emily representing the resistance of that change. This is shown in the story through Emily's conflicts with the town and her refusal of cooperation. Tuncay Tezcan in his analysis of the story states, \u201cIt represents the numerous conflicts in the main character's life, illustrating the effect of social change on the individual.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.101 |title=A Stylistic Analysis of a Rose for Emily by William Faulkner and its Turkish Translation |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |volume=158 |pages=364\u20139 |year=2014 |last1=Tezcan |first1=Tuncay }}</ref>\n\nThere has been much discussion over the title of the story. Why have a rose for Emily? At that time, giving a rose to a woman was common if they had been through a great tragedy. Emily's tragedy is her environment, changing quickly and with volatility, causing her to cling to the past in hopes of stopping the change from occurring. This has a deep impact on her mental state, driving her to extreme acts such as murdering Homer and then sleeping with his corpse for years. The town does nothing to stop these events, merely entertain the idea. Terry Heller writes in his analysis of the story that the town, \u201c[chose] to deal with an idea of Emily, rather than with Emily herself; they are different in that they have different ideas of her and, therefore, approach her\u2026 differently.\u201d<ref>http://www.public.coe.edu/~theller/essays/rose.html{{full|date=September 2018}}</ref> With nobody willing to help her, Emily died a broken person, and for that Faulkner gave her a rose, in sympathy of her ending.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n* ''A Rose for Emily''\u2014[[PBS]] adaptation with [[Anjelica Huston]].\n* [[My Chemical Romance]]'s song \"To The End\" from [[Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge]] (2005) loosely retells the story of Homer and Miss Emily.\n* [[The Zombies]]' song \"A Rose for Emily\" retells the story, and is about a strong theme present in the story: Miss Emily living and dying alone, unloved.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Petridis|first1=Alexis|title=The story behind A Rose for Emily \u2013 and why it's perfect for S-Town|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2017/apr/17/rose-for-emily-s-town-zombies-podcast-john-b-mclemore|work=The Guardian|date=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Andrea Camilleri]] has a similar theme in his novel ''[[The Scent of the Night]]'' influencing his character Detective Salvo Montalbano.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Morton, Clay (2005). \"'A Rose for Emily': Oral Plot, Typographic Story\", ''Storytelling: A Critical Journal of Popular Narrative'' 5.1.\n\n{{Faulkner}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rose For Emily, A}}\n[[Category:1930 short stories]]\n[[Category:Short stories by William Faulkner]]\n[[Category:Horror short stories]]\n[[Category:Necrophilia in fiction]]\n[[Category:Short stories adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Nonlinear narrative literature]]\n", "name_user": "Jnewts99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added an in-text citation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rose_for_Emily"}

In the first general election of 1701 he considered standing again but declined to face a contest.

Marlborough returned him  for Woodstock  at the [[1708 British general election]]. He voted for the naturalization of the Palatine refugees  in 1709, and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710 but was otherwise inactive.

On 18 June 1713 he voted against the French commerce bill.  Marlborough was in temporary exile from November 1712, and Wheate was virtually the custodian  of the Duke's electoral interests at Woodstock. He supervised the  repaving the town, which Marlborough had undertaken in preparation for the  [[1713 British general election]] when Wheate was returned again for Woodstock.

In 1668, at a year old, he succeeded his father, inheriting Glympton Park.

He was returned unopposed as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodstock]] at the [[1690 English general election]] and three weeks later also stood unsuccessfully for Oxfordshire, where he had a bitter contest with his uncle Sir Robert Jenkinson, the 2nd baronet. He was recognized as a Whig, and Court supporter. In the face of a big electoral challenge at Woodstock, he decided not to stand at the [[1695 English general election]].<ref name=HOP/> He was  created a [[Wheate baronets|baronet]] on 2 May 1696 and served as [[High Sheriff of Oxfordshire]] for the year 1696 to 1697.<ref name=Cokayne4/> His further attempts to enter parliament as a Whig, in a Tory dominated county, over the next few years met with failure. At the [[1698 English general election]] his backing by Thomas Wharton was insufficient to win Oxfordshire, where he failed again in a by-election in  November 1699. In the first general election of 1701 he considered standing again but declined to face a contest. In November 1701 he was put up for Oxford by the city\u2019s Whigs, but received a very low number of votes, and at the [[1702 English general election]] he was beaten into fourth place in the poll.<ref name=HOP>{{cite web | url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/wheate-thomas-1667-1721| title= WHEATE, Thomas (1667-1721), of Glympton Park, Oxon.|publisher= History of Parliament Online (1690-1715)|accessdate = 22 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen Queen Anne granted the manor of Woodstock to the Duke of Marlborough  in 1705, this was a particular piece of good fortune for Wheate. Stone from his quarries at Glympton was used in large quantities to build [[Blenheim Palace]], and with the Duke's Whig views, Wheate became a close political associate and one of the leading Whigs in the county. Marlborough returned him  for Woodstock  at the [[1708 British general election]]. He voted for the naturalization of the Palatine refugees  in 1709, and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710 but was otherwise inactive. He was returned again at the [[1710 British general election]] and on 7 December 1711,  voted for the \u2018No Peace without Spain\u2019 motion.  On 18 June 1713 he voted against the French commerce bill.  Marlborough was in temporary exile from November 1712, and Wheate was virtually the custodian  of the Duke\u2019s electoral interests at Woodstock. He supervised the  repaving the town, which Marlborough had undertaken in preparation for the  [[1713 British general election]] when Wheate was returned again for Woodstock. The election was declared void on 15 March 1714 but he was re-elected a week later.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nWheate was returned for Woodstock again at the [[1715 British general election]] and voted with the Administration in every recorded division. He was appointed [[Storekeeper of the Ordnance]] in 1717 and held the post for the rest of his life.

His wife Isabella says he took the list to Mexico City May 2006 to get confirmation of his discoveries from the federal organized crime unit. Six months later Garc\u00eda was missing. When the family lawyer, Sylvia Martinez, later demanded access to his list, the government claimed it had no record of Garc\u00eda's visit.\n\nAfter her husband's disappearance, Rosa Isela Caballero took over the Ecos de la Cuenca. She says she publishes an issue as often as possible, but keeps controversial topics to a minimum.

Ivan was the youngest son of [[Alexis I of Russia]] by his first wife, [[Maria Miloslavskaya]], while Peter was the only son of Alexis by his second wife, [[Natalya Naryshkina]]. Ivan's reign was solely titular because he had serious physical and mental disabilities.\n\n==Early life and accession==\nIvan V was born in 1666 in [[Moscow]], the youngest son of [[Alexis of Russia|Tsar Alexis]] and [[Maria Miloslavskaya]]. Only two of his older brothers survived childhood; his eldest brother, [[Tsarevich Alexei Alexeyevich of Russia|Alexei]], died aged 15 in 1670, therefore his second brother, [[Feodor III of Russia|Feodor III]], became tsar upon the death of their father. When Feodor III died in 1682, at age 20, without leaving an heir, Ivan, who was thought to be \"infirm in body and mind\",{{sfn|Kelly|1854|p=226}} was passed over in favor of his younger half-brother, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]].{{sfn|Thackeray|Findling|2012|p=19}}\n\nThe church and the Naryshkins (family of Peter I's mother, [[Natalya Naryshkina]]) supported Peter's ascension to the throne, however, the family of Ivan V's mother (the Miloslavski) and Ivan's older sister, [[Sofia Alekseyevna of Russia|Sofia Alekseyevna]], in particular, disputed the move. Rumors spread around Moscow that Feodor III had been poisoned and Ivan strangled by [[boyars]] so that the 10-year-old Peter could become Tsar. These rumours fomented the [[Moscow Uprising of 1682]], and the ''[[streltsy]]'' stormed the [[Kremlin]]. These disturbances subsided only after Ivan appeared in person in the city, and proved to everyone that he was alive and well.{{sfn|Thackeray|Findling|2012|p=19}}\n\nThe ''streltsy'' demanded that Ivan be named tsar, and a compromise was found by declaring Ivan and Peter as co-rulers, with a [[regency]] government until the boys came of age. Sofia Alekseyevna, who had been influential at court during her brother Feodor III's reign, was named regent.{{sfn|Kelly|1854|p=227}}\n\n==Tsar and co-ruler==\nOn 25 June 1682, less than two months after the death of Feodor III, Ivan and Peter were crowned in the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] as ''dvoetsarstvenniki'' (double tsars). A [[Regalia of the Russian tsars#Tsars' regalia 1660s-1680s|special throne]] with two seats was commissioned for the occasion (now on display in the [[Kremlin Armoury]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Ivan V Alexeevich|url=http://www.kreml.ru/en-Us/exhibitions/virtual-exhibitions.regalii-russkikh-tsarey/ivan-v-alekseevich/|website=www.kreml.ru|accessdate=2017-11-03|language=en-Us}}</ref>). While Ivan was 16 years old at this time, his co-ruler [[Peter the great|Peter I]] was only 10. Ivan was considered the \"senior tsar\", but actual power was wielded by [[Sophia Alekseyevna]], Ivan's sister and Peter's half-sister, for the next seven years.\n\nSophia was always considerate of Ivan, although she is never known to have consulted him on any important matter. She was anxious that every outward sign of respect and deference be paid to Ivan, which was a subtle way of undermining the influence of Peter's faction in court. Thus, every wish or opinion expressed by Ivan was deferred to, and his general prestige in court remained intact during the years of Sophia's regency. As [[Peter the Great]] grew up, he and his faction, led by his mother's Naryshkin family, contended with Regent Sophia for influence and power. Indeed, Sophia is blamed for the murders of Peter's uncles on his mother's side of the family. Due to this and other situations, tension arose between the factions of the co-tsars.\n\nIn 1689, Peter was 17, and intent upon declaring his majority and demanding power. To pre-empt this, Sophia attempted to raise a riot in the city, spreading the rumour that the Naryshkins had destroyed Ivan's crown and were poised to set his room on fire. This was untrue, and when riots began, Ivan's tutor, Prince [[Prozorovsky]], persuaded him to publicly declare his faith in his brother Peter and make it known that he was unharmed and in no danger for life or liberty. Ivan did this, and also supported Peter's contention that the time had come for terminating the regency. Peter was declared to be of age and Sophia's regency was terminated. Ivan being both incapable and disinterested, Peter came into his own and functioned as though he were the sole tsar. The eventual result was that, over time, the outward signs of deference and power which Ivan had enjoyed during the regency slowly withered away and he became a non-entity in the Russian court. For the last decade of his life, Ivan was completely overshadowed by the more energetic Peter I. He spent his days with his wife, [[Praskovia Saltykova]], caring about little but \"fasting and praying day and night\".\n\n==Marriage and issue==\n[[File:Praskovia Saltykova by I.Nikitin (18th c., Sergiev Posad).jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Praskovia Saltykova]], Portrait by [[Ivan Nikitin (painter)|Ivan Nikitin]].]]\nIn late 1683 or early 1684, Ivan married [[Praskovia Saltykova]], daughter of Fyodor Petrovich Saltykov, a minor nobleman, by his wife, whose name is uncertain - it was either Yekaterina Fyodorovna or Anna Mikhailovna Tatishcheva. Ivan's marriage was arranged in the traditional style of Russian rulers: he selected a bride from a [[bride-show|parade of potential candidates]]. Praskovia Saltykova, who came from a rather obscure family, had been raised in a middle-class household and adhered to conventional values and moral standards. She bonded strongly with her gentle and simple husband, and proved to be an exemplary wife to a mentally-challenged man. She became the mainstay of his life and earned the lifelong respect of her powerful brother-in-law, Peter the Great, who entrusted the care and education of his own two daughters to her. Ivan's purported debility did not prevent him from producing robust offspring, and Praskovia bore him five daughters, three of whom lived to adulthood. Their children were:\n\n* Maria Ivanovna (1689\u20131692)\n* Feodosia Ivanovna (1690\u20131691)\n* [[Catherine Ivanovna|Ekaterina Ivanovna]] (1691\u20131733)\n* [[Anna of Russia|Anna Ivanovna]] (1693\u20131740)\n* [[Praskovia Ivanovna]] (1694\u20131731)\n\n==Death and succession==\nAt the age of 27, Ivan was described by foreign ambassadors as [[senile]], [[paralytic]] and almost [[Blindness|blind]]. He died two years later, on 8 February 1696, and was interred in the [[Archangel Cathedral]]. It was fortuitous to Peter's faction that Ivan produced several daughters but no sons, as there was no confusion regarding the succession of the crown upon his death. His co-ruler was left to become supreme ruler of Russia. The struggle for power within the family had finally ended.<ref>Thompson, John.

Ivan was the youngest son of [[Alexis I of Russia]] by his first wife, [[Maria Miloslavskaya]], while Peter was the only son of Alexis by his second wife, [[Natalya Naryshkina]]. Ivan's reign was solely titular because he had serious physical and mental disabilities.\n\n==Early life and accession==\nIvan V was born in 1666 in [[Moscow]], the youngest son of [[Alexis of Russia|Tsar Alexis]] and [[Maria Miloslavskaya]]. Only two of his older brothers survived childhood; his eldest brother, [[Tsarevich Alexei Alexeyevich of Russia|Alexei]], died aged 15 in 1670, therefore his second brother, [[Feodor III of Russia|Feodor III]], became tsar upon the death of their father. When Feodor III died in 1682, at age 20, without leaving an heir, Ivan, who was thought to be \"infirm in body and mind\",{{sfn|Kelly|1854|p=226}} was passed over in favor of his younger half-brother, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]].{{sfn|Thackeray|Findling|2012|p=19}}\n\nThe church and the Naryshkins (family of Peter I's mother, [[Natalya Naryshkina]]) supported Peter's ascension to the throne, however, the family of Ivan V's mother (the Miloslavski) and Ivan's older sister, [[Sofia Alekseyevna of Russia|Sofia Alekseyevna]], in particular, disputed the move. Rumors spread around Moscow that Feodor III had been poisoned and Ivan strangled by [[boyars]] so that the 10-year-old Peter could become Tsar. These rumours fomented the [[Moscow Uprising of 1682]], and the ''[[streltsy]]'' stormed the [[Kremlin]]. These disturbances subsided only after Ivan appeared in person in the city, and proved to everyone that he was alive and well.{{sfn|Thackeray|Findling|2012|p=19}}\n\nThe ''streltsy'' demanded that Ivan be named tsar, and a compromise was found by declaring Ivan and Peter as co-rulers, with a [[regency]] government until the boys came of age. Sofia Alekseyevna, who had been influential at court during her brother Feodor III's reign, was named regent.{{sfn|Kelly|1854|p=227}}\n\n==Tsar and co-ruler==\nOn 25 June 1682, less than two months after the death of Feodor III, Ivan and Peter were crowned in the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] as ''dvoetsarstvenniki'' (double tsars). A [[Regalia of the Russian tsars#Tsars' regalia 1660s-1680s|special throne]] with two seats was commissioned for the occasion (now on display in the [[Kremlin Armoury]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Ivan V Alexeevich|url=http://www.kreml.ru/en-Us/exhibitions/virtual-exhibitions.regalii-russkikh-tsarey/ivan-v-alekseevich/|website=www.kreml.ru|accessdate=2017-11-03|language=en-Us}}</ref>). While Ivan was 16 years old at this time, his co-ruler [[Peter the great|Peter I]] was only 10. Ivan was considered the \"senior tsar\", but actual power was wielded by [[Sophia Alekseyevna]], Ivan's sister and Peter's half-sister, for the next seven years.\n\nSophia was always considerate of Ivan, although she is never known to have consulted him on any important matter. She was anxious that every outward sign of respect and deference be paid to Ivan, which was a subtle way of undermining the influence of Peter's faction in court. Thus, every wish or opinion expressed by Ivan was deferred to, and his general prestige in court remained intact during the years of Sophia's regency. As [[Peter the Great]] grew up, he and his faction, led by his mother's Naryshkin family, contended with Regent Sophia for influence and power. Indeed, Sophia is blamed for the murders of Peter's uncles on his mother's side of the family. Due to this and other situations, tension arose between the factions of the co-tsars.\n\nIn 1689, Peter was 17, and intent upon declaring his majority and demanding power. To pre-empt this, Sophia attempted to raise a riot in the city, spreading the rumour that the Naryshkins had destroyed Ivan's crown and were poised to set his room on fire. This was untrue, and when riots began, Ivan's tutor, Prince [[Prozorovsky]], persuaded him to publicly declare his faith in his brother Peter and make it known that he was unharmed and in no danger for life or liberty. Ivan did this, and also supported Peter's contention that the time had come for terminating the regency. Peter was declared to be of age and Sophia's regency was terminated.

During this time, whenever the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] won provincially, the entire eastern half of the island was coated light blue. Federally, it was the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'s power base from 1993 to 2011, partly due to its [[left-wing politics|leftist]] bent. With the exception of ethnic areas that protrude from Northern Montreal into the East Island's Honor\u00e9-Mercier riding, where [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] support is strong, the area is relatively homogeneously Francophone and lower-income, a recipe for Bloc dominance. Prior to the rise of the Bloc, the region voted solidly Liberal for decades before being swept up in the [[Brian Mulroney]] tide, electing Quebec nationalists under the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] banner.  The [[Conservative Party of Canada]] has never approached this level of support, and eastern Montreal is currently the weakest region in Canada for the Tories. In 2011, the federalist [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] swept every seat in this region amid the surge of popular support in the province and the concurrent Bloc meltdown, in all but one case by well over 6,000 votes.  The NDP surge even cost longtime Bloc leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] his seat in [[Laurier-Sainte-Marie]].\n\nThe NDP largely held its gains in 2015, losing Honor\u00e9-Mercier to the Liberals and [[La Pointe-de-l'\u00cele]]\u2014long reckoned as the most strongly sovereigntist riding in Quebec\u2014to the Bloc.  However, Duceppe came up well short in his bid to retake his old riding. In 2019, however, the NDP was cut down to just one riding in eastern Montreal, with the Bloc holding onto La Pointe-de-l'\u00cele and the Liberals taking the other three.\n\n{|

end of the [[Island of Montreal]] was the birthplace of the sovereigntist movement, and remained a sovereigntist stronghold for four decades. During this time, whenever the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] won provincially, the entire eastern half of the island was coated light blue. Federally, it was the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'s power base from 1993 to 2011, partly due to its [[left-wing politics|leftist]] bent. With the exception of ethnic areas that protrude from Northern Montreal into the East Island's Honor\u00e9-Mercier riding, where [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] support is strong, the area is relatively homogeneously Francophone and lower-income, a recipe for Bloc dominance. Prior to the rise of the Bloc, the region voted solidly Liberal for decades before being swept up in the [[Brian Mulroney]] tide, electing Quebec nationalists under the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] banner.  The [[Conservative Party of Canada]] has never approached this level of support, and eastern Montreal is currently the weakest region in Canada for the Tories. In 2011, the federalist [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] swept every seat in this region amid the surge of popular support in the province and the concurrent Bloc meltdown, in all but one case by well over 6,000 votes.  The NDP surge even cost longtime Bloc leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] his seat in [[Laurier-Sainte-Marie]].\n\nThe NDP largely held its gains in 2015, losing Honor\u00e9-Mercier to the Liberals and [[La Pointe-de-l'\u00cele]]\u2014long reckoned as the most strongly sovereigntist riding in Quebec\u2014to the Bloc.  However, Duceppe came up well short in his bid to retake his old riding. In 2019, however, the NDP was cut down to just one riding in eastern Montreal, with the Bloc holding onto La Pointe-de-l'\u00cele and the Liberals taking the other three.\n\n{|

It was designed by [[James Wyatt]] and opened in 1772. The main [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] was one of the largest rooms built in England up to that time and had a central [[dome]] somewhat reminiscent of the celebrated [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome. It was built as a set of winter [[assembly rooms]] and later briefly converted into a theatre. Before being demolished in 1937, it was a bazaar and a wine merchant's show room for over a hundred years. [[Marks and Spencer]]'s \"Oxford Street Pantheon\" branch, at 173 Oxford Street now occupies the site.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Pantheon Oxford Street edited.jpg|thumb|The Oxford Street facade.]]\nThe Pantheon was promoted by Philip Elias Turst, of whose life very little else is known. In 1769 he inherited a plot of land which had a frontage of {{convert|54|ft|m}} on Oxford Street and contained two houses, behind which there was a large piece of ground enclosed by the gardens of houses in [[Great Marlborough Street]], Poland Street and Oxford Street. He had some connections with fashionable society, including a lady of means named Margaretta Maria Ellice, who was involved in the management of a fashionable set of assembly rooms in [[Soho Square]]. Miss Ellice was briefly Turst's main financial backer, and took soundings to ensure that a new place of public entertainment on an ambitious scale for the winter [[social season|season]] similar to [[Ranelagh Gardens]] for the summer, would be \"likely to meet with the Approbation of the Nobility in General\". This assurance being forthcoming the scheme went ahead.\n\nAfter falling out with Miss Ellice, who had initially agreed to buy thirty of the fifty shares in the business for \u00a310,000, but soon withdrew, Turst issued fifty shares at \u00a3500 each and found buyers for all of them except one, which he kept for himself. This provided a budget of \u00a325,000 and work began in mid-1769.\n\n[[File:Pantheon Cross section edited.jpg|thumb|300px|A cross section of the rotunda, showing the dome and the colonnades.]]\nTurst soon found himself in legal conflict, not only with Miss Ellice, but also with some of his new investors, as the budget was exceeded, but in January 1772 the Pantheon was completed. The architect chosen for the job was [[James Wyatt]]. He was to become one of the most prominent British architects of his generation, but at that time he was unknown and aged just twenty-two or twenty-three. He appears to have had some sort of indirect connection with Turst, perhaps through his older brother [[Samuel Wyatt|Samuel]], who was to be the main contractor for the project.\n\nThe artists and craftsmen involved included the plasterer [[Joseph Rose (plasterer)|Joseph Rose]], the sculptor [[Joseph Nollekens]], who was paid \u00a3160 for four statues of Britannia, Liberty, the King and the Queen, and [[John Stretzle]], who built the organ for \u00a3300.\n\nIn August 1769, Turst purchased a [[leasehold]] house on the west side of Poland Street which backed on to the site of the Pantheon and built a secondary entrance there. This unbudgeted cost added more fuel to the legal fire. In 1771 one of the shareholders filed a bill of complaint against Turst in the [[Court of Chancery]], complaining of dishonest treatment. In 1773 and again in 1782 Turst in his turn filed complaints against several other shareholders. The outcome of these suits is not known.\n\n==The building==\n[[File:Pantheon ground floor plan.jpg|thumb|Plan.]]\n[[File:Pantheon painting, probably by William Hodges with figures by Zoffany edited.jpg|thumb|A painting of the interior in its original form.]]\n\nThe main part of the site consisted of two rectangles of land. The smaller of these was towards Oxford Street. There, the main doorway, sheltered by a [[portico]], and the two side doorways opened to a vestibule, {{convert|50|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|15|ft|m}} deep, which was divided by screen colonnades into three compartments. A central set of doors opened into the first of two card rooms, and two further pairs of doors opened onto corridors or galleries, giving access to the grand staircase and the great assembly room or rotunda. The total depth of the site was {{convert|204|ft|m}} and the maximum width was {{convert|96|ft|3|in|m}}.\n\nThere is general agreement that the scheme of the great room, or rotunda, was derived from [[Santa Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650140/James-Wyatt#ref12451 |title=James Wyatt (British architect) \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref> The central space was contained in a square of {{convert|60|ft|m}} topped by a [[coffer]]ed [[dome]].

[[Horace Walpole]] compared Wyatt's work favourably with that of better established and very fashionable [[Robert Adam]], \"the Pantheon is still the most beautiful edifice in England\" he said. [[Dr. Burney]], writing long after the destruction of the original building by fire (an event which inflicted on him a heavy financial loss), when the first wave of enthusiasm had long been dissipated, stated that the Pantheon \"was built by Mr. James Wyatt, and regarded both by natives and foreigners, as the most elegant structure in Europe, if not on the globe\u2026 . No person of taste in architecture or music, who remembers the Pantheon, its exhibitions, its numerous, splendid, and elegant assemblies, can hear it mentioned without a sigh!\"\n\nContemporary reports of the cost of the building were greatly exaggerated. Writing to Sir [[Horace Mann]] in May 1770 Horace Walpole asked \"What do you think of a winter Ranelagh erecting in Oxford Road, at the expense of sixty thousand pounds?\". The courts later determined that the actual cost was \u00a336,965 19s. 5\u00bdd: \u00a327,407 2s. 11\u00bdd for the main construction work, \u00a32,500 for the entrance from Poland Street and \u00a37,058 16s. 6d for furniture, paintings, statues, the organ, and Wyatt's five per cent commission as architect.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Patheon Lunardi's Balloon.jpg|thumb|[[Vincenzo Lunardi]]'s balloon exhibited at the Pantheon.]]\n\nThe Pantheon opened on Monday, 27 January 1772. Up to fifty pounds was paid for tickets for the first night which attracted over seventeen hundred members of high society including all the foreign ambassadors and eight dukes and duchesses. Initially the social tone was very high (though a policy that patrons should only be admitted on the recommendation of a peeress was soon dropped), and good profits were made. During the first winter there were assemblies only, without dancing or music, three times a week. In subsequent seasons the entertainments included a mixture of assemblies, masquerades (masked balls) and subscription concerts. For a while the shares commanded high prices and James Wyatt claimed to have sold his two shares for \u00a3900 each.\n\nIn the 1780s the popularity of the Pantheon declined; however, one of the commemoration concerts celebrating the music of the German composer, Handel, was held in the Pantheon in 1784. After the destruction of the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] in [[The Haymarket]] by fire in 1789, it was converted into an opera house on a twelve-year lease at \u00a33,000 per annum. James Wyatt was once again the architect. After only one complete season of opera the Pantheon was burnt to the ground in 1792.\n\nBy 1795 the structure had been rebuilt in a similar but not identical form and it was leased as a place of assembly by one Crispus Claggett, who intended to provide masquerades and concerts. The principal room of this reincarnation was not a rotunda but consisted of \"an Area or Pit, \u2026 and a double tier of elegant and spacious Boxes, in the centre of which is a most splendid one for the Royal Family\". The Pantheon reopened with a masquerade on 9 April 1795. The revived assembly rooms were a failure, and in 1796 or 1797 Claggett disappeared and was never heard of again.\n[[File:Pantheon Masquerade edited.jpg|thumb|A masquerade in the rebuilt and modified Pantheon, circa 1808.]]\nFrom 1798 to 1810 the shareholders reverted to the original custom of managing the Pantheon themselves but the popularity of the entertainments continued to decline. In 1811\u201312 [[Nicholas Wilcox Cundy]] converted the building into a theatre, but restrictions imposed by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] (then the regulator and censor of theatres) ruined this venture and the career of the Pantheon as a place of public entertainment came to a close in 1814.\n\nIn 1833\u201334, the Pantheon was rebuilt as a [[bazaar]] by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]]. The whole of the roof and part of the walls of the old building were taken down, but the entrance fronts to both Oxford Street and Poland Street were retained, as were also the rooms immediately behind the former. The main space of the new building was a great hall of [[basilica]]n plan, with a [[barrel-vault]]ed [[nave]] of five wide bays. In 1867, the building was acquired by [[Walter Gilbey|W. and A. Gilbey]], [[wine merchant]]s, and was used by them as offices and show rooms until 1937.\n\nIt was demolished shortly afterwards to make way for a branch of [[Marks and Spencer]], opened in 1938, which is still there. This was designed by [[Robert Lutyens]] (son of Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]). It has a gleaming art deco polished black granite facade and has become a distinctive landmark on Oxford Street. Its special historic and architectural interest was recognised on 21 September 2009 when the Minister of Culture, Barbara Follett, awarded the building Grade II listed status.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41477 Survey of London] \u2014 detailed architectural history\n\n{{coord|51.5155|-0.1381|type:landmark_region:GB-WSM|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Assembly rooms]]\n[[Category:Dance venues in England]]\n[[Category:Demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n[[Category:Former buildings and structures in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:Entertainment in London]]\n[[Category:Rotundas in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Domes]]\n[[Category:1772 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1937 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1772]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1937]]\n[[Category:James Wyatt buildings]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in London]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in London]]\n[[Category:Oxford Street]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Pantheon (disambiguation)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:Pantheon from Papworth's Select Views 1816.jpg|thumb|The Pantheon in Oxford Street, London.]]\n\n'''The Pantheon''' was a place of public entertainment on the south side of [[Oxford Street]], London, England.

[[Horace Walpole]] compared Wyatt's work favourably with that of better established and very fashionable [[Robert Adam]], \"the Pantheon is still the most beautiful edifice in England\" he said. [[Dr. Burney]], writing long after the destruction of the original building by fire (an event which inflicted on him a heavy financial loss), when the first wave of enthusiasm had long been dissipated, stated that the Pantheon \"was built by Mr. James Wyatt, and regarded both by natives and foreigners, as the most elegant structure in Europe, if not on the globe\u2026 . No person of taste in architecture or music, who remembers the Pantheon, its exhibitions, its numerous, splendid, and elegant assemblies, can hear it mentioned without a sigh!\"\n\nContemporary reports of the cost of the building were greatly exaggerated. Writing to Sir [[Horace Mann]] in May 1770 Horace Walpole asked \"What do you think of a winter Ranelagh erecting in Oxford Road, at the expense of sixty thousand pounds?\". The courts later determined that the actual cost was \u00a336,965 19s. 5\u00bdd: \u00a327,407 2s. 11\u00bdd for the main construction work, \u00a32,500 for the entrance from Poland Street and \u00a37,058 16s. 6d for furniture, paintings, statues, the organ, and Wyatt's five per cent commission as architect.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Patheon Lunardi's Balloon.jpg|thumb|[[Vincenzo Lunardi]]'s balloon exhibited at the Pantheon.]]\n\nThe Pantheon opened on Monday, 27 January 1772. Up to fifty pounds was paid for tickets for the first night which attracted over seventeen hundred members of high society including all the foreign ambassadors and eight dukes and duchesses. Initially the social tone was very high (though a policy that patrons should only be admitted on the recommendation of a peeress was soon dropped), and good profits were made. During the first winter there were assemblies only, without dancing or music, three times a week. In subsequent seasons the entertainments included a mixture of assemblies, masquerades (masked balls) and subscription concerts. For a while the shares commanded high prices and James Wyatt claimed to have sold his two shares for \u00a3900 each.\n\nIn the 1780s the popularity of the Pantheon declined; however, one of the commemoration concerts celebrating the music of the German composer, Handel, was held in the Pantheon in 1784. After the destruction of the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]] in [[The Haymarket]] by fire in 1789, it was converted into an opera house on a twelve-year lease at \u00a33,000 per annum. James Wyatt was once again the architect. After only one complete season of opera the Pantheon was burnt to the ground in 1792.\n\nBy 1795 the structure had been rebuilt in a similar but not identical form and it was leased as a place of assembly by one Crispus Claggett, who intended to provide masquerades and concerts. The principal room of this reincarnation was not a rotunda but consisted of \"an Area or Pit, \u2026 and a double tier of elegant and spacious Boxes, in the centre of which is a most splendid one for the Royal Family\". The Pantheon reopened with a masquerade on 9 April 1795. The revived assembly rooms were a failure, and in 1796 or 1797 Claggett disappeared and was never heard of again.\n[[File:Pantheon Masquerade edited.jpg|thumb|A masquerade in the rebuilt and modified Pantheon, circa 1808.]]\nFrom 1798 to 1810 the shareholders reverted to the original custom of managing the Pantheon themselves but the popularity of the entertainments continued to decline. In 1811\u201312 [[Nicholas Wilcox Cundy]] converted the building into a theatre, but restrictions imposed by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] (then the regulator and censor of theatres) ruined this venture and the career of the Pantheon as a place of public entertainment came to a close in 1814.\n\nIn 1833\u201334, the Pantheon was rebuilt as a [[bazaar]] by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]]. The whole of the roof and part of the walls of the old building were taken down, but the entrance fronts to both Oxford Street and Poland Street were retained, as were also the rooms immediately behind the former. The main space of the new building was a great hall of [[basilica]]n plan, with a [[barrel-vault]]ed [[nave]] of five wide bays. In 1867, the building was acquired by [[Walter Gilbey|W. and A. Gilbey]], [[wine merchant]]s, and was used by them as offices and show rooms until 1937.\n\nIt was demolished shortly afterwards to make way for a branch of [[Marks and Spencer]], opened in 1938, which is still there. This was designed by Robert Lutyens (son of Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]). It has a gleaming art deco polished black granite facade and has become a distinctive landmark on Oxford Street. Its special historic and architectural interest was recognised on 21 September 2009 when the Minister of Culture, Barbara Follett, awarded the building Grade II listed status.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41477 Survey of London] \u2014 detailed architectural history\n\n{{coord|51.5155|-0.1381|type:landmark_region:GB-WSM|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Assembly rooms]]\n[[Category:Dance venues in England]]\n[[Category:Demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n[[Category:Former buildings and structures in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:Entertainment in London]]\n[[Category:Rotundas in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Domes]]\n[[Category:1772 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1937 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1772]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1937]]\n[[Category:James Wyatt buildings]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in London]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in London]]\n[[Category:Oxford Street]]\n", "name_user": "Thoughtfortheday", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:wl", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_London"}
