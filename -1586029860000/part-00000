Sports are governed by both customs and explicit rules regarding acts which are permitted and forbidden at the event and away from it. Forbidden acts frequently include performance-enhancing drug taking (known as \"[[Doping in sport|doping]]\"), using equipment that does not conform to the rules or altering the condition of equipment during play, and deliberate harassment or injury to competitors.\n\n[[File:Lance Armstrong--2002--w.jpg|thumb|A 2012 investigation by the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA) found that Lance Armstrong had used banned performance-enhancing drugs over the course of his cycling career]]\nHigh-profile examples of alleged doping cheating include [[Lance Armstrong]]'s use of [[steroid]]s in professional [[cycling]] - particularly controversial as it is widely suspected that a high percentage of professional cyclists are using prohibited substances - [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]]'s disqualification following the [[100 metres]] final at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], and admissions of [[steroid]] use by former professional baseball players after they have retired, such as [[Jos\u00e9 Canseco]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-02-13-canseco-60minutes_x.htm |title=Canseco:Steroids made my baseball career possible |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2005-02-17 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref> and [[Ken Caminiti]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |title=Sports Illustrated:Steroids in baseball |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2002-06-23 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226205128/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |archivedate=2009-02-26 }}</ref> A famous sporting scandal involving cheating via harassment and injury occurred in 1994 in [[figure skating]] when [[Tonya Harding]]'s ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, hired Shane Stant to break [[Nancy Kerrigan]]'s leg to remove her from the year's competitions and prevent her from competing with Harding. One of the most famous instances of cheating involving a prohibited player action occurred during the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final, when [[Diego Maradona]] [[Hand of God goal|used his hand to punch the ball]] into the goal of [[England national football team|England]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Peter Shilton]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |title=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814051451/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |archivedate=2009-08-14 }}</ref> Using the hand or arm by anyone other than a goalkeeper is illegal according to the rules of association football.\n\nIllegally altering the condition of playing equipment is frequently seen in bat sports such as [[baseball]] and [[cricket]], which are heavily dependent on equipment condition. For example, in baseball, a [[pitcher]] using a [[Spitball|doctored baseball]] (e.g. putting [[graphite]] or [[Petroleum jelly|Vaseline]] on the baseball), or a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] using a [[corked bat]] are some examples of this. [[Tennis]] and [[golf]] are also no strangers to equipment cheating, with players being accused of using rackets of illegal string tension, or golf clubs of illegal weight, size, or make. Equipment cheating can also occur via the use of external aids in situations where equipment is prohibited - such as in [[American football]] via the use of [[stickum]] on the hands of receivers, making the ball easier to catch. An example of this is Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, who admitted to regularly & illegally using \"stickum\" throughout his career, calling into question the integrity of his receiving records.<ref>http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25061154/jerry-rice-admitted-to-cheating-just-days-before-calling-pats-cheaters</ref><ref>http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2015/02/whos_cheating_now_jerry_rice_admits_stickum_use_af.html</ref><ref>https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/jerry-rice-calls-out--cheating--patriots-but-admitted-to-using-stickum-200324269.html</ref>\n\nAthletic cheating is a widespread problem. For example, in [[professional bodybuilding]], cheating is now estimated to be so universal that it is now considered impossible to engage in professional competition without cheating and the use of supposedly banned substances; bodybuilders who refuse to take banned substances now compete in [[natural bodybuilding]] leagues.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nCheating may also be seen in [[coaching]]. One of the most common forms of this is the use of [[bribery]] and [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] in the player recruitment process. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}Such practices are widespread all across athletics, and are particularly visible in [[college sports]] recruitment. Another common form of cheating in coaching is profiteering in association with [[gambling|gamblers]] and [[match fixing]] (see also the section below on cheating in the gambling industry). The most famous coach of the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] Runnin' Rebels basketball team, [[Jerry Tarkanian]], was accused of both recruitment fraud and gambling fraud over the course of his career and was the subject of intense [[NCAA]] scrutiny. Another form of this involves a team coach or other manager undertaking [[corporate espionage]] or another form of prohibited spying in order to obtain details about other teams' strategies and tactics. The [[2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy]], in which the [[New England Patriots]] were found to have videotaped an opposing team from an unapproved location while trying to obtain defensive signals. As was the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] use of, at the time legal, performance enhancers. However, there was cheating proven by the [[Denver Broncos]] during their back to back titles in the late 1990s to circumvent the league's salary cap and obtain and retain players that they would otherwise not have been able to. Circumvention of rules governing conduct and procedures of a sport can also be considered cheating. a form of [[collusion]]. \n\nAn example of cheating via judging collusion occurred in the [[2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal]] when the Russian team was awarded a gold medal over the Canadian team in an alleged vote-swapping judging deal; the Canadian team's silver medals were eventually upgraded to gold at a second awards ceremony and the French judge was suspended for misconduct. The head of the French skating federation was later also suspended, and both were banned from the 2006 Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1959181.stm | work=BBC News | title=Three-year Ban for Skating Judge | date=April 30, 2002 | accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> The [[International Skating Union]] modified its [[ISU Judging System|judging system]] as a result of this case. \n\nCheating is also used to refer to movements in [[strength training]] that transfer weight from an isolated or fatigued muscle group to a different or fresh muscle group. This allows the cheater to move an initial greater weight (if the cheating continues through an entire training set) or to continue exercising past the point of muscular exhaustion (if the cheating begins part way through the set). As strength training is not a sport, cheating has no rule-based consequences, but can result in injury or a failure to meet training goals. This is because each exercise is designed to target specific muscle groups and if the proper form is not used the weight can be transferred away from the targeted group.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n=== Video games ===\n{{Main article|Cheating in video games}}\n[[File:Action Replay Amiga500.jpg|thumb|The [[Action Replay]] card allows Amiga computer owners to cheat in videogames]]\nIn video games, cheating can take the form of secret access codes in single-player games (such as the [[Konami code]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/cheats/games/gradius-nes-6035|title=Gradius Cheats & Codes|publisher=IGN|language=English|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref>) which unlock a bonus for the player when entered, [[hacking (computers)|hacks]] and exploits which give players an unfair advantage in online multiplayer games and single-player modes, or unfair [[collusion]] between players in online games (such as a player who spectates a match, removing limitations such as \"[[fog of war]]\", and reports on enemy positions to game partners).\n\nAttitudes towards cheating vary. Using exploits in single-player modes is usually considered to be simply another form of exploring the game's content unless the player's accomplishments are to be submitted competitively, and is common in single-player games with a high difficulty level; however, cheating in multiplayer modes is considered immoral and harshly condemned by fair players and developers alike. On one hand, cheating allows casual players to complete games at much-accelerated speed, which can be helpful in some cinematic or one-player games, which can take a subjectively long time to finish, as is typical of the [[Role-Playing Game]] (RPG) genre. While this may be seen as a hasty advantage causing no damage to anyone, in a multi-player game such as [[MMORPG]]s the repercussions of cheating are much more damaging, breaking the risk/reward curve of the game and causing fair players to lose online matches and/or character development. Cheating in those types of games is generally prohibited - though often widespread anyway. In many circles, the purchasing of items or currency from sources outside the game is also considered to be cheating. The [[Terms of Service#Video games|Terms of Service]] from many games where this is possible, directly prohibits this activity. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} One area where there is little consensus involves modern [[Free-to-play]] business models which support and are supported by the exchange of real-world money for in-game services, items, and advantages. Games that grant excessive advantages only available to paying customers may be criticized as being 'Pay to win'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/08/13/separating-free-to-play-and-pay-to-win |title=Separating Free-to-Play and Pay-To-Win |publisher=IGN.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> - sometimes considered a form of \"cheating\" that is actually legitimatized by the system - whilst games that limit real-money purchases to cosmetic changes are generally accepted as fair.\n\nAnother form of video game cheating is when a player does things to interact with game objects that are unforeseen by the programmers and break the intended function or reward system of the object. This can involve the way enemies are encountered, objectives met, items used, or any other game object that contains a [[software bug]]. One common example is the exploitation of errors in an enemy's [[pathfinding]]; if a player can cause an enemy to become \"stuck\" in a given terrain feature, that player can then usually dispatch the enemy from a distance without risk, even if much stronger, and achieve greater rewards than the player is intended to be able to at that level of progression. Another example was common in early [[first-person shooter]] games and involved skipping a weapon's reload timer by quickly switching weapons back and forth without actually reloading the weapons; resulting in what was effectively instant reloading. It also can be accomplished through means of altered game files are substituted for the normal files, or image graphics changed to permit greater visibility of the targets, etc. - for example, replacing the colors on a dark-colored enemy intended to blend in with the background with a bright color permitting instant visibility and targeting. Generally speaking, there is often some concern that this is not truly cheating, as it is the fault of the programmers that such an exploit exists in the first place. However, technically, as with live sports, it is cheating if the player is not playing the game in a formally approved manner, breaking unwritten rules. In some cases, this behavior is directly prohibited by the Terms of Service of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2293396~S0 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629121353/http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2293396~S0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-06-29 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 }}</ref>\n\n=== Gambling ===\n[[File:Georges de La Tour - Cheater with the Ace of Diamonds - WGA12334.jpg|thumb|''Cheater with the [[Ace of diamonds|Ace of Diamonds]]'', by [[Georges de La Tour]]]]\n{{see also|Cheating in casinos}}\n\nThe wagering of money on an event extends the motivation for cheating beyond directly participating competitors. As in sport and games, cheating in [[gambling]] is generally related to directly breaking rules or laws, or misrepresenting the event being wagered on, or interfering in the outcome.\nA boxer who takes a dive, a [[casino]] which plays with secretly [[loaded dice]], a rigged [[roulette wheel]] or [[slot machine]], or a [[doctored deck of cards]], are generally regarded as cheating, because it has misrepresented the likelihood of the game's outcomes beyond what is reasonable to expect a bettor to protect himself against. However, for a bookmaker to flatter a horse in order to sell bets on it at shorter [[odds]] may be regarded as [[salesmanship]] rather than cheating, since bettors can counter this by informing themselves and by exercising [[skepticism]].\nDoping a horse is a clear example of cheating by interfering with the instruments of the event under wager. Again, not all interference is cheating; spending money to support the health and well-being of a horse one has wagered on is not in itself generally regarded as cheating, nor is improving the morale of a sportsman one has backed by [[cheering]] for them. Generally, interference is more likely to be regarded as cheating if it diminishes the standard of a sporting competition, damages a participant, or modifies the apparatus of the event or game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629123454/http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-06-29 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the world of gambling, knowing a secret which is not priced into the odds gives a significant advantage, which may give rise to a perception of cheating. However, legal systems do not regard secretly making use of knowledge in this way as criminal deception in itself. This is in contrast to the financial world, where people with certain categories of relationship to a company are restricted from transacting, which would constitute the crime of [[insider trading]]. This may be because of a stronger presumption of equality between investors, or it may be because a company employee who also trades in the company's stock has a conflict of interest, and has thus misrepresented himself the company.\nAn [[advantage play]]er typically uses mental, observational or technical skills to choose when and how much to bet, and neither interferes with the instruments of the game nor breaks any of its rules. Representatives of the [[casino]] industry have claimed that all [[advantage play]] is cheating, but this point of view is reflected neither among societies in general nor in legislation. As of 2010, the only example anywhere of a type of advantage play being unlawful is for an advantage player to use an auxiliary device in the U.S. State of [[Nevada]], whose legislation is uniquely influenced by large casino corporations. Nonetheless it remains a widely held principle that the law should not impose any restraint over the method by which a player arrives at a playing or betting decision from information held by him lawfully and which he is not debarred from under the rules of the game. In \"hole carding\", a casino player tries to catch sight of the front of cards which are dealt face-down according to the rules.\nOne way of cheating and profiting through gambling is to bet against yourself and then intentionally lose. This is known as [[match fixing|throwing a game or taking a dive]]. Illegal gamblers will at times pay sports players to lose so that they may profit from the otherwise unexpected loss. An especially notorious case is the [[Black Sox Scandal]], when eight players of the 1919 Chicago White Sox took payment from gamblers and intentionally played poorly. Another happened in [[boxing]] when [[Jake LaMotta]] famously took a dive against Billy Fox in order to obtain his entry to a championship match against [[Marcel Cerdan]], a deal offered by the mobsters who controlled professional boxing.\n\n== Business ==\n\nVarious [[Trade regulation|regulation]]s exist to prevent unfair competitive advantages in business and finance,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/u/unfair-competitive-advantage-energy/|title=unfair-competitive-advantage-energy (law)}}</ref> for example [[competition law]], or the prohibition of [[insider trading]].\n\nThe most extreme forms of cheating (e.g. attempting to gain money through outright deceit rather than providing a service) are referred to as [[fraud]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Cheating (casino)]]\n* [[Cheating (poker)]]\n* [[Cheating in bridge]]\n* [[Cheating in chess]]\n* [[Cheating in online games]]\n* [[Cheating at the Paralympic Games]]\n* [[Gaming the system]]\n* [[Infidelity]]\n* [[Unfair competition]], in business\n\n<!-- Please stop adding names and/or universities here.

Forbidden acts frequently include performance-enhancing drug taking (known as \"[[Doping in sport|doping]]\"), using equipment that does not conform to the rules or altering the condition of equipment during play, and deliberate harassment or injury to competitors.\n\n[[File:Lance Armstrong--2002--w.jpg|thumb|A 2012 investigation by the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA) found that Lance Armstrong had used banned performance-enhancing drugs over the course of his cycling career]]\nHigh-profile examples of alleged doping cheating include [[Lance Armstrong]]'s use of [[steroid]]s in professional [[cycling]] - particularly controversial as it is widely suspected that a high percentage of professional cyclists are using prohibited substances - [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]]'s disqualification following the [[100 metres]] final at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], and admissions of [[steroid]] use by former professional baseball players after they have retired, such as [[Jos\u00e9 Canseco]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-02-13-canseco-60minutes_x.htm |title=Canseco:Steroids made my baseball career possible |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2005-02-17 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref> and [[Ken Caminiti]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |title=Sports Illustrated:Steroids in baseball |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2002-06-23 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226205128/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |archivedate=2009-02-26 }}</ref> A famous sporting scandal involving cheating via harassment and injury occurred in 1994 in [[figure skating]] when [[Tonya Harding]]'s ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, hired Shane Stant to break [[Nancy Kerrigan]]'s leg to remove her from the year's competitions and prevent her from competing with Harding. One of the most famous instances of cheating involving a prohibited player action occurred during the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final, when [[Diego Maradona]] [[Hand of God goal|used his hand to punch the ball]] into the goal of [[England national football team|England]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Peter Shilton]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |title=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814051451/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |archivedate=2009-08-14 }}</ref> Using the hand or arm by anyone other than a goalkeeper is illegal according to the rules of association football.\n\nIllegally altering the condition of playing equipment is frequently seen in bat sports such as [[baseball]] and [[cricket]], which are heavily dependent on equipment condition. For example, in baseball, a [[pitcher]] using a [[Spitball|doctored baseball]] (e.g. putting [[graphite]] or [[Petroleum jelly|Vaseline]] on the baseball), or a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] using a [[corked bat]] are some examples of this. [[Tennis]] and [[golf]] are also no strangers to equipment cheating, with players being accused of using rackets of illegal string tension, or golf clubs of illegal weight, size, or make. Equipment cheating can also occur via the use of external aids in situations where equipment is prohibited - such as in [[American football]] via the use of [[stickum]] on the hands of receivers, making the ball easier to catch. An example of this is Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, who admitted to regularly & illegally using \"stickum\" throughout his career, calling into question the integrity of his receiving records.<ref>http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25061154/jerry-rice-admitted-to-cheating-just-days-before-calling-pats-cheaters</ref><ref>http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2015/02/whos_cheating_now_jerry_rice_admits_stickum_use_af.html</ref><ref>https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/jerry-rice-calls-out--cheating--patriots-but-admitted-to-using-stickum-200324269.html</ref>\n\nAthletic cheating is a widespread problem. For example, in [[professional bodybuilding]], cheating is now estimated to be so universal that it is now considered impossible to engage in professional competition without cheating and the use of supposedly banned substances; bodybuilders who refuse to take banned substances now compete in [[natural bodybuilding]] leagues.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nCheating may also be seen in [[coaching]]. One of the most common forms of this is the use of [[bribery]] and [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] in the player recruitment process. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}Such practices are widespread all across athletics, and are particularly visible in [[college sports]] recruitment. Another common form of cheating in coaching is profiteering in association with [[gambling|gamblers]] and [[match fixing]] (see also the section below on cheating in the gambling industry). The most famous coach of the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] Runnin' Rebels basketball team, [[Jerry Tarkanian]], was accused of both recruitment fraud and gambling fraud over the course of his career and was the subject of intense [[NCAA]] scrutiny. Another form of this involves a team coach or other manager undertaking [[corporate espionage]] or another form of prohibited spying in order to obtain details about other teams' strategies and tactics. The [[2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy]], in which the [[New England Patriots]] were found to have videotaped an opposing team from an unapproved location while trying to obtain defensive signals. As was the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] use of, at the time legal, performance enhancers. However, there was cheating proven by the [[Denver Broncos]] during their back to back titles in the late 90's to circumvent the league's salary cap and obtain and retain players that they would otherwise not have been able to. Circumvention of rules governing conduct and procedures of a sport can also be considered cheating. a form of [[collusion]]. \n\nAn example of cheating via judging collusion occurred in the [[2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal]] when the Russian team was awarded a gold medal over the Canadian team in an alleged vote-swapping judging deal; the Canadian team's silver medals were eventually upgraded to gold at a second awards ceremony and the French judge was suspended for misconduct. The head of the French skating federation was later also suspended, and both were banned from the 2006 Olympic Games.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1959181.stm | work=BBC News | title=Three-year Ban for Skating Judge | date=April 30, 2002 | accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> The [[International Skating Union]] modified its [[ISU Judging System|judging system]] as a result of this case. \n\nCheating is also used to refer to movements in [[strength training]] that transfer weight from an isolated or fatigued muscle group to a different or fresh muscle group. This allows the cheater to move an initial greater weight (if the cheating continues through an entire training set) or to continue exercising past the point of muscular exhaustion (if the cheating begins part way through the set). As strength training is not a sport, cheating has no rule-based consequences, but can result in injury or a failure to meet training goals. This is because each exercise is designed to target specific muscle groups and if the proper form is not used the weight can be transferred away from the targeted group.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n=== Video games ===\n{{Main article|Cheating in video games}}\n[[File:Action Replay Amiga500.jpg|thumb|The [[Action Replay]] card allows Amiga computer owners to cheat in videogames]]\nIn video games, cheating can take the form of secret access codes in single-player games (such as the [[Konami code]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/cheats/games/gradius-nes-6035|title=Gradius Cheats & Codes|publisher=IGN|language=English|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref>) which unlock a bonus for the player when entered, [[hacking (computers)|hacks]] and exploits which give players an unfair advantage in online multiplayer games and single-player modes, or unfair [[collusion]] between players in online games (such as a player who spectates a match, removing limitations such as \"[[fog of war]]\", and reports on enemy positions to game partners).\n\nAttitudes towards cheating vary. Using exploits in single-player modes is usually considered to be simply another form of exploring the game's content unless the player's accomplishments are to be submitted competitively, and is common in single-player games with a high difficulty level; however, cheating in multiplayer modes is considered immoral and harshly condemned by fair players and developers alike. On one hand, cheating allows casual players to complete games at much-accelerated speed, which can be helpful in some cinematic or one-player games, which can take a subjectively long time to finish, as is typical of the [[Role-Playing Game]] (RPG) genre. While this may be seen as a hasty advantage causing no damage to anyone, in a multi-player game such as [[MMORPG]]s the repercussions of cheating are much more damaging, breaking the risk/reward curve of the game and causing fair players to lose online matches and/or character development. Cheating in those types of games is generally prohibited - though often widespread anyway. In many circles, the purchasing of items or currency from sources outside the game is also considered to be cheating. The [[Terms of Service#Video games|Terms of Service]] from many games where this is possible, directly prohibits this activity. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} One area where there is little consensus involves modern [[Free-to-play]] business models which support and are supported by the exchange of real-world money for in-game services, items, and advantages. Games that grant excessive advantages only available to paying customers may be criticized as being 'Pay to win'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/08/13/separating-free-to-play-and-pay-to-win |title=Separating Free-to-Play and Pay-To-Win |publisher=IGN.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> - sometimes considered a form of \"cheating\" that is actually legitimatized by the system - whilst games that limit real-money purchases to cosmetic changes are generally accepted as fair.\n\nAnother form of video game cheating is when a player does things to interact with game objects that are unforeseen by the programmers and break the intended function or reward system of the object. This can involve the way enemies are encountered, objectives met, items used, or any other game object that contains a [[software bug]]. One common example is the exploitation of errors in an enemy's [[pathfinding]]; if a player can cause an enemy to become \"stuck\" in a given terrain feature, that player can then usually dispatch the enemy from a distance without risk, even if much stronger, and achieve greater rewards than the player is intended to be able to at that level of progression. Another example was common in early [[first-person shooter]] games and involved skipping a weapon's reload timer by quickly switching weapons back and forth without actually reloading the weapons; resulting in what was effectively instant reloading. It also can be accomplished through means of altered game files are substituted for the normal files, or image graphics changed to permit greater visibility of the targets, etc. - for example, replacing the colors on a dark-colored enemy intended to blend in with the background with a bright color permitting instant visibility and targeting. Generally speaking, there is often some concern that this is not truly cheating, as it is the fault of the programmers that such an exploit exists in the first place. However, technically, as with live sports, it is cheating if the player is not playing the game in a formally approved manner, breaking unwritten rules. In some cases, this behavior is directly prohibited by the Terms of Service of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2293396~S0 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629121353/http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2293396~S0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-06-29 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 }}</ref>\n\n=== Gambling ===\n[[File:Georges de La Tour - Cheater with the Ace of Diamonds - WGA12334.jpg|thumb|''Cheater with the [[Ace of diamonds|Ace of Diamonds]]'', by [[Georges de La Tour]]]]\n{{see also|Cheating in casinos}}\n\nThe wagering of money on an event extends the motivation for cheating beyond directly participating competitors. As in sport and games, cheating in [[gambling]] is generally related to directly breaking rules or laws, or misrepresenting the event being wagered on, or interfering in the outcome.\nA boxer who takes a dive, a [[casino]] which plays with secretly [[loaded dice]], a rigged [[roulette wheel]] or [[slot machine]], or a [[doctored deck of cards]], are generally regarded as cheating, because it has misrepresented the likelihood of the game's outcomes beyond what is reasonable to expect a bettor to protect himself against. However, for a bookmaker to flatter a horse in order to sell bets on it at shorter [[odds]] may be regarded as [[salesmanship]] rather than cheating, since bettors can counter this by informing themselves and by exercising [[skepticism]].\nDoping a horse is a clear example of cheating by interfering with the instruments of the event under wager. Again, not all interference is cheating; spending money to support the health and well-being of a horse one has wagered on is not in itself generally regarded as cheating, nor is improving the morale of a sportsman one has backed by [[cheering]] for them. Generally, interference is more likely to be regarded as cheating if it diminishes the standard of a sporting competition, damages a participant, or modifies the apparatus of the event or game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629123454/http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-06-29 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the world of gambling, knowing a secret which is not priced into the odds gives a significant advantage, which may give rise to a perception of cheating. However, legal systems do not regard secretly making use of knowledge in this way as criminal deception in itself. This is in contrast to the financial world, where people with certain categories of relationship to a company are restricted from transacting, which would constitute the crime of [[insider trading]]. This may be because of a stronger presumption of equality between investors, or it may be because a company employee who also trades in the company's stock has a conflict of interest, and has thus misrepresented himself the company.\nAn [[advantage play]]er typically uses mental, observational or technical skills to choose when and how much to bet, and neither interferes with the instruments of the game nor breaks any of its rules. Representatives of the [[casino]] industry have claimed that all [[advantage play]] is cheating, but this point of view is reflected neither among societies in general nor in legislation. As of 2010, the only example anywhere of a type of advantage play being unlawful is for an advantage player to use an auxiliary device in the U.S. State of [[Nevada]], whose legislation is uniquely influenced by large casino corporations. Nonetheless it remains a widely held principle that the law should not impose any restraint over the method by which a player arrives at a playing or betting decision from information held by him lawfully and which he is not debarred from under the rules of the game. In \"hole carding\", a casino player tries to catch sight of the front of cards which are dealt face-down according to the rules.\nOne way of cheating and profiting through gambling is to bet against yourself and then intentionally lose. This is known as [[match fixing|throwing a game or taking a dive]]. Illegal gamblers will at times pay sports players to lose so that they may profit from the otherwise unexpected loss. An especially notorious case is the [[Black Sox Scandal]], when eight players of the 1919 Chicago White Sox took payment from gamblers and intentionally played poorly. Another happened in [[boxing]] when [[Jake LaMotta]] famously took a dive against Billy Fox in order to obtain his entry to a championship match against [[Marcel Cerdan]], a deal offered by the mobsters who controlled professional boxing.\n\n== Business ==\n\nVarious [[Trade regulation|regulation]]s exist to prevent unfair competitive advantages in business and finance,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/u/unfair-competitive-advantage-energy/|title=unfair-competitive-advantage-energy (law)}}</ref> for example [[competition law]], or the prohibition of [[insider trading]].\n\nThe most extreme forms of cheating (e.g. attempting to gain money through outright deceit rather than providing a service) are referred to as [[fraud]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Cheating (casino)]]\n* [[Cheating (poker)]]\n* [[Cheating in bridge]]\n* [[Cheating in chess]]\n* [[Cheating in online games]]\n* [[Cheating at the Paralympic Games]]\n* [[Gaming the system]]\n* [[Infidelity]]\n* [[Unfair competition]], in business\n\n<!-- Please stop adding names and/or universities here.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years. <!-- Antibiotics are not described as \"strongest\"; each has a specific range of activity.

Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[quarantine]] vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Coronaviruses ===\n\n[[Coronavirus]]es (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East Respiratory Syndrome]] (MERS-CoV) and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] (SARS-CoV).

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

It has been known as \"Bundesheer\" since then, except when Austria was a part of [[Nazi Germany]] (1938\u20131945; see [[Anschluss]]). The Austrian Army did develop a defence plan in 1938 against Germany{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, but politics prevented it from being implemented.\n\nWorld War II role of the \"Bundesheer\":\n*Elements of Austrian Army became [[9th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)]] \n*Elements of Austrian Army became [[44th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)]]\n*4th Austrian Division became the [[45th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)]]\n\n\nIn 1955, Austria issued its [[Declaration of Neutrality]], meaning that it would never join a military alliance. The Austrian Armed Forces' main purpose since then has been the protection of Austria's neutrality. Its relationship with NATO is limited to the [[Partnership for Peace]] program.<ref>[https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/austrian-mission-to-nato/ Austrian Mission to NATO]</ref>\n\nWith the end of the [[Cold War]], the Austrian military have increasingly assisted the border police in controlling the influx of illegal immigrants through Austrian borders.  The [[Yugoslav Wars|war]] in the neighbouring Balkans resulted in the lifting of the restrictions on the range of weaponry of the Austrian military that had been imposed by the [[Austrian State Treaty]].\n\n{{see also|Structure of the Austrian Armed Forces in 1989}}\n\n<gallery>\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-08388, Klagenfurth, Einzug des Bundesheeres.jpg|Troops entering [[Klagenfurt]] after a manoeuvre in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (September, 1929)\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-09245, \u00d6sterreich, Skitruppen beim Man\u00f6ver.jpg|Austrian [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]] in 1930\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-09448, Wien, Parade des Bundesheeres.jpg|Austrian Armed Forces celebrating their 10th anniversary in March 1930 at the [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[Heldenplatz]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12705, \u00d6sterreich, Man\u00f6ver der Gebirgsartillerie.jpg|Austrian mountain artillerymen during a manoeuvre in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12135, \u00d6sterreich, Fahnenweihe bei der Armee.jpg|New \"Standarten\" (flags) of Austrian Army units being consecrated by a Catholic priest in [[Mattersburg]], [[Burgenland]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12181, \u00d6sterreich, Pioniere beim Br\u00fcckenbau.jpg|Engineers building a bridge across the [[Danube]] during a manoeuvre in 1931\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-00805, Wien, Februark\u00e4mpfe, Bundesheer 2.jpg|Soldiers of the Austrian Army in Vienna, during the [[Austrian Civil War]] in 1934\nFile:Ausbildung in der Gruppe (18480913048).jpg|Troops of predecessor organisation ''[[B-Gendarmerie]]'' training with M1 Garands during the 1950s\n</gallery>\n\n== Mission ==\nThe main constitutional tasks of today's Austrian military are:\n* to protect the constitutionally established institutions and the population's democratic freedoms.\n* to maintain order and security inside the country.\n* to render assistance in the case of natural catastrophes and disasters of exceptional magnitude.\n\n== Organization ==\n{{Main|Structure of the Austrian Armed Forces}}\n\n[[Image:Austria Army Structure 2016.png|thumb|right|640px|Structure of the Austrian Army after the Bundesheerreform in 2016]]\n[[Image:Bataillon de la garde autrichienne.jpg|thumb|Austrian Guard Company during the [[Bastille Day parade]]]]\n[[Image:VFR Ost\u00f6sterreich Allentsteig 5845679463.jpg|thumb|[[Allentsteig]] (157 km\u00b2) is the largest [[Proving ground|training area]] in Austria.]]\n[[Image:Zeltweg und Umgebung von Norden Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zeltweg Air Base]]]]\n[[Image:J\u00e4gerbataillon 17 (9082965145).jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers of the 17th Infantry Battalion during a manoeuvre]]\n<!--[[Image:J\u00e4gerbataillon 23 bmlv gv at 2.JPG|thumb|right|Austrian [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]] in the [[Alps]]]]\n[[Image:Bundesheer at Airpower11 04.jpg|thumb|right|Paratroopers of the 25th Infantry Battalion exiting a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]]]]\n[[File:Austrian forces at Combined Resolve II (14236023945).jpg|thumb|Austrian soldiers training with the [[Steyr AUG|StG 77]]]]-->\n\nUnder the constitution, the [[President of Austria|President]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. In reality, the [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] has the decision-making authority, exercised through the Minister for National Defence. The Chancellor also chairs the National Defence Council, which has as its members a vice-chairman, the minister for national defence, an appointee of this minister, the Chief of the General Staff, and a parliamentary representative. The minister for national defence, acting in co-operation with the minister for interior, coordinates the work of the four major committees under the National Defence Council: the Military Defence Committee; the Civil Defence Committee; the Economic Defence Committee; and the Psychological Defence Committee. The Chief of the General Staff acts as the senior military adviser to the Minister for National Defence, assists the minister in the exercise of his authority, and, as the head of the general staff, is responsible for planning. However, the army commander exercises direct operational control of the Bundesheer in both peacetime and wartime.\n\nArticle 79 of the constitution, as amended in 1985, states that the Army is entrusted with the military defence of the country. Insofar as the legally constituted civil authority requests its co-operation, the army is further charged with protecting constitutional institutions and their capacity to act, as well as the democratic freedoms of the inhabitants; maintaining order and security in the interior; and rendering aid in disasters and mishaps of extraordinary scope. In administering the armed forces, the Ministry for National Defence is organized into four principal sections and the inspectorate general: Section I deals with legal and legislative matters; Section II handles personnel and recruitment matters, including discipline and grievances; Section III is concerned with troop command, schools, and other facilities, and it also comprises departments G-1 through G-5 as well as a separate department for air operations; and Section IV deals with procurement and supply, quartermaster matters, armaments, and ordnance (see fig. 12).\n\nThe general troop inspectorate is a separate section of the ministry with responsibility for co-ordination and fulfilment of the missions of the armed forces. It encompasses a general staff department, an attach\u00e9 department, and planning and inspection groups.\n\nThe armed forces consist solely of the army, of which the air force is considered a constituent part. In 1993, the total active complement of the armed forces was 52,000, of whom 20,000 to 30,000 were conscripts undergoing training of six to eight months. The army had 46,000 personnel on active duty (including an estimated 19,500 conscripts), and the air force had 6,000 personnel (2,400 conscripts).<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+at0157%29 which quotes \"Jane's Defence Weekly [London], 17, No. 4, January 24, 1992, 117-24. \"</ref>\n\n===Army===\n====Cold War structure====\n{{see|1989 Austrian Army order of battle}}\n\nUnder the area defence strategy, which had determined the army's organizational structure until 1993, the army was divided into three principal elements: the standing alert force (''Bereitschaftstruppe'') of active units, including the air division; the mobile militia (''Mobile Landwehr''), organized as eight mechanized reserve brigades to be deployed to key danger spots in the event of mobilization; and the stationary militia (''Raumgebundene Landwehr'') of twenty-six reserve infantry regiments organized for territorial defence. Both the mobile militia and the stationary militia were brought up to strength only in times of mobilization or during periods allotted for refresher training, usually three weeks in June. Training of conscripts was conducted by twenty-eight training and equipment-holding regiments (''Landwehrstammregimenter''). On mobilization, these regiments would disband, with their cadre reassigned to lead reserve units or form replacement regiments and battalions.\n\nAt the army level were a headquarters, guard, and special forces battalions and an artillery battalion at cadre strength. Two corps headquarters, one in the east at Graz and one in the west at Salzburg, would, on mobilization, command the provincially organized units in their respective zones. Each corps included artillery, antitank, antiaircraft, and engineering battalions, and a logistics regiment, all on a cadre basis.\n\nEach of the nine provincial military commands supervised the training and maintenance activities of their training and equipment-holding regiments. On mobilization, these nine commands would convert to a divisional headquarters commanding mobile militia, stationary militia, and other independent units.\n\nThe only active units immediately available in an emergency were those of the standing alert force of some 15,000 career soldiers supplemented by eight-month conscripts. The force was organized as a mechanized division consisting of three armored infantry brigades. Each brigade was composed of one tank battalion, one mechanized infantry battalion, and one self-propelled artillery battalion. Two of the brigades had antitank battalions equipped with self-propelled weapons. The divisional headquarters was at Baden near Vienna; the three brigades were based in separate locations, also in the northeast of the country.\n\n====Post-Cold War structure====\nThe New Army Structure\u2014the reorganization plan announced in late 1991 and scheduled to be in place sometime in 1995\u2014replaces the previous two-corps structure with one of three corps. The new corps is headquartered at Baden, with responsibility for the two northeastern provinces of Lower Austria and Upper Austria. Army headquarters will be eliminated, as will the divisional structure for the three standing brigades. The three corps\u2014in effect, regional commands\u2014will be directly subordinate to the general troop inspector. The three mechanized brigades will be placed directly under the new Third Corps at Baden, although in the future one brigade may be assigned to each of the three corps. The mobile militia will be reduced from eight to six mechanized brigades. Each of the nine provincial commands will have at least one militia regiment of two to six battalions as well as local defence companies.\n\nTotal personnel strength\u2014both standing forces and reserves\u2014is to be materially contracted under the new plan. The fully mobilized army will decline in strength from 200,000 to 120,000. The standing alert force will be reduced from 15,000 to 10,000. Reaction time is to be radically shortened so that part of the standing alert force can be deployed within hours to a crisis zone (for example, one adjacent to the border with Slovenia). A task force ready for immediate deployment will be maintained by one of the mechanized brigades on a rotational basis. Separate militia training companies to which all conscripts are assigned will be dismantled; in the future, conscripts will undergo basic training within their mobilization companies. Conscripts in the final stages of their training could supplement the standing forces by being poised for operational deployment at short notice.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+at0158%29] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317171915/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+at0158%29|date=2017-03-17}}</ref>\n\nPromotion is not based solely on merit but on position attained, level of education, and seniority. Officers with advanced degrees (for which study at the National Defence Academy qualifies) can expect to attain grade VIII before reaching the retirement age of sixty to sixty-five. Those with a baccalaureate degree can expect to reach grade VII (colonel), and those without university training will retire as captains or majors. Career NCOs form part of the same comprehensive personnel structure. It is common for NCOs to transfer at some stage in their careers to civilian status at the equivalent grade, either in the Ministry for National Defence or in the police or prison services after further training.\n\n===Austrian Air Force===\n{{Main|Austrian Air Force}}\n\nAustria's air force ({{lang-de|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte}}) has as its missions the defence of Austrian airspace, tactical support of Austrian ground forces, reconnaissance and military transport, and search-and-rescue support when requested by civil authorities.\n\nUntil 1985, when the first of twenty-four [[Saab 35 Draken]] were delivered, the country had remained essentially without the capacity to contest violations of its airspace. The Drakens, reconditioned after having served the [[Swedish Air Force]] since the early 1960s, were armed, in accordance with the restrictions on missiles in the State Treaty of 1955, only with a cannon. However, following Austria's revised interpretation of its obligations under the treaty, a decision was made in 1993 to procure [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]]s. The first of these missiles were purchased from Swedish air force inventory, while later a higher performance model was acquired directly from the United States, with deliveries commencing in 1995. French [[Mistral (missile)|Mistral]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s systems were purchased to add ground-based protection against air attack. The first of the systems arrived in Austria in 1993; final deliveries concluded in 1996.\n\nThe Drakens were retired in 2005 and 12 [[Northrop F-5|F-5E Tiger II]] were leased from Switzerland to avoid a gap in the Austrian air defence capabilities until the first Austrian [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] units became operational in 2007. Besides one squadron of 15 Eurofighter Typhoons, the air force has a squadron with 28 [[Saab 105]] trainers, which double as reconnaissance and [[close air support]] planes.\n\nThe helicopter fleet includes 23 [[Bell UH-1N Twin Huey|AB 212]] helicopters used as light transport. 24 French [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] are in service as search-and-rescue helicopters. Furthermore, the air force fields 10 [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58B Kiowa]] as light scout helicopters. After Austria had to request assistance from the [[United States Army]], [[Swiss Air Force]], [[French Air Force]], and German [[Bundeswehr]] to evacuate survivors after the 1999 [[Galt\u00fcr Avalanche]] a decision was taken to equip the Austrian Air Force with medium-sized transport helicopters. Thus in 2002 Austria acquired 9 [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopters. In 2003 the air force received 3 [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130K Hercules]] transport aircraft to support the armed forces in their UN peacekeeping and humanitarian activities.\n\n=== Austrian Special Operations Forces ===\n{{Main|Jagdkommando}}\n\nThe '''Jagdkommando''' (lit. ''Hunting Command'') is the Austrian Armed Forces' [[Special Operations]] group. The duties of this elite unit match those of its foreign counterparts, such as the [[United States Army Special Forces]] and [[British Special Air Service]] being amongst others [[counter-terrorism]] and [[counter-insurgency]]. Jagdkommando soldiers are highly trained professionals whose thorough and rigorous training enables them to take over when tasks or situations outgrow the capabilities and specialization of conventional units.\n\n== Unit Locations ==\n{{Location map+ | Austria\n| width = 960\n| float = center\n| caption = <center>Unit locations in 2018</center>\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Air Force Command\n    | position = top\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 49 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 13 | lon_min = 02 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>Radar Btn</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 49 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 13 | lon_min = 02 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Zeltweg Air Base|Zeltweg]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 12 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 44 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Linz Airport|H\u00f6rsching]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 14 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 11 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Brumowski Air Base|Langenlebarn]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 19 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 06 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Military Airport Aigen im Ennstal|Aigen]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 32 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 08 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Army Cmd\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 04 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 26 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>Guard Btn</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = red pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 11 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 21 | lon_dir = E\n}}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Rapid Mis.\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 25 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 35 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>19 Infantry</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 04 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 19 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>33 Infantry</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 07 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 28 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>3 Recon</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Orange pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 34 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 34 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label =  <small>3 Engineer</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Black pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 14 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 21 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = 4 Mech.

2006]]\n[[Image:Austrian forces at Combined Resolve II (14236022975).jpg|thumb|right|Paratroopers of the 25th Infantry Battalion]]\n\nUntil 1971 Austrian males were obligated to serve nine months in the armed forces, followed by four days of active service every two years for training and inspection. In 1971 the period of initial service was reduced to six months, followed by a total of sixty days of refresher training in the reserves. In the early 1990s, about 45,000 conscripts completed their initial military training every year, and 80,000 reservists participated in some form of exercises each year.\n\nReducing the mobilization strength of the army to 120,000 under the New Army Structure plan is to be accomplished in part by limiting initial training of recruits to six months, followed by reducing the period allotted for refresher training from twenty years to ten years. Each reservist is to receive training over a twelve-day period every second year during his first ten years of reserve duty, generally not extending beyond the time he reaches his mid-thirties. The reduced need for conscripts corresponds to a lower pool of young men because of a declining birth rate. The availability of about 40,000 fit trainees annually in 1993 was expected to fall to barely 30,000 by 2000 and to 26,000 by 2015.\n\nIn 2006 conscription was reduced to six months total. Mandatory reserve training was abolished. Since then the army reserve battalions (Miliz) are suffering from a lack of new reservists and are therefore overaging.\n\nUnder a 1974 law, conscientious objectors can be assigned work as medical orderlies, or other occupations in lieu of military service. Exemptions from service are liberally granted\u2014in 1992 about 12,000 persons were exempted, a great increase over the 1991 total of 4,500. The increase occurred after a new law, valid only for 1992 and 1993, no longer required young men to present their objections to the military in a credible way. Previously, that had not been the case. In 1990, for example, two young men rejected by the alternate service commission on the grounds that they did not present their beliefs in a credible manner were sentenced to prison terms of three months and one month, respectively.\n\nConscripts may attain the rank of private first class by the completion of initial training. Those with leadership potential may serve a longer period to obtain noncommissioned officer (NCO) status in the militia. Those volunteering for the career service can, after three to four years, apply to attend the NCO academy and later a senior NCO course to qualify as warrant officers. Both regular and militia officer candidates undergo a one-year program of basic training. After a further three years, regular officer candidates attending the military academy at Wiener Neustadt and militia officer candidates undergoing periodic intensified refresher training qualify as second lieutenants. The reserve obligation of conscripts generally ends by the time they reach their mid-thirties; NCOs and officers usually end their reserve status at a later age depending on their rank and specialization. By the early 1990s, some 1.3 million men had completed their initial service and refresher training obligations and had no further active-duty commitment.\n\nThe military personnel system is an integral part of a comprehensive civil service system. The nine officer ranks from officer candidate through general correspond to grades I through IX of the civil service system. The highest grade, IX, may be occupied by a section chief (undersecretary), a career ambassador, or a three-star general. A grade VIII position may be held by a departmental counselor, a career minister, or a brigadier general. Salary levels are the same for both civil and military personnel in the equivalent grades, although various allowances may be added, such as flight pay or hazardous-duty pay.\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:420 height:350\nPlotArea = width:330 height:250 left:50 bottom:70\nLegend = columns:1 left:52 top:40 columnwidth:100\n\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod = from:0 till:250000\nTimeAxis = orientation:vertical\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:25000 start:0\nColors=\n id:Manpower value:blue legend:Manpower\n\nPlotData=\n width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\n\n color:Manpower\n bar:1956 from:1 till:23000\n bar:1966 from:1 till:50000\n bar:1976 from:1 till:144000\n bar:1986 from:1 till:240000\n bar:1996 from:1 till:120000\n bar:2006 from:1 till:55000\n bar:2014 from:1 till:53000\n\nTextData=\n pos:(249,310) text:\"Total mobilized strength\"\n</timeline>\n\nThe system of promotion in the Austrian military, which offers no incentive for early retirement, means that the military is top-heavy with senior officers. The New Army Structure, which is intended to result in many fewer active-duty and reserve commands, compounds the difficulty. Personnel changes can be implemented only gradually, as the surplus of officers shrinks by attrition. In 1991, the army had four officers of general rank, fifty-nine at the rank of brigadier general (one star), 155 colonels, and 254 lieutenant colonels. The education of career officers is conducted at the Maria Theresia Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt, forty-five kilometres south of Vienna, which was founded in 1752. Young men who have completed their university entrance requirements are eligible to compete for places. The three-year course graduated 212 students in 1990. At the National Defence Academy in Vienna, which has a curriculum comparable to those of the National Defence University and the Army War College in the United States, operational and troop commanders of field-grade rank study for three years in preparation for general staff and command positions. The NCO school is located at Enns near Linz. Troop schools provide continuous specialized courses for officers and NCOs in artillery, air defence, armour, combat engineering, communications, and the like.\n\nWomen have been accepted for service in the Austrian armed forces since 1998. All service branches are open for female volunteers. In a public opinion survey in 1988, about 66 percent of those polled approved of opening the military to voluntary service by women; only nine percent favoured obligatory service.\n\n==Appearance==\n\nSince 2019 the new service uniform with a six colour camouflage pattern is issued, but the old service uniform in olive is still widespread and will be taken out of service very slowly.<ref>http://www.bundesheer.at/cms/artikel.php?ID=9906</ref><ref>https://kurier.at/politik/inland/neue-tarnuniformen-ab-heute-ist-bundesheer-in-camouflage-look-im-einsatz/400424153</ref><ref>https://www.spartanat.com/2019/03/oesterreich-neue-tarnuniformen-ab-2018/</ref> The dress uniform is grey, for formal occasions a white uniform may be worn. The air force uniform is identical, with the addition of wings worn on the right jacket breast\u2014gold for officers and silver for enlisted personnel. Branches of service are identified by beret colours: scarlet for the honour Guard; green for infantry; black for armour; cherry for airborne; and dark blue for quartermaster. Insignia of rank are worn on the jacket lapel of the dress uniform (silver stars on a green or gold shield) and on the epaulets of the field uniform (white, silver or gold stars on an olive drab field).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmlv.gv.at/abzeichen/barettfarben.shtml|title=Bundesheer - Uniformen und Abzeichen - Barettfarben|author=BMLVS - Abteilung Kommunikation|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmlv.gv.at/abzeichen/dienstgrade.shtml|title=Bundesheer - Uniformen und Abzeichen - Dienstgrade|author=BMLVS - Abteilung Kommunikation|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n{{See also|List of former equipment of the Austrian Army}}\n\nThe Austrian military has a wide variety of equipment.

It has been known as \"Bundesheer\" since then, except when Austria was a part of [[Nazi Germany]] (1938\u20131945; see [[Anschluss]]). The Austrian Army did develop a defence plan in 1938 against Germany{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, but politics prevented it from being implemented.\n\nWorld War II role of the \"Bundesheer\":\n*Elements of Austrian Army became [[9th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)]] \n*Elements of Austrian Army became [[44th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)]]\n*4th Austrian Division became the [[45th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)]]\n\n\nIn 1955, Austria issued its [[Declaration of Neutrality]], meaning that it would never join a military alliance. The Austrian Armed Forces' main purpose since then has been the protection of Austria's neutrality. Its relationship with NATO is limited to the [[Partnership for Peace]] program.<ref>[https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/austrian-mission-to-nato/ Austrian Mission to NATO]</ref>\n\nWith the end of the [[Cold War]], the Austrian military have increasingly assisted the border police in controlling the influx of illegal immigrants through Austrian borders.  The [[Yugoslav Wars|war]] in the neighbouring Balkans resulted in the lifting of the restrictions on the range of weaponry of the Austrian military that had been imposed by the [[Austrian State Treaty]].\n\n{{see also|Structure of the Austrian Armed Forces in 1989}}\n\n<gallery>\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-08388, Klagenfurth, Einzug des Bundesheeres.jpg|Troops entering [[Klagenfurt]] after a manoeuvre in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (September, 1929)\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-09245, \u00d6sterreich, Skitruppen beim Man\u00f6ver.jpg|Austrian [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]] in 1930\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-09448, Wien, Parade des Bundesheeres.jpg|Austrian Armed Forces celebrating their 10th anniversary in March 1930 at the [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[Heldenplatz]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12705, \u00d6sterreich, Man\u00f6ver der Gebirgsartillerie.jpg|Austrian mountain artillerymen during a manoeuvre in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12135, \u00d6sterreich, Fahnenweihe bei der Armee.jpg|New \"Standarten\" (flags) of Austrian Army units being consecrated by a Catholic priest in [[Mattersburg]], [[Burgenland]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12181, \u00d6sterreich, Pioniere beim Br\u00fcckenbau.jpg|Engineers building a bridge across the [[Danube]] during a manoeuvre in 1931\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-00805, Wien, Februark\u00e4mpfe, Bundesheer 2.jpg|Soldiers of the Austrian Army in Vienna, during the [[Austrian Civil War]] in 1934\nFile:Ausbildung in der Gruppe (18480913048).jpg|Troops of predecessor organisation ''[[B-Gendarmerie]]'' training with M1 Garands during the 1950s\n</gallery>\n\n== Mission ==\nThe main constitutional tasks of today's Austrian military are:\n* to protect the constitutionally established institutions and the population's democratic freedoms.\n* to maintain order and security inside the country.\n* to render assistance in the case of natural catastrophes and disasters of exceptional magnitude.\n\n== Organization ==\n{{Main|Structure of the Austrian Armed Forces}}\n\n[[Image:Austria Army Structure 2016.png|thumb|right|640px|Structure of the Austrian Army after the Bundesheerreform in 2016]]\n[[Image:Bataillon de la garde autrichienne.jpg|thumb|Austrian Guard Company during the [[Bastille Day parade]]]]\n[[Image:VFR Ost\u00f6sterreich Allentsteig 5845679463.jpg|thumb|[[Allentsteig]] (157 km\u00b2) is the largest [[Proving ground|training area]] in Austria.]]\n[[Image:Zeltweg und Umgebung von Norden Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zeltweg Air Base]]]]\n[[Image:J\u00e4gerbataillon 17 (9082965145).jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers of the 17th Infantry Battalion during a manoeuvre]]\n<!--[[Image:J\u00e4gerbataillon 23 bmlv gv at 2.JPG|thumb|right|Austrian [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]] in the [[Alps]]]]\n[[Image:Bundesheer at Airpower11 04.jpg|thumb|right|Paratroopers of the 25th Infantry Battalion exiting a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]]]]\n[[File:Austrian forces at Combined Resolve II (14236023945).jpg|thumb|Austrian soldiers training with the [[Steyr AUG|StG 77]]]]-->\n\nUnder the constitution, the [[President of Austria|President]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. In reality, the [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] has the decision-making authority, exercised through the Minister for National Defence. The Chancellor also chairs the National Defence Council, which has as its members a vice-chairman, the minister for national defence, an appointee of this minister, the Chief of the General Staff, and a parliamentary representative. The minister for national defence, acting in co-operation with the minister for interior, coordinates the work of the four major committees under the National Defence Council: the Military Defence Committee; the Civil Defence Committee; the Economic Defence Committee; and the Psychological Defence Committee. The Chief of the General Staff acts as the senior military adviser to the Minister for National Defence, assists the minister in the exercise of his authority, and, as the head of the general staff, is responsible for planning. However, the army commander exercises direct operational control of the Bundesheer in both peacetime and wartime.\n\nArticle 79 of the constitution, as amended in 1985, states that the Army is entrusted with the military defence of the country. Insofar as the legally constituted civil authority requests its co-operation, the army is further charged with protecting constitutional institutions and their capacity to act, as well as the democratic freedoms of the inhabitants; maintaining order and security in the interior; and rendering aid in disasters and mishaps of extraordinary scope. In administering the armed forces, the Ministry for National Defence is organized into four principal sections and the inspectorate general: Section I deals with legal and legislative matters; Section II handles personnel and recruitment matters, including discipline and grievances; Section III is concerned with troop command, schools, and other facilities, and it also comprises departments G-1 through G-5 as well as a separate department for air operations; and Section IV deals with procurement and supply, quartermaster matters, armaments, and ordnance (see fig. 12).\n\nThe general troop inspectorate is a separate section of the ministry with responsibility for co-ordination and fulfilment of the missions of the armed forces. It encompasses a general staff department, an attach\u00e9 department, and planning and inspection groups.\n\nThe armed forces consist solely of the army, of which the air force is considered a constituent part. In 1993, the total active complement of the armed forces was 52,000, of whom 20,000 to 30,000 were conscripts undergoing training of six to eight months. The army had 46,000 personnel on active duty (including an estimated 19,500 conscripts), and the air force had 6,000 personnel (2,400 conscripts).<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+at0157%29 which quotes \"Jane's Defence Weekly [London], 17, No. 4, January 24, 1992, 117-24. \"</ref>\n\n===Army===\n====Cold War structure====\n{{see|1989 Austrian Army order of battle}}\n\nUnder the area defence strategy, which had determined the army's organizational structure until 1993, the army was divided into three principal elements: the standing alert force (''Bereitschaftstruppe'') of active units, including the air division; the mobile militia (''Mobile Landwehr''), organized as eight mechanized reserve brigades to be deployed to key danger spots in the event of mobilization; and the stationary militia (''Raumgebundene Landwehr'') of twenty-six reserve infantry regiments organized for territorial defence. Both the mobile militia and the stationary militia were brought up to strength only in times of mobilization or during periods allotted for refresher training, usually three weeks in June. Training of conscripts was conducted by twenty-eight training and equipment-holding regiments (''Landwehrstammregimenter''). On mobilization, these regiments would disband, with their cadre reassigned to lead reserve units or form replacement regiments and battalions.\n\nAt the army level were a headquarters, guard, and special forces battalions and an artillery battalion at cadre strength. Two corps headquarters, one in the east at Graz and one in the west at Salzburg, would, on mobilization, command the provincially organized units in their respective zones. Each corps included artillery, antitank, antiaircraft, and engineering battalions, and a logistics regiment, all on a cadre basis.\n\nEach of the nine provincial military commands supervised the training and maintenance activities of their training and equipment-holding regiments. On mobilization, these nine commands would convert to a divisional headquarters commanding mobile militia, stationary militia, and other independent units.\n\nThe only active units immediately available in an emergency were those of the standing alert force of some 15,000 career soldiers supplemented by eight-month conscripts. The force was organized as a mechanized division consisting of three armored infantry brigades. Each brigade was composed of one tank battalion, one mechanized infantry battalion, and one self-propelled artillery battalion. Two of the brigades had antitank battalions equipped with self-propelled weapons. The divisional headquarters was at Baden near Vienna; the three brigades were based in separate locations, also in the northeast of the country.\n\n====Post-Cold War structure====\nThe New Army Structure\u2014the reorganization plan announced in late 1991 and scheduled to be in place sometime in 1995\u2014replaces the previous two-corps structure with one of three corps. The new corps is headquartered at Baden, with responsibility for the two northeastern provinces of Lower Austria and Upper Austria. Army headquarters will be eliminated, as will the divisional structure for the three standing brigades. The three corps\u2014in effect, regional commands\u2014will be directly subordinate to the general troop inspector. The three mechanized brigades will be placed directly under the new Third Corps at Baden, although in the future one brigade may be assigned to each of the three corps. The mobile militia will be reduced from eight to six mechanized brigades. Each of the nine provincial commands will have at least one militia regiment of two to six battalions as well as local defence companies.\n\nTotal personnel strength\u2014both standing forces and reserves\u2014is to be materially contracted under the new plan. The fully mobilized army will decline in strength from 200,000 to 120,000. The standing alert force will be reduced from 15,000 to 10,000. Reaction time is to be radically shortened so that part of the standing alert force can be deployed within hours to a crisis zone (for example, one adjacent to the border with Slovenia). A task force ready for immediate deployment will be maintained by one of the mechanized brigades on a rotational basis. Separate militia training companies to which all conscripts are assigned will be dismantled; in the future, conscripts will undergo basic training within their mobilization companies. Conscripts in the final stages of their training could supplement the standing forces by being poised for operational deployment at short notice.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+at0158%29] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317171915/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+at0158%29|date=2017-03-17}}</ref>\n\nPromotion is not based solely on merit but on position attained, level of education, and seniority. Officers with advanced degrees (for which study at the National Defence Academy qualifies) can expect to attain grade VIII before reaching the retirement age of sixty to sixty-five. Those with a baccalaureate degree can expect to reach grade VII (colonel), and those without university training will retire as captains or majors. Career NCOs form part of the same comprehensive personnel structure. It is common for NCOs to transfer at some stage in their careers to civilian status at the equivalent grade, either in the Ministry for National Defence or in the police or prison services after further training.\n\n===Austrian Air Force===\n{{Main|Austrian Air Force}}\n\nAustria's air force ({{lang-de|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte}}) has as its missions the defence of Austrian airspace, tactical support of Austrian ground forces, reconnaissance and military transport, and search-and-rescue support when requested by civil authorities.\n\nUntil 1985, when the first of twenty-four [[Saab 35 Draken]] were delivered, the country had remained essentially without the capacity to contest violations of its airspace. The Drakens, reconditioned after having served the [[Swedish Air Force]] since the early 1960s, were armed, in accordance with the restrictions on missiles in the State Treaty of 1955, only with a cannon. However, following Austria's revised interpretation of its obligations under the treaty, a decision was made in 1993 to procure [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]]s. The first of these missiles were purchased from Swedish air force inventory, while later a higher performance model was acquired directly from the United States, with deliveries commencing in 1995. French [[Mistral (missile)|Mistral]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s systems were purchased to add ground-based protection against air attack. The first of the systems arrived in Austria in 1993; final deliveries concluded in 1996.\n\nThe Drakens were retired in 2005 and 12 [[Northrop F-5|F-5E Tiger II]] were leased from Switzerland to avoid a gap in the Austrian air defence capabilities until the first Austrian [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] units became operational in 2007. Besides one squadron of 15 Eurofighter Typhoons, the air force has a squadron with 28 [[Saab 105]] trainers, which double as reconnaissance and [[close air support]] planes.\n\nThe helicopter fleet includes 23 [[Bell UH-1N Twin Huey|AB 212]] helicopters used as light transport. 24 French [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] are in service as search-and-rescue helicopters. Furthermore, the air force fields 10 [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58B Kiowa]] as light scout helicopters. After Austria had to request assistance from the [[United States Army]], [[Swiss Air Force]], [[French Air Force]], and German [[Bundeswehr]] to evacuate survivors after the 1999 [[Galt\u00fcr Avalanche]] a decision was taken to equip the Austrian Air Force with medium-sized transport helicopters. Thus in 2002 Austria acquired 9 [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopters. In 2003 the air force received 3 [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130K Hercules]] transport aircraft to support the armed forces in their UN peacekeeping and humanitarian activities.\n\n=== Austrian Special Operations Forces ===\n{{Main|Jagdkommando}}\n\nThe '''Jagdkommando''' (lit. ''Hunting Command'') is the Austrian Armed Forces' [[Special Operations]] group. The duties of this elite unit match those of its foreign counterparts, such as the [[United States Army Special Forces]] and [[British Special Air Service]] being amongst others [[counter-terrorism]] and [[counter-insurgency]]. Jagdkommando soldiers are highly trained professionals whose thorough and rigorous training enables them to take over when tasks or situations outgrow the capabilities and specialization of conventional units.\n\n== Unit Locations ==\n{{Location map+ | Austria\n| width = 960\n| float = center\n| caption = <center>Unit locations in 2018</center>\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Air Force Command\n    | position = top\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 49 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 13 | lon_min = 02 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>Radar Btn</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 49 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 13 | lon_min = 02 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Zeltweg Air Base|Zeltweg]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 12 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 44 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Linz Airport|H\u00f6rsching]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 14 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 11 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Brumowski Air Base|Langenlebarn]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 19 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 06 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Military Airport Aigen im Ennstal|Aigen]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 32 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 08 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Army Cmd\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 04 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 26 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>Guard Btn</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = red pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 11 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 21 | lon_dir = E\n}}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Rapid Mis.\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 25 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 35 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>19 Infantry</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 04 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 19 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>33 Infantry</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 07 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 28 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>3 Recon</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Orange pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 34 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 34 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label =  <small>3 Engineer</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Black pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 14 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 21 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = 4 Mech.

2006]]\n[[Image:Austrian forces at Combined Resolve II (14236022975).jpg|thumb|right|Paratroopers of the 25th Infantry Battalion]]\n\nUntil 1971 Austrian males were obligated to serve nine months in the armed forces, followed by four days of active service every two years for training and inspection. In 1971 the period of initial service was reduced to six months, followed by a total of sixty days of refresher training in the reserves. In the early 1990s, about 45,000 conscripts completed their initial military training every year, and 80,000 reservists participated in some form of exercises each year.\n\nReducing the mobilization strength of the army to 120,000 under the New Army Structure plan is to be accomplished in part by limiting initial training of recruits to six months, followed by reducing the period allotted for refresher training from twenty years to ten years. Each reservist is to receive training over a twelve-day period every second year during his first ten years of reserve duty, generally not extending beyond the time he reaches his mid-thirties. The reduced need for conscripts corresponds to a lower pool of young men because of a declining birth rate. The availability of about 40,000 fit trainees annually in 1993 was expected to fall to barely 30,000 by 2000 and to 26,000 by 2015.\n\nIn 2006 conscription was reduced to six months total. Mandatory reserve training was abolished. Since then the army reserve battalions (Miliz) are suffering from a lack of new reservists and are therefore overaging.\n\nUnder a 1974 law, conscientious objectors can be assigned work as medical orderlies, or other occupations in lieu of military service. Exemptions from service are liberally granted\u2014in 1992 about 12,000 persons were exempted, a great increase over the 1991 total of 4,500. The increase occurred after a new law, valid only for 1992 and 1993, no longer required young men to present their objections to the military in a credible way. Previously, that had not been the case. In 1990, for example, two young men rejected by the alternate service commission on the grounds that they did not present their beliefs in a credible manner were sentenced to prison terms of three months and one month, respectively.\n\nConscripts may attain the rank of private first class by the completion of initial training. Those with leadership potential may serve a longer period to obtain noncommissioned officer (NCO) status in the militia. Those volunteering for the career service can, after three to four years, apply to attend the NCO academy and later a senior NCO course to qualify as warrant officers. Both regular and militia officer candidates undergo a one-year program of basic training. After a further three years, regular officer candidates attending the military academy at Wiener Neustadt and militia officer candidates undergoing periodic intensified refresher training qualify as second lieutenants. The reserve obligation of conscripts generally ends by the time they reach their mid-thirties; NCOs and officers usually end their reserve status at a later age depending on their rank and specialization. By the early 1990s, some 1.3 million men had completed their initial service and refresher training obligations and had no further active-duty commitment.\n\nThe military personnel system is an integral part of a comprehensive civil service system. The nine officer ranks from officer candidate through general correspond to grades I through IX of the civil service system. The highest grade, IX, may be occupied by a section chief (undersecretary), a career ambassador, or a three-star general. A grade VIII position may be held by a departmental counselor, a career minister, or a brigadier general. Salary levels are the same for both civil and military personnel in the equivalent grades, although various allowances may be added, such as flight pay or hazardous-duty pay.\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:420 height:350\nPlotArea = width:330 height:250 left:50 bottom:70\nLegend = columns:1 left:52 top:40 columnwidth:100\n\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod = from:0 till:250000\nTimeAxis = orientation:vertical\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:25000 start:0\nColors=\n id:Manpower value:blue legend:Manpower\n\nPlotData=\n width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\n\n color:Manpower\n bar:1956 from:1 till:23000\n bar:1966 from:1 till:50000\n bar:1976 from:1 till:144000\n bar:1986 from:1 till:240000\n bar:1996 from:1 till:120000\n bar:2006 from:1 till:55000\n bar:2014 from:1 till:53000\n\nTextData=\n pos:(249,310) text:\"Total mobilized strength\"\n</timeline>\n\nThe system of promotion in the Austrian military, which offers no incentive for early retirement, means that the military is top-heavy with senior officers. The New Army Structure, which is intended to result in many fewer active-duty and reserve commands, compounds the difficulty. Personnel changes can be implemented only gradually, as the surplus of officers shrinks by attrition. In 1991, the army had four officers of general rank, fifty-nine at the rank of brigadier general (one star), 155 colonels, and 254 lieutenant colonels. The education of career officers is conducted at the Maria Theresia Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt, forty-five kilometres south of Vienna, which was founded in 1752. Young men who have completed their university entrance requirements are eligible to compete for places. The three-year course graduated 212 students in 1990. At the National Defence Academy in Vienna, which has a curriculum comparable to those of the National Defence University and the Army War College in the United States, operational and troop commanders of field-grade rank study for three years in preparation for general staff and command positions. The NCO school is located at Enns near Linz. Troop schools provide continuous specialized courses for officers and NCOs in artillery, air defence, armour, combat engineering, communications, and the like.\n\nWomen have been accepted for service in the Austrian armed forces since 1998. All service branches are open for female volunteers. In a public opinion survey in 1988, about 66 percent of those polled approved of opening the military to voluntary service by women; only nine percent favoured obligatory service.\n\n==Appearance==\n\nSince 2019 the new service uniform with a six colour camouflage pattern is issued, but the old service uniform in olive is still widespread and will be taken out of service very slowly.<ref>http://www.bundesheer.at/cms/artikel.php?ID=9906</ref><ref>https://kurier.at/politik/inland/neue-tarnuniformen-ab-heute-ist-bundesheer-in-camouflage-look-im-einsatz/400424153</ref><ref>https://www.spartanat.com/2019/03/oesterreich-neue-tarnuniformen-ab-2018/</ref> The dress uniform is grey, for formal occasions a white uniform may be worn. The air force uniform is identical, with the addition of wings worn on the right jacket breast\u2014gold for officers and silver for enlisted personnel. Branches of service are identified by beret colours: scarlet for the honour Guard; green for infantry; black for armour; cherry for airborne; and dark blue for quartermaster. Insignia of rank are worn on the jacket lapel of the dress uniform (silver stars on a green or gold shield) and on the epaulets of the field uniform (white, silver or gold stars on an olive drab field).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmlv.gv.at/abzeichen/barettfarben.shtml|title=Bundesheer - Uniformen und Abzeichen - Barettfarben|author=BMLVS - Abteilung Kommunikation|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmlv.gv.at/abzeichen/dienstgrade.shtml|title=Bundesheer - Uniformen und Abzeichen - Dienstgrade|author=BMLVS - Abteilung Kommunikation|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n{{See also|List of former equipment of the Austrian Army}}\n\nThe Austrian military has a wide variety of equipment.

Named in honor of the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, the daughter of the [[Paul I of Russia|Russian Emperor Paul I]]. In 1938, its name was changed to Khanlar, in 2008 - to Goygol.\n\n====Establishment of the colony====\nOn May 10, 1817, [[Alexander I of Russia|the Russian Emperor Alexander I]] signed a petition of 700 Swabian families for resettlement in Transcaucasia. The city of Ulm was appointed the assembly point, from where the settlers were sent on ships down the Danube to Izmail. After the quarantine, they were resettled for wintering in already existing by that time Black Sea German colonies Peterstal, Josefstal, Karlstal and other Swabian villages. The settlers arrived in Transcaucasus only in August 181, accompanied by Cossacks. Of the seven hundred families that left Ulm, only about four hundred have reached the goal; Some of the settlers died on the way from illnesses, others stayed in the Black Sea region. At the same time, about one hundred families from the Black Sea colonies joined the settlers. Six settlements in Georgia and two (Annenfeld and Elenendorf) in [[Azerbaijan]] were founded in the [[Transcaucasia|Transcaucasus]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u041d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0410\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0430|last=\u0418\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|first=\u041d.\u0410|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe colonists arrived to the appointed place in the winter of 1818, so they were forced to winter in Elizavetpole, and only in the spring of 1819, on Easter holidays, government officials determined the exact place of construction of Elenendorf - the former \"Tatar settlement\" Hanahlar, where \"besides the half-buried canal and the pits in the ground, nothing reminded of the former inhabitants.\" The plots for the yards were distributed along two streets. The founders of the Helenendorf colony were Swabian families (according to various sources, from 127 to 135 families), who came mainly from Reutlingen under the leadership of Gottlieb Koch, Duke Shiman, Jakov Krause and Johannes Wuhrer. Initially, the colonists had to live in dugouts, for several years they lived in very difficult and even dangerous conditions, so in the first winter (1818-1819) only 118 families survived. During the Russian-Persian War of 1826\u201328, the Swabians twice had to flee to Elizavetpol and [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]], fleeing from the advancing Persians, both times Helenendorf was burned by the Persians. In 1829\u201330, mortality due to diseases (including plague and cholera) was two times higher than the birth rate.

In 1823 the first school was built, in which children were trained in two classes. As the population grew, the school expanded, and the list of subjects studied in it expanded. From the 1890s, it became compulsory to study the Russian language. In 1907, at the Elendendorf school, a boarding school was opened to accommodate children from other Swabian settlements of the Transcaucasus who studied there. In the 20-ies of the XX century, teachers from Germany were invited to work at the school. So, for example, [[Alois Melichar]] (Alois Melichar), future conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] conducted music lessons in Elendendorf school.\n\nThe cultural life in Helenendorf began with the formation in 1893 of the German Society (Deutscher Verein), originally a male club with a library, a reading room and a bowling alley. Later on, the amateur wind and string orchestras and the theater studio were organized, which held concerts and performances both in the hall of the society, where up to 400 spectators could be accommodated, and at various festive events, including in the public garden of Helendorf. In 1930, a music school was opened with classes of pianofortes and stringed instruments. Various festivals, which gathered musical groups from all the Transcaucasian colonies were often held in Helenendorf (by the 1930s there were 21 colonies).\n\nTraces of the German settlement can be seen in the school buildings and the parish church built in 1854.\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn the 1920 census there were 2,259 people registered.<ref>{{Cite news|last=\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430 [Abdulbaghiyeva] |first=\u0421\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0440 [Sanubar] |script-title=ru:\u041a 200-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044e \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0410\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0435: \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0439 - \u0424\u041e\u0422\u041e |trans-title=On the 200 anniversary of the establishment of German settlements in Azerbaijan: a brief historical overview of the German colonies - photo |date=30 August 2016 |language=ru |newspaper=The First News |url=http://www.1news.az/news/k-200-letiyu-sozdaniya-nemeckih-poseleniy-v-azerbaydzhane-kratkiy-istoricheskiy-obzor-nemeckih-koloniy---foto |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724200428/http://www.1news.az/news/k-200-letiyu-sozdaniya-nemeckih-poseleniy-v-azerbaydzhane-kratkiy-istoricheskiy-obzor-nemeckih-koloniy---foto |archive-date=24 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nThe city today is overwhelmingly populated by Azeris.

In 1938, its name was changed to Khanlar, in 2008 - to Goygol.\n\n====Establishment of the colony====\nOn May 10, 1817, [[Alexander I of Russia|the Russian Emperor Alexander I]] signed a petition of 700 Swabian families for resettlement in Transcaucasia. The city of Ulm was appointed the assembly point, from where the settlers were sent on ships down the Danube to Izmail. After the quarantine, they were resettled for wintering in already existing by that time Black Sea German colonies Peterstal, Josefstal, Karlstal and other Swabian villages. The settlers arrived in Transcaucasus only in August 181, accompanied by Cossacks. Of the seven hundred families that left Ulm, only about four hundred have reached the goal; Some of the settlers died on the way from illnesses, others stayed in the Black Sea region. At the same time, about one hundred families from the Black Sea colonies joined the settlers. Six settlements in Georgia and two (Annenfeld and Elenendorf) in [[Azerbaijan]] were founded in the [[Transcaucasia|Transcaucasus]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u041d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0410\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0430|last=\u0418\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|first=\u041d.\u0410|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe colonists arrived to the appointed place in the winter of 1818, so they were forced to winter in Elizavetpole, and only in the spring of 1819, on Easter holidays, government officials determined the exact place of construction of Elenendorf - the former \"Tatar settlement\" Hanahlar, where \"besides the half-buried canal and the pits in the ground, nothing reminded of the former inhabitants.\" The plots for the yards were distributed along two streets. The founders of the Helenendorf colony were Swabian families (according to various sources, from 127 to 135 families), who came mainly from Reutlingen under the leadership of Gottlieb Koch, Duke Shiman, Jakov Krause and Johannes Wuhrer. Initially, the colonists had to live in dugouts, for several years they lived in very difficult and even dangerous conditions, so in the first winter (1818-1819) only 118 families survived. During the Russian-Persian War of 1826-28, the Swabians twice had to flee to Elizavetpol and [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]], fleeing from the advancing Persians, both times Helenendorf was burned by the Persians. In 1829-30, mortality due to diseases (including plague and cholera) was two times higher than the birth rate.

In 1823 the first school was built, in which children were trained in two classes. As the population grew, the school expanded, and the list of subjects studied in it expanded. From the 1890s, it became compulsory to study the Russian language. In 1907, at the Elendendorf school, a boarding school was opened to accommodate children from other Swabian settlements of the Transcaucasus who studied there. In the 20-ies of the XX century, teachers from Germany were invited to work at the school. So, for example, [[Alois Melichar]] (Alois Melichar), future conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] conducted music lessons in Elendendorf school.\n\nThe cultural life in Helenendorf began with the formation in 1893 of the German Society (Deutscher Verein), originally a male club with a library, a reading room and a bowling alley.

She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man.\n\nThe film became both celebrated and notorious for showing the actress's face in the throes of an orgasm.

To calm her, he said they were using \"long shots\" in any case, and no intimate details would be visible.

She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man.\n\nThe film became both celebrated and notorious for showing the actress's face in the throes of an orgasm. According to Marie Benedict's book ''The Only Woman In The Room,'' Kiesler's expression resulted from someone sticking her with a pin.

The show encouraged children to [[reading (activity)|read]]. In 2012, an iPad and Kindle Fire educational interactive book reading and video field trip application was launched bearing the name of the program.\n\nThe [[public television]] series garnered over 200 broadcast awards, including a [[Peabody Award]] and 26 [[Emmy Award]]s, 11 of which were in the \"Outstanding Children's Series\" category.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading Rainbow Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085075/awards?ref_=tt_ql_4|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref> The series was created under the leadership of Cecily Truett Lancit and Larry Lancit, at Lancit Media Productions in New York. The concept of a reading series for children originated with Twila Liggett, PhD, and Paul Schupbach (director), of the Great Plains National Instructional Television Library at the [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]]; and Tony Buttino, of [[WNED-TV]] [[Buffalo, New York]]. The original team included Lynne Brenner Ganek, Ellen Schecter, and host [[LeVar Burton]].\n\nEach episode centered on a topic from a book, or other children's literature, which was explored through a number of segments or stories.

Retrieved July 2, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Show details==\n''Reading Rainbow'' was hosted by actor and executive producer [[LeVar Burton]], who is also known for his roles in ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. The show was produced first by Lancit Media Entertainment from 1983 to 2001, and then, by On-Screen Entertainment from 2002 to 2006.\n\nEvery episode featured a different book, often narrated by a celebrity. Celebrity readers included [[Philip Bosco]] (Barbara Bash's ''Desert Giant: The World of the Saguaro Cactus''), [[Michael Ansara]] ([[Paul Goble (writer and illustrator)|Paul Goble]]'s ''The Gift of the Sacred Dog'', Sheila MacGill Callahan's ''And Still the Turtle Watched''), [[Josie de Guzman]] (Leyla Torres's ''Saturday Sancocho''), [[Jason Robards]] (Francine Jacobs' ''Sam the Sea Cow''), [[Phylicia Rashad]] (John Steptoe's Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters), [[Bill Cosby]] ([[Marc Brown (author)|Marc Brown's]] ''Arthur's Eyes''), [[Eartha Kitt]] ([[Megan McDonald]]'s ''Is This a House for Hermit Crab?''), and [[Charles Kimbrough]] ([[David Wiesner]]'s ''June 29, 1999''). The featured story would often have still shots of the book's illustrated pages shown in succession, although on certain occasions the shots would be animated. After the featured story, Burton visited settings related to the episode's theme, often featuring interviews with guests. One episode featured a behind-the-scenes look at ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. The last segment of each show, called Book Reviews recommended by children, began with Burton's introductory catchphrase, \"But you don't have to take my word for it,\" and featured children giving capsule reviews of books they liked. Burton ended almost every episode with the phrase \"I'll see you next time.\"\n\nThe series' pilot, which aired as the show's 8th episode in 1983, featured the book ''Gila Monsters Meet You at the Airport'' by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat and was narrated by Doug Parvin. It was created and produced in 1981. Burton hosted the program.\n\nThe daughters of producer Larry Lancit, Shaune and Caitlin Lancit, were often featured in the series, notably as the children thanking the sponsors at the beginning and end of the show.\n\n===Theme song and opening sequence===\nThe show's theme song was written by Steve Horelick, Dennis Neil Kleinman, and Janet Weir; Horelick also served as the series' music director and composer and received an Emmy nomination in 2007 for his work on the series. Over the show's 23-year run, it went through three different versions of the theme song.\n\nThe original theme was performed by Tina Fabrique and featured one of the first uses of the [[Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments|Buchla synthesizer]] in a TV theme song. The original opening sequence, which consisted of an animated butterfly transforming the surroundings of young children reading books into animated fantasy lands, was used until August 1999. The introductory animation was drawn at Oldfather Studios in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] on the [[University of Kansas]] campus and animated by the late [[Michael Sporn]].\n\nIn September 1999, episodes began using a new live-action opening sequence and featured CGI in a space-themed world, with the same theme song performed first by [[Johnny Kemp]].\n\nA third intro was used starting in May 2000, performed by R&B artist [[Chaka Khan]]. The opening sequence is mostly the same as the second one, but this time featuring Burton replacing some of the animated elements.\n\n[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]] parodied the theme song by presenting it as if it was written by [[The Doors]], and featured Fallon doing an impression of [[Jim Morrison]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBRYsAfchkY|title=The Doors Sing \"Reading Rainbow\" Theme (Late Night with Jimmy Fallon)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n===Final years as TV series (2005\u201306)===\n[[File:Readingrainbow logo.png|right|thumb|200px|The ''Reading Rainbow'' logo used between 1983 and 1999.]]\nOriginal production was to have ended after April 4, 2005, with the show continuing to air in [[rerun]]s, but host [[LeVar Burton]] said on February 7, 2006, that five new episodes of the show would be shot in 2006 despite the continuing financial issues of PBS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trektoday.com/news/070206_02.shtml|title=TrekToday - Burton Talks Drama, Diversity, Respect & 'Reading Rainbow'}}</ref> The show aired its final episode on November 10, 2006.\n\n==Relaunch as an app==\n===Announcement and early developments (2010\u201314)===\nFormer executive producer [[LeVar Burton]] announced on his Twitter feed on March 19, 2010, that \"Reading Rainbow 2.0 is in the works.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/levarburton/status/10730167290|title=You heard it here first...

The new goal is to create an educational version for schools to use, free of cost to those schools in need, and help America get back to high literacy rates. They are also going to create a website for students to use to assist them with learning how to read.  The following day, May 29, 2014, they reached two million dollars (double their goal) at 1:15&nbsp;pm.

The show encouraged children to [[reading (activity)|read]]. In 2012, an iPad and Kindle Fire educational interactive book reading and video field trip application was launched bearing the name of the program.\n\nThe [[public television]] series garnered over 200 broadcast awards, including a [[Peabody Award]] and 26 [[Emmy Award]]s, 11 of which were in the \"Outstanding Children's Series\" category.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading Rainbow Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085075/awards?ref_=tt_ql_4|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref> The series was created under the leadership of Cecily Truett Lancit and Larry Lancit, at Lancit Media Productions in New York. The concept of a reading series for children originated with Twila Liggett, PhD, and Paul Schupbach (director), of the Great Plains National Instructional Television Library at the [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]]; and Tony Buttino, of [[WNED-TV]] [[Buffalo, New York]]. The original team included Lynne Brenner Ganek, Ellen Schecter, and host [[LeVar Burton]].\n\nEach episode centered on a topic from a book, or other children's literature, which was explored through a number of segments or stories. The show also recommended books for children to look for when they went to the library.

Kickstarter. Retrieved July 2, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Show details==\n''Reading Rainbow'' was hosted by actor and executive producer [[LeVar Burton]], who is also known for his roles in ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. The show was produced first by Lancit Media Entertainment from 1983 to 2001, and then, by On-Screen Entertainment from 2002 to 2006.\n\nEvery episode featured a different book, often narrated by a celebrity. Celebrity readers included [[Philip Bosco]] (Barbara Bash's ''Desert Giant: The World of the Saguaro Cactus''), [[Michael Ansara]] ([[Paul Goble (writer and illustrator)|Paul Goble]]'s ''The Gift of the Sacred Dog'', Sheila MacGill Callahan's ''And Still the Turtle Watched''), [[Josie de Guzman]] (Leyla Torres's ''Saturday Sancocho''), [[Jason Robards]] (Francine Jacobs' ''Sam the Sea Cow''), [[Phylicia Rashad]] (John Steptoe's Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters), [[Bill Cosby]] ([[Marc Brown (author)|Marc Brown's]] ''Arthur's Eyes''), [[Eartha Kitt]] ([[Megan McDonald]]'s ''Is This a House for Hermit Crab?''), and [[Charles Kimbrough]] ([[David Wiesner]]'s ''June 29, 1999''). The featured story would often have still shots of the book's illustrated pages shown in succession, although on certain occasions the shots would be animated. After the featured story, Burton visited settings related to the episode's theme, often featuring interviews with guests. One episode featured a behind-the-scenes look at ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. The last segment of each show, called Book Reviews recommended by children, began with Burton's introductory catchphrase, \"But you don't have to take my word for it,\" and featured children giving capsule reviews of books they liked. Burton ended almost every episode with the phrase \"I'll see you next time.\"\n\nThe series' pilot, which aired as the show's 8th episode in 1983, featured the book ''Gila Monsters Meet You at the Airport'' by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat and was narrated by Doug Parvin. It was created and produced in 1981. Burton hosted the program.\n\nThe daughters of producer Larry Lancit, Shaune and Caitlin Lancit, were often featured in the series, notably as the children thanking the sponsors at the beginning and end of the show.\n\n===Theme song and opening sequence===\nThe show's theme song was written by Steve Horelick, Dennis Neil Kleinman, and Janet Weir; Horelick also served as the series' music director and composer and received an Emmy nomination in 2007 for his work on the series. Over the show's 23-year run, it went through three different versions of the theme song.\n\nThe original theme was performed by Tina Fabrique and featured one of the first uses of the [[Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments|Buchla synthesizer]] in a TV theme song. The original opening sequence, which consisted of an animated butterfly transforming the surroundings of young children reading books into animated fantasy lands, was used until August 1999. The introductory animation was drawn at Oldfather Studios in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] on the [[University of Kansas]] campus and animated by the late [[Michael Sporn]].\n\nIn September 1999, episodes began using a new live-action opening sequence and featured CGI in a space-themed world, with the same theme song performed first by [[Johnny Kemp]].\n\nA third intro was used starting in May 2000, performed by R&B artist [[Chaka Khan]]. The opening sequence is mostly the same as the second one, but this time featuring Burton replacing some of the animated elements.\n\n[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]] parodied the theme song by presenting it as if it was written by [[The Doors]], and featured Fallon doing an impression of [[Jim Morrison]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBRYsAfchkY|title=The Doors Sing \"Reading Rainbow\" Theme (Late Night with Jimmy Fallon)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n===Final years as TV series (2005\u201306)===\n[[File:Readingrainbow logo.png|right|thumb|200px|The ''Reading Rainbow'' logo used between 1983 and 1999.]]\nOriginal production was to have ended after April 4, 2005, with the show continuing to air in [[rerun]]s, but host [[LeVar Burton]] said on February 7, 2006, that five new episodes of the show would be shot in 2006 despite the continuing financial issues of PBS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trektoday.com/news/070206_02.shtml|title=TrekToday - Burton Talks Drama, Diversity, Respect & 'Reading Rainbow'}}</ref> The show aired its final episode on November 10, 2006.\n\n==Relaunch as an app==\n===Announcement and early developments (2010\u201314)===\nFormer executive producer [[LeVar Burton]] announced on his Twitter feed on March 19, 2010, that \"Reading Rainbow 2.0 is in the works.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/levarburton/status/10730167290|title=You heard it here first...

The new goal is to create an educational version for schools to use, free of cost to those schools in need, and help America get back to high literacy rates. They are also going to create a website for students to use to assist them with learning how to read.  The following day, May 29, 2014, they reached two million dollars (double their goal) at 1:15&nbsp;pm.

Normal anatomy: (r) rectum, (a) anal canal <br> B. Recto-rectal intussusception <br> C. Recto-anal intussusception]]\nThe most widely used classification of internal rectal prolapse is according to the height on the rectal/sigmoid wall from which they originate and by whether the intussusceptum remains within the rectum or extends into the [[anal canal]]. The height of intussusception from the anal canal is usually estimated by [[defecography]].<ref name=\"Obstructed defecation web\" />\n\n'''Recto-rectal (high) intussusception''' (intra-rectal intussusception) is where the intussusception starts in the rectum, does not protrude into the anal canal, but stays within the rectum. (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum and does not extend into the anal canal. The intussuscipiens includes rectal lumen distal to the intussusceptum only). These are usually intussusceptions that originate in the upper rectum or lower [[sigmoid colon|sigmoid]].<ref name=\"Obstructed defecation web\" />\n\n'''Recto-anal (low) intussusception''' (intra-anal intussusception) is where the intussusception starts in the rectum and protrudes into the anal canal (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum, and the intussuscipiens includes part of the anal canal)\n\nAn Anatomico-Functional Classification of internal rectal intussusception has been described,<ref name=\"Obstructed defecation web\" /> with the argument that other factors apart from the height of intussusception above the anal canal appear to be important to predict symptomology. The parameters of this classification are anatomic descent, diameter of intussuscepted bowel, associated rectal hyposensitivity and associated delayed colonic transit:\n\n* Type 1: Internal recto-rectal intussusception\n**Type 1W Wide lumen\n**Type 1N Narrowed lumen\n*Type 2: Internal recto-anal intussusception\n**Type 2W Wide Lumen\n**Type 2N Narrowed lumen\n**Type 2M Narrowed internal lumen with associated rectal hyposensitivity or early megarectum\n*Type 3: Internal-external recto-anal intussusception\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n===History===\n\nPatients may have associated gynecological conditions which may require multidisciplinary management.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> History of constipation is important because some of the operations may worsen constipation. Fecal incontinence may also influence the choice of management.\n\n===Physical examination===\nRectal prolapse may be confused easily with prolapsing hemorrhoids.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Mucosal prolapse also differs from prolapsing (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids, where there is a segmental prolapse of the hemorrhoidal tissues at the 3,7 and 11\u2019O clock positions.<ref name=\"Gupta 2006\" /> Mucosal prolapse can be differentiated from a full thickness external rectal prolapse (a complete rectal prolapse) by the orientation of the folds (furrows) in the prolapsed section. In full thickness rectal prolapse, these folds run circumferential.  In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids. Furthermore, in rectal prolapse, there is a sulcus present between the prolapsed bowel and the anal verge, whereas in hemorrhoidal disease there is no sulcus.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Prolapsed, incarcerated hemorrhoids are extremely painful, whereas as long as a rectal prolapse is not strangulated, it gives little pain and is easy to reduce.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nThe prolapse may be obvious, or it may require straining and squatting to produce it.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> The anus is usually patulous, (loose, open) and has reduced resting and squeeze pressures.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Sometimes it is necessary to observe the patient while they strain on a toilet to see the prolapse happen<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> (the perineum can be seen with a mirror or by placing an endoscope in the bowl of the toilet).<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> A phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\nThe perianal skin may be macerated (softening and whitening of skin that is kept constantly wet) and show [[excoriation]].<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n===Proctoscopy/sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy===\nThese may reveal congestion and [[edema]] (swelling) of the distal rectal mucosa,<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> and in 10-15% of cases there may be a solitary rectal ulcer on the anterior rectal wall.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Localized inflammation or ulceration can be biopsied, and may lead to a diagnosis of SRUS or colitis cystica profunda.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Rarely, a [[neoplasia|neoplasm]] (tumour) may form on the leading edge of the intussusceptum. In addition, patients are frequently elderly and therefore have increased incidence of [[colorectal cancer]]. Full length colonoscopy is usually carried out in adults prior to any surgical intervention.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> These investigations may be used with contrast media ([[barium enema]]) which may show the associated mucosal abnormalities.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n===Videodefecography===\nThis investigation is used to diagnose internal intussusception, or demonstrate a suspected external prolapse that could not be produced during the examination.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> It is usually not necessary with obvious external rectal prolapse.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> [[Defecography]] may demonstrate associated conditions like [[cystocele]], vaginal vault prolapse or [[enterocele]].<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n===Colonic transit studies===\n[[Colonic transit studies]] may be used to rule out [[colonic inertia]] if there is a history of severe constipation.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Continent prolapse patients with slow transit constipation, and who are fit for surgery may benefit from subtotal colectomy with rectopexy.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n===Anorectal manometry===\nThis investigation objectively documents the functional status of the sphincters. However, the clinical significance of the findings are disputed by some.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> It may be used to assess for pelvic floor dyssenergia,<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> ([[anismus]] is a contraindication for certain surgeries, e.g. STARR), and these patients may benefit from post-operative [[biofeedback]] therapy. Decreased squeeze and resting pressures are usually the findings, and this may predate the development of the prolapse.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Resting tone is usually preserved in patients with mucosal prolapse.<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> In patients with reduced resting pressure, levatorplasty may be combined with prolapse repair to further improve continence.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n===Anal electromyography/Pudendal nerve testing===\nMay be used to evaluate incontinence, but there is disagreement about what relevance the results may show, as rarely do they mandate a change of surgical plan.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> There may be denervation of striated musculature on the electromyogram.<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> Increased nerve conduction periods (nerve damage), this may be significant in predicting post-operative incontinence.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n==Complete rectal prolapse==\n[[File:Rectal prolaps.jpg|thumbnail|right|A severe example of complete (external) rectal prolapse.

Alternatively, the intussuscepting rectum may lead to chronic stimulation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR - contraction of the external anal sphincter in response to stool in the rectum). The RAIR was shown to be absent or blunted. Squeeze (maximum voluntary contraction) pressures may be affected as well as the resting tone. This is most likely a denervation injury to the external anal sphincter.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\nThe assumed mechanism of [[fecal incontinence]] in rectal prolapse is by the chronic stretch and trauma to the anal sphincters and the presence of a direct conduit (the intussusceptum) connecting rectum to the external environment which is not guarded by the sphincters.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nThe assumed mechanism of obstructed defecation is by disruption to the rectum and anal canal's ability to contract and fully evacuate rectal contents. The intussusceptum itself may mechanically obstruct the rectoanal [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], creating a blockage that straining, anismus and colonic dysmotility exacerbate.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nSome believe that internal rectal intussusception represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse.

This is done through the perineum.

Complications include breakage of the encirclement material, fecal impaction, sepsis, and erosion into the skin or anal canal. Recurrence rates are higher that the other perineal procedures.

This increased pressure causes the anterior portion of the rectal lining to be forced into the anal canal (an [[Rectal prolapse#Internal rectal intussusception|internal rectal intussusception]]). The lining of the rectum is repeatedly damaged by this friction, resulting in [[ulceration]]. SRUS can therefore considered to be a consequence of internal intussusception (a sub type of rectal prolapse), which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases. It may be [[asymptomatic]], but it can cause [[rectal pain]], [[rectal bleeding]], [[rectal malodor]], incomplete evacuation and [[obstructed defecation]] (rectal outlet obstruction).\n\n===Symptoms===\nSymptoms include:<ref name=abid/><ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /><ref name=\"mackle\" />\n* Straining during [[defecation]]\n* Mucous [[rectal discharge]]\n* [[Rectal bleeding]]\n* Sensation of incomplete evacuation ([[Rectal tenesmus|tenesmus]])\n* [[constipation]], or more rarely [[diarrhea]]\n* [[fecal incontinence]] (rarely)\n\n===Prevalence===\nThe condition is thought to be uncommon.

Trauma from hard stools may also contribute.\n\nThe site of the ulcer is typically on the [[anterior]] wall of the [[rectal ampulla]], about 7\u201310&nbsp;cm from the anus.

(i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum and does not extend into the anal canal. The intussuscipiens includes rectal lumen distal to the intussusceptum only).

In full thickness rectal prolapse, these folds run circumferential.  In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids. Furthermore, in rectal prolapse, there is a sulcus present between the prolapsed bowel and the anal verge, whereas in hemorrhoidal disease there is no sulcus.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Prolapsed, incarcerated hemorrhoids are extremely painful, whereas as long as a rectal prolapse is not strangulated, it gives little pain and is easy to reduce.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nThe prolapse may be obvious, or it may require straining and squatting to produce it.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> The anus is usually patulous, (loose, open) and has reduced resting and squeeze pressures.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Sometimes it is necessary to observe the patient while they strain on a toilet to see the prolapse happen<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> (the perineum can be seen with a mirror or by placing an endoscope in the bowl of the toilet).<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> A phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\nThe perianal skin may be macerated (softening and whitening of skin that is kept constantly wet) and show [[excoriation]].<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n===Proctoscopy/sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy===\nThese may reveal congestion and [[edema]] (swelling) of the distal rectal mucosa,<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> and in 10-15% of cases there may be a solitary rectal ulcer on the anterior rectal wall.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Localized inflammation or ulceration can be biopsied, and may lead to a diagnosis of SRUS or colitis cystica profunda.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Rarely, a [[neoplasia|neoplasm]] (tumour) may form on the leading edge of the intussusceptum. In addition, patients are frequently elderly and therefore have increased incidence of [[colorectal cancer]]. Full length colonoscopy is usually carried out in adults prior to any surgical intervention.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> These investigations may be used with contrast media ([[barium enema]]) which may show the associated mucosal abnormalities.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n===Videodefecography===\nThis investigation is used to diagnose internal intussusception, or demonstrate a suspected external prolapse that could not be produced during the examination.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> It is usually not necessary with obvious external rectal prolapse.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> [[Defecography]] may demonstrate associated conditions like [[cystocele]], vaginal vault prolapse or [[enterocele]].<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n===Colonic transit studies===\n[[Colonic transit studies]] may be used to rule out [[colonic inertia]] if there is a history of severe constipation.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Continent prolapse patients with slow transit constipation, and who are fit for surgery may benefit from subtotal colectomy with rectopexy.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n===Anorectal manometry===\nThis investigation objectively documents the functional status of the sphincters.

Some authors suggest that [[pudendal nerve]] damage is the cause for pelvic floor and anal sphincter weakening, and may be the underlying cause of a spectrum of pelvic floor disorders.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nSphincter function in rectal prolapse is almost always reduced.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> This may be the result of direct sphincter injury by chronic stretching of the prolapsing rectum. Alternatively, the intussuscepting rectum may lead to chronic stimulation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR - contraction of the external anal sphincter in response to stool in the rectum). The RAIR was shown to be absent or blunted. Squeeze (maximum voluntary contraction) pressures may be affected as well as the resting tone. This is most likely a denervation injury to the external anal sphincter.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\nThe assumed mechanism of [[fecal incontinence]] in rectal prolapse is by the chronic stretch and trauma to the anal sphincters and the presence of a direct conduit (the intussusceptum) connecting rectum to the external environment which is not guarded by the sphincters.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nThe assumed mechanism of obstructed defecation is by disruption to the rectum and anal canal's ability to contract and fully evacuate rectal contents. The intussusceptum itself may mechanically obstruct the rectoanal [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], creating a blockage that straining, anismus and colonic dysmotility exacerbate.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nSome believe that internal rectal intussusception represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse.

Dietary adjustments, including increasing dietary fiber may be beneficial to reduce constipation, and thereby reduce straining.<ref name=Samson2015 /> A bulk forming agent (e.g. [[psyllium]]) or stool softener can also reduce constipation.<ref name=Samson2015 />\n\n====Surgical====\nSurgery is often required to prevent further damage to the anal sphincters. The goals of surgery are to restore the normal anatomy and to minimize symptoms. There is no globally agreed consensus as to which procedures are more effective,<ref name=Samson2015 /> and there have been over 50 different operations described.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nSurgical approaches in rectal prolapse can be either perineal or abdominal. A perineal approach (or trans-perineal) refers to surgical access to the rectum and sigmoid colon via incision around the anus and [[perineum]] (the area between the genitals and the anus).<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Surgery\">{{cite web|last=Sherk|first=Stephanie Dionne|title=Rectal prolapse repair on Encyclopedia of Surgery|url=http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Pa-St/Rectal-Prolapse-Repair.html#b|publisher=Encyclopedia of Surgery|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> Abdominal approach (trans-abdominal approach) involves the surgeon cutting into the [[abdomen]] and gaining surgical access to the [[pelvic cavity]]. Procedures for rectal prolapse may involve fixation of the bowel (rectopexy), or resection (a portion removed), or both.<ref name=Samson2015 /> Trans-anal (endo-anal) procedures are also described where access to the internal rectum is gained through the anus itself.\n\n=====Abdominal procedures=====\nThe abdominal approach carries a small risk of impotence in males (e.g. 1-2% in abdominal rectopexy).<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Abdominal operations may be open or [[laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopic]] (keyhole surgery).<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\n'''Laparoscopic procedures'''\nRecovery time following laparoscopic surgery is shorter and less painful than following traditional abdominal surgery.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Surgery\" /> Instead of opening the pelvic cavity with a wide incision (laparotomy), a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) and surgical instruments are inserted into the pelvic cavity via small incisions.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Surgery\" /> Rectopexy and anterior resection have been performed laparoscopically with good results.\n\n=====Perineal procedures=====\nThe perineal approach generally results in less post-operative pain and complications, and a reduced length of hospital stay. These procedures generally carry a higher recurrence rate and poorer functional outcome.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> The perineal procedures include perineal rectosigmoidectomy and Delorme repair.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Elderly, or other medically high-risk patients are usually treated by perineal procedures,<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />  as they can be performed under a [[regional anesthesia|regional anesthetic]], or even [[local anesthetic]] with [[intravenous sedation]], thus avoid the risks of a [[general anesthetic]].<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Alternatively, perineal procedures may be selected to reduce risk of nerve damage, for example in young male patients for whom sexual dysfunction may be a major concern.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n'''Perineal rectosigmoidectomy'''\n\nThe goal of Perineal rectosigmoidectomy is to resect, or remove, the redundant bowel. This is done through the perineum. The lower rectum is anchored to the sacrum through fibrosis in order to prevent future prolapse.<ref name=Samson2015 /> The full thickness of the rectal wall is incised at a level just above the dentate line. Redundant rectal and sigmoid wall is removed and the new edge of colon is reconnected (anastomosed) with the anal canal with stitches or staples.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> This procedure may be combined with levatorplasty, to tighten the pelvic muscles.<ref name=Samson2015 /> A combined a perineal proctosigmoidectomy with anterior levatoroplasty is also called an Altemeier procedure.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Levatorplasty is performed to correct elvator diastasis which is commonly associated with rectal prolapse.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Perineal rectosigmoidectomy was first introduced by Mikulicz in 1899, and it remained the preferred treatment in Europe for many years.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> It was Popularized by Altemeier.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> The procedure is simple, safe and effective.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Continence Levatorplasty may enhance restoration of continence (2/3 of patients).<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Complications occur in less than 10% of cases, and include pelvic bleeding, pelvic abscess and anastomotic dehiscence (splitting apart of the stitches inside), bleeding or leak at a dehiscence<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Mortality is low.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Recurrence rates are higher than for abdominal repair,<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> 16-30%, but more recent studies give lower recurrence rates.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Additional levatoroplasty  can reduce recurrence rates to 7%.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\n'''Delorme Procedure'''\n\nThis is a modification of the perineal rectosigmoidectomy, differing in that only the mucosa and submucosa are excised from the prolapsed segment, rather than full thickness resection.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> The prolapse is exposed if it is not already present, and the mucosal and submucosal layers are stripped from the redundant length of bowel. The muscle layer that is left is plicated (folded) and placed as a buttress above the pelvic floor.<ref name=Samson2015 /> The edges of the mucosal are then stitched back together. \"Mucosal proctectomy\" was first discussed by Delorme in 1900,<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> now it is becoming more popular again as it has low morbidity and avoids an abdominal incision, while effectively repairing the prolapse.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> The procedure is ideally suited to those patients with full-thickness prolapse limited to partial circumference (e.g., anterior wall) or less-extensive prolapse (perineal rectosigmoidectomy may be difficult in this situation).<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Fecal incontinence is improved following surgery (40%\u201375% of patients).<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Post operatively, both mean resting and squeeze pressures were increased.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Constipation is improved in 50% of cases,<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> but often urgency and tenesmus are created. Complications, including infection, urinary retention, bleeding, [[anastomosis|anastomotic]] dehiscence (opening of the stitched edges inside), stricture (narrowing of the gut lumen), diarrhea, and fecal impaction occur in 6-32% of cases.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Mortality occurs in 0\u20132.5% cases.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> There is a higher recurrence rate than abdominal approaches (7-26% cases).<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n'''Anal encirclement (Thirsch procedure)'''\n\nThis procedure can be carried out under [[local anaesthetic]]. After reduction of the prolapse, a subcutaneous suture (a stich under the skin) or other material is placed encircling the anus, which is then made taut to prevent further prolapse.<ref name=Samson2015 /> Placing silver wire around the anus first described by Thiersch in 1891.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Materials used include nylon, silk, silastic rods, silicone, Marlex mesh, Mersilene mesh, fascia, tendon, and Dacron.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> This operation does not correct the prolapse itself, it merely supplements the anal sphincter, narrowing the anal canal with the aim of preventing the prolapse from becoming external, meaning it remains in the rectum.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> This goal is achieved in 54-100% cases. Complications include breakage of the encirclement material, fecal impaction, sepsis, and erosion into the skin or anal canal. Recurrence rates are higher that the other perineal procedures. This procedure is most often used for people who have a severe condition or who have a high risk of adverse effects from general anesthetic,<ref name=Samson2015 /> and who may not tolerate other perineal procedures.\n\n==Internal rectal intussusception==\n\n'''Internal rectal intussusception''' (rectal intussusception, internal intussusception, internal rectal prolapse, occult rectal prolapse, internal rectal [[procidentia]] and rectal invagination) is a medical condition defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the [[rectal]] wall that can occur during [[defecation]].<ref name=\"Coloproctology\"/>\n\nThis phenomenon was first described in the late 1960s when [[defecating proctogram|defecography]] was first developed and became widespread.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Degrees of internal intussusception have been demonstrated in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising the possibility that it represents a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.<ref name=\"Shorvon 1989\"/>\n\n===Symptoms===\n\nInternal intussusception may be [[asymptomatic]], but common symptoms include:<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\n* [[Fecal leakage]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Portier|first1=G|author2=Kirzin, S; Cabarrot, P; Queralto, M; Lazorthes, F|title=The effect of abdominal ventral rectopexy on faecal incontinence and constipation in patients with internal intra-anal rectal intussusception.|journal=Colorectal Disease|date=August 2011|volume=13|issue=8|pages=914\u20137|pmid=20497199|doi=10.1111/j.1463-1318.2010.02327.x}}</ref>\n* sensation of [[obstructed defecation]] ([[Rectal tenesmus|tenesmus]]).<ref name=\"Johansson 1985\">{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=C|author2=Ihre, T; Ahlb\u00e4ck, SO|title=Disturbances in the defecation mechanism with special reference to intussusception of the rectum (internal procidentia).|journal=Diseases of the Colon and Rectum|date=December 1985|volume=28|issue=12|pages=920\u20134|pmid=4064851|doi=10.1007/bf02554307}}</ref>\n* Pelvic pain.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n* [[Rectal bleeding]].<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\n'''Recto-rectal''' intussusceptions may be [[asymptomatic]], apart from mild obstructed defecation. \"interrupted defaecation\" in the morning is thought by some to be characteristic.<ref name=\"Obstructed defecation web\" />\n\n'''Recto-anal''' intussusceptions commonly give more severe symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, need for digital evacuation of stool, need for support of the [[perineum]] during defecation, urgency, frequency or intermittent [[fecal incontinence]].<ref name=\"Obstructed defecation web\" />\n\nIt has been observed that intussusceptions of thickness \u22653&nbsp;mm, and those that appear to cause obstruction to rectal evacuation may give clinical symptoms.<ref name=weiss>{{cite journal|last1=Weiss|first1=EG|author2=McLemore, EC|title=Functional disorders: rectoanal intussusception.|journal=Clinics in Colon and Rectal Surgery|date=May 2008|volume=21|issue=2|pages=122\u20138|pmid=20011408|doi=10.1055/s-2008-1075861|pmc=2780198}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dvorkin|first1=LS|author2=Gladman, MA; Epstein, J; Scott, SM; Williams, NS; Lunniss, PJ|title=Rectal intussusception in symptomatic patients is different from that in asymptomatic volunteers.|journal=The British Journal of Surgery|date=July 2005|volume=92|issue=7|pages=866\u201372|pmid=15898121|doi=10.1002/bjs.4912}}</ref>\n\n===Cause===\n\nThere are 2 schools of thought regarding the nature of internal intussusception, viz: whether it is a primary phenomenon, or secondary to (a consequence of) another condition.\n\nSome believe that it represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse.

It includes SRUS, rectal prolapse, proctitis cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps.<ref name=\"nonaka\" /><ref name=\"abid\" /> It is classified as a chronic benign inflammatory disorder. The unifying feature is varying degrees of rectal prolapse, whether internal intussusception (occult prolapse) or external prolapse.\n\n==Pornography==\nRosebud pornography (or rosebudding or rectal prolapse pornography) is an anal sex practice which occurs in some extreme anal pornography wherein a pornographic actor or actress performs a rectal prolapse wherein the walls of the rectum slip out of the anus. A rectal prolapse is a serious medical condition that requires the attention of a medical professional. However, in rosebud pornography it is performed deliberately. Michelle Lhooq, writing for VICE, argues that rosebudding is an example of producers making 'extreme' content due to the easy availability of free pornography on the internet. She also argues that rosebudding is a way for pornographic actors and actresses to distinguish themselves.<ref name=\"VICE1\">{{cite web|last=Lhooq |first=Michelle |url=https://www.vice.com/read/a-rosebud-by-any-other-name-would-smell-like-shit |title=Extreme Anal Porn's Shitty Consequences &#124; VICE &#124; United States |publisher=VICE |date=2014-06-17 |accessdate=2015-02-12}}</ref> Repeated rectal prolapses can cause bowel problems and anal leakage and therefore risk the health of pornographic actors or actresses who participate in them.<ref name=\"VICE1\"/> Lhooq also argues that some who participate in this form of pornography are unaware of the consequences.<ref name=\"VICE1\"/>\n\n==Terminology==\n\nProlapse refers to \"the falling down or slipping of a body part from its usual position or relations\". It is derived from the Latin ''pro-'' - \"forward\" + ''labi'' - \"to slide\". {{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Prolapse}} [[Prolapse]] can refer to many different medical conditions other than rectal prolapse.\n\nprocidentia has a similar meaning to prolapse, referring to \"a sinking or prolapse of an organ or part\". It is derived from the Latin ''procidere'' - \"to fall forward\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Procidentia on the Free Dictionary|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/procidentia|publisher=Farlex Inc.|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> [[Procidentia]] usually refers to [[uterine prolapse]], but rectal procidentia can also be a synonym for rectal prolapse.\n\nIntussusception is defined as [[invagination]] (infolding), especially referring to \"the slipping of a length of intestine into an adjacent portion\". It is derived from the Latin ''intus'' - \"within\" and ''susceptio'' - \"action of undertaking\", from ''suscipere'' - \"to take up\". {{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Intussusception}} Rectal intussusception is not to be confused with other [[intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]]s involving [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] or [[small intestine]], which can sometimes be a medical emergency. Rectal intussusception by contrast is not life-threatening.\n\nIntussusceptum refers to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] section of rectal wall, which telescopes into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] section of [[rectum]] (termed the intussuscipiens).<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> What results is 3 layers of rectal wall overlaid.

During her tenure in Garden City, Mahar was also a summer instructor in library science at three universities: St. John's University Brooklyn, New York, 1948; New York State Teachers College, Geneseo, New York 1949 and 1950; and the School of Library Service, Columbia University, 1952 and 1953.\n\nDuring this same period, Mahar was awarded a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] for 1951-1952 for a study of library services to children and young people in the United Kingdom. Upon her return to the United States in 1952, the American Library Association (ALA) appointed her to serve as its observer at the [[United Nations]].  When she finished that assignment in 1953, she worked for one more year in Garden City as a high school librarian.\n\nIn November 1954, Mahar accepted a position with the ALA as the executive secretary of the American Association of School Libraries (AASL). She stayed until August 1956, when she resigned to accept an appointment as a professor in the Division of Library Education at State University Teachers College, Geneseo, New York.  In her 18-month month tenure at AASL, she was able to encourage school library leaders to look far beyond present circumstances. She helped develop a philosophy of school librarianship that still drives school library media program development today.\n\nMahar believed that the development of good school libraries would come more quickly if the AASL would look beyond the organization and build bridges within the ALA and other professional education organizations. She felt that external relationships would give school librarians an opportunity to represent their field of librarianship and to interpret their work with young people.\n\nIn 1955, Mahar proposed a revision of school library standards, which would eventually be published as the groundbreaking ''Standards for School Library Programs'' (ALA, 1960). She also encouraged the division to take a stand on intellectual freedom and to publish \u201cThe School Library Bill of Rights\u201d (ALA, 1955).\n\nIn November 1956, Mahar resigned her position with the AASL to accept an appointment as professor in the Division of Librarianship at New York Teachers College, Geneseo, New York. Although Mahar had strongly urged the AASL leadership to be more involved with the parent organization, it was the ALA's planned restructuring, to begin in 1957, which partially led to her departure. She also feared a negative impact on the AASL's growth and a loss of autonomy.\n\nIn 1957, Mahar moved to the [[U.S. Office of Education]] (USOE) as Children's Library Specialist in the Division of Library Services. Under the supervision of Nora Beust, she wrote and consulted throughout the country to help state and local education agencies use [[National Defense Education Act]] funds for improving school libraries.\n\nIn 1963, Mahar became coordinator of School Library Services in the Bureau of Educational Research and Development. As opportunities arose for restructuring the unit, she projected a scenario for the future that included more enabling legislation for improving school libraries. She continued to move through the agency in a progression of positions that reflected the changes relating to responsibility for elementary and secondary school libraries.\n\nIn 1966\u20131967, she was appointed chief, School Librarian Section. She was chief, Instructional Resources Branch, 1967\u20131968, and chief, Western Program Operations Branch, 1968\u20131972. In 1972, she assumed the position of chief of the School Media Resources Branch, Office of Libraries and Learning Resources, from which she retired in 1978.\n\nAfter her retirement from the USOE, Mahar turned her attention to the school library needs of the international community. In 1979, the School of Education at the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] awarded her a one-year appointment as a research assistant. She aimed her work primarily at [[United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and the [[World Bank]].<ref name=\"LibBio\" />\n\n==Publications==\nThroughout her experience as a practicing school librarian, Mahar wrote about and implemented of her philosophy of the importance of instructional materials in student learning. Mahar believed that professional librarians must do everything possible to meet individual needs and that the school librarian must eschew a reputation for only organizing, housing, and circulating books. Students and teachers should be able to locate a wide variety of materials organized and available for use in the school library.\n\nMahar's articles of the early 1950s hit on the theses that would drive her career: services and activities in a good school library, organizing all materials in the school library, and the value of school libraries in the learning process.\n\nThroughout her tenure in the USOE, Mahar published annual statistical reports on school and public libraries. She also wrote about current school library issues for he state and national press. Her articles covered the gamut of now-familiar themes: certifying school librarians; evaluating school libraries; cooperative practices between administrators and librarians; public and school library cooperation; promising practices; and state and federal roles for school library development.\n\nIn 1960, Mahar published ''State Department of Education Responsibilities for School Libraries'' (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Office of Education, 1960). The document reported on a study conducted by the Library Services Branch of the USOE, done at the request of the Council of Chief State School Officers.

She aimed her work primarily at [[United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and the [[World Bank]].<ref name=\"LibBio\" />\n\n==Publications==\nThroughout her experience as a practicing school librarian, Mahar wrote about and implemented of her philosophy of the importance of instructional materials in student learning. Mahar believed that professional librarians must do everything possible to meet individual needs and that the school librarian must eschew a reputation for only organizing, housing, and circulating books. Students and teachers should be able to locate a wide variety of materials organized and available for use in the school library.\n\nMahar\u2019s articles of the early 1950s hit on the theses that would drive her career: services and activities in a good school library, organizing all materials in the school library, and the value of school libraries in the learning process.\n\nThroughout her tenure in the USOE, Mahar published annual statistical reports on school and public libraries. She also wrote about current school library issues for he state and national press. Her articles covered the gamut of now-familiar themes: certifying school librarians; evaluating school libraries; cooperative practices between administrators and librarians; public and school library cooperation; promising practices; and state and federal roles for school library development.\n\nIn 1960, Mahar published ''State Department of Education Responsibilities for School Libraries'' (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Office of Education, 1960). The document reported on a study conducted by the Library Services Branch of the USOE, done at the request of the Council of Chief State School Officers. The report set forth the responsibilities and services of school libraries as interpreted by state school systems.<ref name=\"LibBio\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maher, Mary Hellen}}\n[[Category:Writers from Schenectady, New York]]\n[[Category:American librarians]]\n[[Category:Columbia University School of Library Service alumni]]\n[[Category:University at Albany, SUNY alumni]]\n[[Category:1913 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "GoingBatty", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 1 link to disambiguation page -(You can help)-St. John\u2019s University/WP:WCWproject (Spelling and typography)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Hellen_Maher"}

It is held annually, with passenger vehicles (including some motorcycles) being displayed in odd-numbered years in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and commercial vehicles in even-numbered years in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]]. Before 1991, the show was held solely in Frankfurt. For 2021 and beyond, the show will be held in Munich.\n\nThe IAA is organized by the ''[[Verband der Automobilindustrie]]'' (VDA&nbsp;\u2013 Association of the German Automotive Industry) and is scheduled by the [[Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles]]. Formerly, the show in Frankfurt occupied twelve buildings.\n\n==History==\nIn 1897 the first IAA was held at the Hotel Bristol in [[Berlin]], with a total of eight motor vehicles on display.<ref name=1st-iaa>{{cite web|title=IAA: Frankfurt International Car Show|url=http://www.around-germany.com/1655/iaa-frankfurt-international-car-show/|publisher=Around-Germany.com|accessdate=2014-10-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018150648/http://www.around-germany.com/1655/iaa-frankfurt-international-car-show/|archivedate=2014-10-18}}</ref> As the automobile became more known and accepted, the IAA became a fixed event in Germany, with at least one held every year, usually in Berlin. From 1905\u20131907, there were two per year, as the production had increased to an industrial level. In the next years the show was suspended due to the ongoing [[World War I]], and was then reinstated in 1921 with 67 automobile manufacturers displaying 90 vehicles under the motto \"comfort\".\n\nDespite the still perceptible after-effects of the global recession, the 22nd IAA was held in Berlin in 1931, with a total of 295,000 visitors. For the first time the exhibition included [[front-wheel drive]] vehicles. In 1939, the 29th installation of the event gathered a total of 825,000 visitors \u2013 an all-time record at that time. The new [[Volkswagen]] was presented for the first time, which later came to be known as the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]]. This was the last IAA before it was again suspended during [[World War II]], after which Germany and Berlin was divided, with West-Berlin being isolated within Communist East Germany. From 1947\u20131949, West Germany\u2019s automobile and accessories manufacturers took part in the export trade fair in [[Hanover]]. The automobile industry\u2019s hall acted like a magnet on the public, with a great number of visitors coming to the show. In 1951 the show was held on the [[Messe Frankfurt]] for the first time. The event, which was held in April, attracted a total of 570,000 visitors, with exhibits including the first [[Large goods vehicle|HGV]] to have a [[turbo diesel]] engine. Just six months later, in September 1951, a second exhibition in Berlin was held, gathering 290,000 visitors. From then on, the German automobile industry bade farewell to its traditional exhibition site in Berlin and relocated the motor show completely to Frankfurt. The IAA was also rescheduled to only take place every other year.\n\nIn 1989 the last IAA to feature both passenger cars and commercial vehicles in one show confirmed that the exhibition site in Frankfurt was now too small for this major event. Almost 2,000 exhibitors squeezed onto an exhibition site measuring 252,000 square metres. More than 1.2 million visitors attended the event. Because of the high demand, it was no longer possible to meet exhibitors\u2019 requirements for adequate exhibition stands. In view of this, the [[Verband der Automobilindustrie|VDA]] decided to split the IAA from now on, with a focus on passenger vehicles in odd years, and a focus on commercial vehicles in even years. The first IAA focused solely on \"passenger cars\", held in 1991, was a huge success. A total of 1,271 exhibitors from 43 countries displayed their new products and innovations. With more than 935,000 visitors, the IAA Passenger Cars was extremely well attended. In 1992 the first IAA \"commercial vehicles\" took place in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]]. It saw 1,284 exhibitors from 29 countries and gathered 287,000 people, 66 per cent being trade visitors.\n\nIn 2001 the [[September 11 attacks]] on the World Trade Center in New York cast a shadow over the IAA in Frankfurt. The exhibition went ahead all the same. As a mark of solidarity with the victims and their dependants, all show elements and loud music as well as the official opening ceremony with the Federal Chancellor were cancelled. VDA President Gottschalk explained this decision: \"Because we could not permit terrorist forces to take away our freedom of action. And because, as a key international sector, we have a responsibility not to allow things to grind to a halt.\" In an impressive manner, the general public confirmed that this indeed was the right decision to take: More than 800,000 people visited this \"quiet IAA\".\n\nDuring the [[Great Recession]], in 2009, the IAA Cars proved to be a magnet for visitors. Around 850,000 people visited the IAA, which greatly exceeded the target of 750,000. This IAA, which took place under the headline \"A Moving Experience\", showed where the mobility of tomorrow is heading. A huge number of options were presented at the IAA, ranging from the mild hybrid and the plug-in hybrid to the all-electric car, fuel cells and hydrogen power.\n\nIn 2011 the 63rd IAA featured the all-new \"Hall of Electric Mobility\", a first-timer to all Motor Shows worldwide. Additional IAA-premieres included the Electric Mobility Conference as well as the CarIT Conference dealing with the issue of connected driving.\n\n==Change of Venue Location==\n\n2019 marked the final year that IAA hosted its automotive exhibition in Frankfurt.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/nearly-70-years-frankfurt-no-longer-host-iaa-111205931.html |title=After nearly 70 years, Frankfurt will no longer host the IAA motor show |work=Yahoo News |date=30 January 2020}}</ref> In the last several years, more and more manufacturers opted out of IAA or greatly downsized their presences. The marquees that specialise in high performance and luxury vehicles \u2014 such as Aston Martin, Bentley, Bugatti, Ferrari, and Rolls-Royce \u2014 were often the biggest draw at the IAA show, and they were absent from the several previous exhibitions. BMW had downsized its presence from 11,000 to 3,000 square metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gtspirit.com/2019/09/16/iaa-2019-downfall-frankfurt-motor-show/ |title=IAA 2019: The Downfall of the Frankfurt Motor Show |date=16 September 2019 |last=Sellmeyer |first=Des |work=GT Spirit}}</ref> The rapid decreasing number of visitors in the last several exhibitions reflected the appalling state of IAA along with the failure of Messe Frankfurt to contain the aggressive environmental protestors blocking the entrances.  \n\nThus, the contract between Messe Frankfurt and [[Verband_der_Automobilindustrie|VDA]], the IAA organiser, expired in 2019: VDA chose not to renew the contract with Messe Frankfurt, citing the aforementioned reasons. Instead, VDA indicated its intention of moving its biennual automotive exhibitions to other city for 2021 onward. The final three candidate cities were [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Munich]]. Four cities had submitted the bids but didn't make the final round: [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hannover]], and [[Stuttgart]].\n\nOn 3 March 2020 VDA chose [[Munich]].<ref>{{cite web |title=M\u00fcnchen wird die Stadt der neuen IAA 2021 |url=https://www.iaa.de/de/pkw/newsroom/presse/pressemitteilungen/muenchen-wird-die-stadt-der-neuen-iaa-2021 |website=iaa.de |publisher=iaa |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref> Munich beat out Berlin and Hamburg based on three criterias. Munich Airport is second Lufthansa hub and has many direct international flights (second to Frankfurt); Munich is home to BMW and several other high-tech industries such as Apple, Google, and many start-up companies; the city has 130,000 employees working in automobile industry. The [[Alliance_90/The_Greens|Greens]]-led city council and Bavarian state government have given the support along with 2/3 of people responding to the survey. The event will take place shortly before the start of [[Oktoberfest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tz.de/muenchen/muenchen-iaa-internationale-automobil-messe-oktoberfest-flughafen-zr-13571427.html |title=Mega-Coup f\u00fcr M\u00fcnchen fix!

For example, Mercedes-Benz arrived at the show with seven hybrids, including a luxury sedan concept vehicle called the F 700, a {{convert|17|ft|m|adj=on}}-long car that achieves a fuel economy of 44.4 miles per gallon (mpg). The research vehicle features a homogenous charge compression ignition engine, a technology that produces the high fuel economy of a diesel engine from a clean-burning gasoline engine. Mercedes has also mated its clean-diesel engine to an electric motor, creating the [[Bluetec]] hybrid. The company plans to introduce a gasoline-fueled hybrid SUV and sedan in 2009, followed by two Bluetec hybrids in 2010, one of which will achieve 51 miles per gallon of diesel fuel. In addition, the Mercedes Car Group exhibited its smart car in three new incarnations: an electric-only vehicle and both diesel and gasoline versions with \"micro hybrid drive\", a belt-driven starter and alternator that allows the engine to shut off at stops. See the DaimlerChrysler press releases about the auto show and the F700.\n\n[[Opel]], a subsidiary of [[General Motors]], unveiled the [[Opel Flextreme|Flextreme]], a [[plug-in hybrid]] that can travel {{convert|34|mi|km}} on its [[lithium-ion battery]] before a small diesel engine starts charging the battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/10/officially-official-opel-flextreme-concept-40g-km-of-co2-and|title=Officially Official: Opel Flextreme Concept \u2013 40g/km of CO2 and two Segways in the trunk!|publisher=Autoblog.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110210116/http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/10/officially-official-opel-flextreme-concept-40g-km-of-co2-and/|archivedate=2016-01-10}}</ref>  Opel also unveiled the [[Opel Corsa|Corsa Hybrid]], a coupe that combines a belt-driven starter and alternator with a lithium-ion battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/08/22/frankfurt-preview-opel-corsa-hybrid-concept|title=Frankfurt Preview: Opel Corsa Hybrid concept|publisher=Autoblog.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110210116/http://www.autoblog.com/2007/08/22/frankfurt-preview-opel-corsa-hybrid-concept/|archivedate=2016-01-10}}</ref>\n\n[[Volvo Cars]], a division of [[Ford Motor Company]], exhibited a plug-in hybrid with motors in each of the wheels.

It is held annually, with passenger vehicles (including some motorcycles) being displayed in odd-numbered years in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and commercial vehicles in even-numbered years in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]]. Before 1991, the show was held solely in Frankfurt. For 2021 and beyond, the show will be held in Munich.\n\nThe IAA is organized by the ''[[Verband der Automobilindustrie]]'' (VDA&nbsp;\u2013 Association of the German Automotive Industry) and is scheduled by the [[Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles]]. Formerly, the show in Frankfurt occupied twelve buildings.\n\n==History==\nIn 1897 the first IAA was held at the Hotel Bristol in [[Berlin]], with a total of eight motor vehicles on display.<ref name=1st-iaa>{{cite web|title=IAA: Frankfurt International Car Show|url=http://www.around-germany.com/1655/iaa-frankfurt-international-car-show/|publisher=Around-Germany.com|accessdate=2014-10-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018150648/http://www.around-germany.com/1655/iaa-frankfurt-international-car-show/|archivedate=2014-10-18}}</ref> As the automobile became more known and accepted, the IAA became a fixed event in Germany, with at least one held every year, usually in Berlin. From 1905\u20131907, there were two per year, as the production had increased to an industrial level. In the next years the show was suspended due to the ongoing [[World War I]], and was then reinstated in 1921 with 67 automobile manufacturers displaying 90 vehicles under the motto \"comfort\".\n\nDespite the still perceptible after-effects of the global recession, the 22nd IAA was held in Berlin in 1931, with a total of 295,000 visitors. For the first time the exhibition included [[front-wheel drive]] vehicles. In 1939, the 29th installation of the event gathered a total of 825,000 visitors \u2013 an all-time record at that time. The new [[Volkswagen]] was presented for the first time, which later came to be known as the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]]. This was the last IAA before it was again suspended during [[World War II]], after which Germany and Berlin was divided, with West-Berlin being isolated within Communist East Germany. From 1947\u20131949, West Germany\u2019s automobile and accessories manufacturers took part in the export trade fair in [[Hanover]]. The automobile industry\u2019s hall acted like a magnet on the public, with a great number of visitors coming to the show. In 1951 the show was held on the [[Messe Frankfurt]] for the first time. The event, which was held in April, attracted a total of 570,000 visitors, with exhibits including the first [[Large goods vehicle|HGV]] to have a [[turbo diesel]] engine. Just six months later, in September 1951, a second exhibition in Berlin was held, gathering 290,000 visitors. From then on, the German automobile industry bade farewell to its traditional exhibition site in Berlin and relocated the motor show completely to Frankfurt. The IAA was also rescheduled to only take place every other year.\n\nIn 1989 the last IAA to feature both passenger cars and commercial vehicles in one show confirmed that the exhibition site in Frankfurt was now too small for this major event. Almost 2,000 exhibitors squeezed onto an exhibition site measuring 252,000 square metres. More than 1.2 million visitors attended the event. Because of the high demand, it was no longer possible to meet exhibitors\u2019 requirements for adequate exhibition stands. In view of this, the [[Verband der Automobilindustrie|VDA]] decided to split the IAA from now on, with a focus on passenger vehicles in odd years, and a focus on commercial vehicles in even years. The first IAA focused solely on \"passenger cars\", held in 1991, was a huge success. A total of 1,271 exhibitors from 43 countries displayed their new products and innovations. With more than 935,000 visitors, the IAA Passenger Cars was extremely well attended. In 1992 the first IAA \"commercial vehicles\" took place in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]]. It saw 1,284 exhibitors from 29 countries and gathered 287,000 people, 66 per cent being trade visitors.\n\nIn 2001 the [[September 11 attacks]] on the World Trade Center in New York cast a shadow over the IAA in Frankfurt. The exhibition went ahead all the same. As a mark of solidarity with the victims and their dependants, all show elements and loud music as well as the official opening ceremony with the Federal Chancellor were cancelled. VDA President Gottschalk explained this decision: \"Because we could not permit terrorist forces to take away our freedom of action. And because, as a key international sector, we have a responsibility not to allow things to grind to a halt.\" In an impressive manner, the general public confirmed that this indeed was the right decision to take: More than 800,000 people visited this \"quiet IAA\".\n\nDuring the [[Great Recession]], in 2009, the IAA Cars proved to be a magnet for visitors. Around 850,000 people visited the IAA, which greatly exceeded the target of 750,000. This IAA, which took place under the headline \"A Moving Experience\", showed where the mobility of tomorrow is heading. A huge number of options were presented at the IAA, ranging from the mild hybrid and the plug-in hybrid to the all-electric car, fuel cells and hydrogen power.\n\nIn 2011 the 63rd IAA featured the all-new \"Hall of Electric Mobility\", a first-timer to all Motor Shows worldwide. Additional IAA-premieres included the Electric Mobility Conference as well as the CarIT Conference dealing with the issue of connected driving.\n\n==Change of Venue Location==\n\n2019 marked the final year that IAA hosted its automotive exhibition in Frankfurt.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/nearly-70-years-frankfurt-no-longer-host-iaa-111205931.html |title=After nearly 70 years, Frankfurt will no longer host the IAA motor show |work=Yahoo News |date=30 January 2020}}</ref> In the last several years, more and more manufacturers opted out of IAA or greatly downsized their presences. The marquees that specialise in high performance and luxury vehicles \u2014 such as Aston Martin, Bentley, Bugatti, Ferrari, and Rolls-Royce \u2014 were often the biggest draw at the IAA show, and they were absent from the several previous exhibitions. BMW had downsized its presence from 11,000 to 3,000 square metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gtspirit.com/2019/09/16/iaa-2019-downfall-frankfurt-motor-show/ |title=IAA 2019: The Downfall of the Frankfurt Motor Show |date=16 September 2019 |last=Sellmeyer |first=Des |work=GT Spirit}}</ref> The rapid decreasing number of visitors in the last several exhibitions reflected the appalling state of IAA along with the failure of Messe Frankfurt to contain the aggressive environmental protestors blocking the entrances.  \n\nThus, the contract between Messe Frankfurt and [[Verband_der_Automobilindustrie|VDA]], the IAA organiser, expired in 2019: VDA chose not to renew the contract with Messe Frankfurt, citing the aforementioned reasons. Instead, VDA indicated its intention of moving its biennual automotive exhibitions to other city for 2021 onward. The final three candidate cities were [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Munich]]. Four cities had submitted the bids but didn't make the final round: [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hannover]], and [[Stuttgart]].\n\nOn 3 March 2020 VDA chose [[Munich]].<ref>{{cite web |title=M\u00fcnchen wird die Stadt der neuen IAA 2021 |url=https://www.iaa.de/de/pkw/newsroom/presse/pressemitteilungen/muenchen-wird-die-stadt-der-neuen-iaa-2021 |website=iaa.de |publisher=iaa |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref> Munich beat out Berlin and Hamburg based on three criterias. Munich Airport is second Lufthansa hub and has many direct international flights (second to Frankfurt); Munich is home to BMW and several other high-tech industries such as Apple, Google, and many start-up companies; the city has 130,000 employees working in automobile industry. The [[Alliance_90/The_Greens|Greens]]-led city council and Bavarian state government have given the support along with 2/3 of people responding to the survey. The event will take place shortly before the start of [[Oktoberfest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tz.de/muenchen/muenchen-iaa-internationale-automobil-messe-oktoberfest-flughafen-zr-13571427.html |title=Mega-Coup f\u00fcr M\u00fcnchen fix!

For example, Mercedes-Benz arrived at the show with seven hybrids, including a luxury sedan concept vehicle called the F 700, a {{convert|17|ft|m|adj=on}}-long car that achieves a fuel economy of 44.4 miles per gallon (mpg). The research vehicle features a homogenous charge compression ignition engine, a technology that produces the high fuel economy of a diesel engine from a clean-burning gasoline engine. Mercedes has also mated its clean-diesel engine to an electric motor, creating the [[Bluetec]] hybrid. The company plans to introduce a gasoline-fueled hybrid SUV and sedan in 2009, followed by two Bluetec hybrids in 2010, one of which will achieve 51 miles per gallon of diesel fuel. In addition, the Mercedes Car Group exhibited its smart car in three new incarnations: an electric-only vehicle and both diesel and gasoline versions with \"micro hybrid drive\", a belt-driven starter and alternator that allows the engine to shut off at stops. See the DaimlerChrysler press releases about the auto show and the F700.\n\n[[Opel]], a subsidiary of [[General Motors]], unveiled the [[Opel Flextreme|Flextreme]], a [[plug-in hybrid]] that can travel {{convert|34|mi|km}} on its [[lithium-ion battery]] before a small diesel engine starts charging the battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/10/officially-official-opel-flextreme-concept-40g-km-of-co2-and|title=Officially Official: Opel Flextreme Concept \u2013 40g/km of CO2 and two Segways in the trunk!|publisher=Autoblog.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110210116/http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/10/officially-official-opel-flextreme-concept-40g-km-of-co2-and/|archivedate=2016-01-10}}</ref>  Opel also unveiled the [[Opel Corsa|Corsa Hybrid]], a coupe that combines a belt-driven starter and alternator with a lithium-ion battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/08/22/frankfurt-preview-opel-corsa-hybrid-concept|title=Frankfurt Preview: Opel Corsa Hybrid concept|publisher=Autoblog.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110210116/http://www.autoblog.com/2007/08/22/frankfurt-preview-opel-corsa-hybrid-concept/|archivedate=2016-01-10}}</ref>\n\n[[Volvo Cars]], a division of [[Ford Motor Company]], exhibited a plug-in hybrid with motors in each of the wheels.
