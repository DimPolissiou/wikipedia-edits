The first and last control points are always the end points of the curve; however, the intermediate control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve. The sums in the following sections are to be understood as [[Affine space#Affine combinations and barycenter|affine combinations]], the coefficients sum to 1.\n\n===Linear B\u00e9zier curves===\nGiven distinct points '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, a linear B\u00e9zier curve is simply a [[straight line]] between those two points. The curve is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{B}(t)=\\mathbf{P}_0 + t(\\mathbf{P}_1-\\mathbf{P}_0)=(1-t)\\mathbf{P}_0 + t\\mathbf{P}_1 \\mbox{ , } 0 \\le t \\le 1</math>\nand is equivalent to [[linear interpolation]].\n\n===Quadratic B\u00e9zier curves===\n[[File:Quadratic Beziers in string art.svg|thumb|upright|Quadratic B\u00e9ziers in [[string art]]: The end points ('''&bull;''') and control point ('''&times;''') define the quadratic B\u00e9zier curve ('''\u22ef''').]]\nA quadratic B\u00e9zier curve is the path traced by the function '''B'''(''t''), given points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, and '''P'''<sub>2</sub>,\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}(t) = (1 - t)[(1 - t) \\mathbf P_0 + t \\mathbf P_1] + t [(1 - t) \\mathbf P_1 + t \\mathbf P_2] \\mbox{ , } 0 \\le t \\le 1</math>,\n\nwhich can be interpreted as the linear interpolant of corresponding points on the linear B\u00e9zier curves from '''P'''<sub>0</sub> to '''P'''<sub>1</sub> and from '''P'''<sub>1</sub> to '''P'''<sub>2</sub> respectively. Rearranging the preceding equation yields:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}(t) = (1 - t)^{2}\\mathbf{P}_0 + 2(1 - t)t\\mathbf{P}_1 + t^{2}\\mathbf{P}_2 \\mbox{ , } 0 \\le t \\le 1.</math>\n\nThis can be written in a way that highlights the symmetry with respect to '''P'''<sub>1</sub>:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\mathbf{P}_1+(1 - t)^{2}(\\mathbf{P}_0 - \\mathbf{P}_1) + t^{2}(\\mathbf{P}_2-\\mathbf{P}_1) \\mbox{ , } 0 \\le t \\le 1.</math>\n\nWhich immediately gives the derivative of the B\u00e9zier curve with respect to ''t'':\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}'(t) = 2 (1 - t) (\\mathbf{P}_1 - \\mathbf{P}_0) + 2 t (\\mathbf{P}_2 - \\mathbf{P}_1) \\,.</math>\n\nfrom which it can be concluded that the tangents to the curve at '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and '''P'''<sub>2</sub> intersect at '''P'''<sub>1</sub>. As ''t'' increases from 0 to 1, the curve departs from '''P'''<sub>0</sub> in the direction of '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, then bends to arrive at '''P'''<sub>2</sub> from the direction of '''P'''<sub>1</sub>.\n\nThe second derivative of the B\u00e9zier curve with respect to ''t'' is\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}''(t) = 2(\\mathbf{P}_2 - 2 \\mathbf{P}_1 + \\mathbf{P}_0) \\,.</math>\n\n===Cubic B\u00e9zier curves===\nFour points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, '''P'''<sub>2</sub> and '''P'''<sub>3</sub> in the plane or in higher-dimensional space define a cubic B\u00e9zier curve.\nThe curve starts at '''P'''<sub>0</sub> going toward '''P'''<sub>1</sub> and arrives at '''P'''<sub>3</sub> coming from the direction of '''P'''<sub>2</sub>. Usually, it will not pass through '''P'''<sub>1</sub> or '''P'''<sub>2</sub>; these points are only there to provide directional information. The distance between '''P'''<sub>1</sub> and '''P'''<sub>2</sub> determines \"how far\" and \"how fast\" the curve moves towards '''P'''<sub>1</sub> before turning towards '''P'''<sub>2</sub>.\n\nWriting '''B'''<sub>'''P'''<sub>i</sub>,'''P'''<sub>j</sub>,'''P'''<sub>k</sub></sub>(''t'') for the quadratic B\u00e9zier curve defined by points '''P'''<sub>i</sub>, '''P'''<sub>j</sub>, and '''P'''<sub>k</sub>, the cubic B\u00e9zier curve can be defined as an affine combination of two quadratic B\u00e9zier curves:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{B}(t)=(1-t)\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathbf P_0,\\mathbf P_1,\\mathbf P_2}(t) + t \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathbf P_1,\\mathbf P_2,\\mathbf P_3}(t) \\mbox{ , } 0 \\le t \\le 1.</math>\n\nThe explicit form of the curve is:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{B}(t)=(1-t)^3\\mathbf{P}_0+3(1-t)^2t\\mathbf{P}_1+3(1-t)t^2\\mathbf{P}_2+t^3\\mathbf{P}_3 \\mbox{ , } 0 \\le t \\le 1.</math>\n\nFor some choices of '''P'''<sub>1</sub> and '''P'''<sub>2</sub> the curve may intersect itself, or contain a [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp]].\n\nAny series of 4 distinct points can be converted to a cubic B\u00e9zier curve that goes through all 4 points in order.\nGiven the starting and ending point of some cubic B\u00e9zier curve, and the points along the curve corresponding to ''t'' = 1/3 and ''t'' = 2/3, the control points for the original B\u00e9zier curve can be recovered.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Burkardt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225210855/http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/html/bezier_interpolation.html |url=http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/html/bezier_interpolation.html |title=Forcing Bezier Interpolation |archive-date=2013-12-25}}</ref>\n\nThe derivative of the cubic B\u00e9zier curve with respect to ''t'' is\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}'(t) = 3(1-t)^2(\\mathbf{P}_1 - \\mathbf{P}_0) + 6(1-t)t(\\mathbf{P}_2 - \\mathbf{P}_1) + 3t^2(\\mathbf{P}_3 - \\mathbf{P}_2) \\,.</math>\n\nThe second derivative of the B\u00e9zier curve with respect to ''t'' is\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}''(t) = 6(1-t)(\\mathbf{P}_2 - 2 \\mathbf{P}_1 + \\mathbf{P}_0) + 6t(\\mathbf{P}_3 - 2 \\mathbf{P}_2 + \\mathbf{P}_1) \\,.</math>\n\n==General definition==\nB\u00e9zier curves can be defined for any degree ''n''.\n\n===Recursive definition===\nA recursive definition for the B\u00e9zier curve of degree ''n'' expresses it as a point-to-point [[linear combination]] ([[linear interpolation]]) of a pair of corresponding points in two B\u00e9zier curves of degree ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n\nLet <math>\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathbf{P}_0\\mathbf{P}_1\\ldots\\mathbf{P}_n}</math> denote the B\u00e9zier curve determined by any selection of points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, '''P'''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;'''P'''<sub>''n''</sub>.

We have\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^n b_{i, n}(t)\\mathbf{P}_i,\\quad 0 \\le t \\le 1</math>\n\nwhere the polynomials\n\n:<math>b_{i,n}(t) = {n\\choose i} t^i (1 - t)^{n - i},\\quad i = 0, \\ldots, n</math>\n\nare known as [[Bernstein polynomial|Bernstein basis polynomials]] of degree ''n''.\n\nNote that ''t''<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''t'')<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, and that the [[binomial coefficient]], <math>\\scriptstyle {n \\choose i}</math>, is:\n\n:<math>{n \\choose i} = \\frac{n!}{i!(n - i)!}</math>\n\nThe points '''P'''<sub>''i''</sub> are called ''control points'' for the B\u00e9zier curve. The [[polygon]] formed by connecting the B\u00e9zier points with [[line (mathematics)|lines]], starting with '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and finishing with '''P'''<sub>''n''</sub>, is called the ''B\u00e9zier polygon'' (or ''control polygon''). The [[convex hull]] of the B\u00e9zier polygon contains the B\u00e9zier curve.\n\n===Polynomial form===\nSometimes it is desirable to express the B\u00e9zier curve as a [[polynomial]] instead of a sum of less straightforward [[Bernstein polynomial]]s. Application of the [[binomial theorem]] to the definition of the curve followed by some rearrangement will yield:\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\sum_{j = 0}^n {t^j \\mathbf{C}_j}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{C}_j = \\frac{n!}{(n - j)!} \\sum_{i = 0}^j \\frac{(-1)^{i + j} \\mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!} =\n\\prod_{m = 0}^{j - 1} (n - m) \\sum_{i = 0}^j \\frac{(-1)^{i + j} \\mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!}\n.</math>\n\nThis could be practical if <math>\\mathbf{C}_j</math> can be computed prior to many evaluations of <math>\\mathbf{B}(t)</math>; however one should use caution as high order curves may lack [[numeric stability]] ([[de Casteljau's algorithm]] should be used if this occurs). Note that the [[empty product]] is 1.\n\n===Properties===\n[[File:quadratic_to_cubic_Bezier_curve.svg|thumb|upright|A cubic B\u00e9zier curve (yellow) can be made identical to a quadratic one (black) by\n<div style=\"margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em\">1.

As the curve is completely contained in the [[convex hull]] of its [[Control point (mathematics)|control points]], the points can be graphically displayed and used to manipulate the curve intuitively. [[Affine transformation]]s such as [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] can be applied on the curve by applying the respective transform on the control points of the curve.\n\n[[Quadratic function|Quadratic]] and [[Cubic function|cubic]] B\u00e9zier curves are most common. Higher degree curves are more [[computationally expensive]] to evaluate. When more complex shapes are needed, low order B\u00e9zier curves are patched together, producing a [[composite B\u00e9zier curve]]. A composite B\u00e9zier curve is commonly referred to as a \"path\" in [[vector graphics]] languages (like [[PostScript]]), vector graphics standards (like [[SVG]]) and vector graphics programs (like [[Artline (program)|Artline]]<!-- 1990 -->, [[Timeworks Publisher]]<!-- early 1990s -->, [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[CorelDraw]], [[Inkscape]], and [[Allegro (software library)|Allegro]]). In order to make composite B\u00e9zier curves appear smooth (which is generally desirable), it suffices to force the control point at which two constituent B\u00e9zier curves meet to lie on the line defined by the two control points on either side. This guarantees that the resulting curve is G1 continuous.\n\nThe simplest method for scan converting ([[Rasterisation|rasterizing]]) a B\u00e9zier curve is to evaluate it at many closely spaced points and scan convert the approximating sequence of line segments. However, this does not guarantee that the rasterized output looks sufficiently smooth, because the points may be spaced too far apart. Conversely it may generate too many points in areas where the curve is close to linear. A common adaptive method is recursive subdivision, in which a curve's control points are checked to see if the curve approximates a straight line to within a small tolerance. If not, the curve is subdivided parametrically into two segments, 0 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 0.5 and 0.5 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 1, and the same procedure is applied recursively to each half. There are also forward differencing methods, but great care must be taken to analyse error propagation.<ref name=\"Xuexiang\"/>\n\nAnalytical methods where a B\u00e9zier is intersected with each scan line involve finding roots of cubic polynomials (for cubic B\u00e9ziers) and dealing with multiple roots, so they are not often used in practice.<ref name=\"Xuexiang\">{{cite web |title=Complex Quadratic B\u00e9zier Curve on Unit Circle |author1=Xuexiang Li |last-author-amp=yes |author2=Junxiao Xue |publisher=School of Software, Zhengzhou University |location=Zhengzhou, China |url=https://www.atlantis-press.com/php/download_paper.php?id=12403}}</ref>\n\nThe rasterisation algorithm used in [[Metafont]] is based on discretising the curve, so that it is approximated by a sequence of \"[[rook (chess)|rook]] moves\" that are purely vertical or purely horizontal, along the pixel boundaries. To that end, the plane is first split into eight 45\u00b0 sectors (by the coordinate axes and the two lines <math> y = \\pm x </math>), then the curve is decomposed into smaller segments such that the ''direction'' of a curve segment stays within one sector; since the curve velocity is a second degree polynomial, finding the <math>t</math> values where it is parallel to one of these lines can be done by solving quadratic equations. Within each segment, either horizontal or vertical movement dominates, and the total number of steps in either direction can be read off from the endpoint coordinates; in for example the 0\u201345\u00b0 sector horizontal movement to the right dominates, so it only remains to decide between which steps to the right the curve should make a step up.<ref>Parts 19\u201322 of {{cite book |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald E. |author-link=Donald Knuth |title=Metafont: The Program |date=1986 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-13438-1}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\nIn animation applications, such as [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Synfig]], B\u00e9zier curves are used to outline, for example, movement.

This is inefficient as there exists also approximations of all B\u00e9zier curves using arcs of circles or ellipses, which can be rendered incrementally with arbitrary precision. Another approach, used by modern hardware graphics adapters with accelerated geometry, can convert exactly all B\u00e9zier and conic curves (or surfaces) into [[non-uniform rational B-spline|NURBS]], that can be rendered incrementally without first splitting the curve recursively to reach the necessary flatness condition. This approach also allows preserving the curve definition under all linear or perspective 2D and 3D transforms and projections.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nFont engines, like [[FreeType]], draw the font's curves (and lines) on a pixellated surface using a process known as [[font rasterization]].<ref name=freetype>{{cite web |title=FreeType Glyph Conventions / VI.

The first and last control points are always the end points of the curve; however, the intermediate control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve. The sums in the following sections are to be understood as [[Affine space#Affine combinations and barycenter|affine combinations]], the coefficients sum to 1.\n\n===Linear B\u00e9zier curves===\nGiven distinct points '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, a linear B\u00e9zier curve is simply a [[straight line]] between those two points.

The [[polygon]] formed by connecting the B\u00e9zier points with [[line (mathematics)|lines]], starting with '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and finishing with '''P'''<sub>''n''</sub>, is called the ''B\u00e9zier polygon'' (or ''control polygon''). The [[convex hull]] of the B\u00e9zier polygon contains the B\u00e9zier curve.\n\n===Polynomial form===\nSometimes it is desirable to express the B\u00e9zier curve as a [[polynomial]] instead of a sum of less straightforward [[Bernstein polynomial]]s. Application of the [[binomial theorem]] to the definition of the curve followed by some rearrangement will yield:\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\sum_{j = 0}^n {t^j \\mathbf{C}_j}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{C}_j = \\frac{n!}{(n - j)!} \\sum_{i = 0}^j \\frac{(-1)^{i + j} \\mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!} =\n\\prod_{m = 0}^{j - 1} (n - m) \\sum_{i = 0}^j \\frac{(-1)^{i + j} \\mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!}\n.</math>\n\nThis could be practical if <math>\\mathbf{C}_j</math> can be computed prior to many evaluations of <math>\\mathbf{B}(t)</math>; however one should use caution as high order curves may lack [[numeric stability]] ([[de Casteljau's algorithm]] should be used if this occurs). Note that the [[empty product]] is 1.\n\n===Properties===\n[[File:quadratic_to_cubic_Bezier_curve.svg|thumb|upright|A cubic B\u00e9zier curve (yellow) can be made identical to a quadratic one (black) by\n<div style=\"margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em\">1.

As the curve is completely contained in the [[convex hull]] of its [[Control point (mathematics)|control points]], the points can be graphically displayed and used to manipulate the curve intuitively. [[Affine transformation]]s such as [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] can be applied on the curve by applying the respective transform on the control points of the curve.\n\n[[Quadratic function|Quadratic]] and [[Cubic function|cubic]] B\u00e9zier curves are most common. Higher degree curves are more [[computationally expensive]] to evaluate. When more complex shapes are needed, low order B\u00e9zier curves are patched together, producing a [[composite B\u00e9zier curve]]. A composite B\u00e9zier curve is commonly referred to as a \"path\" in [[vector graphics]] languages (like [[PostScript]]), vector graphics standards (like [[SVG]]) and vector graphics programs (like [[Artline (program)|Artline]]<!-- 1990 -->, [[Timeworks Publisher]]<!-- early 1990s -->, [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[CorelDraw]], [[Inkscape]], and [[Allegro (software library)|Allegro]]). In order to make composite B\u00e9zier curves appear smooth (which is generally desirable), it suffices to force the control point at which two constituent B\u00e9zier curves meet to lie on the line defined by the two control points on either side. This guarantees that the resulting curve is G1 continuous, meaning that the first derivative is continuous everywhere.\n\nThe simplest method for scan converting ([[Rasterisation|rasterizing]]) a B\u00e9zier curve is to evaluate it at many closely spaced points and scan convert the approximating sequence of line segments. However, this does not guarantee that the rasterized output looks sufficiently smooth, because the points may be spaced too far apart. Conversely it may generate too many points in areas where the curve is close to linear. A common adaptive method is recursive subdivision, in which a curve's control points are checked to see if the curve approximates a straight line to within a small tolerance. If not, the curve is subdivided parametrically into two segments, 0 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 0.5 and 0.5 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 1, and the same procedure is applied recursively to each half. There are also forward differencing methods, but great care must be taken to analyse error propagation.<ref name=\"Xuexiang\"/>\n\nAnalytical methods where a B\u00e9zier is intersected with each scan line involve finding roots of cubic polynomials (for cubic B\u00e9ziers) and dealing with multiple roots, so they are not often used in practice.<ref name=\"Xuexiang\">{{cite web |title=Complex Quadratic B\u00e9zier Curve on Unit Circle |author1=Xuexiang Li |last-author-amp=yes |author2=Junxiao Xue |publisher=School of Software, Zhengzhou University |location=Zhengzhou, China |url=https://www.atlantis-press.com/php/download_paper.php?id=12403}}</ref>\n\nThe rasterisation algorithm used in [[Metafont]] is based on discretising the curve, so that it is approximated by a sequence of \"[[rook (chess)|rook]] moves\" that are purely vertical or purely horizontal, along the pixel boundaries. To that end, the plane is first split into eight 45\u00b0 sectors (by the coordinate axes and the two lines <math> y = \\pm x </math>), then the curve is decomposed into smaller segments such that the ''direction'' of a curve segment stays within one sector; since the curve velocity is a second degree polynomial, finding the <math>t</math> values where it is parallel to one of these lines can be done by solving quadratic equations. Within each segment, either horizontal or vertical movement dominates, and the total number of steps in either direction can be read off from the endpoint coordinates; in for example the 0\u201345\u00b0 sector horizontal movement to the right dominates, so it only remains to decide between which steps to the right the curve should make a step up.<ref>Parts 19\u201322 of {{cite book |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald E. |author-link=Donald Knuth |title=Metafont: The Program |date=1986 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-13438-1}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\nIn animation applications, such as [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Synfig]], B\u00e9zier curves are used to outline, for example, movement.

The \"smooth curve\" feature of charts in [[Microsoft Excel]] also uses this algorithm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xlrotor.com/resources/files.shtml |title=smooth_curve_bezier_example_file.xls |website=Rotating Machinery Analysis, Inc. |accessdate=2011-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718131613/http://www.xlrotor.com/resources/files.shtml |archivedate=2011-07-18 }}</ref>\n\nBecause arcs of circles and ellipses cannot be exactly represented by B\u00e9zier curves, they are first approximated by B\u00e9zier curves, which are in turn approximated by arcs of circles. This is inefficient as there exists also approximations of all B\u00e9zier curves using arcs of circles or ellipses, which can be rendered incrementally with arbitrary precision. Another approach, used by modern hardware graphics adapters with accelerated geometry, can convert exactly all B\u00e9zier and conic curves (or surfaces) into [[non-uniform rational B-spline|NURBS]], that can be rendered incrementally without first splitting the curve recursively to reach the necessary flatness condition. This approach also allows preserving the curve definition under all linear or perspective 2D and 3D transforms and projections.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nFont engines, like [[FreeType]], draw the font's curves (and lines) on a pixellated surface using a process known as [[font rasterization]].<ref name=freetype>{{cite web |title=FreeType Glyph Conventions / VI.

At the time the people were suffering from several years of potato famine. The notices of ejection were served on the tenants on 15 May, 1849. They asked for a delay in order to use their cattle and other effects to their best advantage, but were given no answer. Many of them were soon turned out of their houses and their property seized. It was now the month of July and far too late for them to set out for Canada as the cold winter would be setting in when they arrived, with no means to provide against it and therefore they rebelled. As a result the principal Sheriff-Substitute by the surname of Colqhoun along with his officers and a strong body of police left [[Inverness]] and headed for Sollas on North Uist to eject the tenants from their homes. As the tenant's homes were demolished they began to throw stones at the men carrying out this work who were then driven from the houses and had to retire behind the police for shelter. Volleys of stones and other missiles followed. The police then charged at them in two divisions and there were some cuts and bruises on both sides, but the demolition work then went on uninterrupted. Among the incidents of eviction mentioned by historian [[Alexander Mackenzie (historian)|Alexander Mackenzie]] was that of an old woman who attacked an officer with her stick, knocking off his hat, but he was then carried out by two police officers.

Adams and Joe Ksander. The film stars the voices of [[John Krasinski]], [[Charlyne Yi]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[David Cross]] and [[Constance Wu]]. It tells the story of Mai Su, a lonely rebellious teenage girl living in a world where sentient robot technology is commonplace, and 7723, a top-secret weaponized robot, who, through a chance encounter, meet each other and form an unlikely bond that they must use to stop a vicious threat. The film was released on [[Netflix]] on September 7, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=September 2018}}\nIn the futuristic city of Grainland where robots are ubiquitous, the father of a girl named Mai leaves for losing his job. Some time later, she and her mother Molly attend a product launch at IQ Robotics headquarters. Mai, annoyed at Molly's ignorance of her, wanders off and stumbles upon the secret lab of Dr. Tanner Rice, who's been working on an attack robot called 7723. Mai accidentally activates 7723, before being apprehended by security and returned to her mother. At the launch, Justin Pin, CEO of IQ Robotics, unveils the next generation of Q-Bots to the public with the promise to put \"one in every home\", however he has secretly designed the Q-Bots to explode. Meanwhile, 7723 leaves the lab to find Mai, but causes a high-speed pursuit on an elevated freeway. The situation escalates when he uses his weapon systems, making the police forces respond with deadly force. Falling into the lowest levels of the city, he awakens later to find the fall damaged his memory core, preventing him from keeping memories in the long term.\n\nThe next day at school, Mai is beaten up by an athletic group of bullies with Q-Bots. Mai comes home with a [[black eye]] much to Molly's shock, but the two's strained relationship prevents any meaningful discussion, and so Mai runs to her room. Later that night when Mai goes outside to check on her foulmouthed dog, Momo, she finds 7723 in her backyard. She initially tries to dismiss him, but impressed by his weapons system, she allows him to stay in the shed.\n\nWith 7723 at her side, Mai confronts the bullies, and they flee after 7723 destroys one of their Q-Bots. The two then embark on a montage of shenanigans throughout the city, but as 7723 accumulates more memories, he struggles to decide which to keep. When Mai confronts him about it, he reveals if he reaches full capacity, he will undergo a total system reset, losing all his memories in the process. Mai suggests deleting his core systems to make room, but he warns that he would lose functionality.\n\n7723 becomes apprehensive about using his abilities despite Mai's orders, who has become power-crazy, and refuses to blast Mai's school bully leader when she orders her hurt, so Mai injures the bully using her bat. He subsequently deletes his weapon system to save his memories and prevent himself from hurting any more people, and promises Mai to never let her down again: but is unknowingly seen by Molly's Q-Bot, allowing Dr. Rice to find him, and he goes to Mai's home to [[Disk_formatting|format]] 7723's memory and take him away. While explaining he built 7723 to prevent an upcoming crisis, Pin and his bodyguard robot Ares arrive. When Pin reveals his plan of killing people, a fight erupts, but without his weapons, 7723 cannot stop Pin from kidnapping Molly and flees with Mai and Momo into the sewers. Mai snaps at 7723 for deleting his weapon systems and not saving her mother. \n\nStorming off to IQ Robotics to rescue her, she is quickly apprehended, but 7723 arrives and the two make up in the heat of the battle. They find Dr. Rice, who warns them of Ares, but before he can say much more, Pin appears and vaporizes him, but Mai has noticed that Pin's mannerisms are mimicking Ares', and the resulting battle is taken to a nearby sports stadium, where the truth is eventually and publicly revealed: Ares had killed Pin and has been using a bionic skeleton in his body. When Pin created Ares, he told him to make the world \"perfect\", which Ares believes will only happen through humanity's extinction. With his plans exposed, Ares arms the Q-Bots and merges with a powerful assault armor to overpower 7723, while Mai rescues Molly and evacuates the stadium, but is captured by Ares' Pin body. Unable to fend off Ares, 7723 makes the decision to reboot himself, restoring his weapons and beginning the process of wiping his memories. Saving Mai, he shares one last goodbye with her before battling Ares on equal footing. After an arduous battle, his system reboot completes before he can neutralize an immobilized Ares, becoming inert. Ares attempts to use his now-weakened Pin body to destroy the vulnerable 7723, but Mai stops him by swiping Ares' head off. 7723 re-activates but fails to recognize Mai.\n\nAs everything finally returns to normal, Mai begins making new memories with 7723, and even regain pieces of his old ones, and both are accepted by the community.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[John Krasinski]] as 7723 (credited as \"Project 77\")\n* [[Charlyne Yi]] as Mai Su,<ref group=Note>Pronounced like \"May\".</ref> Molly's daughter\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Justin Pin / Ares\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Momo, Mai's foulmouthed dog, which 7723 uses a translator to understand him\n* [[David Cross]] as Dr. Tanner Rice / Q-Bots \n* [[Constance Wu]] as Molly Su, Mai's mom\n* [[Kiana Brown|Kiana Led\u00e9]] as Greenwood\n* [[Anna Akana]] as Ani, Mai's friend\n* Kitana Turnbull as RJ \n* [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] as Junior \n* [[Issac Ryan Brown]] as Ric\n* [[Betsy Sodaro]] as Gate\n* [[Fred Tatasciore]] as Police Robots / Robot Podium / Announcer\n\n==Production==\n\n''Next Gen'' is a Canadian-American-Chinese co-production.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Amid |first1=Amidi |title=A behind the scenes look at the art of netflix's 'next gen' |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-art-of-netflixs-next-gen-exclusive-gallery-163673.html |agency=Cartoonbrew |publisher=Cartoonbrew}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that [[Netflix]] had purchased worldwide rights to ''Next Gen'', an [[animated film]] directed by Kevin R.

The series is centered around five young [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] insects who live in an overgrown suburban backyard and learn life lessons while having adventures. Wakely acquired worldwide rights from [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] to a catalogue of music by [[the Beatles]] to feature in the series. The program features versions of songs by the popular rock group, performed by contemporary recording artists and interwoven into the narrative.\n\n''Beat Bugs'' was produced in association with [[Beyond International Group|Beyond Entertainment]], [[Atomic Cartoons]] and the [[Seven Network]], an investor of the program. The series was first made available worldwide on Netflix on 3 August 2016 after premiering in Australia exclusively on [[7TWO]] on 25 July 2016. It also airs on the CBC Kids programing block of [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]].\n\nThe program received an [[AWGIE Awards|AWGIE Award]] in animation for an episode script in 2016, an [[AACTA Awards|AACTA Award]] for Best Children's Television Series and a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] in 2017. The second season premiered in November 2016 on Netflix and 7TWO, and was followed by a 48-minute special in November 2017. Additional episodes entered pre-production in 2018. A staged production featuring the characters and themes of the show, ''Beat Bugs: A Musical Adventure'', began playing in theaters in the U.S. in October 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n''Beat Bugs'' is a series aimed at five to seven year olds, set in an overgrown suburban backyard, which serves as an environment that five young bug friends regularly explore.<ref name=\"theaustralian\"/><ref name=\"atomiccartoons\"/> To the bugs, the backyard is known as \"Village Green\".

Grace: A Storytelling Company and [[Thunderbird Films|Thunderbird Entertainment]]. The series is centered around five young [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] insects who live in an overgrown suburban backyard and learn life lessons while having adventures. Wakely acquired worldwide rights from [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] to a catalogue of music by [[the Beatles]] to feature in the series. The program features versions of songs by the popular rock group, performed by contemporary recording artists and interwoven into the narrative.\n\n''Beat Bugs'' was produced in association with [[Beyond International Group|Beyond Entertainment]], [[Atomic Cartoons]] and the [[Seven Network]], an investor of the program. The series was first made available worldwide on Netflix on 3 August 2016 after premiering in Australia exclusively on [[7TWO]] on 25 July 2016. It also airs on the CBC Kids programing block of [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]].\n\nThe program received an [[AWGIE Awards|AWGIE Award]] in animation for an episode script in 2016, an [[AACTA Awards|AACTA Award]] for Best Children's Television Series and a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] in 2017. The second season premiered in November 2016 on Netflix and 7TWO, and was followed by a 48-minute special in November 2017. Additional episodes entered pre-production in 2018. A staged production featuring the characters and themes of the show, ''Beat Bugs: A Musical Adventure'', began playing in theaters in the U.S. in October 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n''Beat Bugs'' is a series aimed at five to seven year olds, set in an overgrown suburban backyard, which serves as an environment that five young bug friends regularly explore.<ref name=\"theaustralian\"/><ref name=\"atomiccartoons\"/> To the bugs, the backyard is known as \"Village Green\".

In 2008, ESPN's ''[[College GameDay (football)|College Gameday]]'' broadcast from [[Downtown Atlanta]], while ESPN corporate sponsors and local Atlanta-based companies featured prominent displays at Fanzones in Atlanta's [[Centennial Olympic Park]].<ref name=\"sportsbusinessjournal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/59825|title='Kickoff' aims for college football spotlight|work=sportsbusinessjournal.com}}</ref>\n\nPayout to each team depends on the amount of revenue gained in excess of the Kickoff's $5.5 million budget. In 2008, Clemson and Alabama were both expected to receive more than $2 million.<ref name=\"sportsbusinessjournal.com\" />\n\n=== Series summary ===\nThe first game, known that year as the Chick-fil-A College Kickoff, was played on August 30, 2008, the opening Saturday of the [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2008 season]]. [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] defeated [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]] 34\u201310.\n\nAlabama returned to the Chick-fil-A Kickoff for the 2009 game, defeating [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]] to begin the [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009 season]].\n\n[[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] and [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] were initially slated to play in 2010, but Auburn officials later backed out of the offer. ABC attempted to replace Auburn with [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]], but the switch prompted UCLA to opt out entirely because the game would essentially be a home game for the Atlanta-based Yellow Jackets, with no scheduled return trip to [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/auburnbeat/2009/04/auburnucla_game_in_2010_nixed.html|title=Auburn-UCLA game in 2010 nixed|work=AL.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bruinsnation.com/2009/4/28/857192/auburn-ad-jay-jacobs-is-under|title=Auburn A.D.

The 2010 game also saw the introduction of a trophy awarded to the winner, the Old Leather Helmet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chick-fil-akickoffgame.com/FANCENTRAL/TheOldLeatherHelmet/tabid/152/Default.aspx|title=A College Football Celebration|work=Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140220230834/http://www.chick-fil-akickoffgame.com/FANCENTRAL/TheOldLeatherHelmet/tabid/152/Default.aspx|archivedate=February 20, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe 2011 edition was the first Chick-fil-A Kickoff to feature a team that was not a member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] or [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]], the two conferences with tie-ins to the [[Peach Bowl|Chick-fil-A Bowl]]. [[Boise State Broncos football|Boise State]] of the [[Mountain West Conference]], one of the most successful programs from a BCS non-automatic qualifier conference in recent years, defeated [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] 35\u201321.\n\nThe Chick-fil-A Kickoff consisted of two games in 2012. [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] defeated [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State]] 35\u201321 on Friday night prior to Clemson defeating Auburn 26\u201319 in the headliner on Saturday. The dual-game idea was first mentioned in the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' in May 2010, when Gary Stokan, president of the Chick-Fil-A Bowl, told the newspaper that there was the possibility of having Alabama face [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] in a rematch of the [[1993 Sugar Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college/2010/05/alabama-vs-miami-to-open-2012-in-atlanta.html|title=College Gridiron 365 \u2013 Football Blog \u2013 Orlando Sentinel|work=orlandosentinel.com|access-date=May 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510163458/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college/2010/05/alabama-vs-miami-to-open-2012-in-atlanta.html|archive-date=May 10, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe 2013 edition was a rematch of the 2009 game. Alabama, the two-time defending [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] national champions, once again defeated Virginia Tech, this time by a score of 35\u201310.\n\n2014 would again feature two games. [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]] defeated Boise State 35\u201313 in a Thursday night game. Alabama would defeat [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] 33\u201323 in the headliner on Saturday afternoon. It marked the first ever meeting between Alabama and West Virginia in any sport. \n\nThe 2015 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, which moved to [[CBS Sports|CBS]] that season, returned to a single game with the ACC's [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville Cardinals]] taking on the SEC's Auburn Tigers. Auburn defeated Louisville, 31\u201324.\n\nThe 2016 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, which moved back to ESPN, featured North Carolina and Georgia, both making their second appearances in the kickoff series. The Bulldogs defeated the Tar Heels 33\u201324 in the final edition of the game played the Georgia Dome.\n\nThe 2017 event was the third doubleheader in the series. Alabama defeated [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] on Saturday evening by a score of 24\u20137, serving as the ''[[Saturday Night Football]]'' season opener.  Tennessee defeated Georgia Tech 42\u201341 in double overtime on Monday evening.  The two games were the first in the series to be played in the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Downtown Atlanta.\n\n==Game results ==\n{| class=wikitable\n! Season !!

In 2008, ESPN's ''[[College GameDay (football)|College Gameday]]'' broadcast from [[Downtown Atlanta]], while ESPN corporate sponsors and local Atlanta-based companies featured prominent displays at Fanzones in Atlanta's [[Centennial Olympic Park]].<ref name=\"sportsbusinessjournal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/59825|title='Kickoff' aims for college football spotlight|work=sportsbusinessjournal.com}}</ref>\n\nPayout to each team depends on the amount of revenue gained in excess of the Kickoff's $5.5 million budget. In 2008, Clemson and Alabama were both expected to receive more than $2 million.<ref name=\"sportsbusinessjournal.com\" />\n\n=== Series summary ===\nThe first game, known that year as the Chick-fil-A College Kickoff, was played on August 30, 2008, the opening Saturday of the [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2008 season]]. [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] defeated [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]] 34\u201310.\n\nAlabama returned to the Chick-fil-A Kickoff for the 2009 game, defeating [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]] to begin the [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009 season]].\n\n[[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] and [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] were initially slated to play in 2010, but Auburn officials later backed out of the offer. ABC attempted to replace Auburn with [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]], but the switch prompted UCLA to opt out entirely because the game would essentially be a home game for the Atlanta-based Yellow Jackets, with no scheduled return trip to [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/auburnbeat/2009/04/auburnucla_game_in_2010_nixed.html|title=Auburn-UCLA game in 2010 nixed|work=AL.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bruinsnation.com/2009/4/28/857192/auburn-ad-jay-jacobs-is-under|title=Auburn A.D.

The 2010 game also saw the introduction of a trophy awarded to the winner, the Old Leather Helmet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chick-fil-akickoffgame.com/FANCENTRAL/TheOldLeatherHelmet/tabid/152/Default.aspx|title=A College Football Celebration|work=Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140220230834/http://www.chick-fil-akickoffgame.com/FANCENTRAL/TheOldLeatherHelmet/tabid/152/Default.aspx|archivedate=February 20, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe 2011 edition was the first Chick-fil-A Kickoff to feature a team that was not a member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] or [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]], the two conferences with tie-ins to the [[Peach Bowl|Chick-fil-A Bowl]]. [[Boise State Broncos football|Boise State]] of the [[Mountain West Conference]], one of the most successful programs from a BCS non-automatic qualifier conference in recent years, defeated [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] 35\u201321.\n\nThe Chick-fil-A Kickoff consisted of two games in 2012. [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] defeated [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State]] 35\u201321 on Friday night prior to Clemson defeating Auburn 26\u201319 in the headliner on Saturday. The dual-game idea was first mentioned in the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' in May 2010, when Gary Stokan, president of the Chick-Fil-A Bowl, told the newspaper that there was the possibility of having Alabama face [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] in a rematch of the [[1993 Sugar Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college/2010/05/alabama-vs-miami-to-open-2012-in-atlanta.html|title=College Gridiron 365 \u2013 Football Blog \u2013 Orlando Sentinel|work=orlandosentinel.com|access-date=May 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510163458/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college/2010/05/alabama-vs-miami-to-open-2012-in-atlanta.html|archive-date=May 10, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe 2013 edition was a rematch of the 2009 game. Alabama, the two-time defending [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] national champions, once again defeated Virginia Tech, this time by a score of 35\u201310.\n\n2014 would again feature two games. [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]] defeated Boise State 35\u201313 in a Thursday night game. Alabama would defeat [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] 33\u201323 in the headliner on Saturday afternoon. It marked the first ever meeting between Alabama and West Virginia in any sport. \n\nThe 2015 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, which moved to [[CBS Sports|CBS]] that season, returned to a single game with the ACC's [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville Cardinals]] taking on the SEC's Auburn Tigers. Auburn defeated Louisville, 31\u201324.\n\nThe 2016 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, which moved back to ESPN, featured North Carolina and Georgia, both making their second appearances in the kickoff series. The Bulldogs defeated the Tar Heels 33\u201324 in the final edition of the game played the Georgia Dome.\n\nThe 2017 event was the third doubleheader in the series. Alabama defeated [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] on Saturday evening by a score of 24\u20137, serving as the ''[[Saturday Night Football]]'' season opener.  Tennessee defeated Georgia Tech 42\u201341 in double overtime on Monday evening.  The two games were the first in the series to be played in the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Downtown Atlanta.\n\n==Game results ==\n{| class=wikitable\n! Season !!
