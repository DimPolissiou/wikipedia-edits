The character is created by  novelist [[Robert Ludlum]]. He first appeared in the novel ''[[The Bourne Identity (novel)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (1980), which was [[The Bourne Identity (1988 film)|adapted for television]] in 1988. The novel was adapted into a [[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|feature film of the same name]] in 2002 and starred [[Matt Damon]] in the lead role.\n\nThe character originally featured in three novels by Ludlum, released between 1980 and 1990, followed by eleven novels written by [[Eric Van Lustbader]] since 2004. Along with the first feature film, Jason Bourne also appears in three sequel movies ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' (2004),  ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007), and ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'' (2016), with Damon again in the lead role.

Before the events in ''The Bourne Identity'', Webb had a Thai wife named Dao and two children named Joshua and Alyssa in [[Phnom Penh]].  Webb's wife and two children were inadvertently killed during the [[Vietnam War]] when a fighter plane strayed into Cambodia, dropped two [[bomb]]s, and strafed a spot near the [[Mekong River]]. However, unknown to Bourne, Joshua survived.<ref>Lustbader, Eric Van. ''The Bourne Legacy''. St. Martin's Press, 2004.</ref> Due to Cambodia's [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in the war, every nation disclaimed the plane, and, therefore, no one took responsibility for the incident. Infuriated by both the utter injustice and randomness of his loss, Webb went to [[Saigon]] and, under the careful guidance of friend and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Alexander Conklin, ended up training for an elite Top Secret Special Forces unit called \"Medusa\". Within that select organization Webb was known only by his code name, \"Delta One\".\n\n=== Medusa ===\nAn assassination team or [[death squad]], \"Medusa\" was created to infiltrate [[Northern Vietnam]] and assassinate members of the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|Viet Cong]] and its collaborators. Its members were criminals; its leader, a man called Delta, ran \"Medusa\" with an iron fist. He became well known for his ruthlessness, his disregard for orders, and his disturbing success rate on his missions, resulting in the kidnapping of Webb's brother, U.S. Army Lieutenant Gordon Webb, during his tour of duty in Saigon.\n\nDuring the mission to save David Webb's brother, an original \"Medusa\" team member named \"Jason Charles Bourne\" was discovered to be a double agent who alerted a large number of North Vietnamese soldiers to their whereabouts. When Delta found Bourne after killing his way through the North Vietnamese, he simply killed Bourne in the jungles of Tam Quan. Bourne's murder was never exposed due to the Top Secret status of \"Medusa\".\n\n=== Operation Treadstone ===\nYears later, a [[black ops]] arm of the CIA was formed to eliminate the notorious [[Carlos the Jackal]] and called \"Treadstone Seventy-One\", named after a building on New York's Seventy-First Street, and Webb was called up by the creator of Treadstone and Medusa, David Abbott, who was nicknamed \"The Monk\" (short for \"The Silent Monk of Covert Operations\") to be its principal agent.  At this point, Webb (Delta) takes the identity of Jason Bourne due to the actual Bourne's status as MIA in the war as well as the fact that Bourne was in reality a ruthless killer with a long criminal record. The point of all this was to turn Jason Bourne into something more than he really was, a contract assassin who would be known all over the world for terminating the lives of just about anyone. The assassin's alias was \"Cain\". The reasoning for creating such a myth was to create competition for the well-known assassin named \"Carlos\", or \"Carlos the Jackal\" (real name [[Ilich Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez]]) who at that time was considered the world's best and most famous assassin. The name Cain was chosen because it had some significance for what he was doing. During Vietnam, Cain was used instead of Charlie in the [[ICAO spelling alphabet|phonetic alphabet]] (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot...) because Charlie became synonymous with Viet Cong. So Delta dropped back one letter to Cain, which stood for Charlie. In Spanish, Charlie is Carlos; Carlos was Venezuelan. The myth of Cain was created by having Cain take credit for any well-publicized killings that took place in Asia, and later in Europe, regardless of the circumstances. By creating this myth, Cain was to drive the reclusive Carlos out in the open \"long enough to put a bullet in his head\". To add insult to Carlos's name, Cain stole the credit for Carlos's kills, even when Cain had no part in them.\n\n== Film backstory ==\nIn the film series, Jason Bourne was born as David Webb on September 13, 1970 in [[Nixa, Missouri]] (although in ''Ultimatum'', he was given a false date of April 15, 1971, as a coded reference to a specific site). He joined the [[United States Army]] and was eventually selected for [[Delta Force]] in 1998. His father, Richard Webb, a senior [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst, created the Treadstone program, a black ops project intended to train and deploy elite assassins. He was monitored by the CIA, which murdered his father with a car bomb in [[Beirut]] in a bid to recruit Webb.\n\nThe ploy worked; Webb approached the CIA and was brought into the program by Neil Daniels, a supervisor in the Treadstone program, and was monitored by Dr. Albert Hirsch, who supervised the medical assessment of the Treadstone agents. He was brought into a secret recruitment center in [[New York City]], where Hirsch ordered him tortured for days \u2014 via [[waterboarding]] and sleep deprivation \u2014 to break his spirit and allow him to be molded into an assassin. He was officially accepted when he murdered an unidentified man (implied to be the real Jason Bourne) without questioning. After that, he was given a new identity as Jason Bourne, and his birth identity was dropped.\n\nAfter heavy training, in which he learned several languages and mastered several martial arts skills, Bourne was placed in the Treadstone program, whose missions were run by the CIA's Alexander Conklin. His first assignment, an unofficial one, was in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]], where he assassinated Vladimir Neski, a [[Russian people|Russian]] politician who was intending to expose the theft of $20 million in black funds stolen from the CIA by Treadstone's Director, Ward Abbott, and a Russian oligarch, Yuri Gretkov. Under Conklin's orders, Bourne murdered Neski and his wife and arranged it as a murder-suicide.\n\nBourne worked in the program for three years, during which he was considered its top agent because he could adapt to his surroundings, think laterally, and execute assassinations that looked like accidents. He was stationed in [[Paris|Paris, France]], maintaining a secluded life while performing assassinations, mostly around Europe. His official handler was a logistics agent, Nicky Parsons, also stationed in Paris, with whom he was implied to have some sort of a romantic relationship kept secret from his Treadstone employers.\n\nThe turning point in his life came when he was ordered to murder Nykwana Wombosi, an exiled African warlord who was blackmailing the CIA into reinstating him as head of his state, lest he expose several CIA secrets. Using an alias, John Michael Kane, Bourne gathered information on Wombosi. He infiltrated the warlord's yacht and hid inside it for five days, surfacing on a cold night in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, intending to arrange the murder to look like he was killed by a crew member to avoid suspicion. However, Wombosi was surrounded by his children, and Bourne was unable to bring himself to kill him. He tried to abandon the mission by leaving the boat, but an unknown shooter shot him twice in the back, sending him off the yacht into the sea and triggering amnesia, causing Webb / Bourne to forget his identity.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Novels ===\n\nThe series has included fourteen novels which have been written by two authors, [[Robert Ludlum]] and [[Eric Van Lustbader]]. Ludlum's series include the first three books, dubbed the [[Bourne (novel series)|Bourne trilogy]]. After Ludlum's death in 2001, Lustbader took over the character in his own series of novels, which span eleven books so far, with a twelfth (''The Bourne Nemesis'') currently being completed.\n\n==== Written by Robert Ludlum ====\n\n===== ''The Bourne Identity'' (1980) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Identity (novel)}}\n\nA man is found floating unconscious in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] near [[Marseille]] by Italian fishermen with two gunshot wounds in his back. He wakes and discovers he is suffering from [[Psychogenic amnesia|extreme memory loss]]. Film negative embedded in his hip leads him to a bank in Zurich where he learns he is known by the name Jason Bourne. As he tries to reclaim his memory, Bourne attracts the attention of hostile people for reasons unknown to him. At a hotel, while cornered, Bourne takes a young woman, Marie St. Jacques, hostage to escape. Marie is an employee of the [[Government of Canada]]. Bourne and Marie discover that \"Jason Bourne\" is the cover identity of a contract assassin, and that both the CIA and another contract killer known as [[Carlos the Jackal]] have an interest in him. Marie is convinced that this man she has come to know cannot be the ruthless killer that all their discoveries seem to imply. She compels Bourne to continue searching for his true identity and, in the end, he finds the truth. Through this time, Bourne has the phrase \"Cain is for Charlie, and Delta is for Cain\" continually flash through his mind, propelling him in the direction of his mission.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Supremacy'' (1986) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Supremacy}}\n\nHaving recovered his memory and retired from the CIA, David Webb now teaches Asian studies at a university in Maine and lives with Marie. She is taken captive seemingly by a powerful Chinese [[drug lord]], but in reality, by the United States government using the fictitious drug lord as cover. The scheme is an attempt to turn Webb back into his former self, the mythical Jason Bourne, to go after a Bourne impostor in China. The phony Bourne has been credited with a Far East political assassination that could, in a worst-case scenario, cause a Chinese [[civil war]] over the ownership of [[Hong Kong]].\n\n===== ''The Bourne Ultimatum'' (1990) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Ultimatum}}\n\nAs Carlos the Jackal enters old age and his infamy fades, he decides that he will do two things before he dies: kill Jason Bourne and destroy the [[KGB]] facility of Novgorod, where the Jackal was trained and later turned away. Webb's family is forced to hide in the Caribbean while Webb himself works with old friend and CIA officer Alex Conklin to hunt down and kill the Jackal first. Webb poses as an important member of Medusa, now a nearly omnipotent economic force that controls the commander of [[NATO]], leading figures in the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]], and large [[NYSE]] firms. The plan is to use Medusa's resources to contact the Jackal. Webb just misses the Jackal several times before Webb feigns his own death and convinces the Jackal that he has succeeded. Following this, the Jackal turns to his second goal. Webb tracks the Jackal down with the help of Conklin and a KGB agent as the Jackal begins destroying the KGB compound. In a final confrontation, the Jackal is led into a dam lock in which he drowns and Webb returns to his family.\n\n==== Written by Eric Van Lustbader ====\n\n===== ''The Bourne Legacy'' (2004) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Legacy (novel)}}\n\nWith the climactic events of ''The Bourne Ultimatum'' behind him, Jason Bourne is able to once again become David Webb, now professor of linguistics at Georgetown University. However, this serenity does not last for long. When a silenced gunshot narrowly misses Webb's head, the Bourne persona reawakens in him. His first objective is to reach his long-time friend and handler at the CIA, Alex Conklin. However, unknown to Bourne, a Hungarian by the name of Stepan Spalko has now drawn Jason into a web\u2014one which he cannot escape as easily as his professional fa\u00e7ade. And the man who nearly killed him in Georgetown continues his deadly, intensely personal pursuit.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Betrayal'' (2007) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Betrayal}}\n\nJason Bourne takes a mission to rescue his only friend in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], Martin Lindros, who disappeared in [[Africa]] while tracking shipments of [[uranium]]. Once safely back in America, Lindros persuades Bourne to help track the money trail of [[terrorists]] buying the nuclear material in [[Odessa]]. But once there, Bourne is hampered by confusing flashbacks of unfamiliar places and events and he wonders if someone is brainwashing him in order to throw him off the trail, or worse, if the man he saved in Africa is really Martin Lindros. Now, Bourne must gather evidence while trying to stay one step ahead of the terrorists who won't let anyone stand in their way.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Sanction'' (2008) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Sanction}}\n\nJason Bourne returns to [[Georgetown University]], and the mild world of his alter ego, David Webb, hoping for normality. But, after so many adrenaline-soaked years of risking his life, Bourne finds himself chafing under the quiet life of a linguistics professor. Aware of his frustrations, his academic mentor, Professor Spector, asks for help investigating the murder of a former student. The young man died carrying information about a group's terrorist activities, including an immediate plan to attack the United States. The organization, the Black Legion, and its plot have also popped up on the radar of the Central Intelligence Agency, whose new director Veronica Hart is struggling to assert her authority. Sensing an opportunity to take control of the CIA by showing Hart's incompetence, National Security Agency operatives attempt to accomplish what the CIA never could do, hunt down and kill Jason Bourne. In Europe, Bourne's investigation into the Black Legion turns into one of the deadliest and most tangled operations of his double life\u2014while an assassin is getting closer by the minute.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Deception'' (2009) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Deception}}\n\nBourne's nemesis, Arkadin, is still hot on his trail, and the two continue their struggle, reversing roles of hunter and hunted. When Bourne is ambushed and badly wounded, he fakes his death and goes into hiding. In safety, he takes on a new identity, and begins a mission to find out who tried to assassinate him. Jason begins to question who he really is, how much of him is tied up in the Bourne identity, and what he would become if that was suddenly taken away from him. Meanwhile, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt by what seems to be an Iranian missile. A massive global investigative team is assembled to get at the truth of the situation before it can escalate into an international scandal. Bourne's search for the man who shot him intersects with the search for the people who brought down the airliner, leading Bourne into one of the most deadly and challenging situations he has ever encountered. With the threat of a new world war brewing, Bourne finds himself in a race against time to uncover the truth and find the person behind his assault, all the while being stalked by his unknown nemesis.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Objective'' (2010) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Objective}}\n\n''The Bourne Objective'' is the eighth novel in the Bourne series, and the fifth written by Eric Van Lustbader. The book was released in 2010, sequel to ''The Bourne Deception''.\nThe killing of an art dealer dredges up snatches of Jason Bourne's impaired memory, in particular the murder of a young woman who entrusted him with a strangely engraved ring. Now he's determined to find its owner and purpose. But Bourne never knows what terrible acts he'll discover he committed when he digs into the past.\nThe trail will lead him to a vicious Russian mercenary, Leonid Arkadin, also a graduate of the Central Intelligence training program Treadstone. The covert course was shuttered by Congress for corruption, but not before it produced Bourne and Arkadin, giving them equal skills, equal force, and equal cunning.\nAs Bourne's destiny circles closer to Arkadin's, it becomes clear that someone else has been watching and manipulating them.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Dominion'' (2011) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Dominion}}\n\nJason Bourne is searching for an elusive cadre of terrorists planning to destroy America's most strategic natural resources\u2014and needs the help of his longtime friend, General Boris Karpov. Karpov, the newly appointed head of Russia's most feared spy agency, FSB-2, is one of the most determined, honorable, and justice-hungry men that Bourne knows. But Karpov has made a deal with the devil. In order to remain the head of FSB-2, he must hunt down and kill Bourne. Now, these two trusted friends are on a deadly collision course. From the Colombian highlands to [[Munich]], [[C\u00e1diz]], and [[Damascus]], the clock is counting down to a disaster that will cripple America's economic and military future. Only Bourne and Karpov have a chance to avert the catastrophe\u2014but if they destroy each other first, that chance will be gone forever.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Imperative'' (2012) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Imperative}}\n\nThe tenth book in the series was published on June 5, 2012. The man Jason Bourne fished out of the freezing sea is near death, half-drowned and bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound. He awakens with no memory of who he is or why he was shot, and Bourne is eerily reminded of his own amnesia. Then Bourne discovers that the Mossad agent named Rebeka is so determined to find this injured man that she has gone off the grid, cut her ties to her agency, and is now being stalked by Mossad's most feared killer. The answers to these mysteries may lie back in southeast Lebanon, in a secret encampment to which Bourne and Rebeka escaped following a firefight weeks ago. The complex trail links to the mission given to Treadstone directors Peter Marks and Soraya Moore: find the semi-mythic terrorist assassin known as Nicodemo. In the course of Bourne's desperate, deadly search for a secret that will alter the future of the entire world, he will experience both triumph and loss, and his life will never be the same. Now everything turns on the amnesiac. Bourne must learn his identity and purpose before both he and Rebeka are killed. From [[Stockholm]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], from [[Mexico City]] to [[Beijing]], the web of lies and betrayals extends into a worldwide conspiracy of monumental proportions.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Retribution'' (2013) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Retribution}}\n\nThe eleventh book in the series was published on December 3, 2013. Bourne's friend Eli Yadin, head of Mossad, learns that Ouyang Jidan, a senior member of China's Politburo, and a major Mexican drug lord may have been trafficking in more than drugs.

Bourne is determined to avenge her death, but in the process he becomes enmeshed in a monstrous worldwide scheme involving the Chinese, Mexicans, and Russians. Bourne's desperate search for Ouyang takes him from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Shanghai]], [[Mexico City]], and, ultimately, a village on China's coast where a clever trap has been laid for him. Bourne finds himself pursued on all sides and unsure whom he can trust.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Ascendancy'' (2014) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Ascendancy}}\n\nThe twelfth book in the Bourne series was published on June 10, 2014. Bourne has been hired to impersonate a high-level government minister at a political summit meeting in Qatar, shielding the minister from any assassination attempts.

Six highly skilled field agents have disappeared, the body parts of three found in a national park in Georgia. Facing death and destruction in the shadows of civilisation, Bourne will battle his deadliest nemesis yet.\n\n=== Television ===\n\nIn 1988, a [[The Bourne Identity (1988 film)|two-part made-for-television movie of ''The Bourne Identity'']] aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  It starred [[Richard Chamberlain]] as Jason Bourne and [[Jaclyn Smith]] as Marie St. Jacques.  The TV movie was largely faithful to Robert Ludlum's novel, both in plot as well as in the portrayal of the character of Jason Bourne.\n\nA spin-off of the Universal-produced film franchise entitled ''[[Treadstone]]'' began airing in October 2019 on [[USA Network]]. It explores the origins of the Treadstone program and operatives other than Bourne. Producer Ben Smith, who worked on the recent two ''Bourne'' films, said the show will tie into the next film in the franchise.<ref>https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481543/another-bourne-movie-is-in-the-works-and-itll-tie-into-the-treadstone-tv-show</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\n{{Main|Bourne (film series)}}\n[[File:Matt Damon TIFF 2015.jpg|thumb|Actor Matt Damon, who portrays Jason Bourne in the film series]]\nThe Jason Bourne novels were adapted into a series of films \u2013 ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (2002), ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' (2004), ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007), ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]'' (2012), and ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'' (2016). The films retain the titles and some base elements but otherwise feature different plots independent of the novels. In these films, Bourne is portrayed by [[Matt Damon]].\n\nBourne does not appear in ''The Bourne Legacy'', with the exception of his picture being featured in the film as well as brief discussions of how he's caused problems to the organization he worked for. As  a result, the film focuses on the fallout in the intelligence community from Bourne's actions in ''Ultimatum''. ''Legacy'' features [[Jeremy Renner]] as Aaron Cross, an operative in a different clandestine program evolved from Treadstone.\n\n=== Video games ===\n\nA video game titled ''[[Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy]]'' was released in 2008 for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]].\n\nThe Ludlum estate obtained the rights to the video game franchise and sold it to [[Electronic Arts]] in 2009.

He first appeared in the novel ''[[The Bourne Identity (novel)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (1980), which was [[The Bourne Identity (1988 film)|adapted for television]] in 1988. The novel was adapted into a [[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|feature film of the same name]] in 2002 and starred [[Matt Damon]] in the lead role.\n\nThe character originally featured in three novels by Ludlum, released between 1980 and 1990, followed by eleven novels written by [[Eric Van Lustbader]] since 2004. Along with the first feature film, Jason Bourne also appears in three sequel movies ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' (2004),  ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007), and ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'' (2016), with Damon again in the lead role.

Before the events in ''The Bourne Identity'', Webb had a Thai wife named Dao and two children named Joshua and Alyssa in [[Phnom Penh]].  Webb's wife and two children were inadvertently killed during the [[Vietnam War]] when a fighter plane strayed into Cambodia, dropped two [[bomb]]s, and strafed a spot near the [[Mekong River]]. However, unknown to Bourne, Joshua survived.<ref>Lustbader, Eric Van. ''The Bourne Legacy''. St. Martin's Press, 2004.</ref> Due to Cambodia's [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in the war, every nation disclaimed the plane, and, therefore, no one took responsibility for the incident. Infuriated by both the utter injustice and randomness of his loss, Webb went to [[Saigon]] and, under the careful guidance of friend and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Alexander Conklin, ended up training for an elite Top Secret Special Forces unit called \"Medusa\". Within that select organization Webb was known only by his code name, \"Delta One\".\n\n=== Medusa ===\nAn assassination team or [[death squad]], \"Medusa\" was created to infiltrate [[Northern Vietnam]] and assassinate members of the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|Viet Cong]] and its collaborators. Its members were criminals; its leader, a man called Delta, ran \"Medusa\" with an iron fist. He became well known for his ruthlessness, his disregard for orders, and his disturbing success rate on his missions, resulting in the kidnapping of Webb's brother, U.S. Army Lieutenant Gordon Webb, during his tour of duty in Saigon.\n\nDuring the mission to save David Webb's brother, an original \"Medusa\" team member named \"Jason Charles Bourne\" was discovered to be a double agent who alerted a large number of North Vietnamese soldiers to their whereabouts. When Delta found Bourne after killing his way through the North Vietnamese, he simply killed Bourne in the jungles of Tam Quan. Bourne's murder was never exposed due to the Top Secret status of \"Medusa\".\n\n=== Operation Treadstone ===\nYears later, a [[black ops]] arm of the CIA was formed to eliminate the notorious [[Carlos the Jackal]] and called \"Treadstone Seventy-One\", named after a building on New York's Seventy-First Street, and Webb was called up by the creator of Treadstone and Medusa, David Abbott, who was nicknamed \"The Monk\" (short for \"The Silent Monk of Covert Operations\") to be its principal agent.  At this point, Webb (Delta) takes the identity of Jason Bourne due to the actual Bourne's status as MIA in the war as well as the fact that Bourne was in reality a ruthless killer with a long criminal record. The point of all this was to turn Jason Bourne into something more than he really was, a contract assassin who would be known all over the world for terminating the lives of just about anyone. The assassin's alias was \"Cain\". The reasoning for creating such a myth was to create competition for the well-known assassin named \"Carlos\", or \"Carlos the Jackal\" (real name [[Ilich Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez]]) who at that time was considered the world's best and most famous assassin. The name Cain was chosen because it had some significance for what he was doing. During Vietnam, Cain was used instead of Charlie in the [[ICAO spelling alphabet|phonetic alphabet]] (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot...) because Charlie became synonymous with Viet Cong. So Delta dropped back one letter to Cain, which stood for Charlie. In Spanish, Charlie is Carlos; Carlos was Venezuelan. The myth of Cain was created by having Cain take credit for any well-publicized killings that took place in Asia, and later in Europe, regardless of the circumstances. By creating this myth, Cain was to drive the reclusive Carlos out in the open \"long enough to put a bullet in his head\". To add insult to Carlos's name, Cain stole the credit for Carlos's kills, even when Cain had no part in them.\n\n== Film backstory ==\nIn the film series, Jason Bourne was born as David Webb on September 13, 1970 in [[Nixa, Missouri]] (although in ''Ultimatum'', he was given a false date of April 15, 1971, as a coded reference to a specific site). He joined the [[United States Army]] and was eventually selected for [[Delta Force]] in 1998. His father, Richard Webb, a senior [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst, created the Treadstone program, a black ops project intended to train and deploy elite assassins. He was monitored by the CIA, which murdered his father with a car bomb in [[Beirut]] in a bid to recruit Webb.\n\nThe ploy worked; Webb approached the CIA and was brought into the program by Neil Daniels, a supervisor in the Treadstone program, and was monitored by Dr. Albert Hirsch, who supervised the medical assessment of the Treadstone agents. He was brought into a secret recruitment center in [[New York City]], where Hirsch ordered him tortured for days \u2014 via [[waterboarding]] and sleep deprivation \u2014 to break his spirit and allow him to be molded into an assassin. He was officially accepted when he murdered an unidentified man (implied to be the real Jason Bourne) without questioning. After that, he was given a new identity as Jason Bourne, and his birth identity was dropped.\n\nAfter heavy training, in which he learned several languages and mastered several martial arts skills, Bourne was placed in the Treadstone program, whose missions were run by the CIA's Alexander Conklin. His first assignment, an unofficial one, was in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]], where he assassinated Vladimir Neski, a [[Russian people|Russian]] politician who was intending to expose the theft of $20 million in black funds stolen from the CIA by Treadstone's Director, Ward Abbott, and a Russian oligarch, Yuri Gretkov. Under Conklin's orders, Bourne murdered Neski and his wife and arranged it as a murder-suicide.\n\nBourne worked in the program for three years, during which he was considered its top agent because he could adapt to his surroundings, think laterally, and execute assassinations that looked like accidents. He was stationed in [[Paris|Paris, France]], maintaining a secluded life while performing assassinations, mostly around Europe. His official handler was a logistics agent, Nicky Parsons, also stationed in Paris, with whom he was implied to have some sort of a romantic relationship kept secret from his Treadstone employers.\n\nThe turning point in his life came when he was ordered to murder Nykwana Wombosi, an exiled African warlord who was blackmailing the CIA into reinstating him as head of his state, lest he expose several CIA secrets. Using an alias, John Michael Kane, Bourne gathered information on Wombosi. He infiltrated the warlord's yacht and hid inside it for five days, surfacing on a cold night in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, intending to arrange the murder to look like he was killed by a crew member to avoid suspicion. However, Wombosi was surrounded by his children, and Bourne was unable to bring himself to kill him. He tried to abandon the mission by leaving the boat, but an unknown shooter shot him twice in the back, sending him off the yacht into the sea and triggering amnesia, causing Webb / Bourne to forget his identity.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== Novels ===\n\nThe series has included fourteen novels which have been written by two authors, [[Robert Ludlum]] and [[Eric Van Lustbader]]. Ludlum's series include the first three books, dubbed the [[Bourne (novel series)|Bourne trilogy]]. After Ludlum's death in 2001, Lustbader took over the character in his own series of novels, which span eleven books so far, with a twelfth (''The Bourne Nemesis'') currently being completed.\n\n==== Written by Robert Ludlum ====\n\n===== ''The Bourne Identity'' (1980) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Identity (novel)}}\n\nA man is found floating unconscious in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] near [[Marseille]] by Italian fishermen with two gunshot wounds in his back. He wakes and discovers he is suffering from [[Psychogenic amnesia|extreme memory loss]]. Film negative embedded in his hip leads him to a bank in Zurich where he learns he is known by the name Jason Bourne. As he tries to reclaim his memory, Bourne attracts the attention of hostile people for reasons unknown to him. At a hotel, while cornered, Bourne takes a young woman, Marie St. Jacques, hostage to escape. Marie is an employee of the [[Government of Canada]]. Bourne and Marie discover that \"Jason Bourne\" is the cover identity of a contract assassin, and that both the CIA and another contract killer known as [[Carlos the Jackal]] have an interest in him. Marie is convinced that this man she has come to know cannot be the ruthless killer that all their discoveries seem to imply. She compels Bourne to continue searching for his true identity and, in the end, he finds the truth. Through this time, Bourne has the phrase \"Cain is for Charlie, and Delta is for Cain\" continually flash through his mind, propelling him in the direction of his mission.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Supremacy'' (1986) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Supremacy}}\n\nHaving recovered his memory and retired from the CIA, David Webb now teaches Asian studies at a university in Maine and lives with Marie. She is taken captive seemingly by a powerful Chinese [[drug lord]], but in reality, by the United States government using the fictitious drug lord as cover. The scheme is an attempt to turn Webb back into his former self, the mythical Jason Bourne, to go after a Bourne impostor in China. The phony Bourne has been credited with a Far East political assassination that could, in a worst-case scenario, cause a Chinese [[civil war]] over the ownership of [[Hong Kong]].\n\n===== ''The Bourne Ultimatum'' (1990) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Ultimatum}}\n\nAs Carlos the Jackal enters old age and his infamy fades, he decides that he will do two things before he dies: kill Jason Bourne and destroy the [[KGB]] facility of Novgorod, where the Jackal was trained and later turned away. Webb's family is forced to hide in the Caribbean while Webb himself works with old friend and CIA officer Alex Conklin to hunt down and kill the Jackal first. Webb poses as an important member of Medusa, now a nearly omnipotent economic force that controls the commander of [[NATO]], leading figures in the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]], and large [[NYSE]] firms. The plan is to use Medusa's resources to contact the Jackal. Webb just misses the Jackal several times before Webb feigns his own death and convinces the Jackal that he has succeeded. Following this, the Jackal turns to his second goal. Webb tracks the Jackal down with the help of Conklin and a KGB agent as the Jackal begins destroying the KGB compound. In a final confrontation, the Jackal is led into a dam lock in which he drowns and Webb returns to his family.\n\n==== Written by Eric Van Lustbader ====\n\n===== ''The Bourne Legacy'' (2004) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Legacy (novel)}}\n\nWith the climactic events of ''The Bourne Ultimatum'' behind him, Jason Bourne is able to once again become David Webb, now professor of linguistics at Georgetown University. However, this serenity does not last for long. When a silenced gunshot narrowly misses Webb's head, the Bourne persona reawakens in him. His first objective is to reach his long-time friend and handler at the CIA, Alex Conklin. However, unknown to Bourne, a Hungarian by the name of Stepan Spalko has now drawn Jason into a web\u2014one which he cannot escape as easily as his professional fa\u00e7ade. And the man who nearly killed him in Georgetown continues his deadly, intensely personal pursuit.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Betrayal'' (2007) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Betrayal}}\n\nJason Bourne takes a mission to rescue his only friend in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], Martin Lindros, who disappeared in [[Africa]] while tracking shipments of [[uranium]]. Once safely back in America, Lindros persuades Bourne to help track the money trail of [[terrorists]] buying the nuclear material in [[Odessa]]. But once there, Bourne is hampered by confusing flashbacks of unfamiliar places and events and he wonders if someone is brainwashing him in order to throw him off the trail, or worse, if the man he saved in Africa is really Martin Lindros. Now, Bourne must gather evidence while trying to stay one step ahead of the terrorists who won't let anyone stand in their way.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Sanction'' (2008) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Sanction}}\n\nJason Bourne returns to [[Georgetown University]], and the mild world of his alter ego, David Webb, hoping for normality. But, after so many adrenaline-soaked years of risking his life, Bourne finds himself chafing under the quiet life of a linguistics professor. Aware of his frustrations, his academic mentor, Professor Spector, asks for help investigating the murder of a former student. The young man died carrying information about a group's terrorist activities, including an immediate plan to attack the United States. The organization, the Black Legion, and its plot have also popped up on the radar of the Central Intelligence Agency, whose new director Veronica Hart is struggling to assert her authority. Sensing an opportunity to take control of the CIA by showing Hart's incompetence, National Security Agency operatives attempt to accomplish what the CIA never could do, hunt down and kill Jason Bourne. In Europe, Bourne's investigation into the Black Legion turns into one of the deadliest and most tangled operations of his double life\u2014while an assassin is getting closer by the minute.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Deception'' (2009) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Deception}}\n\nBourne's nemesis, Arkadin, is still hot on his trail, and the two continue their struggle, reversing roles of hunter and hunted. When Bourne is ambushed and badly wounded, he fakes his death and goes into hiding. In safety, he takes on a new identity, and begins a mission to find out who tried to assassinate him. Jason begins to question who he really is, how much of him is tied up in the Bourne identity, and what he would become if that was suddenly taken away from him. Meanwhile, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt by what seems to be an Iranian missile. A massive global investigative team is assembled to get at the truth of the situation before it can escalate into an international scandal. Bourne's search for the man who shot him intersects with the search for the people who brought down the airliner, leading Bourne into one of the most deadly and challenging situations he has ever encountered. With the threat of a new world war brewing, Bourne finds himself in a race against time to uncover the truth and find the person behind his assault, all the while being stalked by his unknown nemesis.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Objective'' (2010) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Objective}}\n\n''The Bourne Objective'' is the eighth novel in the Bourne series, and the fifth written by Eric Van Lustbader. The book was released in 2010, sequel to ''The Bourne Deception''.\nThe killing of an art dealer dredges up snatches of Jason Bourne's impaired memory, in particular the murder of a young woman who entrusted him with a strangely engraved ring. Now he's determined to find its owner and purpose. But Bourne never knows what terrible acts he'll discover he committed when he digs into the past.\nThe trail will lead him to a vicious Russian mercenary, Leonid Arkadin, also a graduate of the Central Intelligence training program Treadstone. The covert course was shuttered by Congress for corruption, but not before it produced Bourne and Arkadin, giving them equal skills, equal force, and equal cunning.\nAs Bourne's destiny circles closer to Arkadin's, it becomes clear that someone else has been watching and manipulating them.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Dominion'' (2011) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Dominion}}\n\nJason Bourne is searching for an elusive cadre of terrorists planning to destroy America's most strategic natural resources\u2014and needs the help of his longtime friend, General Boris Karpov. Karpov, the newly appointed head of Russia's most feared spy agency, FSB-2, is one of the most determined, honorable, and justice-hungry men that Bourne knows. But Karpov has made a deal with the devil. In order to remain the head of FSB-2, he must hunt down and kill Bourne. Now, these two trusted friends are on a deadly collision course. From the Colombian highlands to [[Munich]], [[C\u00e1diz]], and [[Damascus]], the clock is counting down to a disaster that will cripple America's economic and military future. Only Bourne and Karpov have a chance to avert the catastrophe\u2014but if they destroy each other first, that chance will be gone forever.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Imperative'' (2012) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Imperative}}\n\nThe tenth book in the series was published on June 5, 2012. The man Jason Bourne fished out of the freezing sea is near death, half-drowned and bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound. He awakens with no memory of who he is or why he was shot, and Bourne is eerily reminded of his own amnesia. Then Bourne discovers that the Mossad agent named Rebeka is so determined to find this injured man that she has gone off the grid, cut her ties to her agency, and is now being stalked by Mossad's most feared killer. The answers to these mysteries may lie back in southeast Lebanon, in a secret encampment to which Bourne and Rebeka escaped following a firefight weeks ago. The complex trail links to the mission given to Treadstone directors Peter Marks and Soraya Moore: find the semi-mythic terrorist assassin known as Nicodemo. In the course of Bourne's desperate, deadly search for a secret that will alter the future of the entire world, he will experience both triumph and loss, and his life will never be the same. Now everything turns on the amnesiac. Bourne must learn his identity and purpose before both he and Rebeka are killed. From [[Stockholm]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], from [[Mexico City]] to [[Beijing]], the web of lies and betrayals extends into a worldwide conspiracy of monumental proportions.\n\n===== ''The Bourne Retribution'' (2013) =====\n{{Main|The Bourne Retribution}}\n\nThe eleventh book in the series was published on December 3, 2013. Bourne's friend Eli Yadin, head of Mossad, learns that Ouyang Jidan, a senior member of China's Politburo, and a major Mexican drug lord may have been trafficking in more than drugs. Yadin needs Bourne to investigate. Bourne agrees, but only because he has a personal agenda: Ouyang Jidan is the man who ordered Rebeka\u2014one of the very few people Bourne has ever truly cared about\u2014murdered.

The TV movie was largely faithful to Robert Ludlum's novel, both in plot as well as in the portrayal of the character of Jason Bourne.\n\nA spin-off of the Universal-produced film franchise entitled ''[[Treadstone]]'' began airing in October 2019 on [[USA Network]]. It explores the origins of the Treadstone program and operatives other than Bourne. Producer Ben Smith, who worked on the recent two ''Bourne'' films, said the show will tie into the next film in the franchise.<ref>https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481543/another-bourne-movie-is-in-the-works-and-itll-tie-into-the-treadstone-tv-show</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\n{{Main|Bourne (film series)}}\n[[File:Matt Damon TIFF 2015.jpg|thumb|Actor Matt Damon, who portrays Jason Bourne in the film series]]\nThe Jason Bourne novels were adapted into a series of films \u2013 ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (2002), ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' (2004), ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007), ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]'' (2012), and ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'' (2016).

As  a result, the film focuses on the fallout in the intelligence community from Bourne's actions in ''Ultimatum''. ''Legacy'' features [[Jeremy Renner]] as Aaron Cross, an operative in a different clandestine program evolved from Treadstone.\n\n=== Video games ===\n\nA video game titled ''[[Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy]]'' was released in 2008 for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]].\n\nThe Ludlum estate obtained the rights to the video game franchise and sold it to [[Electronic Arts]] in 2009.

Italian words can be divided into the following [[lexical categories]]: articles, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.\n\n==Articles==\nItalian articles vary according to definiteness ([[Article (grammar)#Definite article|definite]], [[Article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite]], and [[Article (grammar)#Partitive article|partitive]]), [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]], and the initial sound of the subsequent word. Partitive articles compound the preposition ''[[wikt:di#Italian|di]]'' with the corresponding definite article, to express uncertain quantity.

masculine pronouns and adjectives are used to refer to and describe unspecified neuter things such as facts and ideas (e.g. ''Lo so'' (\"I know it\"), where ''lo'' is the masculine third-person singular unstressed direct object pronoun).\n\n==Nouns==\nMost nouns are derived from Latin. Many of these are themselves borrowed from Greek (e.g. ''poeta'' below):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+Derivation of noun inflections\n|-\n![[Latin declension]]\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n|-\n|1st (-a / -ae)     || ''poet'''a''' / poet'''i''''' \"poet(s)\"          || ''ros'''a''' / ros'''e''''' \"rose(s)\"\n|-\n|2nd (-us / -\u012b; -um / -a)     || ''carr'''o''' / carr'''i''''' \"truck(s)\"<br>''vezz'''o''' / vezz'''i''''' \"habit(s)\"         || \n|-\n|3rd (-\u00d8, -is / -\u0113s) || ''can'''e''' / can'''i''''' \"dog(s)\"             || ''paret'''e''' / paret'''i''''' \"wall(s)\"\n|-\n|3rd (-\u0101s / -\u0101t\u0113s)  ||                                                  || ''citt'''ade''' / citt'''adi''''' \"town(s) (archaic)\"\n|-\n|4th (-us / -\u016bs)    || ''pass'''o''' / pass'''i''''' \"step(s)\"          || ''man'''o''' / man'''i''''' \"hand(s)\"\n|-\n|5th (-\u0113s / -\u0113s)  ||                                                  || ''fed'''e''' / fed'''i''''' \"faith(s)\"\n|}\n\nAny other noun, both those from Latin with an unusual ending and those derived from languages other than Latin or Greek, are usually not Latinized , and nouns ending with a stressed vowel are not inflected; thus:\n* ''il re'' / ''i re'' (\"the king(s)\": ''rex / reges'')\n* ''il caff\u00e8'' / ''i caff\u00e8'' (\"the coffee(s)\")\n* ''il film'' / ''i film'' (\"the film(s)\")\n\nThere are certain words (neuter in Latin) that are masculine in the singular and feminine or masculine in the plural:\n* ''il braccio'' / ''le braccia'' or ''i bracci'' (\"the arm(s)\")\n* ''l'uovo'' / ''le uova'' (\"the egg(s)\")\n* ''il ginocchio'' / ''le ginocchia'' or ''i ginocchi'' (\"the knee(s)\")\n* ''il sopracciglio'' / ''le sopracciglia'' or ''i sopraccigli'' (\"the eyebrow(s)\")\nThese nouns' endings derive regularly from the Latin neuter endings of the second declension (sg. ''-um'' / pl. ''-a''), but there are some from the third declension as well: e.g. ''il gregge / le greggi'' (flock(s), but ''i greggi'' works, too); the tradition of calling them \"irregular\" or \"mobile gender\" (''genere mobile'') would come from the paradigm that there are so few nouns of this kind that the existence of neuter can be considered vestigial. The choice of plural is sometimes left to the user, while in some cases there are differences of meaning:<ref>[http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/lingua-italiana/consulenza-linguistica/domande-risposte/plurali-doppi Accademia della Crusca, ''Plurali doppi'']</ref>\n* Sometimes, for body parts, the feminine/neuter plural denotes the literal meaning while the masculine one denotes a figurative meaning: ''il braccio'' (\"the arm\") / ''le braccia'' (\"the arms\") / ''i bracci'' (\"the isthmuses\", \"the inlets\"); ''il corno'' (\"the horn\") / ''le corna'' (\"the horns\" of an animal) / ''i corni'' (\"the horns\" as musical instruments)\n* Sometimes, especially in poetic and old-fashioned Italian, the masculine plural acts as a [[count noun]], while the neuter/feminine plural acts as a [[mass noun]]: ''il cervello'' (\"the brain\") / ''due cervelli'' (\"two brains\") / ''le cervella'' (\"the cerebral matter\"); ''l'anello'' (\"the ring\") / ''due anelli'' (\"two rings\") / ''le anella'' (\"ringlets\"); furthermore, ''il dito'' (\"the finger\") / ''le dita'' (\"the fingers\") and also ''due dita'' (\"two fingers\") / but ''i diti indici'' (\"the index fingers\")\n\n===Irregular plurals===\nThere are a few genuine irregular plurals in Italian (''[[:it:plurali irregolari|plurali irregolari]]''). Most of these were introduced in Vulgar Latin, but some derive from irregular Latin plurals. Examples include:\n*''uomo / uomini'' (man/men; Latin ''homo / homines '')\n*''il dio / gli dei'' (god(s); note also the irregularity in the article: ''gli'' instead of ''i'')\n*''bue / buoi'' (ox(en); Latin ''bovem / boves'')\n*''tempio / templi'' (temple(s); the plural retains the ''l'' from Latin ''templum/templi'' which is lost in the singular in order to distinguish it from ''tempi'', the plural of ''tempo'')\n*''il carcere / le carceri'' (prison (''masculine'') / prisons (''feminine''))\n*''l'eco / gli echi'' (echo (''feminine'') / echoes (''masculine''))\n\n===Alteration===\nIn Italian, altered nouns are nouns with particular shades of meaning. They are divided into [[diminutive]]s, \"vezzeggiativi\" (diminutives with kindness and sympathy nuance), [[augmentative]]s and [[pejorative]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|\n!

The [[markedness|unmarked]] placement for most adjectives (e.g. colours, nationalities) is after the noun,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=4299&ctg_id=45 |title=Accademia della Crusca, ''Sulla posizione dell'aggettivo qualificativo in italiano'' |access-date=2009-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720031420/http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=4299&ctg_id=45 |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but this is reversed for a few common classes of adjective &mdash; those denoting beauty, age, goodness, and size are placed ''before'' the noun in the unmarked case, and after the noun for emphasis.\n\nPlacing the adjective after the noun can alter its meaning or indicate [[restrictiveness]] of reference. If a noun has many adjectives, usually no more than one will be before the noun.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008|reason=\"un nuovo grande edificio\"}}\n\n*''un libro rosso'' = a red book (the unmarked case)\n*''un rosso libro'' = a book that is red (the marked case; it is especially important to the intended meaning that the book is *red*, as opposed to some other color)\n*''un buon uomo'' = a good man (the unmarked case)\n*''un uomo buono'' = a man who is good (the marked case; it is especially important to the intended meaning that he is good, the adjective is emphasized)\n\nAdjectives are inflected for gender and number:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Gender\n!Grammatical number\n!Case 1\n!Case 2\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Masculine\n|Singular\n| -o\n| -e\n|-\n|Plural\n| -i\n| -i\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Feminine\n|Singular\n| -a\n| -e\n|-\n|Plural\n| -e\n| -i\n|}\n\n===Degrees of comparison===\nItalian has three [[degrees of comparison]]: [[comparative]], relative [[superlative]] and absolute superlative.\n\nThe comparative and relative superlative are formed with ''pi\u00f9'' (\"more\", \"most\"); for instance:\n* ''sono '''pi\u00f9 alto''' di te'' (\"I am taller than you\")\n* ''sono '''il pi\u00f9 alto''' fra gli uomini'' (\"I am the tallest of men\")\n\nVice versa, inverting the order of the words, it's required to replace ''pi\u00f9'' with ''meno'' (\"less, fewer\"); for instance:\n* ''sono''' il meno forte''' del campionato'' (\"I am the least strong of the championship\")\n* ''tu sei '''meno alto''' di me '' (\"You are less tall than me\")\n\nAnother comparative form is made with the word ''come'' ('as', 'like'); for instance:\n* ''sono alto come te'' (\"I am as tall as you\")\n\nThe ''absolute comparative'' is formed by placing ''troppo'' (\"too\") before the adjective; for instance: \n* ''sei troppo buono'' (\"you are too good\").\n\nThe ''absolute superlative'', derived from the Latin synthetic superlative in ''-issimus'', is formed by adding ''-issimo'' to an adjective: ''intelligente'' (\"intelligent\"), ''intelligent'''issimo''''' (\"very intelligent\"); ''sporco'' (\"dirty\") ''sporch'''issimo''''' (\"very dirty\"). If the two letters before the last vowel are ''pr'' or ''br'' (e.g., ''aspro'', ''celebre''), the ''r'' is removed and ''-errimo'' is the suffix used (''asp'''errimo''''', ''celeb'''errimo''''') (\"very sour\", \"very famous\").\nAnother way to form the ''absolute superlative'' is to place either ''molto'' or ''assai'' (\"very\") before the adjective. For instance ''sporchissimo'' and ''molto sporco'' (\"very dirty\") are the same, although the form ending in ''issimo'' is usually perceived as more emphatic; that is, ''sporchissimo'' is dirtier than ''molto sporco''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nSome adjectives have irregular comparatives (though with regularly-formed variants also in common use), like\n* ''buono'' (\"good\"), ''migliore'' / ''pi\u00f9 buono'' (\"better\" or \"best\"), ''migliore'' / ''ottimo'' / ''buonissimo'' (\"very good\")\n* ''cattivo'' (\"bad\"), ''peggiore'' / ''pi\u00f9 cattivo'' (\"worse\" or \"worst\"), ''pessimo'' / ''cattivissimo'' (\"very bad\")\n* ''grande'' (\"big\"), ''maggiore'' / ''pi\u00f9 grande'' (\"bigger\"), ''massimo'' / ''grandissimo'' (\"very big\")\n* ''piccolo'' (\"small\"), ''minore'' / ''pi\u00f9 piccolo'' (\"smaller\"), ''minimo'' / ''piccolissimo'' (\"very small\")\n\n===Possessive adjectives===\nWith the exception of 3rd person plural ''loro'' 'their', possessive adjectives, like articles, must agree with the gender and number of the noun they modify. Hence, ''mio zio'' (my uncle), but ''mia zia'' (my aunt). So depending on what is being modified, the possessive adjectives are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Person\n!colspan=2|Masculine\n!colspan=2|Feminine\n|-\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n|1st sing. || mio || miei || mia || mie\n|-\n|2nd sing. || tuo || tuoi || tua || tue\n|-\n|3rd sing. || suo || suoi ||sua || sue\n|-\n|1st pl. || nostro || nostri ||nostra ||nostre\n|-\n|2nd pl. || vostro || vostri || vostra || vostre\n|-\n|3rd pl. || colspan=\"4\"| loro\n|}\n\nIn most cases the possessive adjective is used with an article, usually the [[definite article]]:\n\n{|\n|-\n|''Ho perso '''la mia''' penna.'' || (\"I have lost my pen.\")\n|-\n|''Mi piace '''il mio''' lavoro.'' || (\"I like my job.\")\n|-\n|''Hanno rubato '''la mia''' automobile!'' || (\"They have stolen my car!\")\n|}\n\nAnd sometimes with the [[indefinite article]]:\n\n{|\n|-\n|'''''Un mio''' amico mi ha detto che...'' || (\"A friend of mine told me that...\")\n|-\n|''Ho visto '''una sua''' foto.'' || (\"I have seen a photograph of him/her.\")\n|-\n|''Luca \u00e8 '''un mio''' amico.'' || (\"Luke is a friend of mine.\")\n|}\n\nThe only exception is when the possessive refers to an individual family member (unless the family member is described or characterized in some way):\n\n{|\n|-\n|''Laura \u00e8 '''mia''' sorella'' || (\"Laura is my sister.\")\n|-\n|''Ieri ho visto '''mia''' sorella Diana'' || (\"I saw my sister Diana yesterday.\")\n|-\n|''Questa penna \u00e8 di '''mia''' zia.'' || (\"This pen is my aunt's.\")\n|}\n\n''Mamma'' and ''pap\u00e0'' (or ''babbo'', in Central Italy; \"mother\" and \"father\"), however, are usually used with the article.\n\nFor emphasis, however, possessive adjectives are sometimes placed after the noun. This is usually after words like 'colpa' (fault, sin); 'casa' (house, home); 'merito' (merit); 'piacere' (pleasure); or in [[vocative]] expressions.\n\n{|\n|-\n|''\u00c8 colpa '''sua'''.'' || (\"It is his/her fault.\")\n|-\n|''Oh dio '''mio'''!'' || (\"Oh, my god!\")\n|-\n|''Arrivederci, amico '''mio'''!'' || (\"Goodbye, my friend!\")\n|-\n|''Vorresti andare a casa '''mia'''?'' || (\"Would you like to come over to my house?\")\n|}\n\nIf the antecedent of a third person possessive (being used as an object) is the subject of the sentence, ''proprio'' can be used instead of ''suo'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=7689&ctg_id=45 |title=Accademia della Crusca, ''Impiego di ''Proprio'' e ''Suo'''' |access-date=2009-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720031553/http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=7689&ctg_id=45 |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> though the usage of ''proprio'' is declining in spoken language:{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n{|\n|-\n|''Marco e Maria hanno discusso di filosofia.

Marco ha scelto il '''suo''' punto di vista.'' || (\"Marco and Maria discussed philosophy. Marco took '''his/her''' point of view.\")\n|}\n\nThe first sentence is unambiguous and states that Marco took his own point of view, whereas the second sentence is ambiguous because it may mean that Marco took either his own or Maria's point of view.\n\n===Demonstrative adjectives===\nItalian originally had three degrees of [[demonstrative]] adjectives: ''questo'' (for items near or related to the first person speaker: English \"this\"), ''quello'' (for items near or related to an eventual third person: English \"that\"), and ''codesto'' (for items near or related to an eventual second person). The usage has undergone a simplification, including the meaning of ''codesto'' in ''quello'', and only [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] speakers still use ''codesto''. Its use is very rare in modern language, and the word has acquired a rather pejorative connotation.\n\n==Pronouns==\n\nItalian features a sizeable set of pronouns. [[Personal pronoun]]s are inflected for person, number, case, and, in the third person, gender. Literary subject pronouns also have a distinction between animate (''egli'', ''ella'') and inanimate (''esso'', ''essa'') [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]s, although this is lost in colloquial usage, where ''lui'', ''lei'' and ''loro'' are the most used forms for animate subjects, while no specific pronoun is employed for inanimate subjects (if needed, demonstrative pronouns such as \"questo\" or \"quello\" may be used).  There is also the uninflected pronoun ''ci\u00f2'', which is only used with abstract antecedents.\n\nPersonal pronouns are normally [[null subject language|omitted in the subject]], as the conjugation is usually enough to determine the grammatical person. They are used when some emphasis is needed, e.g. ''sono italiano'' (\"I am Italian\") vs. ''io sono italiano'' (\"''I'' [specifically, as opposed to others] am Italian\").\n\nThe words ''ci'', ''vi'' and ''ne'' act both as personal pronouns (respectively instrumental and genitive case) and clitic [[pro-form]]s for \"there\" (''ci'' and ''vi'', with identical meaning \u2013 as in '''''c''''\u00e8'', '''''ci''' sono'', '''''v''''\u00e8'', '''''vi''' sono'', '''''ci''' vengo'', etc.) and \"from there\" (''ne'' \u2013 as in ''\u00e8 entrato in casa alle 10:00 e '''ne''' \u00e8 uscito alle 11:00'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ [[Personal pronoun]]s\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"border: none;\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Nominative]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Genitive]]\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Dative]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Accusative]]\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]\n|-\n!

In the [[infinitive]], [[gerund]] and, except with third-person courtesy forms, [[imperative mood]]s clitic pronouns must ''always'' be compound to the suffix as enclitics<ref>This was not always the case, however. It is not rare indeed to find in [[opera]] [[libretto]]s the clitic before the imperative, as in ''Ti ferma!'' (which in standard Italian means \"He/She/It stops you!\") instead of the standard ''Fermati!'' (which means \"Stop yourself!\"). However this usage today is completely non-standard and modern listeners might have difficulties with it when approaching old texts.</ref> (as in ''confessalo!'' [2p. sg.]/''confessiamolo!''

Though widely used, this redundant usage is considered non-standard.\n\n==== Combinations of clitics ====\n\nIn Italian it is possible to append more than one clitic to a single verb. In normal usage, two is the usual limit, although clusters of three can occasionally arise for some speakers,<ref>Lepschy, Giulio and Anna Laura Lepschy. 1998. The Italian Language Today. New York: New Amsterdam Books. p. 214</ref> especially with impersonal constructs (e.g. '''''Ce la si''' sente'' = \"One feels up to it\", or ''Nessuno ha ancora visto l'ultimo film di Woody Allen, quindi '''ce lo si''' vede tutti insieme!'' = \"Nobody has watched the last Woody Allen movie yet, so we have to watch it together!\"). Any two cases can be used together, except for accusative + genitive, and word order is strictly determined according to one of the following two patterns:<ref>Lepschy, Giulio and Anna Laura Lepschy. 1998. The Italian Language Today. New York: New Amsterdam Books. p. 212</ref>\n\n<ol><li>When one clitic is third-person non-reflexive accusative or genitive, form II. of the other clitic is used.

The second-person nominative pronoun is ''tu'' for informal use, and for formal use, the third-person form ''Lei'' has been used since the Renaissance.<ref name=serianni>{{cite book| last = Serianni| first = Luca| title = Italiano| publisher = Garzanti| year = 1997| isbn = 88-11-50470-8}}</ref> It is used like \"Sie\" in German, \"usted\" in Spanish, and \"vous\" in French. ''Lei'' was originally an object form of ''ella'', which in turn referred to an [[honorific]] of the feminine gender such as ''la magnificenza tua/vostra'' (\"Your Magnificence\") or ''Vossignoria'' (\"Your Lordship\"),<ref>Maiden, Martin, M.Mair Parry. 1997. The dialects of Italy. P.113</ref> and by analogy, ''Loro'' came to be used as the formal plural. Previously, and in some Italian regions today (e.g. Campania), ''voi'' was used as the formal singular, like French \"vous\". The pronouns ''lei'' (third-person singular), ''Lei'' (formal second-person singular), ''loro'' (third-person plural), and ''Loro'' (formal second-person plural) are pronounced the same but written as shown, and formal ''Lei'' and ''Loro'' take third-person conjugations. Formal ''Lei'' is invariable for gender (always feminine), but adjectives that modify it are not: one would say to a man '''''La''' conosco'' (\"I know you\") but ''Lei \u00e8 alt'''o''''' (\"You are tall\").  Formal ''Loro'' is variable for gender: '''''Li''' conosco'' (\"I know you [masc. pl.]\") vs. '''''Le''' conosco'' (\"I know you [fem. pl.]\"), etc. The formal plural is very rarely used in modern Italian; the unmarked form is widely used instead.<ref>[http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/lingua-italiana/consulenza-linguistica/domande-risposte/pronomi-cortesia Accademia della Crusca, ''Sui pronomi di cortesia'']</ref> For example: ''Gino, Lei \u00e8 un bravo ingegnere.

While the various inflected verbal forms convey a combination of [[Grammatical tense|tense]] (location in time), aspect, and [[Grammatical mood|mood]], language-specific discussions generally refer to these [[inflection]]al forms as \"tempi\", for this reason it is impossible to make comparisons between the tenses of English verbs and the tempi of Italian verbs as there is no correspondence at all.\n\n===Tenses===\n\n====Simple tenses====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

(\"The door is being opened.\")\n\nFor intransitive verbs a reliable rule cannot be given, although a useful rule of thumb is that if a verb's past participle can take on [[Adjective|adjectival]] value, ''essere'' is used, otherwise ''avere''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=5060&ctg_id=44 |title=Accademia della Crusca, ''La scelta degli ausiliari'' |access-date=2009-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530183706/http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=5060&ctg_id=44 |archive-date=2009-05-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=4125&ctg_id=44 |title=Accademia della Crusca, ''Ausiliare con i verbi intransitivi'' |access-date=2009-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720031759/http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=4125&ctg_id=44 |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Also, [[reflexive verb]]s and [[unaccusative verb]]s use ''essere'' (typically non-agentive verbs of motion and change of state, i.e. involuntary actions like ''[[wikt:cadere#Italian|cadere]]'' (\"to fall\") or ''[[wikt:morire#Italian|morire]]'' (\"to die\")). {{Citation needed|date=June 2008|reason=\"Crusca article gives a different interpretation, saying that verbs that can be used as adjectives too go with essere - also, see 'andare' as a counterexample\"}}\n\nThe distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tenses and is essential to the [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] of the past participle. Some verbs use can both, though, like ''[[wikt:vivere#Italian|vivere]]'' (\"to live\"): ''Io ho vissuto'' (\"I have lived\") can alternatively be expressed as, ''Io sono vissuto''.\n\n===Past participle===\nThe past participle is used in Italian as both an adjective and to form many of the compound tenses of the language. There are regular endings for the past participle, based on the conjugation class ([[#Non-finite forms|see below]]). There are, however, many irregular forms as not all verbs follow the pattern, particularly the -ere verbs. Some of the more common irregular past participles include: ''essere'' (to be) \u2192 ''stato'' (same for ''stare''); ''fare'' (to do, to make) \u2192 ''fatto''; ''dire'' (to say, to tell) \u2192 ''detto''; ''aprire'' (to open) \u2192 ''aperto''; ''chiedere'' (to ask) \u2192 ''chiesto''; ''chiudere'' (to close) \u2192 ''chiuso''; ''leggere'' (to read) \u2192 ''letto''; ''mettere'' (to put) \u2192 ''messo''; ''perdere'' (to lose) \u2192 ''perso''; ''prendere'' (to take, to get) \u2192 ''preso''; ''rispondere'' (to answer) \u2192 ''risposto''; ''scrivere'' (to write) \u2192 ''scritto''; ''vedere'' (to see) \u2192 ''visto''.\n\nFor the intransitive verbs taking ''essere'', the past participle always agrees with the subject\u2014that is, it follows the usual adjective agreement rules: ''egli \u00e8 partito; ella \u00e8 partita''.  This is also true for [[reflexive verb]]s, the impersonal ''si'' construction (which requires any adjectives that refer to it to be in the masculine plural: ''Si \u00e8 sempre stanch'''i''' alla fine della giornata'' - One is always tired at the end of the day), and the passive voice, which also use ''essere'' (''Queste mele sono state comprat'''e''' da loro'' - These apple have been bought by them, against ''Essi hanno comprat'''o''' queste mele'' - They bought these apples).\n\nThe past participle when used with ''avere'' never changes to agree with the subject. It ''must'' agree with ''the object'', though, in sentences where this is expressed by a third person clitic pronoun (e.g. ''Hai mangiato la mela? - S\u00ec, '''l<nowiki>'</nowiki>'''ho mangiat'''a''''' (Have you eaten the apple? - Yes, I have eaten it)). When the object is expressed by a first or second person clitic pronoun instead, the agreement is optional: ''Maria! Ti ha chiamat'''o''' / chiamat'''a''' Giovanni? - No, non mi ha chiamat'''o''' / chiamat'''a''''' (Maria! Has Giovanni called you? - No, he has not).\n\nIn all the other cases where the object is not expressed by a clitic pronoun, the agreement with the object is obsolescent in modern Italian (but still correct): ''La storia che avete raccontat'''a''''' (obsolete) ''/ raccontat'''o''' non mi convince'' (The story you told does not convince me); or compare [[Alessandro Manzoni|Manzoni]]'s ''Lucia aveva avut'''e''' due buone ragioni''<ref>[[Alessandro Manzoni]], ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' (1827)</ref> with the more modern ''Lucia aveva avut'''o''' due buone ragioni'' (Lucia had had two good reasons).\n\n===Tense relationship in subordinate sentences===\n\nItalian inherits ''consecutio temporum'', a grammar rule from Latin that governs the relationship between the tenses in principal and subordinate clauses. ''Consecutio temporum'' has very rigid rules. These rules require the subjunctive tense in order to express contemporaneity, posteriority and anteriority in relation with the principal clause.\n\n* To express contemporaneity when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, present, or simple past,) the subordinate clause uses the present subjunctive, to express ''contemporaneity in the present''.\n** ''Penso che Davide '''sia''' intelligente.'' I think David is smart.\n* When the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subordinate clause uses the imperfect subjunctive, expressing ''contemporaneity in the past''.\n** ''Pensavo che Davide '''fosse''' intelligente''.  I thought David was smart.\n* To express anteriority when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, or present or passato prossimo) the subordinate clause uses the past subjunctive.\n** ''Penso che Davide '''sia stato''' intelligente.''  I think David has been smart.\n* To express anteriority when the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subjunctive has to be pluperfect.\n** ''Pensavo che Davide '''fosse stato''' intelligente.'' I thought David had been smart.\n* To express posteriority the subordinate clause uses the future tense in the indicative mood, not the subjunctive, because the subjunctive has no future tense.\n** ''Penso che Davide '''sar\u00e0''' intelligente.'' I think David will be smart.\n* To express posteriority with respect to a past event, the subordinate clause uses the past conditional, whereas in other European languages (such as French, English, and Spanish) the present conditional is used.\n** ''Pensavo che Davide '''sarebbe stato''' intelligente.'' I thought that David would have been smart.\n\n===Regular conjugation===\nThe infinitive of first conjugation verbs ends in ''-are,'' that of second conjugation verbs in ''-ere,'' and that of third conjugation verbs in ''-ire.'' In the following examples for different [[Grammatical mood|moods]], the first conjugation verb is ''parlare'' (meaning ''to talk/speak''), the second conjugation verb is ''temere'' (''to fear'') and the third conjugation verb is ''partire'' (''to leave/depart''.)\n\n====Indicative mood====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse\" border=\"1\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Present'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Preterite'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Imperfect'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Simple future'''\n|-\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n|-\n! io\n| parlo\n| temo\n| parto\n| parlai\n| temetti; temei\n| partii\n| parlavo\n| temevo\n| partivo\n| parler\u00f2\n| temer\u00f2\n| partir\u00f2\n|-\n! tu\n| parli\n| temi\n| parti\n| parlasti\n| temesti\n| partisti\n| parlavi\n| temevi\n| partivi\n| parlerai\n| temerai\n| partirai\n|-\n! egli, ella, esso/essa\n| parla\n| teme\n| parte\n| parl\u00f2\n| temette; tem\u00e9\n| part\u00ec\n| parlava\n| temeva\n| partiva\n| parler\u00e0\n| temer\u00e0\n| partir\u00e0\n|-\n! noi\n| parliamo\n| temiamo\n| partiamo\n| parlammo\n| tememmo\n| partimmo\n| parlavamo\n| temevamo\n| partivamo\n| parleremo\n| temeremo\n| partiremo\n|-\n! voi\n| parlate\n| temete\n| partite\n| parlaste\n| temeste\n| partiste\n| parlavate\n| temevate\n| partivate\n| parlerete\n| temerete\n| partirete\n|-\n! essi/esse\n| parlano\n| temono\n| partono\n| parlarono\n| temettero; temerono\n| partirono\n| parlavano\n| temevano\n| partivano\n| parleranno\n| temeranno\n| partiranno\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Recent past''' = present of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Remote pluperfect''' = preterite of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Recent pluperfect''' = imperfect of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Future perfect''' = simple future of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n|}\n\nSome third conjugation verbs such as ''capire'' insert ''-isc-'' between the stem and the endings in the first, second, and third persons singular and third person plural of the present, e.g., capire -> ''capisco, capisci, capisce, capiamo, capite, capiscono''. It is impossible to tell from the infinitive form which verbs exhibit this phenomenon, which often originated in Latin verbs denoting the \"inchoative\" aspect of an action, that is, verbs describing the beginning of an action.<ref name=serianni/> There are some 500 verbs like this, the first ones in alphabetic order being ''abbellire'', ''abolire'', ''agire'', ''alleggerire'', ''ammattire'' and so forth.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Moretti\n  | first = G.

There are also certain verbs that end in -rre, namely ''trarre, porre, (con)durre'' and derived verbs with different prefixes (such as ''attrarre, comporre, dedurre,'' and so forth). They are derived from earlier ''trahere, ponere, ducere'' and are conjugated as such.\n\n====Subjunctive mood====\n\nThe Italian subjunctive mood is used to indicate cases of desire, express doubt, make impersonal emotional statements, and to talk about impeding events.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse\" border=\"1\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Present'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Imperfect'''\n|-\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n|-\n! io\n| parli\n| tema\n| parta\n| parlassi\n| temessi\n| partissi\n|-\n! tu\n| parli\n| tema\n| parta\n| parlassi\n| temessi\n| partissi\n|-\n! egli, ella, esso/essa\n| parli\n| tema\n| parta\n| parlasse\n| temesse\n| partisse\n|-\n! noi\n| parliamo\n| temiamo\n| partiamo\n| parlassimo\n| temessimo\n| partissimo\n|-\n! voi\n| parliate\n| temiate\n| partiate\n| parlaste\n| temeste\n| partiste\n|-\n! essi/esse\n|parlino\n|temano\n|partano\n|parlassero\n|temessero\n|partissero\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Past''' = present of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Past perfect''' = imperfect of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n|}\n\n*Third conjugation verbs like ''capire'' mentioned above insert ''-isc-'' in the first, second, and third persons singular and third person plural of the present.\n*Compound forms (''past'' and ''past perfect'') are made by adding the past participle (e.g. parlato) to the corresponding auxiliary form (as \"abbia\") in the present and imperfect.\n\n====Conditional mood====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse\" border=\"1\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Present'''\n|-\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n|-\n! io\n| parlerei\n| temerei\n| partirei\n|-\n! tu\n| parleresti\n| temeresti\n| partiresti\n|-\n! egli, ella, esso/essa\n| parlerebbe\n| temerebbe\n| partirebbe\n|-\n! noi\n| parleremmo\n| temeremmo\n| partiremmo\n|-\n! voi\n| parlereste\n| temereste\n| partireste\n|-\n! essi/esse\n| parlerebbero\n| temerebbero\n| partirebbero\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Past''' = conditional of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n|}\n\nAs the table shows, verbs each take their own root from their class of verb: ''-are'' becomes -''er''-, -''ere'' becomes -''er''-, and -''ire'' becomes -''ir''-, the same roots as used in the future indicative tense. All verbs add the same ending to this root. \n\nSome verbs do not follow this pattern, but take irregular roots, these include:\nAndare (to go) ~ Andr-, Avere (to have) ~ Avr-, Bere (to drink) ~ Berr-,\nDare (to give) ~ Dar-, Dovere (to have to) ~ Dovr-, Essere (to be) ~ Sar-,\nFare (to make/do) ~ Far-, Godere (to enjoy) ~ Godr-, Potere (to be able to) ~ Potr-,\nRimanere (to remain) ~ Rimarr-, Sapere (to know) ~ Sapr-, Sedere (to sit) ~ Sedr-,\nStare (to be/feel) ~ Star-, Tenere (to hold) ~ Terr-, Vedere (to see) ~ Vedr-,\nVenire (to come) ~ Verr-, Vivere (to live) ~ Vivr-, Volere (to want) ~ Vorr- etc.\n\nThe Italian conditional mood is a mood that refers to an ''action'' that is possible or likely, but is dependent upon a '''condition'''. Example:\n{|\n| ''Io andrei in spiaggia, ma fa troppo freddo.'' || (\"I ''would'' go to the beach, '''but''' it is too cold.\")\n|}\n\nIt can be used in two tenses, the present, by conjugation of the appropriate noun, or the past, using the auxiliary conjugated in the conditional, with the past participle of the appropriate noun:\n{|\n| ''Mangerei un sacco adesso, se non stessi cercando di fare colpo su queste ragazze.'' || (\"I would eat a lot now, if I were not trying to impress these girls\")\n|-\n| ''Sarei andato in citt\u00e0, se avessi saputo che ci andavano loro.'' || (\"I would have gone to the city, if I had known that they were going.\")\n|}\n\nMany Italian speakers often use the imperfect instead of the conditional and subjunctive. Prescriptivists usually view this as incorrect, but it is frequent in colloquial speech and tolerated in all but high registers and in most writing:<ref>{{cite book|last=Fornaciari|first=Raffaello | title=Sintassi italiana |url=https://archive.org/details/sintassiitaliana00forn| place=[[Florence]] | year=1881}} See an excerpt at {{cite web | title=Grammatica italiana - L'imperfetto nelle frasi condizionali | url=http://www.mauriziopistone.it/testi/discussioni/gramm06_imperfetto.html | accessdate=2007-10-08}}</ref>\n{|\n| ''Se lo sapevo, andavo alla spiaggia'' || (\"If I had known it, I would have gone to the beach.\")\n|-\n| ''Se Lucia non faceva quel segno, la risposta sarebbe probabilmente stata diversa.''<ref>[[Alessandro Manzoni]], ''[[I promessi sposi]]'', chapter 3</ref> || (\"If Lucia had not made that sign, the answer would probably have been different.\")\n|}\n\nThe conditional can also be used in Italian to express \"could\", with the conjugated forms of ''potere'' (\"to be able to\"), \"should\", with the conjugated forms of ''dovere'' (\"to have to\"), or \"would like\", with the conjugated forms of \"volere\" (want):\n{|\n| ''[Lui] potrebbe leggere un libro.'' || (\"He could read a book.\")\n|-\n| ''[Loro] dovrebbero andare a letto.'' || (\"They should go to bed.\")\n|-\n| ''Vorrei un bicchiere d'acqua, perfavore.'' || (\"I would like a glass of water, please.\")\n|}\n\n====Imperative mood====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse\" border=\"1\"\n!\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n|-\n!

In particular, the [[auxiliary verb]]s ''essere'' and ''avere'', and the common [[modal verb]]s ''potere'' (ability, to be able to, can), ''dovere'' (duty, to have to, must), ''sapere'' (knowledge, to know how to) and ''volere'' (will, to want to) are all irregular.  Many of the irregularities are accounted for by the substance of [[Latin grammar]]; in Latin the verb had four [[principal parts]], of which the third and fourth (perfect stem and perfect passive participle) were formed regularly from the present stem only in the first and second conjugations, whereas in the third and fourth (in ''-ere'' with short ''e'' and in ''-ire'') the presence of the ''i'' on the stem caused a mutation of the following consonants and made irregularities at a very early stage of the language.\n\nThe first conjugation has the majority of regular verbs (except \"andare\" (to go), \"fare\" (to do, to make (from third Latin conjugation)), \"dare\" (to give) and \"stare\" (to stay), which are strongly irregular). Almost every new verb (as neologism) enters in first conjugation (e.g. ''formattare'' (to format)) and is perfectly regular.\n\nThe second conjugation is usually irregular. The few regulars are from Latin second conjugation: like \"temere\" (to fear), \"godere\" (to enjoy)... The majority is from Latin third conjugation. Most of these have developed irregularities in Italian.\n\nThe third conjugation (deriving from Latin fourth conjugation) has two different ways: Greek one (or incohative) with insertion of -sc-, \"capire\" (to understand), \"io capisco\" (I understand), and Latin one with no insertion, \"sentire\" (to feel), \"io sento\" (I feel). There are some irregulars, but not too many: example, \"morire\" (to die), \"io muoio\" (I die). The verb \"dire\" (to say, to tell) derives from Latin third conjugation, and is strongly irregular.\n\nMost verbs of the second conjugation are irregular in the ''passato remoto'' (preterite) tense, which resembles the Latin [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse\" border=\"1\"\n|+ ''essere'' (to be; auxiliary)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"4\" | Indicative\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" | Subjunctive\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\" | Conditional\n|-\n!

E.g. ''lenta'' \"slow (feminine)\" becomes ''lenta'''mente''''' \"slowly\". Adjectives ending in ''-re'' or ''-le'' lose their ''e'' before adding ''-mente'' (''facile'' \"easy\" becomes ''facil'''mente''''' \"easily\", ''particolare'' \"particular\" becomes ''particolar'''mente''''' \"particularly\").\n\nThese adverbs can also be derived from the [[Italian grammar#Degrees of comparison|absolute superlative]] form of adjectives, e.g. ''lent'''issima'''mente'' (\"very slowly\"), ''facil'''issima'''mente'' (\"very easily\").\n\nThere is also a plethora of temporal, local, modal and interrogative adverbs, mostly derived from Latin, e.g. ''quando'' (\"when\"), ''dove'' (\"where\"), ''come'' (\"how\"), ''perch\u00e9'' (\"why\"/\"because\"), ''mai'' (\"never\"), ''sempre'' (\"always\"), etc.\n\n==Prepositions==\nItalian has a [[closed class]] of basic prepositions, to which a number of [[adverb]]s can be added that also double as prepositions, e.g.: ''sopra il tavolo'' (\"upon the table\"), ''prima di adesso'' (\"before now\").\n\nIn modern Italian the prepositions ''tra'' and ''fra'' are interchangeable, and often chosen on the basis of [[euphony]]: ''tra fratelli'' (\"among brothers\") vs. ''fra i tralicci'' (\"between the power pylons\").\n\nIn modern Italian, all the basic prepositions except ''tra'', ''fra'' and ''per'' have to be combined with an article placed next to them.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Italian\n! English\n! Preposition + article\n|-\n| '''di'''\n| of, from\n| del, dello, della, dell', dei, degli, delle\n|-\n| '''a'''\n| to, at\n| al, allo, alla, all', ai, agli, alle\n|-\n| '''da'''\n| from, by, since\n| dal, dallo, dalla, dall', dai, dagli, dalle\n|-\n| '''in'''\n| in\n| nel, nello, nella, nell', nei, negli, nelle\n|-\n| '''con'''\n| with\n| con il ''or'' col, con lo, con la, con l', con i ''or'' coi, con gli, con le\n|-\n| '''su'''\n| on, about\n| sul, sullo, sulla, sull', sui, sugli, sulle\n|-\n| '''per'''\n| for, through\n| per il, per lo, per la, per l', per i, per gli, per le\n|-\n| '''tra'''/'''fra'''\n| between, among\n| tra il, tra lo, tra la, tra l', tra i, tra gli, tra le\n|}\n\n==Syntax==\nItalian is an [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] language. Nevertheless, the SVO sequence is sometimes replaced by one of the other arrangements (SOV, VSO, OVS, etc.), especially for reasons of emphasis and, in literature, for reasons of style and metre: Italian has relatively free word order.\n\nThe subject is usually [[null subject language|omitted when it is a pronoun]] \u2013 distinctive verb conjugations make it redundant.  Subject pronouns are considered emphatic when used at all.\n\nQuestions are formed by a rising intonation at the end of the sentence (in written form, a question mark). There is usually no other special marker, although [[wh-movement]] does usually occur. In general, intonation and context are important to recognize questions from affirmative statements.\n\n{|\n|-\n|''Davide \u00e8 arrivato in ufficio.'' || (David has arrived at the office.)\n|-\n|''Davide \u00e8 arrivato in ufficio?'' || (\"Talking about David\u2026 did he arrive at the office?\" or \"Davide has arrived at the office? Really?\" - depending on the intonation)\n|-\n|''Perch\u00e9 Davide \u00e8 arrivato in ufficio?'' || (Why has David arrived at the office?)\n|-\n|''Perch\u00e9 Davide \u00e8 arrivato in ufficio.'' || (Because David has arrived at the office.)\n|-\n|''\u00c8 arrivato Davide in ufficio.'' || (\"It was '''David''' who arrived at the office\" or \"David '''arrived''' at the office\" - depending on the intonation)\n|-\n|''\u00c8 arrivato Davide in ufficio?'' || (Has David arrived at the office?)\n|-\n|''\u00c8 arrivato in ufficio.'' || (He has arrived at the office.)\n|-\n|''(Lui) \u00e8 arrivato in ufficio.'' || ('''He''' has arrived at the office.)\n|-\n|''Chi \u00e8 arrivato in ufficio?'' || (Who has arrived at the office?)\n|}\n\nIn general, adjectives come after the noun they modify, adverbs after the verb.  But: as with [[french grammar|French]], adjectives coming before the noun indicate essential quality of the noun.  Demonstratives (e.g. ''questo'' this, ''quello'' that) come before the noun, and a few particular adjectives (e.g. ''bello'') may be inflected like demonstratives and placed before the noun.\n\n==Disputed points in Italian grammar==\nAmong sometimes proscribed Italian forms are:\n* The usage of an indicative form where a subjunctive one is traditional; for instance: ''credo che Giorgio ieri fosse a casa'' (\"I believe that yesterday George was at home\") is considered proper, while ''credo che Giorgio ieri era a casa'' may not be; ''se Maria fosse stata a casa, le avrei telefonato'' (\"if Mary had been at home, I would have telephoned her\") is preferred, ''se Maria era a casa le telefonavo'' is often proscribed, despite being found in classic Italian writers\n* The use of the object forms (''lui'', ''lei'', ''loro'' and ''Lei'') of third person pronouns instead of the subject forms (''egli'', ''ella'', ''essi'' and ''Ella''), which are employed in formal language\n* ''Ma per\u00f2'', despite being widespread in spoken language, is proscribed in formal usage because it is redundant (''ma'' and ''per\u00f2'' are synonyms).\n\n==Italian grammar books==\nThe first Italian grammar was printed by [[Giovanni Francesco Fortunio]] in 1516 with the title ''[[Regole grammaticali della volgar lingua]]''.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRumIF1TLVkC&lpg=PA221&dq=Giovan%20Francesco%20Fortunio&lr=&hl=es&pg=PA221#v=onepage&q=Giovan%20Francesco%20Fortunio&f=false\n|title=Las lenguas rom\u00e1nicas est\u00e1ndar: (historia de su formaci\u00f3n y de su uso)\n|author=Michael Metzeltin\n|publisher=Academia Llingua Asturiana\n|year=2004\n|place=Uvi\u00e9u, Asturias\n|isbn=84-8168-356-6\n|page=221\n}}</ref> Ever since, several Italian and foreign scholars have published works devoted to its description.

Italian words can be divided into the following [[lexical categories]]: articles, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.\n\n==Articles==\nItalian articles vary according to definiteness ([[Article (grammar)#Definite article|definite]], [[Article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite]], and [[Article (grammar)#Partitive article|partitive]]), [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]], and the initial sound of the subsequent word. Partitive articles compound the preposition ''[[wikt:di#Italian|di]]'' with the corresponding definite article, to express uncertain quantity.

masculine pronouns and adjectives are used to refer to and describe unspecified neuter things such as facts and ideas (e.g. ''Lo so'' (\"I know it\"), where ''lo'' is the masculine third-person singular unstressed direct object pronoun).\n\n==Nouns==\nMost nouns are derived from Latin. Many of these are themselves borrowed from Greek (e.g. ''poeta'' below):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+Derivation of noun inflections\n|-\n![[Latin declension]]\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n|-\n|1st (-a / -ae)     || ''poet'''a''' / poet'''i''''' \"poet(s)\"          || ''ros'''a''' / ros'''e''''' \"rose(s)\"\n|-\n|2nd (-us / -\u012b; -um / -a)     || ''carr'''o''' / carr'''i''''' \"truck(s)\"<br>''vezz'''o''' / vezz'''i''''' \"habit(s)\"         || \n|-\n|3rd (-\u00d8, -is / -\u0113s) || ''can'''e''' / can'''i''''' \"dog(s)\"             || ''paret'''e''' / paret'''i''''' \"wall(s)\"\n|-\n|3rd (-\u0101s / -\u0101t\u0113s)  ||                                                  || ''citt'''ade''' / citt'''adi''''' \"town(s) (archaic)\"\n|-\n|4th (-us / -\u016bs)    || ''pass'''o''' / pass'''i''''' \"step(s)\"          || ''man'''o''' / man'''i''''' \"hand(s)\"\n|-\n|5th (-\u0113s / -\u0113s)  ||                                                  || ''fed'''e''' / fed'''i''''' \"faith(s)\"\n|}\n\nAny other noun, both those from Latin with an unusual ending and those derived from languages other than Latin or Greek, are usually not Latinized , and nouns ending with a stressed vowel are not inflected; thus:\n* ''il re'' / ''i re'' (\"the king(s)\": ''rex / reges'')\n* ''il caff\u00e8'' / ''i caff\u00e8'' (\"the coffee(s)\")\n* ''il film'' / ''i film'' (\"the film(s)\")\n\nThere are certain words (neuter in Latin) that are masculine in the singular and feminine or masculine in the plural:\n* ''il braccio'' / ''le braccia'' or ''i bracci'' (\"the arm(s)\")\n* ''l'uovo'' / ''le uova'' (\"the egg(s)\")\n* ''il ginocchio'' / ''le ginocchia'' or ''i ginocchi'' (\"the knee(s)\")\n* ''il sopracciglio'' / ''le sopracciglia'' or ''i sopraccigli'' (\"the eyebrow(s)\")\nThese nouns' endings derive regularly from the Latin neuter endings of the second declension (sg. ''-um'' / pl. ''-a''), but there are some from the third declension as well: e.g. ''il gregge / le greggi'' (flock(s), but ''i greggi'' works, too); the tradition of calling them \"irregular\" or \"mobile gender\" (''genere mobile'') would come from the paradigm that there are so few nouns of this kind that the existence of neuter can be considered vestigial. The choice of plural is sometimes left to the user, while in some cases there are differences of meaning:<ref>[http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/lingua-italiana/consulenza-linguistica/domande-risposte/plurali-doppi Accademia della Crusca, ''Plurali doppi'']</ref>\n* Sometimes, for body parts, the feminine/neuter plural denotes the literal meaning while the masculine one denotes a figurative meaning: ''il braccio'' (\"the arm\") / ''le braccia'' (\"the arms\") / ''i bracci'' (\"the isthmuses\", \"the inlets\"); ''il corno'' (\"the horn\") / ''le corna'' (\"the horns\" of an animal) / ''i corni'' (\"the horns\" as musical instruments)\n* Sometimes, especially in poetic and old-fashioned Italian, the masculine plural acts as a [[count noun]], while the neuter/feminine plural acts as a [[mass noun]]: ''il cervello'' (\"the brain\") / ''due cervelli'' (\"two brains\") / ''le cervella'' (\"the cerebral matter\"); ''l'anello'' (\"the ring\") / ''due anelli'' (\"two rings\") / ''le anella'' (\"ringlets\"); furthermore, ''il dito'' (\"the finger\") / ''le dita'' (\"the fingers\") and also ''due dita'' (\"two fingers\") / but ''i diti indici'' (\"the index fingers\")\n\n===Irregular plurals===\nThere are a few genuine irregular plurals in Italian (''[[:it:plurali irregolari|plurali irregolari]]''). Most of these were introduced in Vulgar Latin, but some derive from irregular Latin plurals. Examples include:\n*''uomo / uomini'' (man/men; Latin ''homo / homines '')\n*''il dio / gli dei'' (god(s); note also the irregularity in the article: ''gli'' instead of ''i'')\n*''bue / buoi'' (ox(en); Latin ''bovem / boves'')\n*''tempio / templi'' (temple(s); the plural retains the ''l'' from Latin ''templum/templi'' which is lost in the singular in order to distinguish it from ''tempi'', the plural of ''tempo'')\n*''il carcere / le carceri'' (prison (''masculine'') / prisons (''feminine''))\n*''l'eco / gli echi'' (echo (''feminine'') / echoes (''masculine''))\n\n===Alteration===\nIn Italian, altered nouns are nouns with particular shades of meaning. They are divided into [[diminutive]]s, \"vezzeggiativi\" (diminutives with kindness and sympathy nuance), [[augmentative]]s and [[pejorative]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|\n!

The [[markedness|unmarked]] placement for most adjectives (e.g. colours, nationalities) is after the noun,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=4299&ctg_id=45 |title=Accademia della Crusca, ''Sulla posizione dell'aggettivo qualificativo in italiano'' |access-date=2009-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720031420/http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=4299&ctg_id=45 |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but this is reversed for a few common classes of adjective &mdash; those denoting beauty, age, goodness, and size are placed ''before'' the noun in the unmarked case, and after the noun for emphasis.\n\nPlacing the adjective after the noun can alter its meaning or indicate [[restrictiveness]] of reference. If a noun has many adjectives, usually no more than one will be before the noun.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008|reason=\"un nuovo grande edificio\"}}\n\n*''un libro rosso'' = a red book (the unmarked case)\n*''un rosso libro'' = a book that is red (the marked case; it is especially important to the intended meaning that the book is *red*, as opposed to some other color)\n*''un buon uomo'' = a good man (the unmarked case)\n*''un uomo buono'' = a man who is good (the marked case; it is especially important to the intended meaning that he is good, the adjective is emphasized)\n\nAdjectives are inflected for gender and number:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Gender\n!Grammatical number\n!Case 1\n!Case 2\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Masculine\n|Singular\n| -o\n| -e\n|-\n|Plural\n| -i\n| -i\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Feminine\n|Singular\n| -a\n| -e\n|-\n|Plural\n| -e\n| -i\n|}\n\n===Degrees of comparison===\nItalian has three [[degrees of comparison]]: [[comparative]], relative [[superlative]] and absolute superlative.\n\nThe comparative and relative superlative are formed with ''pi\u00f9'' (\"more\", \"most\"); for instance:\n* ''sono '''pi\u00f9 alto''' di te'' (\"I am taller than you\")\n* ''sono '''il pi\u00f9 alto''' fra gli uomini'' (\"I am the tallest of men\")\n\nVice versa, inverting the order of the words, it's required to replace ''pi\u00f9'' with ''meno'' (\"less, fewer\"); for instance:\n* ''sono''' il meno forte''' del campionato'' (\"I am the least strong of the championship\")\n* ''tu sei '''meno alto''' di me '' (\"You are less tall than me\")\n\nAnother comparative form is made with the word ''come'' ('as', 'like'); for instance:\n* ''sono alto come te'' (\"I am as tall as you\")\n\nThe ''absolute comparative'' is formed by placing ''troppo'' (\"too\") before the adjective; for instance: \n* ''sei troppo buono'' (\"you are too good\").\n\nThe ''absolute superlative'', derived from the Latin synthetic superlative in ''-issimus'', is formed by adding ''-issimo'' to an adjective: ''intelligente'' (\"intelligent\"), ''intelligent'''issimo''''' (\"very intelligent\"); ''sporco'' (\"dirty\") ''sporch'''issimo''''' (\"very dirty\"). If the two letters before the last vowel are ''pr'' or ''br'' (e.g., ''aspro'', ''celebre''), the ''r'' is removed and ''-errimo'' is the suffix used (''asp'''errimo''''', ''celeb'''errimo''''') (\"very sour\", \"very famous\").\nAnother way to form the ''absolute superlative'' is to place either ''molto'' or ''assai'' (\"very\") before the adjective. For instance ''sporchissimo'' and ''molto sporco'' (\"very dirty\") are the same, although the form ending in ''issimo'' is usually perceived as more emphatic; that is, ''sporchissimo'' is dirtier than ''molto sporco''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nSome adjectives have irregular comparatives (though with regularly-formed variants also in common use), like\n* ''buono'' (\"good\"), ''migliore'' / ''pi\u00f9 buono'' (\"better\" or \"best\"), ''migliore'' / ''ottimo'' / ''buonissimo'' (\"very good\")\n* ''cattivo'' (\"bad\"), ''peggiore'' / ''pi\u00f9 cattivo'' (\"worse\" or \"worst\"), ''pessimo'' / ''cattivissimo'' (\"very bad\")\n* ''grande'' (\"big\"), ''maggiore'' / ''pi\u00f9 grande'' (\"bigger\"), ''massimo'' / ''grandissimo'' (\"very big\")\n* ''piccolo'' (\"small\"), ''minore'' / ''pi\u00f9 piccolo'' (\"smaller\"), ''minimo'' / ''piccolissimo'' (\"very small\")\n\n===Possessive adjectives===\nWith the exception of 3rd person plural ''loro'' 'their', possessive adjectives, like articles, must agree with the gender and number of the noun they modify. Hence, ''mio zio'' (my uncle), but ''mia zia'' (my aunt). So depending on what is being modified, the possessive adjectives are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Person\n!colspan=2|Masculine\n!colspan=2|Feminine\n|-\n!Singular\n!Plural\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n|1st sing. || mio || miei || mia || mie\n|-\n|2nd sing. || tuo || tuoi || tua || tue\n|-\n|3rd sing. || suo || suoi ||sua || sue\n|-\n|1st pl. || nostro || nostri ||nostra ||nostre\n|-\n|2nd pl. || vostro || vostri || vostra || vostre\n|-\n|3rd pl. || colspan=\"4\"| loro\n|}\n\nIn most cases the possessive adjective is used with an article, usually the [[definite article]]:\n\n{|\n|-\n|''Ho perso '''la mia''' penna.'' || (\"I have lost my pen.\")\n|-\n|''Mi piace '''il mio''' lavoro.'' || (\"I like my job.\")\n|-\n|''Hanno rubato '''la mia''' automobile!'' || (\"They have stolen my car!\")\n|}\n\nAnd sometimes with the [[indefinite article]]:\n\n{|\n|-\n|'''''Un mio''' amico mi ha detto che...'' || (\"A friend of mine told me that...\")\n|-\n|''Ho visto '''una sua''' foto.'' || (\"I have seen a photograph of him/her.\")\n|-\n|''Luca \u00e8 '''un mio''' amico.'' || (\"Luke is a friend of mine.\")\n|}\n\nThe only exception is when the possessive refers to an individual family member (unless the family member is described or characterized in some way):\n\n{|\n|-\n|''Laura \u00e8 '''mia''' sorella'' || (\"Laura is my sister.\")\n|-\n|''Ieri ho visto '''mia''' sorella Diana'' || (\"I saw my sister Diana yesterday.\")\n|-\n|''Questa penna \u00e8 di '''mia''' zia.'' || (\"This pen is my aunt's.\")\n|}\n\n''Mamma'' and ''pap\u00e0'' (or ''babbo'', in Central Italy; \"mother\" and \"father\"), however, are usually used with the article.\n\nFor emphasis, however, possessive adjectives are sometimes placed after the noun. This is usually after words like 'colpa' (fault, sin); 'casa' (house, home); 'merito' (merit); 'piacere' (pleasure); or in [[vocative]] expressions.\n\n{|\n|-\n|''\u00c8 colpa '''sua'''.'' || (\"It is his/her fault.\")\n|-\n|''Oh dio '''mio'''!'' || (\"Oh, my god!\")\n|-\n|''Arrivederci, amico '''mio'''!'' || (\"Goodbye, my friend!\")\n|-\n|''Vorresti andare a casa '''mia'''?'' || (\"Would you like to come over to my house?\")\n|}\n\nIf the antecedent of a third person possessive (being used as an object) is the subject of the sentence, ''proprio'' can be used instead of ''suo'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=7689&ctg_id=45 |title=Accademia della Crusca, ''Impiego di ''Proprio'' e ''Suo'''' |access-date=2009-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720031553/http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=7689&ctg_id=45 |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> though the usage of ''proprio'' is declining in spoken language:{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n{|\n|-\n|''Marco e Maria hanno discusso di filosofia.

Marco ha scelto il '''suo''' punto di vista.'' || (\"Marco and Maria discussed philosophy. Marco took '''his/her''' point of view.\")\n|}\n\nThe first sentence is unambiguous and states that Marco took his own point of view, whereas the second sentence is ambiguous because it may mean that Marco took either his own or Maria's point of view.\n\n===Demonstrative adjectives===\nItalian originally had three degrees of [[demonstrative]] adjectives: ''questo'' (for items near or related to the first person speaker: English \"this\"), ''quello'' (for items near or related to an eventual third person: English \"that\"), and ''codesto'' (for items near or related to an eventual second person). The usage has undergone a simplification, including the meaning of ''codesto'' in ''quello'', and only [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] speakers still use ''codesto''. Its use is very rare in modern language, and the word has acquired a rather pejorative connotation.\n\n==Pronouns==\n\nItalian features a sizeable set of pronouns. [[Personal pronoun]]s are inflected for person, number, case, and, in the third person, gender. Literary subject pronouns also have a distinction between animate (''egli'', ''ella'') and inanimate (''esso'', ''essa'') [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]s, although this is lost in colloquial usage, where ''lui'', ''lei'' and ''loro'' are the most used forms for animate subjects, while no specific pronoun is employed for inanimate subjects (if needed, demonstrative pronouns such as \"questo\" or \"quello\" may be used).  There is also the uninflected pronoun ''ci\u00f2'', which is only used with abstract antecedents.\n\nPersonal pronouns are normally [[null subject language|omitted in the subject]], as the conjugation is usually enough to determine the grammatical person. They are used when some emphasis is needed, e.g. ''sono italiano'' (\"I am Italian\") vs. ''io sono italiano'' (\"''I'' [specifically, as opposed to others] am Italian\").\n\nThe words ''ci'', ''vi'' and ''ne'' act both as personal pronouns (respectively instrumental and genitive case) and clitic [[pro-form]]s for \"there\" (''ci'' and ''vi'', with identical meaning \u2013 as in '''''c''''\u00e8'', '''''ci''' sono'', '''''v''''\u00e8'', '''''vi''' sono'', '''''ci''' vengo'', etc.) and \"from there\" (''ne'' \u2013 as in ''\u00e8 entrato in casa alle 10:00 e '''ne''' \u00e8 uscito alle 11:00'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ [[Personal pronoun]]s\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"border: none;\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Nominative]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Genitive]]\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Dative]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Accusative]]\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]\n|-\n!

The extent to which individual pronouns are elided varies, ranging from virtually always (''lo'' and ''la'') to rarely (''ne'').}}\n! ''Stressed form''\n!

This also happens when the [[underlying representation|underlying]] pronoun is made opaque by elision: ''l'ho svegliat'''o''''' (\"I woke ''him'' up\"), versus  ''L'ho svegliat'''a''''' (\"I woke ''her'' up\").}}\n!

In the [[infinitive]], [[gerund]] and, except with third-person courtesy forms, [[imperative mood]]s clitic pronouns must ''always'' be compound to the suffix as enclitics<ref>This was not always the case, however. It is not rare indeed to find in [[opera]] [[libretto]]s the clitic before the imperative, as in ''Ti ferma!'' (which in standard Italian means \"He/She/It stops you!\") instead of the standard ''Fermati!'' (which means \"Stop yourself!\"). However this usage today is completely non-standard and modern listeners might have difficulties with it when approaching old texts.</ref> (as in ''confessalo!'' [2p. sg.]/''confessiamolo!'' [1p. pl.]/''confessatelo!'' [2p. pl.], ''ricordandolo'' and ''mangiarlo'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples of clitic pronouns\n|-\n|\n! Italian\n! English\n|-\n!

Though widely used, this redundant usage is considered non-standard.\n\n==== Combinations of clitics ====\n\nIn Italian it is possible to append more than one clitic to a single verb. In normal usage, two is the usual limit, although clusters of three can occasionally arise for some speakers,<ref>Lepschy, Giulio and Anna Laura Lepschy. 1998. The Italian Language Today. New York: New Amsterdam Books. p. 214</ref> especially with impersonal constructs (e.g. '''''Ce la si''' sente'' = \"One feels up to it\", or ''Nessuno ha ancora visto l'ultimo film di Woody Allen, quindi '''ce lo si''' vede tutti insieme!'' = \"Nobody has watched the last Woody Allen movie yet, so we have to watch it together!\"). Any two cases can be used together, except for accusative + genitive, and word order is strictly determined according to one of the following two patterns:<ref>Lepschy, Giulio and Anna Laura Lepschy. 1998. The Italian Language Today. New York: New Amsterdam Books. p. 212</ref>\n\n<ol><li>When one clitic is third-person non-reflexive accusative or genitive, form II. of the other clitic is used.

The alliterated form of ''che'' is always pronounced /k/, also when otherwise common phonetic rules switch their pronunciations<ref>(with ''ho'', ''hai'', ''ha'', ''hanno'', and verbal forms beginning by ''a'', ''o'' or ''u'')</ref>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples of alliterated forms\n|-\n! clitic form\n!

The second-person nominative pronoun is ''tu'' for informal use, and for formal use, the third-person form ''Lei'' has been used since the Renaissance.<ref name=serianni>{{cite book| last = Serianni| first = Luca| title = Italiano| publisher = Garzanti| year = 1997| isbn = 88-11-50470-8}}</ref> It is used like \"Sie\" in German, \"usted\" in Spanish, and \"vous\" in French. ''Lei'' was originally an object form of ''ella'', which in turn referred to an [[honorific]] of the feminine gender such as ''la magnificenza tua/vostra'' (\"Your Magnificence\") or ''Vossignoria'' (\"Your Lordship\"),<ref>Maiden, Martin, M.Mair Parry. 1997. The dialects of Italy. P.113</ref> and by analogy, ''Loro'' came to be used as the formal plural. Previously, and in some Italian regions today (e.g. Campania), ''voi'' was used as the formal singular, like French \"vous\". The pronouns ''lei'' (third-person singular), ''Lei'' (formal second-person singular), ''loro'' (third-person plural), and ''Loro'' (formal second-person plural) are pronounced the same but written as shown, and formal ''Lei'' and ''Loro'' take third-person conjugations. Formal ''Lei'' is invariable for gender (always feminine), but adjectives that modify it are not: one would say to a man '''''La''' conosco'' (\"I know you\") but ''Lei \u00e8 alt'''o''''' (\"You are tall\").  Formal ''Loro'' is variable for gender: '''''Li''' conosco'' (\"I know you [masc. pl.]\") vs. '''''Le''' conosco'' (\"I know you [fem. pl.]\"), etc. The formal plural is very rarely used in modern Italian; the unmarked form is widely used instead.<ref>[http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/lingua-italiana/consulenza-linguistica/domande-risposte/pronomi-cortesia Accademia della Crusca, ''Sui pronomi di cortesia'']</ref> For example: ''Gino, Lei \u00e8 un bravo ingegnere. Marco, Lei \u00e8 un bravo architetto. Insieme, voi sarete una gran bella squadra'' (\"Gino, you are a good engineer. Marco, you are a good architect. Together, you will make a very good team\").\n\n==Verbs==\n{{Main|Italian conjugation}}\n\nItalian ''infiniti presenti'' may end in one of these three endings, either ''-are'', ''-ere'', or ''-ire''. Exceptions are also possible: ''fare'' \"to do/make\" (from Latin ''facere''); and  verbs ending in ''-urre'' or ''-arre'', most notably ''tradurre'' (Latin ''traducere'') \"to translate\".<ref>[[#berloco-2018|Berloco 2018]]</ref> Italian grammar does not have distinct forms to indicate specifically verbal [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], though different verbal inflections and periphrases do [[Grammatical aspect#Romance languages|render different aspects]], in particular the [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] and [[imperfective aspect]]s and the [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tense\u2013aspect combination. While the various inflected verbal forms convey a combination of [[Grammatical tense|tense]] (location in time), aspect, and [[Grammatical mood|mood]], language-specific discussions generally refer to these [[inflection]]al forms as \"tempi\", for this reason it is impossible to make comparisons between the tenses of English verbs and the tempi of Italian verbs as there is no correspondence at all.\n\n===Tenses===\n\n====Simple tenses====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Verbs in the [[passive voice]] use ''[[wikt:essere#Italian|essere]]'' or ''[[wikt:venire#Italian|venire]]'', with different meanings:\n*  ''La porta \u00e8 stata aperta.'' (\"The door has been opened.\")\n* ''La porta viene aperta.'' (\"The door is being opened.\")\n\nFor intransitive verbs a reliable rule cannot be given, although a useful rule of thumb is that if a verb's past participle can take on [[Adjective|adjectival]] value, ''essere'' is used, otherwise ''avere''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=5060&ctg_id=44 |title=Accademia della Crusca, ''La scelta degli ausiliari'' |access-date=2009-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530183706/http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=5060&ctg_id=44 |archive-date=2009-05-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=4125&ctg_id=44 |title=Accademia della Crusca, ''Ausiliare con i verbi intransitivi'' |access-date=2009-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720031759/http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/faq/faq_risp.php?id=4125&ctg_id=44 |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Also, [[reflexive verb]]s and [[unaccusative verb]]s use ''essere'' (typically non-agentive verbs of motion and change of state, i.e. involuntary actions like ''[[wikt:cadere#Italian|cadere]]'' (\"to fall\") or ''[[wikt:morire#Italian|morire]]'' (\"to die\")). {{Citation needed|date=June 2008|reason=\"Crusca article gives a different interpretation, saying that verbs that can be used as adjectives too go with essere - also, see 'andare' as a counterexample\"}}\n\nThe distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tenses and is essential to the [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] of the past participle. Some verbs use can both, though, like ''[[wikt:vivere#Italian|vivere]]'' (\"to live\"): ''Io ho vissuto'' (\"I have lived\") can alternatively be expressed as, ''Io sono vissuto''.\n\n===Past participle===\nThe past participle is used in Italian as both an adjective and to form many of the compound tenses of the language. There are regular endings for the past participle, based on the conjugation class ([[#Non-finite forms|see below]]). There are, however, many irregular forms as not all verbs follow the pattern, particularly the -ere verbs. Some of the more common irregular past participles include: ''essere'' (to be) \u2192 ''stato'' (same for ''stare''); ''fare'' (to do, to make) \u2192 ''fatto''; ''dire'' (to say, to tell) \u2192 ''detto''; ''aprire'' (to open) \u2192 ''aperto''; ''chiedere'' (to ask) \u2192 ''chiesto''; ''chiudere'' (to close) \u2192 ''chiuso''; ''leggere'' (to read) \u2192 ''letto''; ''mettere'' (to put) \u2192 ''messo''; ''perdere'' (to lose) \u2192 ''perso''; ''prendere'' (to take, to get) \u2192 ''preso''; ''rispondere'' (to answer) \u2192 ''risposto''; ''scrivere'' (to write) \u2192 ''scritto''; ''vedere'' (to see) \u2192 ''visto''.\n\nFor the intransitive verbs taking ''essere'', the past participle always agrees with the subject\u2014that is, it follows the usual adjective agreement rules: ''egli \u00e8 partito; ella \u00e8 partita''.  This is also true for [[reflexive verb]]s, the impersonal ''si'' construction (which requires any adjectives that refer to it to be in the masculine plural: ''Si \u00e8 sempre stanch'''i''' alla fine della giornata'' - One is always tired at the end of the day), and the passive voice, which also use ''essere'' (''Queste mele sono state comprat'''e''' da loro'' - These apple have been bought by them, against ''Essi hanno comprat'''o''' queste mele'' - They bought these apples).\n\nThe past participle when used with ''avere'' never changes to agree with the subject. It ''must'' agree with ''the object'', though, in sentences where this is expressed by a third person clitic pronoun (e.g. ''Hai mangiato la mela? - S\u00ec, '''l<nowiki>'</nowiki>'''ho mangiat'''a''''' (Have you eaten the apple? - Yes, I have eaten it)). When the object is expressed by a first or second person clitic pronoun instead, the agreement is optional: ''Maria! Ti ha chiamat'''o''' / chiamat'''a''' Giovanni? - No, non mi ha chiamat'''o''' / chiamat'''a''''' (Maria! Has Giovanni called you? - No, he has not).\n\nIn all the other cases where the object is not expressed by a clitic pronoun, the agreement with the object is obsolescent in modern Italian (but still correct): ''La storia che avete raccontat'''a''''' (obsolete) ''/ raccontat'''o''' non mi convince'' (The story you told does not convince me); or compare [[Alessandro Manzoni|Manzoni]]'s ''Lucia aveva avut'''e''' due buone ragioni''<ref>[[Alessandro Manzoni]], ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' (1827)</ref> with the more modern ''Lucia aveva avut'''o''' due buone ragioni'' (Lucia had had two good reasons).\n\n===Tense relationship in subordinate sentences===\n\nItalian inherits ''consecutio temporum'', a grammar rule from Latin that governs the relationship between the tenses in principal and subordinate clauses. ''Consecutio temporum'' has very rigid rules. These rules require the subjunctive tense in order to express contemporaneity, posteriority and anteriority in relation with the principal clause.\n\n* To express contemporaneity when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, present, or simple past,) the subordinate clause uses the present subjunctive, to express ''contemporaneity in the present''.\n** ''Penso che Davide '''sia''' intelligente.'' I think David is smart.\n* When the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subordinate clause uses the imperfect subjunctive, expressing ''contemporaneity in the past''.\n** ''Pensavo che Davide '''fosse''' intelligente''.  I thought David was smart.\n* To express anteriority when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, or present or passato prossimo) the subordinate clause uses the past subjunctive.\n** ''Penso che Davide '''sia stato''' intelligente.''  I think David has been smart.\n* To express anteriority when the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subjunctive has to be pluperfect.\n** ''Pensavo che Davide '''fosse stato''' intelligente.'' I thought David had been smart.\n* To express posteriority the subordinate clause uses the future tense in the indicative mood, not the subjunctive, because the subjunctive has no future tense.\n** ''Penso che Davide '''sar\u00e0''' intelligente.'' I think David will be smart.\n* To express posteriority with respect to a past event, the subordinate clause uses the past conditional, whereas in other European languages (such as French, English, and Spanish) the present conditional is used.\n** ''Pensavo che Davide '''sarebbe stato''' intelligente.'' I thought that David would have been smart.\n\n===Regular conjugation===\nThe infinitive of first conjugation verbs ends in ''-are,'' that of second conjugation verbs in ''-ere,'' and that of third conjugation verbs in ''-ire.'' In the following examples for different [[Grammatical mood|moods]], the first conjugation verb is ''parlare'' (meaning ''to talk/speak''), the second conjugation verb is ''temere'' (''to fear'') and the third conjugation verb is ''partire'' (''to leave/depart''.)\n\n====Indicative mood====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse\" border=\"1\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Present'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Preterite'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Imperfect'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Simple future'''\n|-\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n|-\n! io\n| parlo\n| temo\n| parto\n| parlai\n| temetti; temei\n| partii\n| parlavo\n| temevo\n| partivo\n| parler\u00f2\n| temer\u00f2\n| partir\u00f2\n|-\n! tu\n| parli\n| temi\n| parti\n| parlasti\n| temesti\n| partisti\n| parlavi\n| temevi\n| partivi\n| parlerai\n| temerai\n| partirai\n|-\n! egli, ella, esso/essa\n| parla\n| teme\n| parte\n| parl\u00f2\n| temette; tem\u00e9\n| part\u00ec\n| parlava\n| temeva\n| partiva\n| parler\u00e0\n| temer\u00e0\n| partir\u00e0\n|-\n! noi\n| parliamo\n| temiamo\n| partiamo\n| parlammo\n| tememmo\n| partimmo\n| parlavamo\n| temevamo\n| partivamo\n| parleremo\n| temeremo\n| partiremo\n|-\n! voi\n| parlate\n| temete\n| partite\n| parlaste\n| temeste\n| partiste\n| parlavate\n| temevate\n| partivate\n| parlerete\n| temerete\n| partirete\n|-\n! essi/esse\n| parlano\n| temono\n| partono\n| parlarono\n| temettero; temerono\n| partirono\n| parlavano\n| temevano\n| partivano\n| parleranno\n| temeranno\n| partiranno\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Recent past''' = present of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Remote pluperfect''' = preterite of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Recent pluperfect''' = imperfect of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Future perfect''' = simple future of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n|}\n\nSome third conjugation verbs such as ''capire'' insert ''-isc-'' between the stem and the endings in the first, second, and third persons singular and third person plural of the present, e.g., capire -> ''capisco, capisci, capisce, capiamo, capite, capiscono''. It is impossible to tell from the infinitive form which verbs exhibit this phenomenon, which often originated in Latin verbs denoting the \"inchoative\" aspect of an action, that is, verbs describing the beginning of an action.<ref name=serianni/> There are some 500 verbs like this, the first ones in alphabetic order being ''abbellire'', ''abolire'', ''agire'', ''alleggerire'', ''ammattire'' and so forth.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Moretti\n  | first = G.

There are also certain verbs that end in -rre, namely ''trarre, porre, (con)durre'' and derived verbs with different prefixes (such as ''attrarre, comporre, dedurre,'' and so forth). They are derived from earlier ''trahere, ponere, ducere'' and are conjugated as such.\n\n====Subjunctive mood====\n\nThe Italian subjunctive mood is used to indicate cases of desire, express doubt, make impersonal emotional statements, and to talk about impeding events.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse\" border=\"1\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Present'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Imperfect'''\n|-\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n|-\n! io\n| parli\n| tema\n| parta\n| parlassi\n| temessi\n| partissi\n|-\n! tu\n| parli\n| tema\n| parta\n| parlassi\n| temessi\n| partissi\n|-\n! egli, ella, esso/essa\n| parli\n| tema\n| parta\n| parlasse\n| temesse\n| partisse\n|-\n! noi\n| parliamo\n| temiamo\n| partiamo\n| parlassimo\n| temessimo\n| partissimo\n|-\n! voi\n| parliate\n| temiate\n| partiate\n| parlaste\n| temeste\n| partiste\n|-\n! essi/esse\n|parlino\n|temano\n|partano\n|parlassero\n|temessero\n|partissero\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Past''' = present of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Past perfect''' = imperfect of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n|}\n\n*Third conjugation verbs like ''capire'' mentioned above insert ''-isc-'' in the first, second, and third persons singular and third person plural of the present.\n*Compound forms (''past'' and ''past perfect'') are made by adding the past participle (e.g. parlato) to the corresponding auxiliary form (as \"abbia\") in the present and imperfect.\n\n====Conditional mood====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse\" border=\"1\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"3\" | '''Present'''\n|-\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n|-\n! io\n| parlerei\n| temerei\n| partirei\n|-\n! tu\n| parleresti\n| temeresti\n| partiresti\n|-\n! egli, ella, esso/essa\n| parlerebbe\n| temerebbe\n| partirebbe\n|-\n! noi\n| parleremmo\n| temeremmo\n| partiremmo\n|-\n! voi\n| parlereste\n| temereste\n| partireste\n|-\n! essi/esse\n| parlerebbero\n| temerebbero\n| partirebbero\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\" | <small>'''Past''' = conditional of ''avere''/''essere'' + past participle</small>\n|}\n\nAs the table shows, verbs each take their own root from their class of verb: ''-are'' becomes -''er''-, -''ere'' becomes -''er''-, and -''ire'' becomes -''ir''-, the same roots as used in the future indicative tense. All verbs add the same ending to this root. \n\nSome verbs do not follow this pattern, but take irregular roots, these include:\nAndare (to go) ~ Andr-, Avere (to have) ~ Avr-, Bere (to drink) ~ Berr-,\nDare (to give) ~ Dar-, Dovere (to have to) ~ Dovr-, Essere (to be) ~ Sar-,\nFare (to make/do) ~ Far-, Godere (to enjoy) ~ Godr-, Potere (to be able to) ~ Potr-,\nRimanere (to remain) ~ Rimarr-, Sapere (to know) ~ Sapr-, Sedere (to sit) ~ Sedr-,\nStare (to be/feel) ~ Star-, Tenere (to hold) ~ Terr-, Vedere (to see) ~ Vedr-,\nVenire (to come) ~ Verr-, Vivere (to live) ~ Vivr-, Volere (to want) ~ Vorr- etc.\n\nThe Italian conditional mood is a mood that refers to an ''action'' that is possible or likely, but is dependent upon a '''condition'''. Example:\n{|\n| ''Io andrei in spiaggia, ma fa troppo freddo.'' || (\"I ''would'' go to the beach, '''but''' it is too cold.\")\n|}\n\nIt can be used in two tenses, the present, by conjugation of the appropriate noun, or the past, using the auxiliary conjugated in the conditional, with the past participle of the appropriate noun:\n{|\n| ''Mangerei un sacco adesso, se non stessi cercando di fare colpo su queste ragazze.'' || (\"I would eat a lot now, if I were not trying to impress these girls\")\n|-\n| ''Sarei andato in citt\u00e0, se avessi saputo che ci andavano loro.'' || (\"I would have gone to the city, if I had known that they were going.\")\n|}\n\nMany Italian speakers often use the imperfect instead of the conditional and subjunctive. Prescriptivists usually view this as incorrect, but it is frequent in colloquial speech and tolerated in all but high registers and in most writing:<ref>{{cite book|last=Fornaciari|first=Raffaello | title=Sintassi italiana |url=https://archive.org/details/sintassiitaliana00forn| place=[[Florence]] | year=1881}} See an excerpt at {{cite web | title=Grammatica italiana - L'imperfetto nelle frasi condizionali | url=http://www.mauriziopistone.it/testi/discussioni/gramm06_imperfetto.html | accessdate=2007-10-08}}</ref>\n{|\n| ''Se lo sapevo, andavo alla spiaggia'' || (\"If I had known it, I would have gone to the beach.\")\n|-\n| ''Se Lucia non faceva quel segno, la risposta sarebbe probabilmente stata diversa.''<ref>[[Alessandro Manzoni]], ''[[I promessi sposi]]'', chapter 3</ref> || (\"If Lucia had not made that sign, the answer would probably have been different.\")\n|}\n\nThe conditional can also be used in Italian to express \"could\", with the conjugated forms of ''potere'' (\"to be able to\"), \"should\", with the conjugated forms of ''dovere'' (\"to have to\"), or \"would like\", with the conjugated forms of \"volere\" (want):\n{|\n| ''[Lui] potrebbe leggere un libro.'' || (\"He could read a book.\")\n|-\n| ''[Loro] dovrebbero andare a letto.'' || (\"They should go to bed.\")\n|-\n| ''Vorrei un bicchiere d'acqua, perfavore.'' || (\"I would like a glass of water, please.\")\n|}\n\n====Imperative mood====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse\" border=\"1\"\n!\n! 1st Conj.\n! 2nd Conj.\n! 3rd Conj.\n|-\n!

Technically, the only real imperative forms are the second-person singular and plural, with the other persons being borrowed from the present subjunctive.\n\n====Non-finite forms====\n\n* '''Infinitive''': present: -are, -ere, -ire; past: avere/essere + past participle\n* '''Gerund''': present: -ando, -endo, -endo; past: avendo/essendo + past participle\n* '''Participle''': present: -ante -ente -ente; past: -ato, -uto (though verbs of the second conjugation almost always have a contracted desinence, e.g. \"cuocere\" (to cook) \"cotto\" (cooked)), -ito\n\n===Irregular verbs===\nWhile the majority of Italian verbs are regular, many of the most commonly used ones are [[irregular verb|irregular]].  In particular, the [[auxiliary verb]]s ''essere'' and ''avere'', and the common [[modal verb]]s ''potere'' (ability, to be able to, can), ''dovere'' (duty, to have to, must), ''sapere'' (knowledge, to know how to) and ''volere'' (will, to want to) are all irregular.  Many of the irregularities are accounted for by the substance of [[Latin grammar]]; in Latin the verb had four [[principal parts]], of which the third and fourth (perfect stem and perfect passive participle) were formed regularly from the present stem only in the first and second conjugations, whereas in the third and fourth (in ''-ere'' with short ''e'' and in ''-ire'') the presence of the ''i'' on the stem caused a mutation of the following consonants and made irregularities at a very early stage of the language.\n\nThe first conjugation has the majority of regular verbs (except \"andare\" (to go), \"fare\" (to do, to make (from third Latin conjugation)), \"dare\" (to give) and \"stare\" (to stay), which are strongly irregular). Almost every new verb (as neologism) enters in first conjugation (e.g. ''formattare'' (to format)) and is perfectly regular.\n\nThe second conjugation is usually irregular. The few regulars are from Latin second conjugation: like \"temere\" (to fear), \"godere\" (to enjoy)... The majority is from Latin third conjugation. Most of these have developed irregularities in Italian.\n\nThe third conjugation (deriving from Latin fourth conjugation) has two different ways: Greek one (or incohative) with insertion of -sc-, \"capire\" (to understand), \"io capisco\" (I understand), and Latin one with no insertion, \"sentire\" (to feel), \"io sento\" (I feel). There are some irregulars, but not too many: example, \"morire\" (to die), \"io muoio\" (I die). The verb \"dire\" (to say, to tell) derives from Latin third conjugation, and is strongly irregular.\n\nMost verbs of the second conjugation are irregular in the ''passato remoto'' (preterite) tense, which resembles the Latin [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse\" border=\"1\"\n|+ ''essere'' (to be; auxiliary)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"4\" | Indicative\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" | Subjunctive\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\" | Conditional\n|-\n!

E.g. ''lenta'' \"slow (feminine)\" becomes ''lenta'''mente''''' \"slowly\". Adjectives ending in ''-re'' or ''-le'' lose their ''e'' before adding ''-mente'' (''facile'' \"easy\" becomes ''facil'''mente''''' \"easily\", ''particolare'' \"particular\" becomes ''particolar'''mente''''' \"particularly\").\n\nThese adverbs can also be derived from the [[Italian grammar#Degrees of comparison|absolute superlative]] form of adjectives, e.g. ''lent'''issima'''mente'' (\"very slowly\"), ''facil'''issima'''mente'' (\"very easily\").\n\nThere is also a plethora of temporal, local, modal and interrogative adverbs, mostly derived from Latin, e.g. ''quando'' (\"when\"), ''dove'' (\"where\"), ''come'' (\"how\"), ''perch\u00e9'' (\"why\"/\"because\"), ''mai'' (\"never\"), ''sempre'' (\"always\"), etc.\n\n==Prepositions==\nItalian has a [[closed class]] of basic prepositions, to which a number of [[adverb]]s can be added that also double as prepositions, e.g.: ''sopra il tavolo'' (\"upon the table\"), ''prima di adesso'' (\"before now\").\n\nIn modern Italian the prepositions ''tra'' and ''fra'' are interchangeable, and often chosen on the basis of [[euphony]]: ''tra fratelli'' (\"among brothers\") vs. ''fra i tralicci'' (\"between the power pylons\").\n\nIn modern Italian, all the basic prepositions except ''tra'', ''fra'' and ''per'' have to be combined with an article placed next to them.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Nevertheless, the SVO sequence is sometimes replaced by one of the other arrangements (SOV, VSO, OVS, etc.), especially for reasons of emphasis and, in literature, for reasons of style and metre: Italian has relatively free word order.\n\nThe subject is usually [[null subject language|omitted when it is a pronoun]] \u2013 distinctive verb conjugations make it redundant.  Subject pronouns are considered emphatic when used at all.\n\nQuestions are formed by a rising intonation at the end of the sentence (in written form, a question mark). There is usually no other special marker, although [[wh-movement]] does usually occur. In general, intonation and context are important to recognize questions from affirmative statements.\n\n{|\n|-\n|''Davide \u00e8 arrivato in ufficio.'' || (David has arrived at the office.)\n|-\n|''Davide \u00e8 arrivato in ufficio?'' || (\"Talking about David\u2026 did he arrived at the office?\" or \"Davide has arrived at the office?

But: as with [[french grammar|French]], adjectives coming before the noun indicate essential quality of the noun.  Demonstratives (e.g. ''questo'' this, ''quello'' that) come before the noun, and a few particular adjectives (e.g. ''bello'') may be inflected like demonstratives and placed before the noun.\n\n==Disputed points in Italian grammar==\nAmong sometimes proscribed Italian forms are:\n* The usage of an indicative form where a subjunctive one is traditional; for instance: ''credo che Giorgio ieri fosse a casa'' (\"I believe that yesterday George was at home\") is considered proper, while ''credo che Giorgio ieri era a casa'' may not be; ''se Maria fosse stata a casa, le avrei telefonato'' (\"if Mary had been at home, I would have telephoned her\") is preferred, ''se Maria era a casa le telefonavo'' is often proscribed, despite being found in classic Italian writers\n* The use of the object forms (''lui'', ''lei'', ''loro'' and ''Lei'') of third person pronouns instead of the subject forms (''egli'', ''ella'', ''essi'' and ''Ella''), which are employed in formal language\n* ''Ma per\u00f2'', despite being widespread in spoken language, is proscribed in formal usage because it is redundant (''ma'' and ''per\u00f2'' are synonyms).\n\n==Italian grammar books==\nThe first Italian grammar was printed by [[Giovanni Francesco Fortunio]] in 1516 with the title ''[[Regole grammaticali della volgar lingua]]''.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRumIF1TLVkC&lpg=PA221&dq=Giovan%20Francesco%20Fortunio&lr=&hl=es&pg=PA221#v=onepage&q=Giovan%20Francesco%20Fortunio&f=false\n|title=Las lenguas rom\u00e1nicas est\u00e1ndar: (historia de su formaci\u00f3n y de su uso)\n|author=Michael Metzeltin\n|publisher=Academia Llingua Asturiana\n|year=2004\n|place=Uvi\u00e9u, Asturias\n|isbn=84-8168-356-6\n|page=221\n}}</ref> Ever since, several Italian and foreign scholars have published works devoted to its description. Among others may be mentioned the famous ''[[Grammatica storica della lingua italiana e dei suoi dialetti]]'' written by the [[philologist]] [[Gerhard Rohlfs]], published at the end of the 1960s.\n\nAmong the most modern publications are those by [[Luca Serianni]], in collaboration with [[Alberto Castelvecchi]], ''[[Grammatica italiana. Suoni, forme, costrutti]]'' (Utet, Torino, 1998); and by [[Lorenzo Renzi]], [[Giampaolo Salvi]] and [[Anna Cardinaletti]], ''[[Grande grammatica italiana di consultazione]]'' (3 vol., Bologna, Il Mulino, 1988-1995).

It was released on 3 December 1966 by [[London Records]] in the United States. With its release, the label attempted to fill a marketing gap between the Stones' studio albums and capitalise on their popularity in the US market, which was heightened that year by a notoriously successful [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|North American concert tour]] supporting their hit album ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966).\n\nDiscouraged by the fan hysteria accompanying the band in concert at the time, their producer and manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] abandoned the original idea of having the album capture the Stones in a single live performance at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Instead, he selected 10 concert recordings from other sources alongside two older studio tracks, which were [[overdubbed]] with crowd noise to give the impression of an entirely live album \u2013 all of the tracks were credited on the original LP to the Royal Albert Hall performance. The album takes it title from the Stones' [[Got Live If You Want It! (EP)|1965 UK-only live EP]], whose own name had been inspired by the 1957 [[Slim Harpo]] recording \"I've Got Love If You Want It\".\n\nThe LP sold well, reaching the number six position on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' albums chart]], although the Stones later disavowed the release. Critics of the album note the poor audibility of the band amid the audience noise, but appreciate its historical and documentary value as well as the intense, high-energy quality of the performances. Rare copies of the LP \u2013 pressed in limited quantities for the European market \u2013 became highly valued by [[record collector]]s. ''Got Live If You Want It!'' has been reissued twice by [[ABKCO Records]], in 1986 on CD and in 2002 on [[Super Audio CD|SACD]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Kungliga Tennishallen Stones 1966a.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Rolling Stones]] in 1966]]\nIn 1966, [[the Rolling Stones]]' popularity increased dramatically with the success of their ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' LP and the singles \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?]]\". Coupled with the music's commercial impact, the band's high-energy concerts during [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|their North American tour in June and July]] proved highly successful with young people while alienating local police tasked with [[crowd control|controlling]] the often rebellious and physically exhausting crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety \"among the authorities and [[the establishment]] seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nThe Stones' American record distributor, [[London Records]], wanted to capitalise on the Stones' growing popularity by marketing a new album, but were several months behind the scheduled release of their next original album, ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967). A live album release was then planned for the end of 1966.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Recording and production ==\n{{quote box|quote=\"In the '60s, the Stones didn't play concerts.

Sequenced as the LP's opening track, \"Under My Thumb\" featured a passionate introduction of the group by [[Long John Baldry]], who had sung in [[Alexis Korner]]'s London-based band [[Blues Incorporated]] alongside three members of the Stones in 1962 \u2013 Jagger, rhythm guitarist [[Brian Jones]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]]. The Stones' concert at [[Colston Hall]] in Bristol on 7 October 1966 produced the recordings of \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\", \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" and \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\". According to Margotin and Guesdon, \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\" and \"I'm Alright\" were performed on 5 March and 7 March 1965 at either Regal Theatre in London, the Palace Theatre in Manchester or the Empire Theatre in Liverpool.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nFor the live recordings, the engineer [[Glyn Johns]] used the [[IBC Studios|IBC Mobile Unit]], the technical function of which Margotin and Guesdon say was \"not yet really suited to rock concerts\". Johns captured each show by suspending microphones from the venue's balcony.<ref name=\"Running\"/> [[Keith Richards]], the Stones' lead guitarist, remarked at the time on the difference in being recorded live, \"We all knew that the sound that we were getting live and in the studio was not what we were getting on record \u2013 the difference was light years apart.\"<ref name=\"Havers\"/>\n\nThe first of the album's two studio recordings, \"[[I've Been Loving You Too Long]]\", was cut between 11 May and 12 May 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood. The second, \"[[Fortune Teller (song)|Fortune Teller]]\", was taken from a 9 July 1963 session at Decca Studios in West Hampstead. According to the band's bassist [[Bill Wyman]], both studio tracks had \"crowd atmosphere added\", while even the live recordings of \"Lady Jane\", \"I'm Alright\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother\", and \"Satisfaction\" \"all benefited from various amounts of overdubs at Olympic Studios in mid-October\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Title and packaging ==\nThe Rolling Stones conceived ''Got Live If You Want It!''{{'}}s name from the song \"I've Got Love If You Want It\", recorded in 1957 by [[Slim Harpo]], one of the band's favourite [[blues]] musicians.<ref name=\"Havers\"/> The name was first used for [[Got Live If You Want It!

The majority of his review focused instead on the moral implications of the Stones performing sleazily, as he described, for an audience presumed to be mostly adolescent and preadolescent girls, leading him to condemn the band on \"[[puritanical]]\" grounds. \"I can imagine how unpleasant a thing it would be to watch; hearing it is only slightly less so\", he concluded.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Rolling Stones: Got Live If  You Want It|last=Reilly|first=Peter|page=120|volume=18|magazine=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|HiFi]]|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n[[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]], in his 1972 biography on the band, considers ''Got Live If You Want It!'' in a series of Stones albums \u2013 including ''[[December's Children]]'' (1965), ''Aftermath'' and ''Between the Buttons'' \u2013 to follow their American experiences and feature \"an acceleration of R&B and rock\".

It was released on 3 December 1966 by [[London Records]] in the United States. With its release, the label attempted to fill a marketing gap between the Stones' studio albums and capitalise on their popularity in the US market, which was heightened that year by a notoriously successful [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|North American concert tour]] supporting their hit album ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966).\n\nDiscouraged by the fan hysteria accompanying the band in concert at the time, their producer and manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] abandoned the original idea of having the album capture the Stones in a single live performance at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Instead, he selected 10 concert recordings from other sources alongside two older studio tracks, which were [[overdubbed]] with crowd noise to give the impression of an entirely live album \u2013 all of the tracks were credited on the original LP to the Royal Albert Hall performance. The album takes it title from the Stones' [[Got Live If You Want It! (EP)|1965 UK-only live EP]], whose own name had been inspired by the 1957 [[Slim Harpo]] recording \"I've Got Love If You Want It\".\n\nThe LP sold well, reaching the number six position on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' albums chart]], although the Stones later disavowed the release. Critics of the album note the poor audibility of the band amid the audience noise, but appreciate its historical and documentary value as well as the intense, high-energy quality of the performances. Rare copies of the LP \u2013 pressed in limited quantities for the European market \u2013 became highly valued by [[record collector]]s. ''Got Live If You Want It!'' has been reissued twice by [[ABKCO Records]], in 1986 on CD and in 2002 on [[Super Audio CD|SACD]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Kungliga Tennishallen Stones 1966a.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Rolling Stones]] in 1966]]\nIn 1966, [[the Rolling Stones]]' popularity increased dramatically with the success of their ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' LP and the singles \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?]]\". Coupled with the music's commercial impact, the band's high-energy concerts during [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|their North American tour in June and July]] proved highly successful with young people while alienating local police tasked with [[crowd control|controlling]] the often rebellious and physically exhausting crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety \"among the authorities and [[the establishment]] seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nThe Stones' American record distributor, [[London Records]], wanted to capitalise on the Stones' growing popularity by marketing a new album, but were several months behind the scheduled release of their next original album, ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967). A live album release was then planned for the end of 1966.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Recording and production ==\n{{quote box|quote=\"In the '60s, the Stones didn't play concerts.

As a consequence, [[popular music]] acts were subsequently banned from performing at the Hall. According to the music journalist [[Fred Bronson]], \"the concert drove home the Stones' unpopularity with members of the [[ruling class]].\"<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|page=200|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|publisher=[[Billboard Books]]|isbn=0823076776}}</ref>\n\nThe Stones' producer and manager, [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], abandoned the original idea in response to this \"collective hysteria generated by the group, especially among teenagers, which threatened to degenerate into rioting\", as Margotin and Guesdon describe.

Sequenced as the LP's opening track, \"Under My Thumb\" featured a passionate introduction of the group by [[Long John Baldry]], who had sung in [[Alexis Korner]]'s London-based band [[Blues Incorporated]] alongside three members of the Stones in 1962 \u2013 Jagger, rhythm guitarist [[Brian Jones]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]]. The Stones' concert at [[Colston Hall]] in Bristol on 7 October 1966 produced the recordings of \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\", \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" and \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\". According to Margotin and Guesdon, \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\" and \"I'm Alright\" were performed on 5 March and 7 March 1965 at either Regal Theatre in London, the Palace Theatre in Manchester or the Empire Theatre in Liverpool.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nFor the live recordings, the engineer [[Glyn Johns]] used the [[IBC Studios|IBC Mobile Unit]], the technical function of which Margotin and Guesdon say was \"not yet really suited to rock concerts\". Johns captured each show by suspending microphones from the venue's balcony.<ref name=\"Running\"/> [[Keith Richards]], the Stones' lead guitarist, remarked at the time on the difference in being recorded live, \"We all knew that the sound that we were getting live and in the studio was not what we were getting on record \u2013 the difference was light years apart.\"<ref name=\"Havers\"/>\n\nThe first of the album's two studio recordings, \"[[I've Been Loving You Too Long]]\", was cut between 11 May and 12 May 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood. The second, \"[[Fortune Teller (song)|Fortune Teller]]\", was taken from a 9 July 1963 session at Decca Studios in West Hampstead. According to the band's bassist [[Bill Wyman]], both studio tracks had \"crowd atmosphere added\", while even the live recordings of \"Lady Jane\", \"I'm Alright\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother\", and \"Satisfaction\" \"all benefited from various amounts of overdubs at Olympic Studios in mid-October\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Title and packaging ==\nThe Rolling Stones conceived ''Got Live If You Want It!''{{'}}s name from the song \"I've Got Love If You Want It\", recorded in 1957 by [[Slim Harpo]], one of the band's favourite [[blues]] musicians.<ref name=\"Havers\"/> The name was first used for [[Got Live If You Want It!

The majority of his review focused instead on the moral implications of the Stones performing sleazily, as he described, for an audience presumed to be mostly adolescent and preadolescent girls, leading him to condemn the band on \"[[puritanical]]\" grounds. \"I can imagine how unpleasant a thing it would be to watch; hearing it is only slightly less so\", he concluded.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Rolling Stones: Got Live If  You Want It|last=Reilly|first=Peter|page=120|volume=18|magazine=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|HiFi]]|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n[[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]], in his 1972 biography on the band, considers ''Got Live If You Want It!'' in a series of Stones albums \u2013 including ''[[December's Children]]'' (1965), ''Aftermath'' and ''Between the Buttons'' \u2013 to follow their American experiences and feature \"an acceleration of R&B and rock\".

Other than original stories, many anime are based on [[manga]], [[Light novel|novels]], or [[video game]]s. The genres that tend to be preferred by anime fans include [[romantic comedy]], [[slice of life story]], [[Action genre|action]], or [[sci-fi]], but there are exceptions. Most series are broadcast for 3 months or 6 months with 12 to 13 episodes for each block of 3 months. With the exception of [[Nippon Television|NTV]] programs, few titles have longer than these broadcast times.\n\nIn most cases, a [[production committee]] (a group of several related companies) buys a time slot from a TV station. This process is known as [[brokered programming]], and is similar to how [[infomercial]]s are broadcast. Therefore, unlike ordinary programs, production companies are [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsoring companies]] as well. This way, TV stations can fill the time slots with low viewership, while production companies can advertise their products (anime DVDs) at a lower cost. Since a production\u2019s purpose is to promote the title to fans, low [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] or a lack of sponsors is of little concern. Consequently, the number of late night anime is increasing. The fact that they rely on the sales of DVDs means that these anime are virtually the same as [[OVA]]s, except that they get a chance to be promoted. This is why \"pure\" OVA series have decreased rapidly.\n\n==Differences between TV and DVD versions==\n\nWhen a late night anime is released on video or DVD, it tends to have the contents altered or expanded, such as:\n*Improved [[animation]] quality\n*Scenes uncensored\n*Completely new videos added, such as side stories or epilogues\nExtras, like commentaries by the cast or production staff may also be added.\n\nSuch alteration often happens for television series, but this tendency is especially prominent for late night anime, because:\n*Production companies may not have enough time, or a large enough budget, to make a higher quality series in time for television transmission,\n*They often may want to include sexual or violent content that are restricted for broadcast on television.\n*They have to add value for the DVD release, since they mainly rely on DVD sales.\n\n==Broadcast area==\n\nAs of July 2006, there are 67 late night titles being broadcast, out of 95 total anime titles. This number includes those broadcast by [[Satellite television|satellite]] and [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] stations as well. However, not all are broadcast nationwide. [[Greater Tokyo Area|Tokyo]], for instance, has 49 late night anime series being broadcast. In [[Okinawa]], only 3 of them are on the air.\n\nIn many cases, the title is broadcast only in the area of the station producing the anime (which, in most cases, is Tokyo). In other cases, they are only broadcast in Tokyo, [[Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto|Osaka]], and [[Ch\u016bky\u014d region|Nagoya]]. [[UHF anime]] tends to be broadcast in Osaka, Nagoya, and [[Kant\u014d region]], but not in Tokyo. There are some titles that are broadcast nationwide, but such cases are the exception, not the rule. In other areas, variety shows with local [[tarento]] are often popular, making anime's entry difficult. This is especially the case in [[Hokkaid\u014d]], where [[Yo Oizumi]] and [[How do you like Wednesday?|his program]] are extremely popular.\n\nIf a household has access to CS satellite or [[cable television]], the situation becomes a little better, because anime oriented pay CS satellite stations such as [[Kids Station]], [[Animax]], or [[AT-X (company)|AT-X]] broadcast many of those titles. However, their broadcastings are often weeks or months behind the first run. Moreover, satellite and cable television are not as common in Japan when compared to the [[United States]].\n\nHowever, this situation is changing thanks to the increase of households which can watch BS satellite broadcasting. In November 2011, about 72 percent of Japanese can watch principal BS satellite broadcasting without charge such as [[Nippon BS Broadcasting|BS11]], [[BS-TBS]], BS Fuji and BS TV Tokyo.<ref>[http://rengo-tsushin.com/modules/broadcasting/index.php?page=article&storyid=1672 BS\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u653e\u9001\u8996\u8074\u53ef\u80fd\u4e16\u5e2f\u306e\u5272\u5408\u306f72\u30fb3%\uff1dBS\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u6c11\u653e6\u793e\u304c\u300cBS\u4e16\u5e2f\u666e\u53ca\u7387\u8abf\u67fb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311223048/http://rengo-tsushin.com/modules/broadcasting/index.php?page=article&storyid=1672 |date=2013-03-11 }} \u9023\u5408\u901a\u4fe1.com {{in lang|ja}}</ref> As a result, the number of [[UHF anime]] broadcast by BS11 is increasing, and in 2012, BS11 broadcasts most of them. Moreover, BS11 broadcasts late night anime less than 8 days behind the first run. As to major network stations, since 2001, BS-TBS (previously called BS-i) has broadcast most TBS's anime though it didn't broadcast [[K-On!|K-On!!]] which was broadcast by all [[Japan News Network|JNN]] [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial broadcasting stations]], and from 2006 to 2012, BS Fuji had broadcast most Fuji TV's late night anime. However, in 2013, BS Fuji stopped broadcasting Fuji TV's late night anime, and BS Japan (now known as BS TV Tokyo) which is a subsidiary of TV Tokyo seldom broadcasts TV Tokyo's anime.\n\n==History==\n\nThe earliest late night anime titles include ''[[Sennin Buraku]]'' (1963\u20131964), ''{{ill|Lemon Angel|ja|\u30ec\u30e2\u30f3\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb}}'' (1987), and ''{{ill|Super Zugan|ja|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c5\u30ac\u30f3}}'' (1992). All of them were transmitted on [[Fuji TV]]. ''Sennin Buraku'' was from the longest running manga ever, still published in an adult magazine called ''[[Weekly Asahi Gein\u014d]]''. ''Lemon Angel'' was an [[Hentai|adult anime]] that is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the adult OVA ''[[Cream Lemon]]''. ''Super Zugan'' was from a manga about [[mahjong]]. Those titles received some attention, but remained single experimental programs.\n\nThe title considered to be the true pioneer of late night anime is ''[[Those Who Hunt Elves]]'' (1996) on [[TV Tokyo]]. At the time, several late night [[radio]] talk shows hosted by various voice actors were popular. As a genre, those programs were called \"aniraji\", the abbreviation of '''''ani'''me'' and '''''raji'''o'' (radio). TV producers thought that if anime-related radio programs on late night can be popular, then anime television programs on late night should work too. The result turned out as they wished. Because of this, TV Tokyo continued their late night time slots. In 1997, the time slots were expanded, and they became the basis of the \"late night anime\" that we now know. At the time, following the immense success of ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', the number of produced anime rapidly increased. Many of those titles came to late night slots. [[Nippon TV]] also started their late night anime with ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]''.\n\nIn 1998, Fuji TV restarted their late night anime. Also, [[broadcast satellite|BS]] satellite station [[WOWOW]] started their block with the complete version of ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' which had been incompletely broadcast in TV Tokyo's evening time slot.\n\nThe first UHF late night anime, ''[[Legend of Basara]]'', started that year as well. However, the true rise of UHF anime came with ''[[Comic Party]]'' (2001). In 2001, [[BS digital]] station [[BS-i]] began their time slot with ''[[Mahoromatic]]'', making the cute title one of its killer contents.\n\nIn 2002, Fuji TV increased the number of programs that they broadcast. However, they did not value the otherwise filler programs with nearly zero ratings. Schedules of their late night anime became extremely unstable. For instance, when a program was on air at 2:25 A.M., the next week it was on air at 1:55 A.M. The week after, it was not broadcast, and the next week, 2 episodes were shown at 3:05 A.M. An extreme case was the last week of ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'', for which they broadcast the last 3 episodes in a marathon. Anime fans heavily criticized this attitude, and production companies began to avoid broadcasting on Fuji TV. The number of late night anime on Fuji TV has decreased, and in October 2004, it completely disappeared. However, from April 2005, they started the time block called ''[[Noitamina]]'', the block aimed for a [[Josei|young adult female]] audience, who otherwise would not watch anime. However, non-Noitamina anime, such as ''[[Mushishi]]'', still do not get a proper screening.\n\nLate night anime with [[adult animation|adults as the target demographic]] has caused a rise in sales of anime shows to television stations in Japan in recent years. This type of anime is less popular outside Japan, being considered \"more of a niche product\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Movie-version-of-Osamu-Tezuka-s-Black-Jack-coming-to-China|title= Movie version of Osamu Tezuka's 'Black Jack' coming to China|first= Akira|last= Kobayashi|date= September 5, 2016|accessdate= September 10, 2016|work= Nikkei Asian Review}}</ref>\n\n==Current tendencies of the major nationwide networks==\n\n;[[NHK General TV|NHK General]], [[NHK Educational TV|NHK Educational]]\n:[[NHK]] is the only [[public broadcasting]] station in Japan. They don't usually broadcast late night anime on Weekdays, except for reruns. However, they broadcast late night anime on Sunday nights.\n;[[Nippon Television|NTV]]\n:They mainly show anime designed for non-otaku audiences, but the titles still appeal to anime fans as well. Also, they aired titles with many episodes, such as ''[[Monster (manga)|Monster]]'' or later episodes of ''[[Hunter \u00d7 Hunter]]''. Their anime programs nowadays air on Tuesday nights under the ''AnichU'' block. Until recently, they aired late night anime on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday nights.\n;[[TV Asahi]]\n:They used to rarely air late-night anime, most recent of which are ''[[From the New World (novel)|From the New World]]'' and ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''. However from April 2020 onwards, they are airing late-night anime again every Saturday nights under the ''NUMAnimation'' block, starting with [[Sing \"Yesterday\" for Me]].\n;[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]\n:It is notable that some of the titles they produce are not broadcast on TBS, but on [[BS-TBS]] (a satellite channel affiliated to TBS) or on UHF stations. Their late night anime block (called since April 2018 as ''Animerico'') airs on Thursday nights.\n;[[TV Tokyo]]\n:TV Tokyo always had to explore programs for niche audiences. Such genres include financial news, travel, [[jidaigeki]] (samurai fiction), outdoors, pets, and anime. Among major network stations, more than half of the anime titles are broadcast on this channel. As such, their late night anime, nowadays usually aired on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Friday and sometimes Thursday nights, are abundant with wide varieties.\n;[[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]]\n:Other than the Thursday late night [[Noitamina]] block, they used to broadcast anime on Friday nights, an example of this would be ''[[Assassination Classroom]]''. They also broadcast another anime block called ''[[+Ultra]]'' that airs every Wednesday nights.\n;[[Tokyo MX]]\n:Among the Japanese TV networks, they tend to broadcast the most late-night anime.\n:Three anime titles that are produced by [[Aniplex]] air on Saturdays and sometimes will air a show on Wednesday (starting from October 2019) or Friday nights.\n:There is usually an anime title produced by [[Toho]] airs on Sundays.\n:Anime titles that are produced by [[Kadokawa Corporation|Kadokawa]] typically air on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and sometimes, on Sunday nights.\n:Anime titles that are produced by [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] air on Saturday nights.\n:Anime titles that are produced by [[Avex Group|Avex Pictures]] air on Thursday nights.\n:Their ''[[:ja:\u3042\u306b\u3081\u306e\u3081|Anime no Me]]'' block used to air on Monday nights, alongside [[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation|Yomiuri TV]], but since the Spring 2018 anime season, it is no longer active.\n;[[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]]\n:A Kansai-affiliated station of TBS that besides Friday late night block [[Animeism]], also broadcast anime on Saturday nights, such as the first two seasons of ''[[Attack on Titan]]'' or ''[[Blood Blockade Battlefront]]''.\n\n==Censorship==\nJapanese TV stations do not have a clear detailed system of [[Television rating system|parental guidelines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2011/11/19-1/japans-anime-broadcast-ethics-complaints-for-october-2011 |title=Japan's Anime Broadcast Ethics Complaints for October 2011 |publisher=Crunchyroll.com |date=2011-11-19 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref> The only clear rule is that they cannot show sexual organs. However, they do have many tacit understandings of self-restriction. Bare breasts, for example, are difficult to broadcast on prime time.\n\nTV Tokyo once broadcast radical programs such as ''Evangelion'' during the evening. However, in 1997, they had \"[[Banned episodes of Pok\u00e9mon#Electric Soldier Porygon|Pok\u00e9mon-shock]]\", the incident that caused many children to feel ill by watching the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' episode that contained many flashing lights. After the incident, TV Tokyo's self-restriction codes became much more strict.\nNow, TV Tokyo and Fuji TV are said to be extremely strict on sexual descriptions. Naked bodies are censored, and [[panchira|female underwear]] are censored as well. Even when a female character with a mini-skirt jumps, her skirt does not whip, which is often ridiculed by fans. These censorships on VHFs have become one of the primary reasons of the rise of UHF anime.\n\n==Outside Japan==\nLate night anime are also distributed worldwide, but a lot of titles do not make it into the airwaves and are only available in [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] or legal Internet streaming releases. Anime series which have been aired at late night in Japan may be aired at more convenient times in other countries, be it on [[free-to-air]] or paid channels such as [[Anime Network]] or [[Animax]].\n\nIn the United States, [[Cartoon Network]] relaunched their then-defunct [[Toonami]] block as a part of its nighttime programming block [[Adult Swim]] on May 26, 2012\u2014which continues as a late night Saturday anime action block from its forerunner, Midnight Run. The Toonami relaunch on Adult Swim was itself a rebranding of Adult Swim Action, which was also a late night Saturday block that primarily ran action anime, although with a much shorter block schedule that would typically be around three hours long on average.\n\nSome mainstream titles which are aired either at daytime or prime-time in Japan may end up in late-night slots overseas due to stricter local television regulation. Examples include popular titles such as ''[[Bleach]]'' and ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'' which were aired in the evenings in Japan, but at late night in the United States. In [[Hong Kong]], ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' was deemed as \"mature\" and aired in the weekend midnight slot, although it was considered appropriate for young viewers elsewhere in the world including Japan, the Philippines, and the US.  Due to the controversial nature of ''[[Death Note]]'', [[Philippines|Philippine]] anime channel [[Hero (TV channel)|Hero]] airs it in near midnight, and only on weekends, with no rerun schedules.  They use the same scheme when they started airing censored versions of titles with [[ecchi]], like [[Date A Live]] and [[The Fruit of Grisaia]].\n\n==Rise of UHF anime==\n\nIn [[Kant\u014d region]] including Tokyo, the major nationwide network stations broadcast on analog on the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channels . The \"independent\" stations established to provide [[Prefectural|prefecture]]-specific programming broadcast on the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channels. They are members of the [[Japanese Association of Independent Television Stations]]. In Osaka the situation is similar with exception of [[TV Osaka]]. (Note that all the Japanese terrestrial television have switched to UHF digital.)\n\nHowever, because these UHF stations are obscure, they do not have strong restrictions. Also, their time slots were much cheaper than those of VHF stations. Avoiding strict restrictions by a nationwide television network, and avoiding random scheduling by Fuji TV, many anime, especially those with a lot of [[fan service]], began to be broadcast on UHF stations. This even more obscure method still proved to be fairly effective, and UHF anime time slots continued to expand, especially from 2001. In 2006, if UHF stations are to be treated as one network (which they are not), it now broadcasts the largest number of late night anime (16), even more than TV Tokyo (8). However, many shows suffer from lower budgets compared with VHF shows.\n\nBecause of loose self-restriction codes, many of the titles contain sexual or violent expression that is impossible to broadcast on VHF stations. Examples include ''Rizelmine'' and {{Nihongo|''[[Elfen Lied]]''|\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8|''Erufen R\u012bto''}}. (The latter title, however, was still heavily edited.) Nevertheless, as UHF anime continue to expand, they recently have more varieties. [[Sh\u014djo]] titles such as {{Nihongo|''[[Bokura ga Ita|We were Here]]''|\u50d5\u7b49\u304c\u3044\u305f|''Bokura ga Ita''}} are now also broadcast. {{Nihongo|''[[Princess Tutu]]''|\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9\u30c1\u30e5\u30c1\u30e5|''Purinsesu Chuchu''}}, a show which can be watched by young children, is a UHF late night anime, too. As {{Nihongo|''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]''|\u6dbc\u5bae\u30cf\u30eb\u30d2\u306e\u6182\u9b31|''Suzumiya Haruhi no Y\u016butsu''}} became a huge hit, UHF late night anime has lost the \"cheapest, but the most obscure option\" description.\n\nSimilar tendencies can be seen in other channels as well, such as [[WOWOW]], [[BS-TBS]], and [[communications satellite|CS]] channels on [[SKY Perfect|SkyPerfecTV!]]. It is notable that AT-X, a pay-channel on SkyPerfecTV!, broadcast ''Elfen Lied'' unedited.  It is on WOWOW and BS-i, as well as other CS channels that the rest of Asia who can receive their signal gets a view of these UHF anime.\n\n==See also==\n*[[UHF anime]]\n*[[:ja:\u6df1\u591c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u4e00\u89a7]] Japanese list of late night anime titles\n*[[:ja:UHF\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u4e00\u89a7]] Japanese list of UHF anime titles\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtakuOClock Otaku O'Clock] - a TV Tropes article discussing on the matter\n*[http://akiba.keizai.biz/column/12/ \u30a2\u30ad\u30d0\u738b\u306b\u805e\u304f\u2014\u30aa\u30bf\u30af\u30ab\u30eb\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u3068\u79cb\u8449\u539f\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\uff08\u5f8c\u7de8\uff09]\n*[http://www.itmedia.co.jp/survey/articles/0501/06/news002.html \u8ab0\u304c\u30ad\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u3092\u6bba\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f \u7b2c5\u56de\u3000\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u306f\u7c73\u56fd\u3067\u30ad\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u306b\u306a\u308c\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f\uff08\u524d\u7de8\uff09]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?q=\u6df1\u591c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1 \u6df1\u591c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723022935/http://www.activeanime.com/html/content/view/2098/36/ NIPPON TV TO DISTRIBUTE ANIME ONLINE] at activeAnime via the [[Wayback Machine]]\n*[http://www.c21media.net/archives/32113 <!-- http://www.c21media.net/news/detail.asp?area=4&article=35679 --> Sci Fi builds late-night anime block]\n\n{{Animation industry in Japan}}\n\n[[Category:Anime and manga terminology]]\n[[Category:Anime television]]\n[[Category:Otaku]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=April 2008}}\n{{original research|date=April 2008}}\n}}\n\n{{Expand Japanese|\u6df1\u591c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1|date=December 2011}}\nIn Japan, {{Nihongo|'''late night anime'''|\u6df1\u591c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1 |''shin'ya anime''}} refers to [[anime]] series broadcast on television late at night or in the early hours of the morning, usually between 10 PM and 4 AM [[Japan Standard Time|JST]].\n\n==Overview==\n\nLate night anime is targeted toward Otaku from teens to adult audiences.

All of them were transmitted on [[Fuji TV]]. ''Sennin Buraku'' was from the longest running manga ever, still published in an adult magazine called ''[[Weekly Asahi Gein\u014d]]''. ''Lemon Angel'' was an [[Hentai|adult anime]] that is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the adult OVA ''[[Cream Lemon]]''. ''Super Zugan'' was from a manga about [[mahjong]]. Those titles received some attention, but remained single experimental programs.\n\nThe title considered to be the true pioneer of late night anime is ''[[Those Who Hunt Elves]]'' (1996) on [[TV Tokyo]]. At the time, several late night [[radio]] talk shows hosted by various voice actors were popular. As a genre, those programs were called \"aniraji\", the abbreviation of '''''ani'''me'' and '''''raji'''o'' (radio). TV producers thought that if anime-related radio programs on late night can be popular, then anime television programs on late night should work too. The result turned out as they wished. Because of this, TV Tokyo continued their late night time slots. In 1997, the time slots were expanded, and they became the basis of the \"late night anime\" that we now know. At the time, following the immense success of ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', the number of produced anime rapidly increased. Many of those titles came to late night slots. [[Nippon TV]] also started their late night anime with ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]''.\n\nIn 1998, Fuji TV restarted their late night anime. Also, [[broadcast satellite|BS]] satellite station [[WOWOW]] started their block with the complete version of ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' which had been incompletely broadcast in TV Tokyo's evening time slot.\n\nThe first UHF late night anime, ''[[Legend of Basara]]'', started that year as well. However, the true rise of UHF anime came with ''[[Comic Party]]'' (2001). In 2001, [[BS digital]] station [[BS-i]] began their time slot with ''[[Mahoromatic]]'', making the cute title one of its killer contents.\n\nIn 2002, Fuji TV increased the number of programs that they broadcast. However, they did not value the otherwise filler programs with nearly zero ratings. Schedules of their late night anime became extremely unstable. For instance, when a program was on air at 2:25 A.M., the next week it was on air at 1:55 A.M. The week after, it was not broadcast, and the next week, 2 episodes were shown at 3:05 A.M. An extreme case was the last week of ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'', for which they broadcast the last 3 episodes in a marathon. Anime fans heavily criticized this attitude, and production companies began to avoid broadcasting on Fuji TV. The number of late night anime on Fuji TV has decreased, and in October 2004, it completely disappeared. However, from April 2005, they started the time block called ''[[Noitamina]]'', the block aimed for a [[Josei|young adult female]] audience, who otherwise would not watch anime. However, non-Noitamina anime, such as ''[[Mushishi]]'', still do not get a proper screening.\n\nLate night anime with [[adult animation|adults as the target demographic]] has caused a rise in sales of anime shows to television stations in Japan in recent years. This type of anime is less popular outside Japan, being considered \"more of a niche product\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Movie-version-of-Osamu-Tezuka-s-Black-Jack-coming-to-China|title= Movie version of Osamu Tezuka's 'Black Jack' coming to China|first= Akira|last= Kobayashi|date= September 5, 2016|accessdate= September 10, 2016|work= Nikkei Asian Review}}</ref>\n\n==Current tendencies of the major nationwide networks==\n\n;[[NHK General TV|NHK General]], [[NHK Educational TV|NHK Educational]]\n:[[NHK]] is the only [[public broadcasting]] station in Japan. They don't usually broadcast late night anime on Weekdays, except for reruns. However, they broadcast late night anime on Sunday nights.\n;[[Nippon Television|NTV]]\n:They mainly show anime designed for non-otaku audiences, but the titles still appeal to anime fans as well. Also, they aired titles with many episodes, such as ''[[Monster (manga)|Monster]]'' or later episodes of ''[[Hunter \u00d7 Hunter]]''. Their anime programs nowadays air on Tuesday nights under the ''AnichU'' block. Until recently, they aired late night anime on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday nights.\n;[[TV Asahi]]\n:They used to rarely air late-night anime, most recent of which are ''[[From the New World (novel)|From the New World]]'' and ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''. However from April 2020 onwards, they will air late-night anime again every Saturday nights under the ''NUMAnimation'' block, starting with [[Sing \"Yesterday\" for Me]].\n;[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]\n:It is notable that some of the titles they produce are not broadcast on TBS, but on [[BS-TBS]] (a satellite channel affiliated to TBS) or on UHF stations. Their late night anime block (called since April 2018 as ''Animerico'') airs on Thursday nights.\n;[[TV Tokyo]]\n:TV Tokyo always had to explore programs for niche audiences. Such genres include financial news, travel, [[jidaigeki]] (samurai fiction), outdoors, pets, and anime. Among major network stations, more than half of the anime titles are broadcast on this channel. As such, their late night anime, nowadays usually aired on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Friday and sometimes Thursday nights, are abundant with wide varieties.\n;[[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]]\n:Other than the Thursday late night [[Noitamina]] block, they used to broadcast anime on Friday nights, an example of this would be ''[[Assassination Classroom]]''. They also broadcast another anime block called ''[[+Ultra]]'' that airs every Wednesday nights.\n;[[Tokyo MX]]\n:Among the Japanese TV networks, they tend to broadcast the most late-night anime.\n:Three anime titles that are produced by [[Aniplex]] air on Saturdays and sometimes will air a show on Wednesday (starting from October 2019) or Friday nights.\n:There is usually an anime title produced by [[Toho]] airs on Sundays.\n:Anime titles that are produced by [[Kadokawa Corporation|Kadokawa]] typically air on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and sometimes, on Sunday nights.\n:Anime titles that are produced by [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] air on Saturday nights.\n:Anime titles that are produced by [[Avex Group|Avex Pictures]] air on Thursday nights.\n:Their ''[[:ja:\u3042\u306b\u3081\u306e\u3081|Anime no Me]]'' block used to air on Monday nights, alongside [[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation|Yomiuri TV]], but since the Spring 2018 anime season, it is no longer active.\n;[[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]]\n:A Kansai-affiliated station of TBS that besides Friday late night block [[Animeism]], also broadcast anime on Saturday nights, such as the first two seasons of ''[[Attack on Titan]]'' or ''[[Blood Blockade Battlefront]]''.\n\n==Censorship==\nJapanese TV stations do not have a clear detailed system of [[Television rating system|parental guidelines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2011/11/19-1/japans-anime-broadcast-ethics-complaints-for-october-2011 |title=Japan's Anime Broadcast Ethics Complaints for October 2011 |publisher=Crunchyroll.com |date=2011-11-19 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref> The only clear rule is that they cannot show sexual organs. However, they do have many tacit understandings of self-restriction. Bare breasts, for example, are difficult to broadcast on prime time.\n\nTV Tokyo once broadcast radical programs such as ''Evangelion'' during the evening. However, in 1997, they had \"[[Banned episodes of Pok\u00e9mon#Electric Soldier Porygon|Pok\u00e9mon-shock]]\", the incident that caused many children to feel ill by watching the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' episode that contained many flashing lights. After the incident, TV Tokyo's self-restriction codes became much more strict.\nNow, TV Tokyo and Fuji TV are said to be extremely strict on sexual descriptions. Naked bodies are censored, and [[panchira|female underwear]] are censored as well. Even when a female character with a mini-skirt jumps, her skirt does not whip, which is often ridiculed by fans. These censorships on VHFs have become one of the primary reasons of the rise of UHF anime.\n\n==Outside Japan==\nLate night anime are also distributed worldwide, but a lot of titles do not make it into the airwaves and are only available in [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] or legal Internet streaming releases. Anime series which have been aired at late night in Japan may be aired at more convenient times in other countries, be it on [[free-to-air]] or paid channels such as [[Anime Network]] or [[Animax]].\n\nIn the United States, [[Cartoon Network]] relaunched their then-defunct [[Toonami]] block as a part of its nighttime programming block [[Adult Swim]] on May 26, 2012\u2014which continues as a late night Saturday anime action block from its forerunner, Midnight Run. The Toonami relaunch on Adult Swim was itself a rebranding of Adult Swim Action, which was also a late night Saturday block that primarily ran action anime, although with a much shorter block schedule that would typically be around three hours long on average.\n\nSome mainstream titles which are aired either at daytime or prime-time in Japan may end up in late-night slots overseas due to stricter local television regulation. Examples include popular titles such as ''[[Bleach]]'' and ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'' which were aired in the evenings in Japan, but at late night in the United States. In [[Hong Kong]], ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' was deemed as \"mature\" and aired in the weekend midnight slot, although it was considered appropriate for young viewers elsewhere in the world including Japan, the Philippines, and the US.  Due to the controversial nature of ''[[Death Note]]'', [[Philippines|Philippine]] anime channel [[Hero (TV channel)|Hero]] airs it in near midnight, and only on weekends, with no rerun schedules.  They use the same scheme when they started airing censored versions of titles with [[ecchi]], like [[Date A Live]] and [[The Fruit of Grisaia]].\n\n==Rise of UHF anime==\n\nIn [[Kant\u014d region]] including Tokyo, the major nationwide network stations broadcast on analog on the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channels . The \"independent\" stations established to provide [[Prefectural|prefecture]]-specific programming broadcast on the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channels. They are members of the [[Japanese Association of Independent Television Stations]]. In Osaka the situation is similar with exception of [[TV Osaka]]. (Note that all the Japanese terrestrial television have switched to UHF digital.)\n\nHowever, because these UHF stations are obscure, they do not have strong restrictions. Also, their time slots were much cheaper than those of VHF stations. Avoiding strict restrictions by a nationwide television network, and avoiding random scheduling by Fuji TV, many anime, especially those with a lot of [[fan service]], began to be broadcast on UHF stations. This even more obscure method still proved to be fairly effective, and UHF anime time slots continued to expand, especially from 2001. In 2006, if UHF stations are to be treated as one network (which they are not), it now broadcasts the largest number of late night anime (16), even more than TV Tokyo (8). However, many shows suffer from lower budgets compared with VHF shows.\n\nBecause of loose self-restriction codes, many of the titles contain sexual or violent expression that is impossible to broadcast on VHF stations. Examples include ''Rizelmine'' and {{Nihongo|''[[Elfen Lied]]''|\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8|''Erufen R\u012bto''}}. (The latter title, however, was still heavily edited.) Nevertheless, as UHF anime continue to expand, they recently have more varieties. [[Sh\u014djo]] titles such as {{Nihongo|''[[Bokura ga Ita|We were Here]]''|\u50d5\u7b49\u304c\u3044\u305f|''Bokura ga Ita''}} are now also broadcast. {{Nihongo|''[[Princess Tutu]]''|\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9\u30c1\u30e5\u30c1\u30e5|''Purinsesu Chuchu''}}, a show which can be watched by young children, is a UHF late night anime, too. As {{Nihongo|''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]''|\u6dbc\u5bae\u30cf\u30eb\u30d2\u306e\u6182\u9b31|''Suzumiya Haruhi no Y\u016butsu''}} became a huge hit, UHF late night anime has lost the \"cheapest, but the most obscure option\" description.\n\nSimilar tendencies can be seen in other channels as well, such as [[WOWOW]], [[BS-TBS]], and [[communications satellite|CS]] channels on [[SKY Perfect|SkyPerfecTV!]]. It is notable that AT-X, a pay-channel on SkyPerfecTV!, broadcast ''Elfen Lied'' unedited.  It is on WOWOW and BS-i, as well as other CS channels that the rest of Asia who can receive their signal gets a view of these UHF anime.\n\n==See also==\n*[[UHF anime]]\n*[[:ja:\u6df1\u591c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u4e00\u89a7]] Japanese list of late night anime titles\n*[[:ja:UHF\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u4e00\u89a7]] Japanese list of UHF anime titles\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OtakuOClock Otaku O'Clock] - a TV Tropes article discussing on the matter\n*[http://akiba.keizai.biz/column/12/ \u30a2\u30ad\u30d0\u738b\u306b\u805e\u304f\u2014\u30aa\u30bf\u30af\u30ab\u30eb\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u3068\u79cb\u8449\u539f\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\uff08\u5f8c\u7de8\uff09]\n*[http://www.itmedia.co.jp/survey/articles/0501/06/news002.html \u8ab0\u304c\u30ad\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u3092\u6bba\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f \u7b2c5\u56de\u3000\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u306f\u7c73\u56fd\u3067\u30ad\u30e9\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u306b\u306a\u308c\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f\uff08\u524d\u7de8\uff09]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?q=\u6df1\u591c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1 \u6df1\u591c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723022935/http://www.activeanime.com/html/content/view/2098/36/ NIPPON TV TO DISTRIBUTE ANIME ONLINE] at activeAnime via the [[Wayback Machine]]\n*[http://www.c21media.net/archives/32113 <!-- http://www.c21media.net/news/detail.asp?area=4&article=35679 --> Sci Fi builds late-night anime block]\n\n{{Animation industry in Japan}}\n\n[[Category:Anime and manga terminology]]\n[[Category:Anime television]]\n[[Category:Otaku]]\n", "name_user": "MarkF99999", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCurrent tendencies of the major nationwide networks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_night_anime"}

It occurs after [[autumn]] and before [[spring (season)|spring]] in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemisphere]] being oriented away from the [[Sun]]. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.  When it is winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], it is [[summer]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with [[snow]] and [[freezing]] temperatures. The moment of [[winter solstice]] is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole).  The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with [[daytime|day length]] increasing and [[nighttime|night length]] decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see [[Analemma#Earliest and latest sunrise and sunset|earliest and latest sunrise and sunset]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''winter'' comes from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] noun ''*wintru-'', whose origin is unclear. Several proposals exist, a commonly mentioned one connecting it to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*wed-'' 'water' or a nasal infix variant ''*wend-''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Winter &#124; Origin and meaning of winter by Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2015-02-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202154139/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Cause==\n{{See also|Effect of Sun angle on climate}}\nThe tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44\u00b0 to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation brings about seasons. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer Sun.\n\nDuring winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit the Earth at an oblique angle. Thus a lower amount of [[solar radiation]] strikes the Earth per unit of surface area. Furthermore, the light must travel a longer distance through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat. Compared with these effects, the effect of the changes in the distance of the Earth from the Sun (due to the Earth's elliptical orbit) is negligible.\n\nThe manifestation of the meteorological winter (freezing temperatures) in the northerly snow\u2013prone latitudes is highly variable depending on elevation, position versus marine winds and the amount of precipitation. For instance, within [[Canada]] (a country of cold winters), [[Winnipeg]] on the [[Great Plains]], a long way from the ocean, has a January high of {{convert|-11.3|C|F}} and a low of {{convert|-21.4|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&lang=e&amp;StationName=Winnipeg&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1&dispBack=1|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 Station Data for Winnipeg|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905075212/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&lang=e&StationName=Winnipeg&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1&dispBack=1|archivedate=5 September 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2013-09-25}}</ref> In comparison, [[Vancouver]] on the west coast with a marine influence from moderating Pacific winds has a January low of {{convert|1.4|C|F}} with days well above freezing at {{convert|6.9|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1|title=Canadian climate normals 1981\u20132010 Station Data for Vancouver|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518084829/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all|date=2013-09-25}}</ref> Both places are at 49\u00b0N latitude, and in the same western half of the continent.

In the Southern Hemisphere, the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40\u00b0S makes the winters milder; thus, snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the Southern Hemisphere. In this region, snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the Andes, the Great Dividing Range in Australia, and the mountains of New Zealand, and also occurs in the southerly [[Patagonia]] region of South Argentina. Snow occurs year-round in [[Antarctica]].\n\n==Astronomical and other calendar-based reckoning==\n[[File:KleinarlWinterwonderland.jpg|thumb|In the [[mid-latitudes]] and [[Polar regions of Earth|polar regions]], winter is associated with snow and ice.]]\n[[File:Neve Caxias do Sul (2).jpg|thumb|In the [[Southern Hemisphere]] winter extends from June to September, pictured in [[Caxias do Sul]] in the southern highlands of [[Brazil]].]]\n[[File:Hamburg Germany Jan 6.jpg|thumb|[[Sea ice]] in the [[Port of Hamburg]], Germany]]\n\nIn the [[Northern Hemisphere]], some authorities define the period of '''winter''' based on astronomical fixed points (i.e. based solely on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun), regardless of weather conditions.

In [[Celtic nations]] such as Ireland (using the [[Irish calendar]]) and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November, on [[Halloween|All Hallows]], or [[Samhain]]. Winter ends and spring begins on [[Imbolc]], or [[Candlemas]], which is 1 or 2 February. This system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively. (The three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere and May, June and July in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].)\n\nAlso, many mainland European countries tended to recognize [[Martinmas]] or [[St. Martin's Day]] (11 November), as the first calendar day of winter.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYT8MPFl_egC&pg=PA219|title=Folk-Taxonomies in Early English|last=Anderson|first=Earl R.|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8386-3916-0|location=Madison, N.J.|pages=219|quote=\"On St. Martin's day (11 November) winter begins, summer takes its end, harvest is completed. ...This text is one of many that preserves vestiges of the ancient Indo-European system of two seasons, winter and summer.\"}}</ref> The day falls at the midpoint between the old Julian equinox and [[solstice]] dates. Also, [[Valentine's Day]] (14 February) is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring, such as flowers blooming.\n\nIn [[Chinese astronomy]] and other East Asian [[Chinese calendar|calendars]], winter is taken to commence on or around 7 November, with the ''[[Jieqi|Ji\u00e9q\u00ec]]'' (known as \u7acb\u51ac ''l\u00ec d\u014dng'' \u2013 literally, \"establishment of winter\").\n\nThe three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late November or early December in the Northern Hemisphere and lasts through late February or early March. This \"thermological winter\" is earlier than the solstice delimited definition, but later than the daylight (Celtic) definition. Depending on [[seasonal lag]], this period will vary between climatic regions.\n\nCultural influences such as [[Christmas creep]] may have led to the winter season being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years, although high latitude countries like Canada are usually well into their real winters before the December solstice.\n\nSince by almost all definitions valid for the Northern Hemisphere, winter spans 31 December and 1 January, the season is split across years, just like summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Each calendar year includes parts of two winters. This causes ambiguity in associating a winter with a particular year, e.g. \"Winter 2018\". Solutions for this problem include naming both years, e.g. \"Winter 18/19\", or settling on the year the season starts in or on the year most of its days belong to, which is the later year for most definitions.\n\n==Ecological reckoning and activity==\n[[File:Snowshoe hare.jpg|thumb|right|The [[snowshoe hare]], and some other animals, change color in winter.]]\nEcological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates.  It is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term ''hibernal'' for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and autumnal).<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate = 30 May 2012 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130602225322/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | archivedate = 2 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  The hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the Earth.  The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late January in mild temperate climates.\n\nTo survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for [[overwintering]]:\n*[[Bird migration|Migration]] is a common effect of winter upon animals, notably birds. However, the majority of birds do not migrate{{snd}}the [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinal]] and [[European robin]], for example. Some [[butterfly|butterflies]] also migrate seasonally.\n*[[Hibernation]] is a state of reduced [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] during the winter. Some animals \"sleep\" during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns; e.g., [[Gopher (animal)|gopher]]s, frogs, snakes, and bats.\n*Some animals store food for the winter and live on it instead of hibernating completely. This is the case for [[squirrel]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[badger]]s, and [[raccoon]]s.\n*Resistance is observed when an animal endures winter but changes in ways such as color and musculature. The color of the fur or plumage changes to white (in order to be confused with snow) and thus retains its [[cryptic (zoology)|cryptic]] coloration year-round. Examples are the [[rock ptarmigan]], [[Arctic fox]], [[weasel]], [[hare|white-tailed jackrabbit]], and [[mountain hare]].\n*Some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier coat during the winter; this improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur. The coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling. The heavier coat in winter made it a favorite season for [[Animal trapping|trapper]]s, who sought more profitable skins.\n*Snow also affects the ways animals behave; many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it. Mice and [[vole]]s typically live under the snow layer.\n\nSome [[annual plant]]s never survive the winter. Other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle; this is known as [[vernalization]]. As for [[perennial plant|perennial]]s, many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it. Larger plants, particularly [[deciduous|deciduous trees]], usually let their upper part go dormant, but their roots are still protected by the snow layer. Few plants bloom in the winter, one exception being the [[prunus mume|flowering plum]], which flowers in time for [[Chinese New Year]]. The process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called [[Hardening (botany)|hardening]].\n\n==Exceptionally cold winters==\n[[File:Frost Fair of 1683.JPG|right|thumb|River Thames frost fair, 1683]]\n*1683\u20131684, \"The Great Frost\", when the [[Thames]], hosting the [[River Thames frost fairs]], was frozen all the way up to the London Bridge and remained frozen for about two months.

The unusual coolness of the winter of 1815\u20131816 and of the following summer was primarily due to the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia, in April 1815.  There were secondary effects from an unknown eruption or eruptions around 1810, and several smaller eruptions around the world between 1812 and 1814.  The cumulative effects were worldwide, but were especially strong in the Eastern United States, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Europe. Frost formed in May in New England, killing many newly planted crops, and the summer never recovered. Snow fell in New York and Maine in June, and ice formed in lakes and rivers in July and August. In the UK, snow drifts remained on hills until late July, and the Thames froze in September.

It occurs after [[autumn]] and before [[spring (season)|spring]] in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemisphere]] being oriented away from the [[Sun]]. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.  When it is winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], it is [[summer]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with [[snow]] and [[freezing]] temperatures. The moment of [[winter solstice]] is when the Sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole).  The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with [[daytime|day length]] increasing and [[nighttime|night length]] decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see [[Analemma#Earliest and latest sunrise and sunset|earliest and latest sunrise and sunset]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''winter'' comes from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] noun ''*wintru-'', whose origin is unclear. Several proposals exist, a commonly mentioned one connecting it to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*wed-'' 'water' or a nasal infix variant ''*wend-''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Winter &#124; Origin and meaning of winter by Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2015-02-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202154139/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Cause==\n{{See also|Effect of Sun angle on climate}}\nThe tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44\u00b0 to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation brings about seasons. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer Sun.\n\nDuring winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit the Earth at an oblique angle. Thus a lower amount of [[solar radiation]] strikes the Earth per unit of surface area. Furthermore, the light must travel a longer distance through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat. Compared with these effects, the effect of the changes in the distance of the Earth from the Sun (due to the Earth's elliptical orbit) is negligible.\n\nThe manifestation of the meteorological winter (freezing temperatures) in the northerly snow\u2013prone latitudes is highly variable depending on elevation, position versus marine winds and the amount of precipitation.

In the Southern Hemisphere, the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40\u00b0S makes the winters milder; thus, snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the Southern Hemisphere. In this region, snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the Andes, the Great Dividing Range in Australia, and the mountains of New Zealand, and also occurs in the southerly [[Patagonia]] region of South Argentina. Snow occurs year-round in [[Antarctica]].\n\n==Astronomical and other calendar-based reckoning==\n[[File:KleinarlWinterwonderland.jpg|thumb|In the [[mid-latitudes]] and [[Polar regions of Earth|polar regions]], winter is associated with snow and ice.]]\n[[File:Neve Caxias do Sul (2).jpg|thumb|In the [[Southern Hemisphere]] winter extends from June to September, pictured in [[Caxias do Sul]] in the southern highlands of [[Brazil]].]]\n[[File:Hamburg Germany Jan 6.jpg|thumb|[[Sea ice]] in the [[Port of Hamburg]], Germany]]\n\nIn the [[Northern Hemisphere]], some authorities define the period of '''winter''' based on astronomical fixed points (i.e. based solely on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun), regardless of weather conditions.

In [[Celtic nations]] such as Ireland (using the [[Irish calendar]]) and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November, on [[Halloween|All Hallows]], or [[Samhain]]. Winter ends and spring begins on [[Imbolc]], or [[Candlemas]], which is 1 or 2 February. This system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively. (The three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere and May, June and July in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].)\n\nAlso, many mainland European countries tended to recognize [[Martinmas]] or [[St. Martin's Day]] (11 November), as the first calendar day of winter.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYT8MPFl_egC&pg=PA219|title=Folk-Taxonomies in Early English|last=Anderson|first=Earl R.|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8386-3916-0|location=Madison, N.J.|pages=219|quote=\"On St. Martin's day (11 November) winter begins, summer takes its end, harvest is completed. ...This text is one of many that preserves vestiges of the ancient Indo-European system of two seasons, winter and summer.\"}}</ref> The day falls at the midpoint between the old Julian equinox and [[solstice]] dates. Also, [[Valentine's Day]] (14 February) is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring, such as flowers blooming.\n\nIn [[Chinese astronomy]] and other East Asian [[Chinese calendar|calendars]], winter is taken to commence on or around 7 November, with the ''[[Jieqi|Ji\u00e9q\u00ec]]'' (known as \u7acb\u51ac ''l\u00ec d\u014dng'' \u2013 literally, \"establishment of winter\").\n\nThe three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late November or early December in the Northern Hemisphere and lasts through late February or early March. This \"thermological winter\" is earlier than the solstice delimited definition, but later than the daylight (Celtic) definition. Depending on [[seasonal lag]], this period will vary between climatic regions.\n\nCultural influences such as [[Christmas creep]] may have led to the winter season being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years, although high latitude countries like Canada are usually well into their real winters before the December solstice.\n\nSince by almost all definitions valid for the Northern Hemisphere, winter spans 31 December and 1 January, the season is split across years, just like summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Each calendar year includes parts of two winters. This causes ambiguity in associating a winter with a particular year, e.g. \"Winter 2018\". Solutions for this problem include naming both years, e.g. \"Winter 18/19\", or settling on the year the season starts in or on the year most of its days belong to, which is the later year for most definitions.\n\n==Ecological reckoning and activity==\n[[File:Snowshoe hare.jpg|thumb|right|The [[snowshoe hare]], and some other animals, change color in winter.]]\nEcological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates.  It is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term ''hibernal'' for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and autumnal).<ref>{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate = 30 May 2012 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130602225322/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | archivedate = 2 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  The hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the Earth.  The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late January in mild temperate climates.\n\nTo survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for [[overwintering]]:\n*[[Bird migration|Migration]] is a common effect of winter upon animals, notably birds. However, the majority of birds do not migrate{{snd}}the [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinal]] and [[European robin]], for example. Some [[butterfly|butterflies]] also migrate seasonally.\n*[[Hibernation]] is a state of reduced [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] during the winter. Some animals \"sleep\" during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns; e.g., [[Gopher (animal)|gopher]]s, frogs, snakes, and bats.\n*Some animals store food for the winter and live on it instead of hibernating completely. This is the case for [[squirrel]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[badger]]s, and [[raccoon]]s.\n*Resistance is observed when an animal endures winter but changes in ways such as color and musculature. The color of the fur or plumage changes to white (in order to be confused with snow) and thus retains its [[cryptic (zoology)|cryptic]] coloration year-round. Examples are the [[rock ptarmigan]], [[Arctic fox]], [[weasel]], [[hare|white-tailed jackrabbit]], and [[mountain hare]].\n*Some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier coat during the winter; this improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur. The coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling. The heavier coat in winter made it a favorite season for [[Animal trapping|trapper]]s, who sought more profitable skins.\n*Snow also affects the ways animals behave; many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it. Mice and [[vole]]s typically live under the snow layer.\n\nSome [[annual plant]]s never survive the winter. Other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle; this is known as [[vernalization]]. As for [[perennial plant|perennial]]s, many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it. Larger plants, particularly [[deciduous|deciduous trees]], usually let their upper part go dormant, but their roots are still protected by the snow layer. Few plants bloom in the winter, one exception being the [[prunus mume|flowering plum]], which flowers in time for [[Chinese New Year]]. The process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called [[Hardening (botany)|hardening]].\n\n==Exceptionally cold winters==\n[[File:Frost Fair of 1683.JPG|right|thumb|River Thames frost fair, 1683]]\n*1683\u20131684, \"The Great Frost\", when the [[Thames]], hosting the [[River Thames frost fairs]], was frozen all the way up to the London Bridge and remained frozen for about two months.

The unusual coolness of the winter of 1815\u20131816 and of the following summer was primarily due to the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia, in April 1815.  There were secondary effects from an unknown eruption or eruptions around 1810, and several smaller eruptions around the world between 1812 and 1814.  The cumulative effects were worldwide, but were especially strong in the Eastern United States, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Europe. Frost formed in May in New England, killing many newly planted crops, and the summer never recovered. Snow fell in New York and Maine in June, and ice formed in lakes and rivers in July and August. In the UK, snow drifts remained on hills until late July, and the Thames froze in September.

In February 1784, the ''North Carolina'' was frozen in Chesapeake Bay.\n*1794\u20131795, severe winter, with the coldest January in the UK and lowest temperature ever recorded in London: {{convert|-21|C}} on 25 January. The cold began on Christmas Eve and lasted until late March, with a few temporary warm-ups. The Severn and Thames froze, and frost fairs started up again. The French army tried to invade the Netherlands over its frozen rivers, while the Dutch fleet was stuck in its harbor. The winter had easterlies (from Siberia) as its dominant feature.\n*1813\u20131814, severe cold, last freeze-over of Thames, and last frost fair. (Removal of old London Bridge and changes to river's banks made freeze-overs less likely.)\n*1883\u20131888, colder temperatures worldwide, including an unbroken string of abnormally cold and brutal winters in the Upper Midwest, related to the explosion of [[Krakatoa]] in August 1883.  There was snow recorded in the UK as early as October and as late as July during this time period.\n*1976\u20131977, one of the coldest winters in the US in decades.\n*1985, Arctic outbreak in US resulting from shift in polar vortex, with many cold temperature records broken.\n*2002\u20132003 was an unusually cold winter in the Northern and Eastern US.\n*2010\u20132011, persistent bitter cold in the entire eastern half of the US from December onward, with few or no mid-winter warm-ups, and with cool conditions continuing into spring. [[La Ni\u00f1a]] and negative [[Arctic oscillation]] were strong factors. Heavy and persistent precipitation contributed to almost constant snow cover in the Northeastern US which finally receded in early May.\n*2011 was one of the coldest on record in [[New Zealand]] with sea level snow falling in [[Wellington]] in July for the first time in 35 years and a much heavier snowstorm for 3 days in a row in August.\n\n==Humans and winter==\nHumans are sensitive to cold, see [[hypothermia]]. [[Snowblindness]], [[norovirus]], [[seasonal depression]]. Slipping on black ice and falling [[icicle]]s are other health concerns associated with cold and snowy weather. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is not unusual for homeless people to die from hypothermia in the winter.\n\nOne of the most common diseases associated with winter is [[influenza]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season.htm|title=The Flu Season {{!}} CDC|last=Staff|first=|date=2019-11-07|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Siemiginowski Allegory of Winter.jpg|thumb|upright|''Allegory of Winter'' by [[Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter]] with [[Aeolus]]' Kingdom of the Winds, 1683, [[Wilan\u00f3w Palace]]]]\nIn [[Persian culture]], the winter solstice is called [[Yald\u0101]] (meaning: birth) and it has been celebrated for thousands of years. It is referred to as the eve of the birth of [[Mithra]], who symbolised light, goodness and strength on earth.\n\nIn [[Greek mythology]], [[Hades]] kidnapped [[Persephone]] to be his wife. [[Zeus]] ordered Hades to return her to [[Demeter]], the goddess of the Earth and her mother. However, Hades tricked Persephone into eating the food of the dead, so Zeus decreed that Persephone would spend six months with Demeter and six months with Hades. During the time her daughter is with Hades, Demeter became depressed and caused winter.\n\nIn [[Welsh mythology]], [[Gwyn ap Nudd]] abducted a maiden named [[Creiddylad]]. On May Day, her lover, [[Gwythr ap Greidawl]], fought Gwyn to win her back. The battle between them represented the contest between summer and winter.\n\n* [[Old Man Winter]]\n* [[Jack Frost]]\n* [[Ded Moroz]]\n* [[Snegurochka]]\n* [[Sumarr and Vetr|Vetrright]]\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|small=yes}}\n* [[Cold wave]]\n* [[Cold-weather warfare]]\n* [[Fimbulwinter]]\n* [[Global cooling]]\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Nuclear winter]]\n* [[Old Man Winter]]\n* [[Pineapple Express]]\n* [[Siberian Express]]\n* [[Volcanic winter]]\n* [[List of winter festivals|Winter festivals (list)]]\n* [[Winter City]]\n* [[Winter Hexagon]]\n* [[Winter Olympic Games]]\n* [[Winter sport]]\n* [[Winter War]]\n* [[Christmas]]\n* [[New Year]]\n* [[Valentine's Day]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Rosenthal, Norman E.
