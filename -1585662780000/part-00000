Emerging evidence for both methylphenidate and Adderall indicate that when weight-corrected daily doses, equipotent with those used in the treatment of younger patients, are used to treat adults with ADHD, these patients show a very robust clinical response consistent with that observed in pediatric studies. These data suggest that older patients may require a more aggressive approach in terms of dosing, based on the same target dosage ranges that have already been established \u2013 for methylphenidate, 1\u20131.5\u20132 mg/kg/day, and for D,L-amphetamine, 0.5\u20130.75\u20131 mg/kg/day.... <br />In particular, adolescents and adults are vulnerable to underdosing, and are thus at potential risk of failing to receive adequate dosage levels.

While children with ADHD may climb and run about excessively, adults may experience an inability to relax, or they talk excessively in social situations. Adults with ADHD may start relationships impulsively, display sensation-seeking behavior, and be short-tempered. Addictive behavior such as [[substance abuse]] and gambling are common. The DSM-V criteria do specifically deal with adults, unlike those in DSM-IV, which were criticized for not being appropriate for adults; those who presented differently may lead to the claim that they outgrew the diagnosis.<ref name=\"Kooij-2010\"/>\n\nHaving ADHD symptoms since childhood is usually required to be diagnosed with adult ADHD. However, a proportion of adults who meet criteria for ADHD would not have been diagnosed with ADHD as children.

A Memorandum of Understanding was signed with BAe Dynamics that same year to co-operate on Rb 73 development. Studies were conducted on longer range designs with wings and datalinks, the Rb 73D/Rb 73DL. A lack of FMV funding brought the Rb 73 programme to a halt in 1987.\n\nIn 1988 BAe Dynamics and Thomson-CSF (now [[Thales Group|Thales]]) agreed to jointly fund development of a version of Skyflash with an [[Active radar homing|active radar seeker]]. The Active Sky Flash (ASF) was to include a Thomson-CSF seeker and a new warhead developed by LFK, the guided missile division of Daimler-Benz Aerospace ([[DASA]]) now known as [[MBDA Deutschland GmbH]]. Concepts progressed from the basic ASF to the agile tail-controlled ASF TC Mk. II. Prototype seekers were delivered in 1990 with air-carriage trials in 1991.\n\nSaab Dynamics continued to refine the Rb 73 design using company funds and renewed links were established with BAe Dynamics, to meet the emerging requirement to arm the RAF's Eurofighters. As Eurofighter became the driver behind the missile's development, BAe took charge of the programme. ASF was terminated in 1992 to be replaced by a new wingless concept known as S225X, the name deriving from the internal [[postal code]] of the BAe project manager's office at Stevenage.\n\nS225X was first unveiled at the 1992 Farnborough Air Show. GEC-Marconi Dynamics and Alenia Difesa joined the programme in 1993. In 1994 a ramjet powered version, known as S225XR, was proposed in response to the UK requirement for a future medium-range air-to-air missile for Eurofighter.

{"title_page": "Marxist schools of thought", "text_new": "{{lead too short|date=December 2017}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\n{{Marxism}}\n[[Marxism]] is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that frames [[capitalism]] through a paradigm of exploitation, analyzes [[Social class|class]] relations and [[Social conflict|social conflict]] using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and takes a [[dialectic]]al view of social transformation. Marxism uses a [[materialist]] methodology, now known as [[historical materialism]], to analyze and critique the development of class society and especially of [[capitalism]] as well as the role of [[class struggle]]s in systemic economic, social and political change.\n\nAccording to [[Marxist theory]], class conflict arises in [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist societies]] due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed and exploited [[proletariat]]\u2014a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services\u2014and the [[bourgeoisie]]\u2014the [[ruling class]] that owns the [[means of production]] and extracts its wealth through appropriation of the [[surplus product]] produced by the proletariat in the form of [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a society's [[productive forces]] against its [[relations of production]], results in a period of short-term crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying [[alienation of labor]] experienced by the proletariat, albeit with varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. In periods of deep crisis, the resistance of the oppressed can culminate in a [[proletarian revolution]] which, if victorious, leads to the establishment of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]\u2014a socioeconomic system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production, [[To each according to his contribution|distribution based on one's contribution]] and [[Production for use|production organized directly for use]]. As the productive forces continued to advance, socialism would be transformed into a [[communist society]], i.e. a classless, stateless, humane society based on [[common ownership]] and [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|distribution based on one's needs]].\n\nWhile it originates from the works of 19th century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, with the result that there is now no single definitive Marxist theory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|url=https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0|url-access=registration|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0/page/130 130]|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched.

The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]]. As [[forces of production]] improve, existing forms of organizing production become obsolete and hinder further progress. As [[Karl Marx]] observed: \"At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or\u2014this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms\u2014with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto.

Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]]. In a socialist society, [[private property]]\u2014in the form of the means of production\u2014would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs\u2014that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: \"Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then the appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment\".<ref>''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882). Chapter three.</ref>\n\n[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], [[socialism]] is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.<ref>Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote \"Men make their own history\".

Orthodox Marxism aims to simplify, codify and systematize Marxist method and theory by clarifying the perceived ambiguities and contradictions of classical Marxism. The philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development (advances in technology in the [[productive forces]]) is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations and that social systems and their relations (e.g. [[feudalism]], [[capitalism]] and so on) become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop, which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions. This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental society-wide changes and ultimately leads to the emergence of new [[economic system]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rees|first=John|title=The Algebra of Revolution: The Dialectic and the Classical Marxist Tradition|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=July 1998|isbn=978-0415198776}}</ref>\n\nAs a term, orthodox Marxism refers to the methods of historical materialism and of [[dialectical materialism]] and not the normative aspects inherent to classical Marxism, without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marx's investigations.<ref>Luk\u00e1cs, Georg.

Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories developed from Marxism as well as Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theory for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the agrarian early 20th-century [[Russian Empire]]. Leninism was the Russian application of Marxist economics and political philosophy, effected and realised by the Bolsheviks, the vanguard party who led the fight for the political independence of the working class. In 1903, Lenin stated: <blockquote>We want to achieve a new and better order of society: in this new and better society there must be neither rich nor poor; all will have to work. Not a handful of rich people, but all the working people must enjoy the fruits of their common labour. Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people. This new and better society is called socialist society. The teachings about this society are called 'socialism'.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1903/rp/1.htm \"To the Rural Poor\" (1903)]. ''Collected Works''. vol. 6. p. 366.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe most important consequence of a Leninist-style theory of imperialism is the strategic need for workers in the industrialized countries to bloc or ally with the oppressed nations contained within their respective countries' colonies abroad in order to overthrow capitalism. This is the source of the slogan, which shows the Leninist conception that not only the proletariat\u2014as is traditional to Marxism\u2014are the sole revolutionary force, but all oppressed people: \"Workers and Oppressed Peoples of the World, Unite!\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Ronald Grigor|last=Suny|title=Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite: Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920|volume=1|publisher=Pathfinder Press|location=New York City|date=1991|ISBN=978-0-87348-940-9|page=xiii}}</ref> The other distinguishing characteristic of Leninism is how it approaches the question of organization. Lenin believed that the traditional model of the [[Social Democratic Party|social democratic parties]] of the time, a loose, multitendency organization, was inadequate for overthrowing the Tsarist regime in Russia. He proposed a cadre of professional revolutionaries that disciplined itself under the model of [[democratic centralism]].<ref>{{cite book|first=August H.|last=Nimtz|title=Lenin's Electoral Strategy from Marx and Engels Through the Revolution of 1905: The Ballot, the Streets\u2014or Both|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mh4CAwAAQBAJ|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=Basingstoke, England|date=2014|isbn=978-1137389961|page=56}}</ref>\n\n== Left communism ==\n{{main|Left communism}}\n[[Left communism]] is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first two congresses.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ronald I.|last=Kowalski|title=The Bolshevik Party in Conflict: The Left Communist Opposition of 1918|publisher=[[Palgrave MacMillan]]|location=Basingstoke, England|date=1991|ISBN=978-1-349-10369-0|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-10367-6|page=2}}</ref>  \n\nAlthough she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has been heavily influential for most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included [[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Otto R\u00fchle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Amadeo Bordiga]] and [[Paul Mattick]].\n\nProminent left communist groups existing today include the [[International Communist Current]] and the Internationalist Communist Tendency. Different factions from the old Bordigist International Communist Party are also considered left communist organizations.\n\n== Council communism ==\n{{main|Council communism}}\n[[Council communism]] is a movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]]. Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both [[libertarian Marxism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].\n\nIn contrast to [[social democracy]] and [[Leninism]], the central argument of council communism is that democratic [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and governmental power. This view is opposed to both the [[reformist]] and the revolutionary Leninist ideologies, with their stress on respectively parliaments and institutional government (i.e. by applying social reforms on the one hand and [[Vanguard party|vanguard parties]] and participative [[democratic centralism]] on the other).\n\nThe core principle of council communism is that the government and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]] composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose [[Command economy|state-run authoritarian]] [[state socialism]]/[[state capitalism]]. They also oppose the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a worker's democracy which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.\n\n== Trotskyism ==\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Leon Trotsky]]]]\n[[Trotskyism]] is the branch as advocated by Russian Marxist [[Leon Trotsky]], a contemporary of Lenin from the early years of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], where he led a small trend in competition with both Lenin's [[Bolsheviks]] and the [[Mensheviks]]. Opposed to [[Stalinism]], Trostkyism supports the theory of [[permanent revolution]] and [[world revolution]] instead of the [[two stage theory]] and [[socialism in one country]]. It supported [[proletarian internationalism]] and another [[communist revolution]] in the Soviet Union which Trotsky claimed had become a [[degenerated worker's state]] under the leadership of Stalin in which class relations had re-emerged in a new form, rather than the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nStruggling against Stalin for power in the Soviet Union, Trotsky and his supporters organized into the [[Left Opposition]] and their platform became known as Trotskyism. Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. While in exile, Trotsky continued his campaign against Stalin, founding in 1938 the [[Fourth International]], a Trotskyist rival to the [[Communist International]]. In August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico City on Stalin's orders.\n\nTrotsky's followers claim to be the heirs of Lenin in the same way that mainstream Marxist\u2013Leninists do. There are several distinguishing characteristics of this school of thought\u2014foremost is the theory of permanent revolution. This stated that in less-developed countries the bourgeoisie were too weak to lead their own [[bourgeois-democratic revolution]]s. Due to this weakness, it fell to the proletariat to carry out the bourgeois revolution. With power in its hands, the proletariat would then continue this revolution permanently, transforming it from a national bourgeois revolution to a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist]] [[World revolution|international revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Leon|last=Trotsky|authorlink=Leon Trotsky|title=The Permanent Revolution|date=1931|quote=The Permanent Revolution is Not a \u2018Leap\u2019 by the Proletariat, but the Reconstruction of the Nation under the Leadership of the Proletariat.}}</ref>\n\nAnother shared characteristic between Trotskyists is a variety of theoretical justifications for their negative appraisal of the post-Lenin Soviet Union after Trotsky was expelled by a majority vote from the [[All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubenstein|first=Joshua|title=Leon Trotsky: A Revolutionary's Life|date=2011|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=Hartford, Connecticut|isbn=9780300137248|pages=155\u2013202}}</ref> and subsequently from the Soviet Union.

It is the variety of [[anti-revisionism]] that took inspiration and in some cases received material support from China, especially during the Mao period. There are several key concepts that were developed by Mao. First, Mao concurred with Stalin that not only does class struggle continue under the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], it actually accelerates as long as gains are being made by the proletariat at the expense of the disenfranchised bourgeoisie. Second, Mao developed a strategy for [[socialist revolution]] called [[protracted people's war]] in what he termed the [[semi-feudal]] countries of the [[Third World]] and that relied heavily on the peasantry. Third, Mao wrote many theoretical articles on epistemology and dialectics which he called contradictions.\n\n[[Hoxhaism]], so named because of the central contribution of Albanian statesman [[Enver Hoxha]], was closely aligned with China for a number of years, but it grew critical of Maoism because of the so-called [[Three Worlds Theory]] put forth by elements within the Communist Party of China and because it viewed the actions of Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] unfavorably. However, Hoxhaism as a trend ultimately came to the understanding that socialism had never existed in China at all.\n\n== Maoism ==\n{{main|Maoism}}\n[[File:Mao Zedong 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mao Zedong]]]]\n[[Maoism]] ({{lang-zh|s=\u6bdb\u6cfd\u4e1c\u601d\u60f3|p=M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng s\u012bxi\u01ceng|l=Mao Zedong Thought}}) is the theory that [[Mao Zedong]] developed for realising a socialist revolution in the agricultural, pre-industrial society of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] and later the [[People's Republic of China]]. The philosophical difference between Maoism and Marxism\u2013Leninism is that the [[peasantry]] are the [[Vanguardism|revolutionary vanguard]] in pre-industrial societies rather than the [[proletariat]]. This updating and adaptation of Marxism\u2013Leninism to Chinese conditions in which revolutionary praxis is primary and ideological orthodoxy is secondary represents urban Marxism\u2013Leninism adapted to pre-industrial China.

The term denotes a loose collection of Marxist theorists  who emphasised culture, philosophy and art, in contrast to the Marxism of the Soviet Union.\n\n=== Key Western Marxists ===\n==== Georg Luk\u00e1cs ====\n[[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs|Georg Luk\u00e1cs]] (13 April 1885 \u2013 4 June 1971) was a Hungarian Marxist philosopher and [[literary critic]], who founded Western Marxism with his magnum opus ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]''. Written between 1919 and 1922 and first published in 1923, the collection  of essays contributed to debates concerning Marxism and its relation to sociology, politics and philosophy. The book also reconstructed aspects of [[Marx's theory of alienation]] before many of the works of the [[young Marx]], in which the theory is most clearly expounded, had been published. Luk\u00e1cs's work stresses Karl Marx's origins in [[Hegelianism]] and elaborates Marxist theories such as [[ideology]], [[false consciousness]], [[reification (Marxism)|reification]] and [[class consciousness]].\n\n==== Karl Korsch ====\n[[Karl Korsch]] (15 August 1886 \u2013 21 October 1961) was born in Tostedt, near Hamburg, to the family of a middle-ranking bank official.\n\nIn his later work, he rejected [[Orthodox Marxism]] as historically outmoded, wanting to adapt Marxism to a new historical situation. He wrote in his ''Ten Theses'' (1950) that \"the first step in re-establishing a revolutionary theory and practice consists in breaking with that Marxism which claims to monopolize revolutionary initiative as well as theoretical and practical direction\" and that \"today, all attempts to re-establish the Marxist doctrine as a whole in its original function as a theory of the working classes social revolution are reactionary utopias\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/korsch/1950/ten-theses.htm Karl Korsch (1950) Ten Theses on Marxism  Today]</ref>\n\nKorsch was especially concerned that Marxist theory was losing its precision and validity\u2014in the words of the day, becoming \"vulgarized\"\u2014within the upper echelons of the various socialist organizations. His masterwork ''Marxism and Philosophy'' is an attempt to re-establish the historic character of Marxism as the heir to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].\n\n==== Antonio Gramsci ====\n[[Antonio Gramsci]] (22 January 1891{{spaced ndash}}27 April 1937) was an Italian writer, politician and political theorist. He was a founding member and onetime leader of the [[Communist Party of Italy]].  He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment by the Italian [[Fascist]] regime. These writings, known as the ''Prison Notebooks'', contain Gramsci's tracing of Italian history and nationalism as well as some ideas in Marxist theory, [[critical theory]] and educational theory associated with his name such as:\n* [[Cultural hegemony]] as a means of maintaining the [[State (polity)|state]] in a capitalist society\n* The need for popular workers' education to encourage development of intellectuals from the working class\n* The distinction between [[political society]] (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) which dominates directly and coercively and [[civil society]] (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) where leadership is constituted through ideology or by means of consent\n* \"Absolute [[historicism]]\"\n* The critique of [[economic determinism]]\n* The critique of [[materialism|philosophical materialism]]\n\n==== Herbert Marcuse ====\n[[Herbert Marcuse]] (19 July 1898 \u2013 29 July 1979) was a prominent German-American philosopher and sociologist of Jewish descent and a member of the Frankfurt School.\n\nMarcuse's critiques of capitalist society (especially his 1955 synthesis of Marx and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' and his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'') resonated with the concerns of the leftist student movement in the 1960s. Because of his willingness to speak at student protests, Marcuse soon became known as \"the father of the [[New Left]]\", a term he disliked and rejected.\n\n==== Jean-Paul Sartre ====\n[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (21 June 1905 \u2013 15 April 1980) was already a key and influential philosopher and playwright for his early writings on [[individualism|individualistic]] [[existentialism]]. In his later career, Sartre attempted to reconcile the existential philosophy of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] with Marxist philosophy and Hegelian dialectics in his work ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Ronald|last=Aronson|url=http://bostonreview.net/philosophy-religion/ronald-aronson-philosophy-our-time|title=The Philosophy of Our Time|magazine=[[Boston Review]]|publisher=Boston Critic, Inc.|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=November 14, 2018|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref> Sartre was also involved in Marxist politics and was impressed upon visiting Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], calling him \"not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Jon|last=Anderson|title=Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life|url=https://archive.org/details/cheguevara00jonl|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|location=New York City|date=1997|ISBN=978-0802144119|page=[https://archive.org/details/cheguevara00jonl/page/468 468]}}</ref>\n\n==== Louis Althusser ====\n[[Louis Althusser]] (16 October 1918 \u2013 22 October 1990) was a Marxist philosopher. He was a lifelong member and sometimes strong critic of the [[French Communist Party]]. His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of [[empiricism]] on Marxist theory and [[humanism]] and [[Reformism|reformist socialist]] orientations which manifested as divisions in the European Communist parties as well as the problem of the cult of personality and of ideology itself. Althusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French [[structuralism]] is not a simple affiliation and he is critical of many aspects of structuralism.\n\nHis essay ''Marxism and Humanism'' is a strong statement of anti-humanism in Marxist theory, condemning ideas like \"human potential\" and \"species-being\", which are often put forth by Marxists, as outgrowths of a bourgeois ideology of \"humanity\". His essay ''Contradiction and Overdetermination'' borrows the concept of [[overdetermination]] from [[psychoanalysis]] in order to replace the idea of \"contradiction\" with a more complex model of multiple [[causality]] in political situations (an idea closely related to Gramsci's concept of [[hegemony]]).\n\nAlthusser is also widely known as a theorist of ideology and his best-known essay is ''Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Toward an Investigation''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Louis|last=Althusser|authorlink=Louis Althusser|chapter=Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|title=Lenin and Philosophy and other Essays|date=1970|publisher=[[Monthly Review Press]]|location=New York City|pages=121\u2013176|ISBN=0-902308-89-0|language=French|translator-first=Ben|translator-last=Brewster}}</ref> The essay establishes the concept of ideology, also based on Gramsci's theory of hegemony. Whereas hegemony is ultimately determined entirely by political forces, ideology draws on [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] concepts of the unconscious and mirror-phase respectively and describes the structures and systems that allow us to meaningfully have a concept of the self.\n\n==== Christopher Hill, Eric Hobsbawm and E. P. Thompson ====\nBritish Marxism deviated sharply from French (especially Althusserian) Marxism and like the Frankfurt School developed an attention to cultural experience and an emphasis on human agency while growing increasingly distant from determinist views of materialism. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] formed the [[Communist Party Historians Group]] in 1946. They shared a common interest in \"history from below\" and class structure in early capitalist society. Important members of the group included [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[Raphael Samuel]].\n\nWhile some members of the group (most notably Thompson) left the party after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history. Thompson famously engaged Althusser in ''The Poverty of Theory'',<ref>Thompson, E. P., (1978). ''The Poverty of Theory & other essays'' Merlin, 1978. {{ISBN|0-85036-231-8}}.</ref> arguing that Althusser's theory overdetermined history and left no space for historical revolt by the oppressed.\n\n=== Structural Marxism ===\n{{main|Structural Marxism}}\n[[Structural Marxism]] is an approach to Marxism based on structuralism, primarily associated with the work of the French theorist Louis Althusser and his students. It was influential in France during the late 1960s and 1970s and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and sociologists outside France during the 1970s.\n\n=== Neo-Marxism ===\n{{main|Neo-Marxism}}\n[[Neo-Marxism]] is a school of Marxism that began in the 20th century and hearkened back to the early writings of Marx before the influence of [[Friedrich Engels]], which focused on dialectical idealism rather than [[dialectical materialism]]. It thus rejected economic determinism, being instead far more [[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]. Neo-Marxism adds [[Max Weber]]'s broader understanding of [[social inequality]], such as [[Social status|status]] and [[Power (sociology)|power]], to orthodox Marxist thought.\n\n=== Frankfurt School ===\n{{main|Frankfurt School}}\n{{Frankfurt School}}\nThe [[Frankfurt School]] is a school of neo-Marxist social theory, social research and philosophy. The grouping emerged at the [[Institute for Social Research]] (''Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung'') of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt am Main]] in Germany. The term \"Frankfurt School\" is an informal term used to designate the thinkers affiliated with the Institute for Social Research or influenced by them\u2014it is not the title of any institution and the main thinkers of the Frankfurt School did not use the term to refer to themselves.\n\nThe Frankfurt School gathered together dissident Marxists, severe critics of capitalism who believed that some of Marx's alleged followers had come to parrot a narrow selection of Marx's ideas, usually in defense of orthodox communist or social democratic parties. Influenced especially by the failure of working-class revolutions in Western Europe after [[World War I]] and by the rise of [[Nazism]] in an economically, technologically and culturally advanced nation (Germany), they took up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought might serve to clarify social conditions which Marx himself had never seen. They drew on other schools of thought to fill in Marx's perceived omissions.\n\nMax Weber exerted a major influence, as did Sigmund Freud (as in [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] synthesis in the 1954 work ''Eros and Civilization''). Their emphasis on the \"critical\" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of [[positivism]], crude materialism and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] by returning to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[critical philosophy]] and its successors in German [[idealism]], principally Hegel's philosophy, with its emphasis on [[negation]] and [[contradiction]] as inherent properties of reality.\n\n=== Autonomist Marxism ===\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[Autonomism]] is a category of Marxist social movements around the world that emphasize the ability to organize in autonomous and horizontal networks, as opposed to hierarchical structures such as unions or parties.  Autonomist Marxists, including [[Harry Cleaver]], broaden the definition of the working-class to include salaried and unpaid labour, such as skilled professions and housework\u2014it focuses on the working class in advanced capitalist states as the primary force of change in the construct of capital. Modern autonomist theorists such as [[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that network power constructs are the most effective methods of organization against the neoliberal regime of accumulation and predict a massive shift in the dynamics of capital into a [[Empire (Hardt and Negri book)|21st century empire]].\n\n=== Analytical Marxism ===\n{{main|Analytical Marxism}}\n[[Analytical Marxism]] refers to a style of thinking about Marxism that was prominent among a half-dozen [[Analytic philosophy|analytically trained]] English-speaking philosophers and social scientists during the 1980s. It was mainly associated with the [[September Group]] of academics, so called because they have biennial meetings in varying locations every other September to discuss common interests. The group also dubbed itself \"Non-Bullshit Marxism\".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Marcus|last=Roberts|url=https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/analytical-marxism-an-ex-paradigm|title=Analytical Marxism \u2013 an ex-paradigm?

It was opposed by Louis Althusser's \"[[antihumanism]]\", who qualified it as a revisionist movement.\n\nMarxist humanists contend that Marxism developed lopsided because Marx's early works were unknown until after the orthodox ideas were in vogue\u2014the ''Manuscripts of 1844'' were published only in 1932. They stress that there is continuity between these early writings and the economic theory of Marx's ''[[Das_Kapital|Capital]]'' and that it is necessary to grasp Marx's philosophical foundations to properly understand his later works.\n\n=== Marxist theology ===\n{{see also|Religious communism|Religious socialism|Christian left|Black theology}}\nAlthough Marx was intensely critical of institutionalized [[religion]] including [[Christianity]], some Christians have \"accepted the basic premises of Marxism and attempted to reinterpret Christian faith from this perspective\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Richardson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PN7UMUTBBPAC|chapter=Marxist Theology|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology|publisher=[[SCM Press]]|location=London, England|date=1989|ISBN=978-0334022084|page=352}}</ref> Some of the resulting examples are some forms of [[liberation theology]] and [[black theology]]. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] strongly opposed radical liberation theology while he was still a cardinal, with the Vatican [[Spe Salvi|condemning]] acceptance of Marxism. Black theologian [[James H.

Its most eminent proponents were [[Max Adler (Marxist)|Max Adler]], [[Otto Bauer]], [[Rudolf Hilferding]] and\n[[Karl Renner]]. It was influenced by contemporaneous intellectual trends, including the prominence of [[neo-Kantianism]] and [[positivism]] in [[philosophy]] and the emergence of [[marginalism]] in [[economics]]. The group confronted various issues specific to the governing of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], such as the problem of the [[National Question]], the rise of the interventionist state and the changing class-structure of early 20th century capitalist societies.\n\n== De Leonism ==\n[[De Leonism]] is a form of syndicalist Marxism developed by [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] which exists to the present day.\n\nDe Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. The highly decentralized and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the democratic centralism of Marxism\u2013Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]] should lead the working class to carry out the revolution. De Leon and other De Leonist writers have issued frequent polemics against [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] movements\u2014especially the [[Socialist Party of America]]\u2014and consider them to be reformist or [[Bourgeois socialism|bourgeois socialist]].\n\nDe Leonists have traditionally refrained from any activity or alliances viewed by them as trying to reform capitalism, though the Socialist Labor Party in De Leon's time was active during strikes and such, like [[Social justice#Social justice movements|social justice movements]].\n\n== Eurocommunism ==\n{{main|Eurocommunism}}\nBeginning around the 1970s, various communist parties in Western Europe such as the [[Italian Communist Party]] under [[Enrico Berlinguer]] and the [[Communist Party of Spain]] under [[Santiago Carrillo]] tried to hew to a more independent line from Moscow. Particularly in Italy, they leaned on the theories of Antonio Gramsci. This trend went by the name [[Eurocommunism]] was especially prominent in Italy, Spain and France.<ref>Kingsley, Richard, ed. (1981). ''In Search of Eurocommunism''. Macmillan.</ref>\n\n== Post-Marxism ==\n{{main|Post-Marxism}}\n[[Post-Marxism]] represents the theoretical work of philosophers and social theorists who have built their theories upon those of Marx and Marxists, but exceeded the limits of those theories in ways that puts them outside of Marxism. It begins with the basic tenets of Marxism, but moves away from the mode of production as the starting point for analysis and includes factors other than class, such as gender, ethnicity etc. and a reflexive relationship between the base and superstructure.\n\nMarxism remains a powerful theory in some unexpected and relatively obscure places and is not always properly labeled as \"Marxism\". For example, many Mexican and some American archaeologists still employ a Marxist model to explain the [[Classic Maya collapse]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.counterfire.org/a-marxist-history-of-the-world/9299-a-marxist-history-of-the-world-27-new-world-empires-maya-aztec-and-inca|title=A Marxist History of the World part 27: New World Empires: Maya, Aztec, and Inca|last=Faulkner|first=Neil|website=Counterfire|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref> (c. 900 A.D.) \u2013 without mentioning Marxism by name.\n\n== Marxist feminism ==\n{{main|Marxist feminism}}\n[[Marxist feminism]] is a sub-type of [[feminism|feminist]] theory which focuses on the dismantling of capitalism as a way to liberate women. Marxist feminism states that [[private property]], which gives rise to [[economic inequality]] as well as dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women's oppression.\n\nAccording to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations\u2014that is people's capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit. Marxist feminists see [[gender inequality]] as determined ultimately by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. Gender oppression is [[Oppression#Class oppression|class oppression]] and women's subordination is seen as a form of class oppression which is maintained (like [[racism]]) because it serves the interests of capital and the [[ruling class]]. Marxist feminists have extended traditional Marxist analysis by looking at [[Domestic worker|domestic labour]] as well as [[Wage slavery|wage work]] in order to support their position.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Marxist schools of thought|*]]\n[[Category:Marxist theory]]\n", "text_old": "{{lead too short|date=December 2017}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\n{{Marxism}}\n[[Marxism]] is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that frames [[capitalism]] through a paradigm of exploitation, analyzes [[Social class|class]] relations and [[Social conflict|social conflict]] using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and takes a [[dialectic]]al view of social transformation. Marxism uses a [[materialist]] methodology, now known as [[historical materialism]], to analyze and critique the development of class society and especially of [[capitalism]] as well as the role of [[class struggle]]s in systemic economic, social and political change.\n\nAccording to [[Marxist theory]], class conflict arises in [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist societies]] due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed and exploited [[proletariat]]\u2014a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services\u2014and the [[bourgeoisie]]\u2014the [[ruling class]] that owns the [[means of production]] and extracts its wealth through appropriation of the [[surplus product]] produced by the proletariat in the form of [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a society's [[productive forces]] against its [[relations of production]], results in a period of short-term crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying [[alienation of labor]] experienced by the proletariat, albeit with varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. In periods of deep crisis, the resistance of the oppressed can culminate in a [[proletarian revolution]] which, if victorious, leads to the establishment of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]\u2014a socioeconomic system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production, [[To each according to his contribution|distribution based on one's contribution]] and [[Production for use|production organized directly for use]]. As the productive forces continued to advance, socialism would be transformed into a [[communist society]], i.e. a classless, stateless, humane society based on [[common ownership]] and [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|distribution based on one's needs]].\n\nWhile it originates from the works of 19th century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, with the result that there is now no single definitive Marxist theory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|url=https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0|url-access=registration|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsmarxian00wolf_0/page/130 130]|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched.

It assumes that the form of economic organization, or [[mode of production]], influences all other social phenomena\u2014including wider social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]]. As [[forces of production]] improve, existing forms of organizing production become obsolete and hinder further progress. As [[Karl Marx]] observed: \"At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or\u2014this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms\u2014with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters.

Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]]. In a socialist society, [[private property]]\u2014in the form of the means of production\u2014would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs\u2014that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: \"Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then the appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment\".<ref>''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882).

The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]].

Orthodox Marxism aims to simplify, codify and systematize Marxist method and theory by clarifying the perceived ambiguities and contradictions of classical Marxism. The philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development (advances in technology in the [[productive forces]]) is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations and that social systems and their relations (e.g. [[feudalism]], [[capitalism]] and so on) become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop, which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions. This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental society-wide changes and ultimately leads to the emergence of new [[economic system]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rees|first=John|title=The Algebra of Revolution: The Dialectic and the Classical Marxist Tradition|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=July 1998|isbn=978-0415198776}}</ref>\n\nAs a term, orthodox Marxism refers to the methods of historical materialism and of [[dialectical materialism]] and not the normative aspects inherent to classical Marxism, without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marx's investigations.<ref>Luk\u00e1cs, Georg.

Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories developed from Marxism as well as Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theory for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the agrarian early 20th-century [[Russian Empire]]. Leninism was the Russian application of Marxist economics and political philosophy, effected and realised by the Bolsheviks, the vanguard party who led the fight for the political independence of the working class. In 1903, Lenin stated: <blockquote>We want to achieve a new and better order of society: in this new and better society there must be neither rich nor poor; all will have to work. Not a handful of rich people, but all the working people must enjoy the fruits of their common labour. Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people. This new and better society is called socialist society. The teachings about this society are called 'socialism'.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1903/rp/1.htm \"To the Rural Poor\" (1903)]. ''Collected Works''. vol. 6. p. 366.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe most important consequence of a Leninist-style theory of imperialism is the strategic need for workers in the industrialized countries to bloc or ally with the oppressed nations contained within their respective countries' colonies abroad in order to overthrow capitalism. This is the source of the slogan, which shows the Leninist conception that not only the proletariat\u2014as is traditional to Marxism\u2014are the sole revolutionary force, but all oppressed people: \"Workers and Oppressed Peoples of the World, Unite!\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Ronald Grigor|last=Suny|title=Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite: Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920|volume=1|publisher=Pathfinder Press|location=New York City|date=1991|ISBN=978-0-87348-940-9|page=xiii}}</ref> The other distinguishing characteristic of Leninism is how it approaches the question of organization. Lenin believed that the traditional model of the [[Social Democratic Party|social democratic parties]] of the time, a loose, multitendency organization, was inadequate for overthrowing the Tsarist regime in Russia. He proposed a cadre of professional revolutionaries that disciplined itself under the model of [[democratic centralism]].<ref>{{cite book|first=August H.|last=Nimtz|title=Lenin's Electoral Strategy from Marx and Engels Through the Revolution of 1905: The Ballot, the Streets\u2014or Both|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mh4CAwAAQBAJ|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=Basingstoke, England|date=2014|isbn=978-1137389961|page=56}}</ref>\n\n== Left communism ==\n{{main|Left communism}}\n[[Left communism]] is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first two congresses.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ronald I.|last=Kowalski|title=The Bolshevik Party in Conflict: The Left Communist Opposition of 1918|publisher=[[Palgrave MacMillan]]|location=Basingstoke, England|date=1991|ISBN=978-1-349-10369-0|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-10367-6|page=2}}</ref>  \n\nAlthough she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has been heavily influential for most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included [[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Otto R\u00fchle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Amadeo Bordiga]] and [[Paul Mattick]].\n\nProminent left communist groups existing today include the [[International Communist Current]] and the Internationalist Communist Tendency. Different factions from the old Bordigist International Communist Party are also considered left communist organizations.\n\n== Council communism ==\n{{main|Council communism}}\n[[Council communism]] is a movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]]. Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both [[libertarian Marxism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].\n\nIn contrast to [[social democracy]] and [[Leninism]], the central argument of council communism is that democratic [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and governmental power. This view is opposed to both the [[reformist]] and the revolutionary Leninist ideologies, with their stress on respectively parliaments and institutional government (i.e. by applying social reforms on the one hand and [[Vanguard party|vanguard parties]] and participative [[democratic centralism]] on the other).\n\nThe core principle of council communism is that the government and the economy should be managed by [[workers' councils]] composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose [[Command economy|state-run authoritarian]] [[state socialism]]/[[state capitalism]]. They also oppose the idea of a revolutionary party since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a worker's democracy which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.\n\n== Trotskyism ==\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Leon Trotsky]]]]\n[[Trotskyism]] is the branch as advocated by Russian Marxist [[Leon Trotsky]], a contemporary of Lenin from the early years of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], where he led a small trend in competition with both Lenin's [[Bolsheviks]] and the [[Mensheviks]]. Opposed to [[Stalinism]], Trostkyism supports the theory of [[permanent revolution]] and [[world revolution]] instead of the [[two stage theory]] and [[socialism in one country]]. It supported [[proletarian internationalism]] and another [[communist revolution]] in the Soviet Union which Trotsky claimed had become a [[degenerated worker's state]] under the leadership of Stalin in which class relations had re-emerged in a new form, rather than the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nStruggling against Stalin for power in the Soviet Union, Trotsky and his supporters organized into the [[Left Opposition]] and their platform became known as Trotskyism. Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. While in exile, Trotsky continued his campaign against Stalin, founding in 1938 the [[Fourth International]], a Trotskyist rival to the [[Communist International]]. In August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico City on Stalin's orders.\n\nTrotsky's followers claim to be the heirs of Lenin in the same way that mainstream Marxist\u2013Leninists do. There are several distinguishing characteristics of this school of thought\u2014foremost is the theory of permanent revolution. This stated that in less-developed countries the bourgeoisie were too weak to lead their own [[bourgeois-democratic revolution]]s. Due to this weakness, it fell to the proletariat to carry out the bourgeois revolution. With power in its hands, the proletariat would then continue this revolution permanently, transforming it from a national bourgeois revolution to a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist]] [[World revolution|international revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Leon|last=Trotsky|authorlink=Leon Trotsky|title=The Permanent Revolution|date=1931|quote=The Permanent Revolution is Not a \u2018Leap\u2019 by the Proletariat, but the Reconstruction of the Nation under the Leadership of the Proletariat.}}</ref>\n\nAnother shared characteristic between Trotskyists is a variety of theoretical justifications for their negative appraisal of the post-Lenin Soviet Union after Trotsky was expelled by a majority vote from the [[All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubenstein|first=Joshua|title=Leon Trotsky: A Revolutionary's Life|date=2011|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=Hartford, Connecticut|isbn=9780300137248|pages=155\u2013202}}</ref> and subsequently from the Soviet Union.

[[Anti-revisionism]] is a faction within Marxist\u2013Leninism that rejects Khrushchev's theses.

It is the variety of [[anti-revisionism]] that took inspiration and in some cases received material support from China, especially during the Mao period. There are several key concepts that were developed by Mao. First, Mao concurred with Stalin that not only does class struggle continue under the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], it actually accelerates as long as gains are being made by the proletariat at the expense of the disenfranchised bourgeoisie. Second, Mao developed a strategy for [[socialist revolution]] called [[protracted people's war]] in what he termed the [[semi-feudal]] countries of the [[Third World]] and that relied heavily on the peasantry. Third, Mao wrote many theoretical articles on epistemology and dialectics which he called contradictions.\n\n[[Hoxhaism]], so named because of the central contribution of Albanian statesman [[Enver Hoxha]], was closely aligned with China for a number of years, but it grew critical of Maoism because of the so-called [[Three Worlds Theory]] put forth by elements within the Communist Party of China and because it viewed the actions of Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] unfavorably. However, Hoxhaism as a trend ultimately came to the understanding that socialism had never existed in China at all.\n\n== Maoism ==\n{{main|Maoism}}\n[[File:Mao Zedong 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mao Zedong]]]]\n[[Maoism]] ({{lang-zh|s=\u6bdb\u6cfd\u4e1c\u601d\u60f3|p=M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng s\u012bxi\u01ceng|l=Mao Zedong Thought}}) is the theory that [[Mao Zedong]] developed for realising a socialist revolution in the agricultural, pre-industrial society of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] and later the [[People's Republic of China]]. The philosophical difference between Maoism and Marxism\u2013Leninism is that the [[peasantry]] are the [[Vanguardism|revolutionary vanguard]] in pre-industrial societies rather than the [[proletariat]]. This updating and adaptation of Marxism\u2013Leninism to Chinese conditions in which revolutionary praxis is primary and ideological orthodoxy is secondary represents urban Marxism\u2013Leninism adapted to pre-industrial China. The claim that Mao had adapted Marxism\u2013Leninism to Chinese conditions evolved into the idea that he had updated it in a fundamental way applying to the world as a whole.<ref name=\"World History 2000. p. 769\">Lenman, B.

James]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Maurice Brinton]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]], [[Ernesto Screpanti]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]].\n\n== Western Marxism ==\n{{main|Western Marxism}}\n[[Western Marxism]] is a current of [[Marxist theory]] that arose from [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] in the aftermath of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] in [[Russia]] and the ascent of [[Leninism]]. The term denotes a loose collection of Marxist theorists  who emphasised culture, philosophy and art, in contrast to the Marxism of the Soviet Union.\n\n=== Key Western Marxists ===\n==== Georg Luk\u00e1cs ====\n[[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs|Georg Luk\u00e1cs]] (13 April 1885 \u2013 4 June 1971) was a Hungarian Marxist philosopher and [[literary critic]], who founded Western Marxism with his magnum opus ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]''. Written between 1919 and 1922 and first published in 1923, the collection  of essays contributed to debates concerning Marxism and its relation to sociology, politics and philosophy. The book also reconstructed aspects of [[Marx's theory of alienation]] before many of the works of the [[young Marx]], in which the theory is most clearly expounded, had been published. Luk\u00e1cs's work stresses Karl Marx's origins in [[Hegelianism]] and elaborates Marxist theories such as [[ideology]], [[false consciousness]], [[reification (Marxism)|reification]] and [[class consciousness]].\n\n==== Karl Korsch ====\n[[Karl Korsch]] (15 August 1886 \u2013 21 October 1961) was born in Tostedt, near Hamburg, to the family of a middle-ranking bank official.\n\nIn his later work, he rejected [[Orthodox Marxism]] as historically outmoded, wanting to adapt Marxism to a new historical situation. He wrote in his ''Ten Theses'' (1950) that \"the first step in re-establishing a revolutionary theory and practice consists in breaking with that Marxism which claims to monopolize revolutionary initiative as well as theoretical and practical direction\" and that \"today, all attempts to re-establish the Marxist doctrine as a whole in its original function as a theory of the working classes social revolution are reactionary utopias\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/korsch/1950/ten-theses.htm Karl Korsch (1950) Ten Theses on Marxism  Today]</ref>\n\nKorsch was especially concerned that Marxist theory was losing its precision and validity\u2014in the words of the day, becoming \"vulgarized\"\u2014within the upper echelons of the various socialist organizations. His masterwork ''Marxism and Philosophy'' is an attempt to re-establish the historic character of Marxism as the heir to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].\n\n==== Antonio Gramsci ====\n[[Antonio Gramsci]] (22 January 1891{{spaced ndash}}27 April 1937) was an Italian writer, politician and political theorist. He was a founding member and onetime leader of the [[Communist Party of Italy]].  He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment by the Italian [[Fascist]] regime. These writings, known as the ''Prison Notebooks'', contain Gramsci's tracing of Italian history and nationalism as well as some ideas in Marxist theory, [[critical theory]] and educational theory associated with his name such as:\n* [[Cultural hegemony]] as a means of maintaining the [[State (polity)|state]] in a capitalist society\n* The need for popular workers' education to encourage development of intellectuals from the working class\n* The distinction between [[political society]] (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) which dominates directly and coercively and [[civil society]] (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) where leadership is constituted through ideology or by means of consent\n* \"Absolute [[historicism]]\"\n* The critique of [[economic determinism]]\n* The critique of [[materialism|philosophical materialism]]\n\n==== Herbert Marcuse ====\n[[Herbert Marcuse]] (19 July 1898 \u2013 29 July 1979) was a prominent German-American philosopher and sociologist of Jewish descent and a member of the Frankfurt School.\n\nMarcuse's critiques of capitalist society (especially his 1955 synthesis of Marx and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' and his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'') resonated with the concerns of the leftist student movement in the 1960s. Because of his willingness to speak at student protests, Marcuse soon became known as \"the father of the [[New Left]]\", a term he disliked and rejected.\n\n==== Jean-Paul Sartre ====\n[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (21 June 1905 \u2013 15 April 1980) was already a key and influential philosopher and playwright for his early writings on [[individualism|individualistic]] [[existentialism]]. In his later career, Sartre attempted to reconcile the existential philosophy of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] with Marxist philosophy and Hegelian dialectics in his work ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Ronald|last=Aronson|url=http://bostonreview.net/philosophy-religion/ronald-aronson-philosophy-our-time|title=The Philosophy of Our Time|magazine=[[Boston Review]]|publisher=Boston Critic, Inc.|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=November 14, 2018|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref> Sartre was also involved in Marxist politics and was impressed upon visiting Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], calling him \"not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Jon|last=Anderson|title=Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life|url=https://archive.org/details/cheguevara00jonl|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|location=New York City|date=1997|ISBN=978-0802144119|page=[https://archive.org/details/cheguevara00jonl/page/468 468]}}</ref>\n\n==== Louis Althusser ====\n[[Louis Althusser]] (16 October 1918 \u2013 22 October 1990) was a Marxist philosopher. He was a lifelong member and sometimes strong critic of the [[French Communist Party]]. His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of [[empiricism]] on Marxist theory and [[humanism]] and [[Reformism|reformist socialist]] orientations which manifested as divisions in the European Communist parties as well as the problem of the cult of personality and of ideology itself. Althusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French [[structuralism]] is not a simple affiliation and he is critical of many aspects of structuralism.\n\nHis essay ''Marxism and Humanism'' is a strong statement of anti-humanism in Marxist theory, condemning ideas like \"human potential\" and \"species-being\", which are often put forth by Marxists, as outgrowths of a bourgeois ideology of \"humanity\". His essay ''Contradiction and Overdetermination'' borrows the concept of [[overdetermination]] from [[psychoanalysis]] in order to replace the idea of \"contradiction\" with a more complex model of multiple [[causality]] in political situations (an idea closely related to Gramsci's concept of [[hegemony]]).\n\nAlthusser is also widely known as a theorist of ideology and his best-known essay is ''Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Toward an Investigation''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Louis|last=Althusser|authorlink=Louis Althusser|chapter=Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|title=Lenin and Philosophy and other Essays|date=1970|publisher=[[Monthly Review Press]]|location=New York City|pages=121\u2013176|ISBN=0-902308-89-0|language=French|translator-first=Ben|translator-last=Brewster}}</ref> The essay establishes the concept of ideology, also based on Gramsci's theory of hegemony. Whereas hegemony is ultimately determined entirely by political forces, ideology draws on [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] concepts of the unconscious and mirror-phase respectively and describes the structures and systems that allow us to meaningfully have a concept of the self.\n\n==== Christopher Hill, Eric Hobsbawm and E. P. Thompson ====\nBritish Marxism deviated sharply from French (especially Althusserian) Marxism and like the Frankfurt School developed an attention to cultural experience and an emphasis on human agency while growing increasingly distant from determinist views of materialism. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] formed the [[Communist Party Historians Group]] in 1946. They shared a common interest in \"history from below\" and class structure in early capitalist society. Important members of the group included [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[Raphael Samuel]].\n\nWhile some members of the group (most notably Thompson) left the party after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history. Thompson famously engaged Althusser in ''The Poverty of Theory'',<ref>Thompson, E. P., (1978). ''The Poverty of Theory & other essays'' Merlin, 1978. {{ISBN|0-85036-231-8}}.</ref> arguing that Althusser's theory overdetermined history and left no space for historical revolt by the oppressed.\n\n=== Structural Marxism ===\n{{main|Structural Marxism}}\n[[Structural Marxism]] is an approach to Marxism based on structuralism, primarily associated with the work of the French theorist Louis Althusser and his students. It was influential in France during the late 1960s and 1970s and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and sociologists outside France during the 1970s.\n\n=== Neo-Marxism ===\n{{main|Neo-Marxism}}\n[[Neo-Marxism]] is a school of Marxism that began in the 20th century and hearkened back to the early writings of Marx before the influence of [[Friedrich Engels]], which focused on dialectical idealism rather than [[dialectical materialism]]. It thus rejected economic determinism, being instead far more [[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]. Neo-Marxism adds [[Max Weber]]'s broader understanding of [[social inequality]], such as [[Social status|status]] and [[Power (sociology)|power]], to orthodox Marxist thought.\n\n=== Frankfurt School ===\n{{main|Frankfurt School}}\n{{Frankfurt School}}\nThe [[Frankfurt School]] is a school of neo-Marxist social theory, social research and philosophy. The grouping emerged at the [[Institute for Social Research]] (''Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung'') of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt am Main]] in Germany. The term \"Frankfurt School\" is an informal term used to designate the thinkers affiliated with the Institute for Social Research or influenced by them\u2014it is not the title of any institution and the main thinkers of the Frankfurt School did not use the term to refer to themselves.\n\nThe Frankfurt School gathered together dissident Marxists, severe critics of capitalism who believed that some of Marx's alleged followers had come to parrot a narrow selection of Marx's ideas, usually in defense of orthodox communist or social democratic parties. Influenced especially by the failure of working-class revolutions in Western Europe after [[World War I]] and by the rise of [[Nazism]] in an economically, technologically and culturally advanced nation (Germany), they took up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought might serve to clarify social conditions which Marx himself had never seen. They drew on other schools of thought to fill in Marx's perceived omissions.\n\nMax Weber exerted a major influence, as did Sigmund Freud (as in [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] synthesis in the 1954 work ''Eros and Civilization''). Their emphasis on the \"critical\" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of [[positivism]], crude materialism and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] by returning to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[critical philosophy]] and its successors in German [[idealism]], principally Hegel's philosophy, with its emphasis on [[negation]] and [[contradiction]] as inherent properties of reality.\n\n=== Autonomist Marxism ===\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[Autonomism]] is a category of Marxist social movements around the world that emphasize the ability to organize in autonomous and horizontal networks, as opposed to hierarchical structures such as unions or parties.  Autonomist Marxists, including [[Harry Cleaver]], broaden the definition of the working-class to include salaried and unpaid labour, such as skilled professions and housework\u2014it focuses on the working class in advanced capitalist states as the primary force of change in the construct of capital. Modern autonomist theorists such as [[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that network power constructs are the most effective methods of organization against the neoliberal regime of accumulation and predict a massive shift in the dynamics of capital into a [[Empire (Hardt and Negri book)|21st century empire]].\n\n=== Analytical Marxism ===\n{{main|Analytical Marxism}}\n[[Analytical Marxism]] refers to a style of thinking about Marxism that was prominent among a half-dozen [[Analytic philosophy|analytically trained]] English-speaking philosophers and social scientists during the 1980s. It was mainly associated with the [[September Group]] of academics, so called because they have biennial meetings in varying locations every other September to discuss common interests. The group also dubbed itself \"Non-Bullshit Marxism\".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Marcus|last=Roberts|url=https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/analytical-marxism-an-ex-paradigm|title=Analytical Marxism \u2013 an ex-paradigm?

It was opposed by Louis Althusser's \"[[antihumanism]]\", who qualified it as a revisionist movement.\n\nMarxist humanists contend that Marxism developed lopsided because Marx's early works were unknown until after the orthodox ideas were in vogue\u2014the ''Manuscripts of 1844'' were published only in 1932. They stress that there is continuity between these early writings and the economic theory of Marx's ''[[Das_Kapital|Capital]]'' and that it is necessary to grasp Marx's philosophical foundations to properly understand his later works.\n\n=== Marxist theology ===\n{{see also|Religious communism|Religious socialism|Christian left|Black theology}}\nAlthough Marx was intensely critical of institutionalized [[religion]] including [[Christianity]], some Christians have \"accepted the basic premises of Marxism and attempted to reinterpret Christian faith from this perspective\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Richardson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PN7UMUTBBPAC|chapter=Marxist Theology|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology|publisher=[[SCM Press]]|location=London, England|date=1989|ISBN=978-0334022084|page=352}}</ref> Some of the resulting examples are some forms of [[liberation theology]] and [[black theology]]. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] strongly opposed radical liberation theology while he was still a cardinal, with the Vatican [[Spe Salvi|condemning]] acceptance of Marxism. Black theologian [[James H. Cone]] wrote in his book ''For My People'' that \"for analyzing the structure of capitalism. Marxism as a tool of social analysis can disclose the gap between appearance and reality, and thereby help Christians to see how things really are\".<ref>{{cite book|first=James H.|last=Cone|authorlink=James H.

Its most eminent proponents were [[Max Adler (Marxist)|Max Adler]], [[Otto Bauer]], [[Rudolf Hilferding]] and\n[[Karl Renner]]. It was influenced by contemporaneous intellectual trends, such as the prominence of [[neo-Kantianism]] and [[positivism]] in [[philosophy]] and the emergence of [[marginalism]] in [[economics]]. The group confronted various issues specific to the governing of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], such as the problem of the [[National Question]], the rise of the interventionist state and the changing class-structure of early 20th century capitalist societies.\n\n== De Leonism ==\n[[De Leonism]] is a form of syndicalist Marxism developed by [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] which exists to the present day.\n\nDe Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. The highly decentralized and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the democratic centralism of Marxism\u2013Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]] should lead the working class to carry out the revolution. De Leon and other De Leonist writers have issued frequent polemics against [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] movements\u2014especially the [[Socialist Party of America]]\u2014and consider them to be reformist or [[Bourgeois socialism|bourgeois socialist]].\n\nDe Leonists have traditionally refrained from any activity or alliances viewed by them as trying to reform capitalism, though the Socialist Labor Party in De Leon's time was active during strikes and such, like [[Social justice#Social justice movements|social justice movements]].\n\n== Eurocommunism ==\n{{main|Eurocommunism}}\nBeginning around the 1970s, various communist parties in Western Europe such as the [[Italian Communist Party]] under [[Enrico Berlinguer]] and the [[Communist Party of Spain]] under [[Santiago Carrillo]] tried to hew to a more independent line from Moscow. Particularly in Italy, they leaned on the theories of Antonio Gramsci. This trend went by the name [[Eurocommunism]] was especially prominent in Italy, Spain and France.<ref>Kingsley, Richard, ed. (1981). ''In Search of Eurocommunism''. Macmillan.</ref>\n\n== Post-Marxism ==\n{{main|Post-Marxism}}\n[[Post-Marxism]] represents the theoretical work of philosophers and social theorists who have built their theories upon those of Marx and Marxists, but exceeded the limits of those theories in ways that puts them outside of Marxism. It begins with the basic tenets of Marxism, but moves away from the mode of production as the starting point for analysis and includes factors other than class, such as gender, ethnicity etc. and a reflexive relationship between the base and superstructure.\n\nMarxism remains a powerful theory in some unexpected and relatively obscure places and is not always properly labeled as \"Marxism\". For example, many Mexican and some American archaeologists still employ a Marxist model to explain the [[Classic Maya collapse]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.counterfire.org/a-marxist-history-of-the-world/9299-a-marxist-history-of-the-world-27-new-world-empires-maya-aztec-and-inca|title=A Marxist History of the World part 27: New World Empires: Maya, Aztec, and Inca|last=Faulkner|first=Neil|website=Counterfire|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref> (c. 900 A.D.) \u2013 without mentioning Marxism by name.\n\n== Marxist feminism ==\n{{main|Marxist feminism}}\n[[Marxist feminism]] is a sub-type of [[feminism|feminist]] theory which focuses on the dismantling of capitalism as a way to liberate women. Marxist feminism states that [[private property]], which gives rise to [[economic inequality]] as well as dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women's oppression.\n\nAccording to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations\u2014that is people's capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit. Marxist feminists see [[gender inequality]] as determined ultimately by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. Gender oppression is [[Oppression#Class oppression|class oppression]] and women's subordination is seen as a form of class oppression which is maintained (like [[racism]]) because it serves the interests of capital and the [[ruling class]]. Marxist feminists have extended traditional Marxist analysis by looking at [[Domestic worker|domestic labour]] as well as [[Wage slavery|wage work]] in order to support their position.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Marxist schools of thought|*]]\n[[Category:Marxist theory]]\n", "name_user": "Hanshans23", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAustro-Marxism", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_schools_of_thought"}

It was written by co-producer [[Kay Cannon]] and directed by series producer [[Don Scardino]]. It originally aired on the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC) network in the United States on December 3, 2009. Guest stars in the episode include [[Kristian Alfonso]], John Anderson, [[Will Arnett]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Chris Parnell]], [[Peter Reckell]], and [[Sherri Shepherd]].\n\nIn the episode, [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) starts her first day on her talk show ''Dealbreakers'' and appoints [[Frank Rossitano]] ([[Judah Friedlander]]) to replace her as the head writer of the fictional sketch comedy show ''The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan'' (''TGS''). Meanwhile, [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) tries to achieve an [[List of persons who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]] by winning the four awards: an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], and a [[Tony Award|Tony]].\n\n\"Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001\" has received generally positive reception from television critics. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was watched by 6.2&nbsp;million households during its original broadcast, and received a 3.0 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18\u201349 demographic. ''30 Rock'' editor Ken Eluto received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination in the category of [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series]] for his work in this episode. \"Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001\" was submitted for consideration on the behalf of Tina Fey for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] Emmy.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens with [[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) and [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) preparing for the beginning of her new talk show, ''Dealbreakers''. Jack's rival, [[List of 30 Rock characters#Devon Banks|Devon Banks]] ([[Will Arnett]]), complicates the situation by threatening to publicly ridicule Jack if the show loses money. Jack, under pressure, begins to interfere with Liz's appearance, sending her over the edge with insecurity. After 510 takes, they finally settle on an opening title to the show. After Liz locks herself in her dressing room, Jack shuts ''Dealbreakers'' down, but manages to break even by selling the show's opening titles; in future, whenever a television show is playing in the background of a Sheinhardt Universals soap opera, the ''Dealbreakers'' titles will be shown.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) realizes that although he has two sons with his wife [[List of 30 Rock characters#Angie Jordan|Angie]] ([[Sherri Shepherd]]), what is missing from his life is a daughter. As he shops for a special Christmas present for Angie, to try to convince her to have another child, Tracy finds a diamond encrusted \"EGOT\" necklace and sets a new life goal to achieve [[List of persons who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]] status by winning four major awards: an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], and a [[Tony Award|Tony]]. Tracy discovers many EGOT-ers have been composers and aspires to write the most popular song of all time. The \"EGOT\" necklace originally belonged to [[Philip Michael Thomas]] of ''[[Miami Vice]]''. After failing to combine five popular musical styles into one song, he seeks help from [[Whoopi Goldberg]], an EGOT title holder. Tracy sings his song to Angie and she is so moved she agrees to have another child.\n\nAt the same time, ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' staff writer [[Frank Rossitano]] ([[Judah Friedlander]]) is appointed head writer of the show in Liz's absence.

Meanwhile, [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) tries to achieve an [[List of persons who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]] by winning the four awards: an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], and a [[Tony Award|Tony]].\n\n\"Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001\" has received generally positive reception from television critics. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was watched by 6.2&nbsp;million households during its original broadcast, and received a 3.0 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18\u201349 demographic. ''30 Rock'' editor Ken Eluto received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination in the category of [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series]] for his work in this episode. \"Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001\" was submitted for consideration on the behalf of Tina Fey for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] Emmy.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens with [[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) and [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) preparing for the beginning of her new talk show, ''Dealbreakers''. Jack's rival, [[List of 30 Rock characters#Devon Banks|Devon Banks]] ([[Will Arnett]]), complicates the situation by threatening to publicly ridicule Jack if the show loses money. Jack, under pressure, begins to interfere with Liz's appearance, sending her over the edge with insecurity. After 510 takes, they finally settle on an opening title to the show. After Liz locks herself in her dressing room, Jack shuts ''Dealbreakers'' down, but manages to break even by selling the show's opening titles; in future, whenever a television show is playing in the background of a Sheinhardt Universals soap opera, the ''Dealbreakers'' titles will be shown.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) realizes that although he has two sons with his wife [[List of 30 Rock characters#Angie Jordan|Angie]] ([[Sherri Shepherd]]), what is missing from his life is a daughter. As he shops for a special Christmas present for Angie, to try to convince her to have another child, Tracy finds a diamond encrusted \"EGOT\" necklace and sets a new life goal to achieve [[List of persons who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]] status by winning four major awards: an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], and a [[Tony Award|Tony]]. Tracy discovers many EGOT-ers have been composers and aspires to write the most popular song of all time. The \"EGOT\" necklace originally belonged to [[Philip Michael Thomas]] of ''[[Miami Vice]]''. After failing to combine five popular musical styles into one song, he seeks help from [[Whoopi Goldberg]], an EGOT title holder. Tracy sings his song to Angie and she is so moved she agrees to have another child.\n\nAt the same time, ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' staff writer [[Frank Rossitano]] ([[Judah Friedlander]]) is appointed head writer of the show in Liz's absence.

Development in this region is restricted by the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. Other large settlements include the county town of [[Aylesbury]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] in the south near the [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[Princes Risborough]] in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of [[Buckingham]] and near [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]] in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is [[Milton Keynes]] in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a [[Borough of Milton Keynes|unitary authority]] separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by [[Buckinghamshire County Council]] as a [[non-metropolitan county]], and four district councils. In national elections, Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nA large part of the [[Chiltern Hills]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], runs through the south of the county and attracts many walkers and cyclists from London. In this area older buildings are often made from local flint and red brick. Many parts of the county are quite affluent and like many areas around London this has led to high housing costs: several reports have identified the market town of [[Beaconsfield]] as having among the highest property prices outside London.<ref name=\"Beaconsfield cost\">{{cite web|last1=Spence|first1=Graham|title=Beaconsfield is the most expensive market town in England|url=http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|website=Get Bucks|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103912/http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How expensive are the houses in your street?

To the north of the county lies rolling countryside in the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and around the [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]]. The [[River Thames|Thames]] forms part of the county's southwestern boundary. Notable service amenities in the county are [[Pinewood Film Studios]], [[Dorney Lake|Dorney rowing lake]] and part of [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone race track]] on the Northamptonshire border. Many national companies have head-offices or major centres in Milton Keynes. Heavy industry and quarrying is limited, with agriculture predominating after service industries.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Buckinghamshire}}\n[[File:Buckingham-215x334.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bucks (1904)]]\n\nThe name Buckinghamshire is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] in origin and means ''The district (scire) of Bucca's home''. ''Bucca's home'' refers to [[Buckingham]] in the north of the county, and is named after an Anglo-Saxon landowner. The county has been so named since about the 12th century; however, the county has existed since it was a subdivision of the kingdom of [[Mercia]] (585\u2013919).\n\nThe history of the area predates the Anglo-Saxon period and the county has a rich history starting from the [[Celt]]ic and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, though the Anglo-Saxons perhaps had the greatest impact on Buckinghamshire: the geography of the rural county is largely as it was in the Anglo-Saxon period. Later, Buckinghamshire became an important political arena, with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] intervening in local politics in the 16th century and just a century later the [[English Civil War]] was reputedly started by [[John Hampden]] in mid-Bucks.<ref name=\"Biography of John Hampden\">{{cite web |url=http://www.johnhampden.org/ |title=Biography of John Hampden |publisher=Johnhampden.org |accessdate=19 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908134006/http://www.johnhampden.org/ |archive-date=8 September 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the biggest change to the county came in the 19th century, when a combination of [[cholera]] and [[famine]] hit the rural county, forcing many to migrate to larger towns to find work. Not only did this alter the local economic situation, it meant a lot of land was going cheap at a time when the rich were more mobile and leafy Bucks became a popular rural idyll: an image it still has today. Buckinghamshire is a popular home for London commuters, leading to greater local affluence; however, some pockets of relative deprivation remain.<ref name=\"WLAP\">{{cite web|title=High Wycombe Local Community Area Profile |publisher=[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606165628/http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of London and coming of the railways promoted the growth of towns in the south of the county such as Aylesbury, Amersham and High Wycombe, leaving the town Buckingham itself to the north in a relative backwater.<ref name=\"About Buckingham UoB\">{{cite web|title=About Buckingham|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|website=University of Buckingham|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910190131/http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, most county institutions are now based in the south of the county or Milton Keynes, rather than in Buckingham.\n\n==Geography==\nThe county can be split into two sections geographically. The south leads from the [[River Thames]] up the gentle slopes of the [[Chiltern Hills]] to the more abrupt slopes on the northern side leading to the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and the Borough of Milton Keynes, a large and relatively level expanse of land that is  the southern [[drainage basin|catchment]] of the [[River Great Ouse]].\n\n===Waterways===\n\n====Rivers====\nThe county includes parts of two of the four longest rivers in England. The [[River Thames]] forms the southern boundary with [[Berkshire]], which has crept over the border at [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] and [[Slough]] so that the river is no longer the sole boundary between the two counties. The River Great Ouse rises just outside the county in [[Northamptonshire]] and flows east through Buckingham, Milton Keynes and [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]].\n\n====Canals====\n[[File:Medmenham River Thames geograph-4090549-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|The River Thames at Medmenham]]\nThe main branch of the [[Grand Union Canal]] passes through the county as do its arms to [[Slough Arm|Slough]], [[Aylesbury Canal Society|Aylesbury]], [[Wendover Arm Canal|Wendover]] (disused) and [[Buckingham Arm|Buckingham]] (disused). The canal has been incorporated into the landscaping of Milton Keynes.\n\n===Landscape===\nThe southern part of the county is dominated by the Chiltern Hills. The two highest points in Buckinghamshire are [[Haddington Hill]] in Wendover Woods (a stone marks its summit) at {{convert|267|m|ft}} above sea level, and [[Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire|Coombe Hill]] near [[Wendover]] at {{convert|260|m|ft}}.\n\n====Mineral extraction====\nQuarrying has taken place for chalk, clay for brickmaking and gravel and sand in the river valleys. Flint, also extracted from quarries, was often used to build older local buildings. Several former quarries, now flooded, have become nature reserves.<ref name=\"College Lake\">{{cite web|title=College Lake|url=http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|publisher=BBOWT|accessdate=12 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024012611/http://www.bbowt.org.uk/college-lake/about-college-lake|archive-date=24 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Buckinghamshire districts\n|'''District'''\n|'''Main towns'''\n|'''Population (2011)'''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|title= 2011 Census: KS101EW Usual resident population, local authorities in England and Wales|access-date= 11 December 2012|archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|archive-date= 5 January 2016|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n|'''Area'''\n|'''Population density (2011)'''\n|'''Population projection 2026'''\n|-\n|'''[[Aylesbury Vale]]'''||[[Aylesbury]], [[Buckingham]]||174,137|| 902.75&nbsp;km\u00b2 || 193/km\u00b2 || 213,000\n|-\n|'''[[Wycombe (district)|Wycombe]]'''||[[High Wycombe]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]]||171,644|| 324.57&nbsp;km\u00b2\n||529/km\u00b2||165,000\n|-\n|'''[[Chiltern (district)|Chiltern]]'''||[[Amersham]], [[Chesham]]||92,635||196.35&nbsp;km\u00b2||472/km\u00b2||89,000\n|-\n|'''[[South Bucks]]'''||[[Beaconsfield]], [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]]||66,867||141.28&nbsp;km\u00b2||474/km\u00b2||63,800\n|-\n|'''TOTAL Non-Metropolitan'''||N/A||'''505,283'''||'''1565&nbsp;km\u00b2'''||'''323/km\u00b2'''||'''530,800'''\n|-\n|'''[[Borough of Milton Keynes]]'''||[[Milton Keynes]], [[Newport Pagnell]]||248,821||308.63&nbsp;km\u00b2||806/km\u00b2||323,146<ref>{{cite web |url= http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120701155340/http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fCube/PE097_C1&study=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/fStudy/PE097&context=http://analysis.mkiobservatory.org.uk:80/obj/cServer/MKi&top=yes |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2012-07-01 |title= Milton Keynes intelligence Observatory }}</ref>\n|-\n|'''TOTAL Ceremonial'''||N/A||'''754,104'''||'''1874&nbsp;km\u00b2'''||'''402/km\u00b2'''||'''853,946'''\n|}\n[[File:CheshamPondParkView.jpg|thumb|Suburban housing, Chesham]]\nAs can be seen from the table, the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and the Borough of Milton Keynes have been identified as growth areas, with a projected population surge of almost 40,000 in Aylesbury Vale between 2011 and 2026 and 75,000 in Milton Keynes within the same 15 years.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The population of the Borough of Milton Keynes is expected to reach almost 350,000 by 2031.<ref name=\"guardian060104\">{{cite news |author=Hetherington, Peter |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/urbandesign/story/0,11200,1116879,00.html?=rss |title=Milton Keynes to double in size over next 20 years |work=The Guardian |accessdate=23 November 2012 |location=London |date=6 January 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418100925/http://society.guardian.co.uk/urbandesign/story/0,11200,1116879,00.html?=rss |archive-date=18 April 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBuckinghamshire is sub-divided into civil parishes.\n\n<!--The info here can easily be sourced from Census data.

There were four district councils that are subsidiary to the county council: Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, [[South Bucks]] and Wycombe districts.\n\nThe [[Buckinghamshire County Council|county council]] was founded in 1889 with its base in new municipal buildings in Walton Street, Aylesbury (which are still there). In Buckinghamshire, local administration was run on a two-tier system where public services are split between the county council and a series of district councils.\n\nIn 1966 the council moved into new premises: a 15-storey tower block in the centre of Aylesbury (pictured) designed by county architect [[Fred Pooley]]. It is now a Grade II [[listed building]].\n\nIn 1997 the northernmost<ref>The part of Buckinghamshire north of the [[Varsity Line]] together with [[Bow Brickhill]], [[Woburn Sands]] and parts of [[Bletchley and Fenny Stratford]].</ref> part of Buckinghamshire, then Milton Keynes District, was separated to form a unitary authority, the Borough of Milton Keynes; however for ceremonial and some other purposes Milton Keynes is still considered in law to be part of Buckinghamshire.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK \n  | type = act\n  | year = 1997\n  | chapter = 23\n  | act = Lieutenancies Act 1997\n}}</ref>\n\nBuckinghamshire County Council was a large employer in the county and provides a variety of services, including education (schools, adult education and youth services), social services, highways, libraries, County Archives and Record Office, the [[Buckinghamshire County Museum|County Museum]] and the [[Roald Dahl Children's Gallery]] in Aylesbury, consumer services and some aspects of waste disposal and planning.\n\n===Milton Keynes Council===\n[[Milton Keynes Council]] was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 as the Milton Keynes District Council, subordinate to Buckinghamshire County Council.

Development in this region is restricted by the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. Other large settlements include the county town of [[Aylesbury]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] in the south near the [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[Princes Risborough]] in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of [[Buckingham]] and near [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]] in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is [[Milton Keynes]] in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a [[Borough of Milton Keynes|unitary authority]] separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by [[Buckinghamshire County Council]] as a [[non-metropolitan county]], and four district councils. In national elections, Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nA large part of the [[Chiltern Hills]], an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]], runs through the south of the county and attracts many walkers and cyclists from London. In this area older buildings are often made from local flint and red brick. Many parts of the county are quite affluent and like many areas around London this has led to high housing costs: several reports have identified the market town of [[Beaconsfield]] as having among the highest property prices outside London.<ref name=\"Beaconsfield cost\">{{cite web|last1=Spence|first1=Graham|title=Beaconsfield is the most expensive market town in England|url=http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|website=Get Bucks|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103912/http://www.getbucks.co.uk/news/local-news/beaconsfield-most-expensive-market-town-8257800|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How expensive are the houses in your street?

To the north of the county lies rolling countryside in the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and around the [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]]. The [[River Thames|Thames]] forms part of the county's southwestern boundary. Notable service amenities in the county are [[Pinewood Film Studios]], [[Dorney Lake|Dorney rowing lake]] and part of [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone race track]] on the Northamptonshire border. Many national companies have head-offices or major centres in Milton Keynes. Heavy industry and quarrying is limited, with agriculture predominating after service industries.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Buckinghamshire}}\n[[File:Buckingham-215x334.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Bucks (1904)]]\n\nThe name Buckinghamshire is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] in origin and means ''The district (scire) of Bucca's home''. ''Bucca's home'' refers to [[Buckingham]] in the north of the county, and is named after an Anglo-Saxon landowner. The county has been so named since about the 12th century; however, the county has existed since it was a subdivision of the kingdom of [[Mercia]] (585\u2013919).\n\nThe history of the area predates the Anglo-Saxon period and the county has a rich history starting from the [[Celt]]ic and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods, though the Anglo-Saxons perhaps had the greatest impact on Buckinghamshire: the geography of the rural county is largely as it was in the Anglo-Saxon period. Later, Buckinghamshire became an important political arena, with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] intervening in local politics in the 16th century and just a century later the [[English Civil War]] was reputedly started by [[John Hampden]] in mid-Bucks.<ref name=\"Biography of John Hampden\">{{cite web |url=http://www.johnhampden.org/ |title=Biography of John Hampden |publisher=Johnhampden.org |accessdate=19 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908134006/http://www.johnhampden.org/ |archive-date=8 September 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the biggest change to the county came in the 19th century, when a combination of [[cholera]] and [[famine]] hit the rural county, forcing many to migrate to larger towns to find work. Not only did this alter the local economic situation, it meant a lot of land was going cheap at a time when the rich were more mobile and leafy Bucks became a popular rural idyll: an image it still has today. Buckinghamshire is a popular home for London commuters, leading to greater local affluence; however, some pockets of relative deprivation remain.<ref name=\"WLAP\">{{cite web|title=High Wycombe Local Community Area Profile |publisher=[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606165628/http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/assets/content/bcc/docs/research/area_profiles/Wycombe2008.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe expansion of London and coming of the railways promoted the growth of towns in the south of the county such as Aylesbury, Amersham and High Wycombe, leaving the town Buckingham itself to the north in a relative backwater.<ref name=\"About Buckingham UoB\">{{cite web|title=About Buckingham|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|website=University of Buckingham|accessdate=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910190131/http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history/town|archive-date=10 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, most county institutions are now based in the south of the county or Milton Keynes, rather than in Buckingham.\n\n==Geography==\nThe county can be split into two sections geographically. The south leads from the [[River Thames]] up the gentle slopes of the [[Chiltern Hills]] to the more abrupt slopes on the northern side leading to the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and the Borough of Milton Keynes, a large and relatively level expanse of land that is  the southern [[drainage basin|catchment]] of the [[River Great Ouse]].\n\n===Waterways===\n\n====Rivers====\nThe county includes parts of two of the four longest rivers in England. The [[River Thames]] forms the southern boundary with [[Berkshire]], which has crept over the border at [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] and [[Slough]] so that the river is no longer the sole boundary between the two counties. The River Great Ouse rises just outside the county in [[Northamptonshire]] and flows east through Buckingham, Milton Keynes and [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]].\n\n====Canals====\n[[File:Medmenham River Thames geograph-4090549-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|The River Thames at Medmenham]]\nThe main branch of the [[Grand Union Canal]] passes through the county as do its arms to [[Slough Arm|Slough]], [[Aylesbury Canal Society|Aylesbury]], [[Wendover Arm Canal|Wendover]] (disused) and [[Buckingham Arm|Buckingham]] (disused). The canal has been incorporated into the landscaping of Milton Keynes.\n\n===Landscape===\nThe southern part of the county is dominated by the Chiltern Hills.

The ceremonial county has a [[Lord Lieutenant]] and a [[High Sheriff]]. Currently the [[Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire]] is [[Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, 8th Baronet|Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher]] and the [[High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire]] is Amanda Nicholson.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The office of ''[[Custos rotulorum]]'' has been combined with that of Lord Lieutenant since 1702.\n\n===Buckinghamshire County Council (1889-2020)===\n\nUntil 31 March 2020, the ceremonial county had two top-level administrations: Buckinghamshire County Council, which administered about four-fifths of the county and the Borough of Milton Keynes, a [[unitary authority]], which administers the remaining fifth. There were four district councils that are subsidiary to the county council: Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, [[South Bucks]] and Wycombe districts.\n\nThe [[Buckinghamshire County Council|county council]] was founded in 1889 with its base in new municipal buildings in Walton Street, Aylesbury (which are still there). In Buckinghamshire, local administration was run on a two-tier system where public services are split between the county council and a series of district councils.\n\nIn 1966 the council moved into new premises: a 15-storey tower block in the centre of Aylesbury (pictured) designed by county architect [[Fred Pooley]]. It is now a Grade II [[listed building]].\n\nIn 1997 the northernmost<ref>The part of Buckinghamshire north of the [[Varsity Line]] together with [[Bow Brickhill]], [[Woburn Sands]] and parts of [[Bletchley and Fenny Stratford]].</ref> part of Buckinghamshire, then Milton Keynes District, was separated to form a unitary authority, the Borough of Milton Keynes; however for ceremonial and some other purposes Milton Keynes is still considered in law to be part of Buckinghamshire.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK \n  | type = act\n  | year = 1997\n  | chapter = 23\n  | act = Lieutenancies Act 1997\n}}</ref>\n\nBuckinghamshire County Council was a large employer in the county and provides a variety of services, including education (schools, adult education and youth services), social services, highways, libraries, County Archives and Record Office, the [[Buckinghamshire County Museum|County Museum]] and the [[Roald Dahl Children's Gallery]] in Aylesbury, consumer services and some aspects of waste disposal and planning.\n\n===Milton Keynes Council===\n[[Milton Keynes Council]] was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 as the Milton Keynes District Council, subordinate to Buckinghamshire County Council. The (district) council was first [[1973 United Kingdom local elections|elected in 1973]], a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the [[Borough of Milton Keynes|District of Milton Keynes]] on 1 April 1974.

That the swan is in chains illustrates that [[Swan upping|the swan is bound to the monarch]], an ancient law that still applies to wild swans in the UK today. The arms were first borne at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] by the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]].\n\nAbove the swan is a gold band, in the centre of which is [[Whiteleaf Cross]], representing the many ancient landmarks of the county. The shield is surmounted by a [[beech]] tree, representing the [[Chiltern Forest]] that once covered almost half the county. Either side of the shield are a [[Deer|buck]], for Buckingham, and a swan, the county symbol.\n\nThe motto of the shield is ''Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum''.

Buckinghamshire County Council is one of the few remaining [[Local Education Authority|LEA]]s still using the [[Tripartite system of education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland|tripartite system]], albeit with some revisions such as the abolition of [[secondary technical school]]s. It has a completely selective education system: pupils transfer either to a [[grammar school]] or to a [[secondary modern school]] or [[Free school (England)|free school]] depending on how they perform in the [[Eleven-Plus exam]] and on their preferences. Pupils who do not take the test can only be allocated places at secondary modern schools or free school. There are 9 independent schools and 34 maintained (state) secondary schools, not including [[sixth form college]]s, in the county council area. There is also the [[Buckinghamshire University Technical College]] which offers secondary education from age 14. The unitary authority of Milton Keynes operates a [[comprehensive education]] system: there are 8 maintained (state) secondary schools in the borough council area.\n\nBuckinghamshire and Milton Keynes are also home to the [[University of Buckingham]], [[Buckinghamshire New University]], the [[National Film and Television School]], the [[Open University]] and the [[University Campus Milton Keynes]].\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:John Milton's cottage.jpg|thumb|John Milton's cottage, Chalfont]]\n[[File:House from rear (9058754955).jpg|thumb|[[Cliveden]]]]\n[[File:Buckingham Church - geograph.org.uk - 715502.jpg|thumb|Buckingham church seen from across the [[River Great Ouse|Ouse]]]]\nBuckinghamshire is the birthplace and/or final resting place of several notable individuals.

It is the administrative headquarters of the [[Tirunelveli District]]. It is the sixth-largest municipal corporation in the state after [[Chennai]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Madurai]], [[Trichy]] and [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]]. Tirunelveli is located {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the state capital [[Chennai]], {{convert|58|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from [[Thoothukudi]] and {{convert|73|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Kanyakumari]]. The downtown is located on the west bank of the [[Thamirabarani River]]; its twin [[Palayankottai|Palayamkottai]] is on the east bank. [[Palayamkottai]] is called as the Oxford of the south India. It is a hub of many schools, colleges and many important government offices. \n\nTirunelveli is an ancient city, and is more than 2000 years old. Tirunelveli is believed to be an ancient settlement of great importance. It has been ruled at different times by the [[Early Pandyan Kingdom|Early Pandyas]], the [[Medieval Cholas|Medieval]] and [[Later Cholas]], the later [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]], the [[Madurai Sultanate|Ma'bar]] , the [[Vijayanagar Empire]], the [[Madurai Nayaks]], [[Chanda Sahib]], the [[Carnatic region|Karnatic]] [[Nawab of the Carnatic|kingdom]] and the [[British Raj|British]]. The [[Polygar War]], involving [[Palaiyakkarar]]s led by [[Veerapandiya Kattabomman]] and forces of the British East India Company, was waged on the city's outskirts from 1797 to 1801. \n\nTirunelveli is administered by a [[Tirunelveli Municipal Corporation|Municipal Corporation]], established on 1 June 1994 by the [[Municipal Corporations Act|Municipal Corporation Act]]. The city covers an area of {{convert|189.9|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and had a population of 473,637 in 2011 excluding some Municipal corporation region then.The total population after expansion is 968,984. Tirunelveli is well-connected by road and rail with the rest of Tamil Nadu and India. The nearest domestic airport is [[Tuticorin Airport|Thoothukudi Airport]]. The Nearest International Airports are [[Madurai International Airport]] and [[Trivandrum International Airport|Thiruvananthapuram International Airport]]. The nearest Seaport is [[Tuticorin Port Trust|Thoothukudi Port]].\n\nIndustries in Tirunelveli include administrative services, agricultural trading, tourism, banking, agricultural machinery, information technology and educational services. The city is an educational hub of southern India, with institutions such as Anna University Regional Campus - Tirunelveli, [[Tirunelveli Medical College]], The Tirunelveli Veterinary College and Research Institution, [[Government Law College, Tirunelveli|Tirunelveli Law College]],  the [[ Government College of Engineering, Tirunelveli|Government College of Engineering]], [[Manonmaniam Sundaranar University]] and much more. \n\nTirunelveli has a number of historical monuments, the [[Nellaiappar Temple|Swami Nellaiappar Temple]] being the most prominent.\n\n==Etymology==\nTirunelveli is one of the many temple towns in the state which is named after the grooves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The region is believed to have been covered with Venu forest and hence called Venuvanam.{{sf|Reddy| 2013| p= 10}} Tirunelveli was known in [[Sambandar]]'s seventh-century Saiva canonical work ''[[Tevaram]]'' as Thirunelveli.{{sfn|Moondram Thirumurai}} Swami Nellaiappar temple inscriptions say that [[Shiva]] (as Vrihivritesvara) descended in the form of a hedge and roof to save the paddy crop of a devotee. In Hindu legend, the place was known as Venuvana (\"forest of bamboo\") due to the presence of bamboo in the temple under which the deity is believed to have appeared.{{sfn|Ayyar| 1991| pp=498\u2013499}} The early Pandyas named the city Thenpandya Nadu or Thenpandya Seemai, the Cholas Mudikonda Cholamandalam and the Nayaks Tirunelveli Seemai; it was known as Tinnelvelly by the British, and Tirunelveli after independence.{{sfn|Kanmony|2010|p=42}}{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|p=88}} The word ''Tirunelveli'' is derived from three Tamil words: ''thiru'', ''nel'' and ''veli'', meaning \"sacred paddy hedge\".{{sfn|P.|2008|p=67}}{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|p=88}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nellaiappar temple pillar.JPG|250x250px|left|thumb|Sculpted pillar in Nellaiappar Temple (the largest temple in Tirunelveli)|alt=granite column with sculpture showing a person with a bow]]\nThe history of Tirunelveli was researched by [[Robert Caldwell]] (1814\u201391), a Christian [[missionary]] who visited the area.{{sfn|Caldwell|1989}}{{sfn|Daughrity|2005}}{{sfn|Mission Studies|2007}} Tirunelveli was under the rule of [[Pandian Empire|Pandya]] kings as their secondary capital; [[Madurai]] was the empire's primary capital.{{sfn| Stein|Johnson|Bayly|Richards|1989|p=79}} The Pandya dynasty in the region dates to several centuries before the [[Christian era]] from inscriptions by [[Asoka the great|Ashoka]] (304\u2013232 BCE) and mention in the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', the ''[[Brihat-Samhita]]'' and the writings of [[Megasthenes]] (350\u2013290 CE). The province came under the rule of [[Cholas]] under [[Rajendra Chola I]] in 1064 CE; however, it is unclear whether he conquered the region or obtained it voluntarily.{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|p=23-30}} Tirunelveli remained under control of the Cholas until the early 13th century, when the second Pandyan empire was established with Madurai as its capital.{{sfn|Salma Ahmed|2011|p=26}}\n\nThe Nellaiappar temple was the royal shrine of the later Pandyas during the 13th and 14th centuries, and the city benefited from dams constructed with royal patronage during the period. After the death of [[Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I|Kulasekara Pandian]] (1268\u20131308), the region was occupied by Vijayangara rulers and Marava chieftains (palayakarars, or ''poligars'') during the 16th century. The Maravars occupied the western foothills and the Telugas, and the Kannadigas settled in the black-soil-rich eastern portion. Tirunelveli was the subsidiary capital of the [[Madurai Nayaks]];{{sfn| Stein|Johnson|Bayly|Richards|1989|p=79}} under [[Viswanatha Nayak]] (1529\u201364), the city was rebuilt about 1560. Inscriptions from the Nellaiappar temple indicate generous contributions to the temple.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|pp=379\u2013380}} Nayak rule ended in 1736. \n\nThe region was captured by the subjects of the Mughal Empire such as [[Chanda Sahib]] (1740\u20131754) who declared himself \"Nawab of Tinnevelly\" as well as the [[Nawab of the Carnatic]].\nIn 1743 Nizam-ul-mulk, lieutenant of the [[Deccan Plateau]], displaced most of the Marathas from the region and Tirunelveli came under the rule of the [[Nawabs of Arcot]]. The original power lay in the hands of the ''polygars'', who were originally military chiefs of the Nayaks. The city was the chief commercial town during the Nawab and [[Nayak (ethnic group)|Nayak]] era. The city was known as Nellai Cheemai, with ''Cheemai'' meaning \"a developed foreign town\".{{sfn|''The Hindu''|19 May 2007}}  The ''polygars'' built forts in the hills, had 30,000 troops and waged war among themselves. In 1755, the British government sent a mission under Major Heron and Mahfuz Khan which restored some order and bestowed the city to Mahfuz Khan. The ''poligars'' waged war against Mahfuz Khan seven miles from Tirunelveli, but were defeated. The failure of Mahfuz Khan led the East India Company to send Muhammed Yusuf for help. Khan became ruler, rebelled in 1763 and was hanged in 1764. In 1758, British troops under Colonel Fullarton reduced the ''polygar'' stronghold under [[Veerapandiya Kattabomman]]. In 1797, the first Polygar war broke out between the British (under Major Bannerman) and the ''polygars'' (headed by Kattabomman). Some ''polygars'' (such as the head of Ettaiyapuram) aided the British; Kattabomman was defeated and hanged in his home province of Panchalaguruchi. Two years later, another rebellion became known as the Second Polygar War. Panchalankuruchi fell to the British, after stiff resistance. The [[Carnatic region]] came under British rule following a treaty with the Nawab of Carnatic.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|pp=375\u2013379}}{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|p=93-96}}{{sfn|W.|2002|p=214-221}}\n\nAfter acquiring Tirunelveli from the Nawab of Arcot in 1801, the British anglicised its name to \"Tinnevelly\" and made it the headquarters of Tinnelvelli District. The administrative and military headquarters was located in Palayamkottai (anglicised as \"Palankottah\"), from which attacks against the ''polygars'' were launched. After independence both cities reverted to their original names, and Tirunelveli remained the capital of Tirunelveli district. A separate [[Thoothukudi district]] was split off in 1986.{{sfn|Kanmony|2010|p=42}}\nIn 2019 , [[Tenkasi]] was split from [[Tirunelveli District]] forming [[Tenkasi district|Tenkasi District]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\nTirunelveli has the relatively rare dry-summer [[Tropical climate|Tropical savannah climate]] (K\u00f6ppen: ''As''), scattered irregularly across the world but is relatively common in areas near the Laccadive Sea.\n\n[[File:Agasthiyamalai range and Tirunelveli rainshadow.jpg|thumb|The [[Agasthiyamalai]] hills cut off Tirunelveli from the [[southwest monsoon]], creating a [[rainshadow]] region.|alt=image of hills with dark skyline]]\nTirunelveli is located at {{Coord|8|43|41.82|N|77|41|43.94|E|region:IN|display=inline}},{{sfn|Falling Rain Genomics}} and its average elevation is {{convert|47|m|ft}}. It is located at the southernmost tip of the Deccan plateau. The Tamirabarani River divides the city into the Tirunelveli quarter and the Palayamkottai area. The river (with its tributaries, such as the Chittar) is the major source of irrigation, and is fed by the northeast and southwest monsoons.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|p=215}} The major lakes in the city are Nainar Lake and Udayarpetti Lake. The area around the Tamirabarani River and the Chittar has five streams: Kodagan, Palayan, Tirunelveli, Marudur East and Marudur West, and the Chittar feeds fifteen other channels. The soil is friable, red and sandy.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|pp=379\u2013380}}\n \nThe climate of Tirunelveli is generally hot and humid. The average temperature during summer (March to June) ranges from {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|41|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, and {{convert|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} during the rest of the year. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|680|mm|in}}. Maximum precipitation occurs during the [[northeast monsoon]] (October\u2013December). Since the economy of the district is primarily based on agriculture, flooding of the Tamarabarani River or a fluctuation in monsoon rain has an immediate impact on the local economy. The primary crops grown in the region are paddy and cotton.

Corporation Building named after V O Chidambaranar]]'''Tirunelveli''' {{audio|Tirunelveli-pronunciation.ogg|pronunciation}}, also known as '''Nellai''' and historically (during [[British Raj|British rule]]) as '''Tinnevelly''', is a major city in the [[India]]n state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is the administrative headquarters of the [[Tirunelveli District]]. It is the sixth-largest municipal corporation in the state after [[Chennai]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Madurai]], [[Trichy]] and [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]]. Tirunelveli is located {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the state capital [[Chennai]], {{convert|58|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from [[Thoothukudi]] and {{convert|73|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Kanyakumari]].

The [[Polygar War]], involving [[Palaiyakkarar]]s led by [[Veerapandiya Kattabomman]] and forces of the British East India Company, was waged on the city's outskirts from 1797 to 1801. \n\nTirunelveli is administered by a [[Tirunelveli Municipal Corporation|Municipal Corporation]], established on 1 June 1994 by the [[Municipal Corporations Act|Municipal Corporation Act]].

The region is believed to have been covered with Venu forest and hence called Venuvanam.{{sf|Reddy| 2013| p= 10}} Tirunelveli was known in [[Sambandar]]'s seventh-century Saiva canonical work ''[[Tevaram]]'' as Thirunelveli.{{sfn|Moondram Thirumurai}} Swami Nellaiappar temple inscriptions say that [[Shiva]] (as Vrihivritesvara) descended in the form of a hedge and roof to save the paddy crop of a devotee. In Hindu legend, the place was known as Venuvana (\"forest of bamboo\") due to the presence of bamboo in the temple under which the deity is believed to have appeared.{{sfn|Ayyar| 1991| pp=498\u2013499}} The early Pandyas named the city Thenpandya Nadu or Thenpandya Seemai, the Cholas Mudikonda Cholamandalam and the Nayaks Tirunelveli Seemai; it was known as Tinnelvelly by the British, and Tirunelveli after independence.{{sfn|Kanmony|2010|p=42}}{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|p=88}} The word ''Tirunelveli'' is derived from three Tamil words: ''thiru'', ''nel'' and ''veli'', meaning \"sacred paddy hedge\".{{sfn|P.|2008|p=67}}{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|p=88}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nellaiappar temple pillar.JPG|250x250px|left|thumb|Sculpted pillar in Nellaiappar Temple (the largest temple in Tirunelveli)|alt=granite column with sculpture showing a person with a bow]]\nThe history of Tirunelveli was researched by [[Robert Caldwell]] (1814\u201391), a Christian [[missionary]] who visited the area.{{sfn|Caldwell|1989}}{{sfn|Daughrity|2005}}{{sfn|Mission Studies|2007}} Tirunelveli was under the rule of [[Pandian Empire|Pandya]] kings as their secondary capital; [[Madurai]] was the empire's primary capital.{{sfn| Stein|Johnson|Bayly|Richards|1989|p=79}} The Pandya dynasty in the region dates to several centuries before the [[Christian era]] from inscriptions by [[Asoka the great|Ashoka]] (304\u2013232 BCE) and mention in the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', the ''[[Brihat-Samhita]]'' and the writings of [[Megasthenes]] (350\u2013290 CE). The province came under the rule of [[Cholas]] under [[Rajendra Chola I]] in 1064 CE; however, it is unclear whether he conquered the region or obtained it voluntarily.{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|p=23-30}} Tirunelveli remained under control of the Cholas until the early 13th century, when the second Pandyan empire was established with Madurai as its capital.{{sfn|Salma Ahmed|2011|p=26}}\n\nThe Nellaiappar temple was the royal shrine of the later Pandyas during the 13th and 14th centuries, and the city benefited from dams constructed with royal patronage during the period. After the death of [[Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I|Kulasekara Pandian]] (1268\u20131308), the region was occupied by Vijayangara rulers and Marava chieftains (palayakarars, or ''poligars'') during the 16th century. The Maravars occupied the western foothills and the Telugas, and the Kannadigas settled in the black-soil-rich eastern portion. Tirunelveli was the subsidiary capital of the [[Madurai Nayaks]];{{sfn| Stein|Johnson|Bayly|Richards|1989|p=79}} under [[Viswanatha Nayak]] (1529\u201364), the city was rebuilt about 1560. Inscriptions from the Nellaiappar temple indicate generous contributions to the temple.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|pp=379\u2013380}} Nayak rule ended in 1736. \n\nThe region was captured by the subjects of the Mughal Empire such as [[Chanda Sahib]] (1740\u20131754) who declared himself \"Nawab of Tinnevelly\" as well as the [[Nawab of the Carnatic]].\nIn 1743 Nizam-ul-mulk, lieutenant of the [[Deccan Plateau]], displaced most of the Marathas from the region and Tirunelveli came under the rule of the [[Nawabs of Arcot]]. The original power lay in the hands of the ''polygars'', who were originally military chiefs of the Nayaks. The city was the chief commercial town during the Nawab and [[Nayak (ethnic group)|Nayak]] era. The city was known as Nellai Cheemai, with ''Cheemai'' meaning \"a developed foreign town\".{{sfn|''The Hindu''|19 May 2007}}  The ''polygars'' built forts in the hills, had 30,000 troops and waged war among themselves. In 1755, the British government sent a mission under Major Heron and Mahfuz Khan which restored some order and bestowed the city to Mahfuz Khan. The ''poligars'' waged war against Mahfuz Khan seven miles from Tirunelveli, but were defeated. The failure of Mahfuz Khan led the East India Company to send Muhammed Yusuf for help. Khan became ruler, rebelled in 1763 and was hanged in 1764. In 1758, British troops under Colonel Fullarton reduced the ''polygar'' stronghold under [[Veerapandiya Kattabomman]]. In 1797, the first Polygar war broke out between the British (under Major Bannerman) and the ''polygars'' (headed by Kattabomman). Some ''polygars'' (such as the head of Ettaiyapuram) aided the British; Kattabomman was defeated and hanged in his home province of Panchalaguruchi. Two years later, another rebellion became known as the Second Polygar War. Panchalankuruchi fell to the British, after stiff resistance. The [[Carnatic region]] came under British rule following a treaty with the Nawab of Carnatic.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|pp=375\u2013379}}{{sfn|Caldwell|1989|p=93-96}}{{sfn|W.|2002|p=214-221}}\n\nAfter acquiring Tirunelveli from the Nawab of Arcot in 1801, the British anglicised its name to \"Tinnevelly\" and made it the headquarters of Tinnelvelli District. The administrative and military headquarters was located in Palayamkottai (anglicised as \"Palankottah\"), from which attacks against the ''polygars'' were launched. After independence both cities reverted to their original names, and Tirunelveli remained the capital of Tirunelveli district.

It is located at the southernmost tip of the Deccan plateau. The Tamirabarani River divides the city into the Tirunelveli quarter and the Palayamkottai area. The river (with its tributaries, such as the Chittar) is the major source of irrigation, and is fed by the northeast and southwest monsoons.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|p=215}} The major lakes in the city are Nainar Lake and Udayarpetti Lake. The area around the Tamirabarani River and the Chittar has five streams: Kodagan, Palayan, Tirunelveli, Marudur East and Marudur West, and the Chittar feeds fifteen other channels. The soil is friable, red and sandy.{{sfn|Hunter|1908|pp=379\u2013380}}\n \nThe climate of Tirunelveli is generally hot and humid.

The average annual rainfall is {{convert|680|mm|in}}. Maximum precipitation occurs during the [[northeast monsoon]] (October\u2013December). Since the economy of the district is primarily based on agriculture, flooding of the Tamarabarani River or a fluctuation in monsoon rain has an immediate impact on the local economy. The primary crops grown in the region are paddy and cotton. Pineapples were introduced during the 16th century, [[Chili pepper|chilly]] and tobacco during the late 16th and potatoes during the early 17th centuries.{{sfn| Subrahmanyam|1990|p=28}} The most common tree is the [[Borassus|palmyra palm]], a raw material in cottage industries. Other trees grown in the region are [[teak]], wild jack, ''manjakadambu'', ''venteak'', ''vengai'', ''pillaimaruthu'', ''karimaruthu'' and bamboo.

The first R142As were delivered on November 16, 1999, though they initially experienced minor issues were reported while undergoing testing. Following the completion of testing, the R142s were placed into revenue service on July 10, 2000, and by 2003, all cars were delivered. In January 2019, the MTA has proposed mid-life upgrades to the R142 fleet.\n\n==Description==\n880 of the R142s are numbered 6301\u20137180, and the remaining 150 cars are numbered 1101\u20131250.\n\nThere are two types of cars: \"A\" (cab at one end) and \"B\" (no cabs). \"A\" cars are powered with four traction motors each, with the passenger doors opposite each other. The \"B\" cars are powered by two traction motors at the number-two end, and the passenger doors are staggered (car ends are numbered on the lower body just above the truck).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?3427|title=Showing Image 3427|work=nycsubway.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?100281|title=Showing Image 100281|work=nycsubway.org}}</ref> The trains are linked up in 5-car, A-B-B-B-A sets, but also can be linked in sets of 4 cars (A-B-B-A), 6 cars (A-B-B-B-B-A), 9 cars (one 5-car set and one 4-car set), or 11 cars (one 5-car set and one 6-car set).\n\nCurrently, most R142s are maintained at the [[239th Street Yard]] and [[East 180th Street Yard]] and assigned on the {{NYCS|2}} and {{NYCS|5}}, with the remaining sets maintained at the [[Jerome Yard]] and assigned to the {{NYCS|4}}.\n\n==Features==\nThe R142s feature [[Alstom]] ONIX [[alternating current|AC]] propulsion systems, electronic braking, automatic [[climate control]], [[New Technology Train#Electronic strip maps|electronic strip maps]], and an on-board [[intercom]] system.

All passenger cars built after the R142s also use this feature.\n\nCurrent recorded announcements are by:\n* [[Jessica Ettinger]], 1010 WINS Anchor: announcements for [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line|Lexington Avenue Line]] trains ('''{{NYCS|4}}''', '''{{NYCS|5}}''', and '''{{nycs|6}}''').\n* Dianne Thompson: announcements for the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]] trains ('''[[1 (New York City Subway service)|1]]''', '''{{NYCS|2}}''', and '''{{nycs|3}}''').\n* Charlie Pellett: announcements to warn passengers of the closing doors, last stop announcements, and current transfer and connection announcements at select stations; formerly provided safety/delay announcements (2000\u20132017).\n* Velina Mitchell: current safety and delay announcements (since 2018). She also recorded the stop announcement for [[WTC Cortlandt (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|WTC Cortlandt]] and [[Franklin Avenue (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Franklin Avenue]] stations.<ref> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixfJcMlzBLU]</ref>, as well as transfer announcements at selected stations referencing the M14-SBS bus route<ref> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_EZVZA68ko]</ref>.\n\nMelissa Kleiner originally provided announcements for the '''{{NYCS|5}}''' outside of Manhattan, but the announcements have since been re-recorded by Ettinger.\n\nThe first three people listed were news anchors with [[WBBR|Bloomberg Radio]] at the time the announcements were recorded. Since then, Ettinger and Pellett have moved to 1010 [[WINS-AM]] and Sirius Satellite Radio, working with Howard Stern and his Howard 100 News team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nycsubway.org/cars/r142.html|title=www.nycsubway.org|work=www.nycsubway.org}}</ref>\n\nNewer, shorter announcements have been tested on some sets on the '''2''' and '''5''' since 2015 in an effort to reduce dwell times and subsequently reduce the likelihood of delays.<ref>http://newyork.cbslocal.com/video/3189522-shorter-subway-announcements-may-be-on-the-way/</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn April 30, 1997, the Board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved the purchase of 680 cars from Bombardier (the R142s) and 400 cars from Kawasaki (the R142As). The original purchase order was for 740 cars, but because of the intense competition between the firms, the MTA was able to purchase 340 additional cars at the same price. The entire cost of the purchase was $1.45 billion. The new subway cars were based on the results of the tests from the [[R110A (New York City Subway car)|R110A]] and [[R110B (New York City Subway car)|R110B]] test trains.

The original purchase order was for 740 cars, but because of the intense competition between the firms, the MTA was able to purchase 340 additional cars at the same price. The entire cost of the purchase was $1.45 billion. The new subway cars were based on the results of the tests from the [[R110A (New York City Subway car)|R110A]] and [[R110B (New York City Subway car)|R110B]] test trains.

The most commonly viewed wild mammal is the [[vervet monkey]], which has been known to grab food under the nose of unsuspecting guests at the Fish River Sun Resort.\nThere are over 135 species of marine and terrestrial birds found along the river including the colourful [[Knysna lourie]], [[giant kingfisher]] and the majestic [[African fish eagle|fish eagle]].\nThere are 26 species of snakes, of which only five are venomous.\n\n==History==\nDuring the 19th century, the river formed the border of the [[Cape Colony]]<ref name=\"teal-1894-87\">{{cite book|last=Theal|first=George McCall|title=South Africa (the Cape Colony, Natal, Orange Free State, South African Republic, and all other territories south of the Zambesi)|publisher=Unwin|location=London|year=1894|pages=87\u201388|url=https://archive.org/stream/southafricatheca00theauoft#page/87/mode/1up|accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref> and was hotly contested during the [[Xhosa Wars]] of 1779 to 1878 between the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] nation on the one side and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] farmers and the [[1820 Settlers]] from [[England]] on the other,<ref name=\"bantu_tribes-333\">{{cite book|authors=Doke,Clement M.; Dart,Raymond A.; Goodwin,A.J.H.; Marais,J.S.; Eiselen,W.M.|title=The Bantu Speaking Tribes Of South Africa|publisher=Routledge And Kegan Paul Limited|year=1962|pages=333\u2013334|url=https://archive.org/stream/bantuspeakingtri032916mbp#page/n380/mode/1up}}</ref> and in 1835, the [[Fingo (Mfengu)|Fingo]] people were permitted to settle on the river's banks. During [[apartheid]], the lower reaches formed the western boundary of the nominally independent [[Ciskei]] homeland.\nBetween 1846 and 1847, the Fish River mouth area became a hive of activity during the War of the Axe, one of several frontier wars at the time between the Xhosa nation and the British colonists. A ferry was constructed at the Fish River to link the Cape Colony (western side of the river) with Waterloo Bay (the small bay near the mouth of Old Woman's River which now flows through the Fish River Sun resort). Waterloo Bay, named after the first ship which unloaded cargo in the bay, served as a landing place for soldiers and supplies in the war. Several ships wrecked along the Fish River coast during these years.<ref name=\"military\">[http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol085vw.html]</ref>\nThe following are notable historical sites at the Fish River mouth, mostly encompassed within the Fish River Sun Resort premises which the establishment has endeavoured to protect:\n\n=== Maitland Military Camp ===\nThe main military camp was on the eastern bank of the Old Woman's River, called Cape Maitland, in honour of Sir Peregrine Maitland, Governor of the Cape Colony. The name was later changed to Fort Albert in honour of Queen Victoria's husband. The camp consisted of huts and tents surrounded by an earthwork and was abandoned at the end of the war. The camp site was \u2018rediscovered\u2019 when large quantities of artifacts were unearthed during the construction of the Fish River Sun golf course.<ref name=\"military\" />\n\n=== Broxholm Cottage ===\nA certain Sergeant C. Broxholm is rumoured to have built the only structure that survived the war, located on the eastern side of the river. Built in 1846, he sold the building a year later to Mr. J Kidd of the Wesleyan Missionary Society who hoped to undertake missionary work at Waterloo Bay.\n\n=== Soldier\u2019s Cemetery ===\nSome of the soldiers that died during the occupation of Waterloo Bay were buried in a small cemetery near the eastern bank of the Old Woman's River. The graves were not marked but it is believed that members of the 6th and 45th regiments and Cape Levy were buried there. A clearing among the dune scrub marks the site on the Fish River Sun Resort property.<ref name=\"military\" />\n\n=== Civilian camp ===\nA large civilian camp with the accompanying trading stores and inns which followed the military activities was apparently situated on the western side of the Old Woman's River. All historical remains are currently covered by the golf playing surface.<ref name=\"military\" />\n\n=== Shipwrecks ===\nThe remains of the vessels ''Catherine'' and ''Justina'' can still be seen by divers. The ships were wrecked in the 1840s and are located within 1&nbsp;km of the mouth of the Fish River.<ref name=\"military\" />\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Recreation===\n*Despite its name, fishing that takes place along its (mainly lower) reaches is primarily recreational.\n*Annually, the [[Fish River Canoe Marathon]], a popular canoeing event takes place over two days from Grassridge Dam to [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]].\n*Diving in the area of the River's mouth is quite an experience, thanks to the numerous shipwrecks which can be found: the SS ''Cariboo'', the SS ''Kilbrennan'' and the ''Waterloo'', to name a few.\n\n===Fish River Sun Hotel and Country Club Resort===\nThe Fish River Sun Hotel and Country Club Resort is a Sun International resort destination at the mouth of the Fish River on the south-eastern coastline of South Africa. \nThe Fish River Sun opened its doors in March 1989 as a hotel and casino. The 184,000 hectare property on the eastern banks of the Fish River fell within the then Ciskei region, a former Bantustan homeland during the apartheid administration. The hotel, casino and golf course continued to be a popular and successful tourism attraction in the region, mostly due to the casino, as licenses are awarded sparingly in South Africa. \nThe resort establishment suffered a huge knock when its casino license was not extended after its ten-year period, ending in 1999. The accommodation format was converted from a hotel to a vacation club functioning on a timeshare basis. The Eastern Cape Gambling Board granted another casino license in nearby Port Elizabeth, also operated by Sun International, in the Boardwalk Casino and Entertainment World Complex. As part of the license bid, the Boardwalk agreed to supplement the costs of maintaining the Fish River Sun as part of its obligation to rural development in the province.\nActivities include swimming, guided nature walks, golf, dune boarding, canoeing, fishing, mini-golf, and spa treatments.\n\nThere is a golf course designed by [[Gary Player]] and rated in the top 30 golf courses in South Africa.<ref name=\"golf\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.golfdirect.co.za/top100sacourses.php |title=Top 100 Golf Courses in South Africa |access-date=September 20, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529055238/http://www.golfdirect.co.za/top100sacourses.php |archive-date=May 29, 2010 |url-status=dead }}></ref> Old Woman's River runs through the course. The course has hosted some large events including the [[Africa Open]] in 2008.\n\n==Great Fish Point==\nGreat Fish Point is a [[lighthouse]] situated near the mouth of the Great Fish River, about 25&nbsp;km from the coastal holiday resort of [[Port Alfred]].\n\nBefore the lighthouse was built in 1898, two ship's lamps exhibiting fixed green lights were erected on a flagstaff at Port Alfred, but these lights later proved to be inadequate. The clockwork system which used to drive the lens is still intact and on display.\n\nAlthough the lighthouse itself is only 9 metres high, it is situated 76 metres above sea level.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of rivers of South Africa]]\n* [[List of estuaries of South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dwaf.gov.za/documents/other/wma/15/fishsundaysispfeb05ap.pdf Fish to Sundays: Internal Strategic Perspective]\n* [https://archives-manuscripts.dartmouth.edu/repositories/2/resources/1196 James MacKinlay diary] at Dartmouth College Library\n\n{{Rivers of South Africa}}\n\n[[Category:Internal borders of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Great Fish River| ]]\n[[Category:Rivers of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Rivers of the Eastern Cape]]\n[[Category:Tributaries of the Orange River]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Great Fish|the bay|Great Fish Bay|the river in Canada|Back River (Nunavut)|other rivers|Fish River (disambiguation)}}\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2010}}\n{{Infobox river\n| name               = Great Fish River\n| name_native        = \n| name_native_lang   = \n| name_other         = \n| name_etymology     = \n<!---------------------- IMAGE & MAP -->\n| image              = Visrivier.jpg\n| image_size         = \n| image_caption      = The Great Fish River in the Eastern Cape from Dubbeldrift Nature Reserve.\n| map                = \n| map_size           = \n| map_caption        = \n| pushpin_map        = South Africa\n| pushpin_map_size   = \n| pushpin_map_caption= Location of the Great Fish River mouth\n<!---------------------- LOCATION -->\n| subdivision_type1  = Country\n| subdivision_name1  = [[South Africa]]\n| subdivision_type2  = \n| subdivision_name2  = \n| subdivision_type3  = [[Provinces of South Africa|Province]]\n| subdivision_name3  = [[Eastern Cape]]\n| subdivision_type4  = \n| subdivision_name4  = \n| subdivision_type5  = \n| subdivision_name5  = \n<!---------------------- PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS -->\n| length             = {{convert|730|km|mi|abbr=on}} \n| width_min          = \n| width_avg          = \n| width_max          = \n| depth_min          = \n| depth_avg          = \n| depth_max          = \n| discharge1_location= \n| discharge1_min     = \n| discharge1_avg     = \n| discharge1_max     = \n<!---------------------- BASIN FEATURES -->\n| source1            = \n| source1_location   = \n| source1_coordinates= \n| source1_elevation  = \n| mouth              = [[Indian Ocean]]\n| mouth_location     = Near [[Seafield, Eastern Cape|Seafield]]\n| mouth_coordinates  = {{coord|33|29|34|S|27|07|52|E|display=inline,title}}\n| mouth_elevation    = {{convert|0|m|abbr=on}}\n| progression        = \n| river_system       = \n| basin_size         = {{convert|30366|km2|abbr=on}}\n| tributaries_left   = \n| tributaries_right  = \n| custom_label       = \n| custom_data        = \n| extra              = \n}}\n[[File:Close to great fish river790.JPG|thumb|Landscape near the middle course of the Great Fish River]]\nThe '''Great Fish River''' (called ''great'' to distinguish it from the [[Namibia]]n [[Fish River, Nambia|Fish River]]) ({{lang-af|Groot-Visrivier}})<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://myfundi.co.za/a/Riviere_van_Suid-Afrika |title=Riviere van Suid-Afrika |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430151102/http://myfundi.co.za/a/Riviere_van_Suid-Afrika |archive-date=2012-04-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> is a river running {{convert|644|km|mi}} through the [[South Africa]]n province of the [[Eastern Cape]].

The most commonly viewed wild mammal is the [[vervet monkey]], which has been known to grab food under the nose of unsuspecting guests at the Fish River Sun Resort.\nThere are over 135 species of marine and terrestrial birds found along the river including the colourful [[Knysna lourie]], [[giant kingfisher]] and the majestic [[African fish eagle|fish eagle]].\nThere are 26 species of snakes, of which only five are venomous.\n\n==History==\nDuring the 19th century, the river formed the border of the [[Cape Colony]]<ref name=\"teal-1894-87\">{{cite book|last=Theal|first=George McCall|title=South Africa (the Cape Colony, Natal, Orange Free State, South African Republic, and all other territories south of the Zambesi)|publisher=Unwin|location=London|year=1894|pages=87\u201388|url=https://archive.org/stream/southafricatheca00theauoft#page/87/mode/1up|accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref> and was hotly contested during the [[Xhosa Wars]] of 1779 to 1878 between the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] nation on the one side and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] farmers and the [[1820 Settlers]] from [[England]] on the other,<ref name=\"bantu_tribes-333\">{{cite book|authors=Doke,Clement M.; Dart,Raymond A.; Goodwin,A.J.H.; Marais,J.S.; Eiselen,W.M.|title=The Bantu Speaking Tribes Of South Africa|publisher=Routledge And Kegan Paul Limited|year=1962|pages=333\u2013334|url=https://archive.org/stream/bantuspeakingtri032916mbp#page/n380/mode/1up}}</ref> and in 1835, the [[Fingo (Mfengu)|Fingo]] people were permitted to settle on the river's banks. During [[apartheid]], the lower reaches formed the western boundary of the nominally independent [[Ciskei]] homeland.\nBetween 1846 and 1847, the Fish River mouth area became a hive of activity during the War of the Axe, one of several frontier wars at the time between the Xhosa nation and the British colonists. A ferry was constructed at the Fish River to link the Cape Colony (western side of the river) with Waterloo Bay (the small bay near the mouth of Old Woman's River which now flows through the Fish River Sun resort). Waterloo Bay, named after the first ship which unloaded cargo in the bay, served as a landing place for soldiers and supplies in the war. Several ships wrecked along the Fish River coast during these years.<ref name=\"military\">[http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol085vw.html]</ref>\nThe following are notable historical sites at the Fish River mouth, mostly encompassed within the Fish River Sun Resort premises which the establishment has endeavoured to protect:\n\n=== Maitland Military Camp ===\nThe main military camp was on the eastern bank of the Old Woman's River, called Cape Maitland, in honour of Sir Peregrine Maitland, Governor of the Cape Colony. The name was later changed to Fort Albert in honour of Queen Victoria's husband. The camp consisted of huts and tents surrounded by an earthwork and was abandoned at the end of the war. The camp site was \u2018rediscovered\u2019 when large quantities of artifacts were unearthed during the construction of the Fish River Sun golf course.<ref name=\"military\" />\n\n=== Broxholm Cottage ===\nA certain Sergeant C. Broxholm is rumoured to have built the only structure that survived the war, located on the eastern side of the river. Built in 1846, he sold the building a year later to Mr. J Kidd of the Wesleyan Missionary Society who hoped to undertake missionary work at Waterloo Bay.\n\n=== Soldier\u2019s Cemetery ===\nSome of the soldiers that died during the occupation of Waterloo Bay were buried in a small cemetery near the eastern bank of the Old Woman's River. The graves were not marked but it is believed that members of the 6th and 45th regiments and Cape Levy were buried there. A clearing among the dune scrub marks the site on the Fish River Sun Resort property.<ref name=\"military\" />\n\n=== Civilian camp ===\nA large civilian camp with the accompanying trading stores and inns which followed the military activities was apparently situated on the western side of the Old Woman's River. All historical remains are currently covered by the golf playing surface.<ref name=\"military\" />\n\n=== Shipwrecks ===\nThe remains of the vessels ''Catherine'' and ''Justina'' can still be seen by divers. The ships were wrecked in the 1840s and are located within 1&nbsp;km of the mouth of the Fish River.<ref name=\"military\" />\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Recreation===\n*Despite its name, fishing that takes place along its (mainly lower) reaches is primarily recreational.\n*Annually, the [[Fish River Canoe Marathon]], a popular canoeing event takes place over two days from Grassridge Dam to [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]].\n*Diving in the area of the River's mouth is quite an experience, thanks to the numerous shipwrecks which can be found: the SS ''Cariboo'', the SS ''Kilbrennan'' and the ''Waterloo'', to name a few.\n\n===Fish River Sun Hotel and Country Club Resort===\nThe Fish River Sun Hotel and Country Club Resort is a Sun International resort destination at the mouth of the Fish River on the south-eastern coastline of South Africa. \nThe Fish River Sun opened its doors in March 1989 as a hotel and casino. The 184,000 hectare property on the eastern banks of the Fish River fell within the then Ciskei region, a former Bantustan homeland during the apartheid administration. The hotel, casino and golf course continued to be a popular and successful tourism attraction in the region, mostly due to the casino, as licenses are awarded sparingly in South Africa. \nThe resort establishment suffered a huge knock when its casino license was not extended after its ten-year period, ending in 1999. The accommodation format was converted from a hotel to a vacation club functioning on a timeshare basis. The Eastern Cape Gambling Board granted another casino license in nearby Port Elizabeth, also operated by Sun International, in the Boardwalk Casino and Entertainment World Complex. As part of the license bid, the Boardwalk agreed to supplement the costs of maintaining the Fish River Sun as part of its obligation to rural development in the province.\nActivities include swimming, guided nature walks, golf, dune boarding, canoeing, fishing, mini-golf, and spa treatments.\n\nThere is a golf course designed by [[Gary Player]] and rated in the top 30 golf courses in South Africa.<ref name=\"golf\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.golfdirect.co.za/top100sacourses.php |title=Top 100 Golf Courses in South Africa |access-date=September 20, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529055238/http://www.golfdirect.co.za/top100sacourses.php |archive-date=May 29, 2010 |url-status=dead }}></ref> Old Woman's River runs through the course. The course has hosted some large events including the [[Africa Open]] in 2008.\n\n==Great Fish Point==\nGreat Fish Point is a [[lighthouse]] situated near the mouth of the Great Fish River, about 25&nbsp;km from the coastal holiday resort of [[Port Alfred]].\n\nBefore the lighthouse was built in 1898, two ship's lamps exhibiting fixed green lights were erected on a flagstaff at Port Alfred, but these lights later proved to be inadequate. The clockwork system which used to drive the lens is still intact and on display.\n\nAlthough the lighthouse itself is only 9 metres high, it is situated 76 metres above sea level.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of rivers of South Africa]]\n* [[List of estuaries of South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dwaf.gov.za/documents/other/wma/15/fishsundaysispfeb05ap.pdf Fish to Sundays: Internal Strategic Perspective]\n\n{{Rivers of South Africa}}\n\n[[Category:Internal borders of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Great Fish River| ]]\n[[Category:Rivers of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Rivers of the Eastern Cape]]\n[[Category:Tributaries of the Orange River]]\n", "name_user": "Igrallert", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:added link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fish_River"}
