Human [[hunting]] is often cited as one cause. Other theories for the cause of the extinctions are climate change associated with the receding [[Ice age]] and the hyperdisease hypothesis (q.v. [[Quaternary extinction event]]).<ref name=grayson/> One of the more widely accepted theories states that, although the woolly rhinoceros was specialized for cold weather, it was capable of surviving in warmer climates. This suggests that climate change was not the only factor contributing to the rhinoceros's extinction. Other cold-adapted species, such as [[reindeer]], [[muskox]] and [[wisent]], survived this period of climatic change and many others like it, supporting the 'overkill' hypothesis for the woolly rhino.\n\n[[Radiocarbon dating]] indicates that populations survived as recently as [[8th millennium BC|8,000 BC]] in western Siberia.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Orlova | first=L.

The extinction does not coincide with the end of the last ice age, but does coincide with a minor yet severe climatic reversal that lasted for about 1,000&ndash;1,250 years, the [[Younger Dryas]] (GS1\u2014Greenland Stadial 1), characterized by glacial readvances and severe cooling globally, a brief interlude in the continuing warming subsequent to the termination of the last major ice age (GS2), thought to have been due to a shutdown of the [[thermohaline circulation]] in the ocean due to huge influxes of cold fresh water from the preceding sustained glacial melting during the warmer Interstadial (GI1\u2014Greenland Interstadial 1: ca.&nbsp;16,000\u201311,450 <sup>14</sup>C years B.P.).\n\n==Fossil specimens==\n\n===Frozen specimens===\n[[File:Frozen Coelodonta.jpg|thumb|left|Mummified remains discovered in 1771]] \nMany rhinoceros remains have been found preserved in the [[permafrost]] region.

Several languages are spoken in the city in addition to Spanish, contributing to its culture and the dialect spoken in the city and in some other parts of the country.

During the siege of Cagliari, the Catalans built a [[Shrine of Our Lady of Bonaria|sanctuary]] to the [[Virgin Mary]] on top of the hill. In 1335, King [[Alfonso IV of Aragon|Alfonso the Gentle]] donated the church to the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarians]], who built an [[abbey]] that stands to this day. In the years after that, a story circulated, claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously helped to calm a storm in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The statue was placed in the abbey. Spanish sailors, especially [[Andalusia]]ns, venerated this image and frequently invoked the \"Fair Winds\" to aid them in their [[navigation]] and prevent [[shipwreck]]s.

The settlement founded by Mendoza was located in what is today the [[San Telmo]] district of Buenos Aires, south of the city centre.\n\nMore attacks by the indigenous people forced the settlers away, and in 1542 the site was abandoned.<ref>[http://www.laeducacion.com/vinculos/materias/historia/not020107.htm Abor\u00edgenes de la Argentina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605092500/http://www.laeducacion.com/vinculos/materias/historia/not020107.htm |date=5 June 2014 }}.

He dubbed the settlement \"Sant\u00edsima Trinidad\" and its port became \"Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda de los Buenos Aires.\"<ref name=\"provincia\"/>\n\nFrom its earliest days, Buenos Aires depended primarily on trade. During most of the 17th century, Spanish ships were menaced by pirates, so they developed a complex system where ships with military protection were dispatched to Central America in a convoy from Seville the only port allowed to trade with the colonies, to [[Lima|Lima, Peru]] and from it to the inner cities of the viceroyalty. Because of this, products took a very long time to arrive in Buenos Aires, and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive. This scheme frustrated the traders of Buenos Aires, and a thriving informal yet accepted by the authorities contraband industry developed inside the colonies and with the Portuguese. This also instilled a deep resentment among ''[[porte\u00f1o]]s'' towards the Spanish authorities.<ref name=\"Short history\"/>\n\nSensing these feelings, [[Charles III of Spain]] progressively eased the trade restrictions and finally declared Buenos Aires an open port in the late 18th century. The capture of [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Porto Bello]] by British forces also fueled the need to foster commerce via the Atlantic route, to the detriment of Lima-based trade. One of his rulings was to split a region from the Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa and create instead the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], with Buenos Aires as the capital. However, Charles's placating actions did not have the desired effect, and the ''porte\u00f1os'', some of them versed in the ideology of the [[French Revolution]], became even more convinced of the need for independence from Spain.\n\n===War of Independence===\n{{see also|Argentine War of Independence}}\n\n[[File:General view of Buenos Ayres from the Plaza de Toros - Emeric Essex Vidal - Picturesque illustrations of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video (1820).jpg|thumb|left|[[Emeric Essex Vidal]], ''General view of Buenos Ayres from the Plaza de Toros'', 1820. In this area now lies the [[Plaza San Mart\u00edn (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Mart\u00edn]].]]\n\nDuring the [[British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], British forces attacked Buenos Aires twice. In 1806 the British successfully invaded Buenos Aires, but an army from [[Montevideo]] led by [[Santiago de Liniers]] defeated them. In the brief period of British rule, the viceroy [[Rafael Sobremonte]] managed to escape to [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and designated this city as capital. Buenos Aires became the capital again after its liberation, but Sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy. Santiago de Liniers, chosen as new viceroy, prepared the city against a possible new British attack and repelled the attempted invasion of 1807. The militarization generated in society changed the balance of power favorably for the [[criollo people|criollo]]s (in contrast to [[peninsulars]]), as well as the development of the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain. An attempt by the peninsular merchant [[Mart\u00edn de \u00c1lzaga]] to remove Liniers and replace him with a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Junta]] was defeated by the criollo armies. However, by 1810 it would be those same armies who would support a new revolutionary attempt, successfully removing the new viceroy [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]]. This is known as the [[May Revolution]], which is now celebrated as a national holiday. This event started the [[Argentine War of Independence]], and many armies left Buenos Aires to fight the diverse strongholds of royalist resistance, with varying levels of success. The government was held first by two Juntas of many members, then by two [[triumvirate]]s, and finally by a unipersonal office, the [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Supreme Director]]. Formal independence from Spain was [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared]] in 1816, at the [[Congress of Tucum\u00e1n]]. Buenos Aires managed to endure the whole [[Spanish American wars of independence]] without falling again under royalist rule.\n[[File:Pellegrini Buenos Aires Catedral.jpg|thumb|Impression of the [[Buenos Aires Cathedral]] by ''Carlos Pellegrini'', 1829.]]\n\nHistorically, Buenos Aires has been Argentina's main venue of [[liberalism|liberal]], [[free trade|free-trading]] and foreign ideas, while many of the provinces, especially those to the north-west, advocated a more [[nationalism|nationalistic]] and [[Catholic]] approach to political and social issues. Much of the internal tension in Argentina's history, starting with the centralist-federalist conflicts of the 19th century, can be traced back to these contrasting views. In the months immediately following the 25 May Revolution, Buenos Aires sent a number of military envoys to the provinces with the intention of obtaining their approval. Many of these missions ended in violent clashes, and the enterprise fuelled tensions between the capital and the provinces.\n\nIn the 19th century the city was [[blockade]]d twice by naval forces: by the [[French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata|French]] from 1838 to 1840, and later by an [[Anglo-French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Anglo-French]] expedition from 1845 to 1848. Both blockades failed to force the city into submission, and the foreign powers eventually desisted from their demands.\n\n===19th and 20th century===\n\n[[File:Pabellon-argentino plazasmartin 1900.jpg|thumb|left|''Argentine Pavilion'' in [[Plaza San Mart\u00edn (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Mart\u00edn]] (1889).]]\n\nDuring most of the 19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject. It was already the capital of [[Buenos Aires Province]], and between 1853 and 1860 it was the capital of the seceded [[State of Buenos Aires]]. The issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally settled in 1880 when the city was [[Federalization of Buenos Aires|federalized]] and became the seat of government, with its mayor appointed by the president. The [[Casa Rosada]] became the seat of the [[President of Argentina|president]].<ref name=\"provincia\"/>\n\nHealth conditions in poor areas were negative, with high rates of tuberculosis.  Public-health physicians and politicians typically blamed both the poor themselves and their ramshackle tenement houses (conventillos) for the spread of the dreaded disease.  People ignored public-health campaigns to limit the spread of contagious diseases, such as the prohibition of spitting on the streets, the strict guidelines to care for infants and young children, and quarantines that separated families from ill loved ones.<ref>Diego Armus, ''The Ailing City: Health, Tuberculosis, and Culture in Buenos Aires, 1870\u20131950'' (2011)</ref> [[File:Museo del Bicentenario - \"La Casa Rosada\" por Della Valle.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Casa Rosada]] during the [[Argentina Centennial]], 1910.]]\n\nIn addition to the wealth generated by the [[Buenos Aires Customs]] and the fertile [[pampas]], [[Rail transport in Argentina|railroad development]] in the second half of the 19th century increased the economic power of Buenos Aires as raw materials flowed into its factories. A leading destination for immigrants from Europe, particularly Italy and Spain, from 1880 to 1930 Buenos Aires became a multicultural city that ranked itself with the major European capitals. The [[Teatro Col\u00f3n|Col\u00f3n Theater]] became one of the world's top opera venues, and the city became the regional capital of [[Radio in Argentina|radio]], [[Television in Argentina|television]], [[Argentine cinema|cinema]], and [[Culture of Argentina#Theatre|theatre]]. The city's main avenues were built during those years, and the dawn of the 20th century saw the construction of South America's tallest buildings and its first [[Buenos Aires Underground|underground]] system. A second construction boom, from 1945 to 1980, reshaped downtown and much of the city. [[File:Buenos Aires - San Nicol\u00e1s - Construcci\u00f3n del Obelisco.jpg|thumb|Construction of the [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires]] on the [[9 de Julio Avenue]], 1936.]] [[File:Buenos Aires, 1986.jpg|thumb|[[9 de Julio Avenue]], 1986.]]\n\nBuenos Aires also attracted migrants from Argentina's provinces and neighboring countries. [[Shanty town]]s (''[[villa miseria|villas miseria]]'') started growing around the city's industrial areas during the 1930s, leading to pervasive social problems and social contrasts with the largely upwardly-mobile Buenos Aires population. These laborers became the political base of [[Peronism]], which emerged in Buenos Aires during the [[Loyalty Day (Argentina)|pivotal demonstration]] of 17 October 1945, at the [[Plaza de Mayo]].<ref name=\"Clar\u00edn guide\">''Gu\u00eda visual de Buenos Aires centro hist\u00f3rico'', [[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|''Clar\u00edn'']] Viajes, 2001.</ref> Industrial workers of the Greater Buenos Aires industrial belt have been Peronism's main support base ever since, and Plaza de Mayo became the site for demonstrations and many of the country's political events; on 16 June 1955, however, a splinter faction of the Navy bombed the Plaza de Mayo area, killing 364 civilians (see ''[[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]]''). This was the only time the city was attacked from the air, and the event was followed by a military uprising which deposed President Per\u00f3n, three months later (see ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'').\n\nIn the 1970s the city suffered from the fighting between left-wing revolutionary movements ([[Montoneros]], [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|ERP]] and F.A.R.) and the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] paramilitary group [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Triple A]], supported by [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n|Isabel Per\u00f3n]], who became president of Argentina in 1974 after Juan Per\u00f3n's death.\n\nThe [[March 1976 coup]], led by General [[Jorge Videla]], only escalated this conflict; the \"[[Dirty War]]\" resulted in 30,000 ''[[Forced disappearance|desaparecidos]]'' (people kidnapped and killed by the military during the years of the junta).<ref name=\"Millions\">''We are Millions: Neo-liberalism and new forms of political action in Argentina'', Marcela L\u00f3p\u00e9z Levy, Latin America Bureau, London, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1899365630}}</ref> The silent marches of their mothers ([[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]]) are a well-known image of Argentines' suffering during those times. The [[National Reorganization Process|dictatorship]]'s appointed mayor, [[Osvaldo Cacciatore]], also drew up plans for a network of freeways intended to relieve the city's acute traffic gridlock. The plan, however, called for a seemingly indiscriminate razing of residential areas and, though only three of the eight planned were put up at the time, they were mostly obtrusive raised freeways that continue to blight a number of formerly comfortable neighborhoods to this day.\n\nThe city was visited by [[Pope John Paul II]] twice, firstly in 1982 and again in 1987; on these occasions gathered some of the largest crowds in the city's history. The return of democracy in 1983 coincided with a cultural revival, and the 1990s saw an economic revival, particularly in the construction and financial sectors.\n\nOn 17 March 1992 a bomb [[1992 Israeli Embassy attack in Buenos Aires|exploded in the Israeli Embassy]], killing 29 and injuring 242. Another explosion, on 18 July 1994, [[1994 AMIA bombing|destroyed a building]] housing several [[Jew]]ish organizations, killing 85 and injuring many more, these incidents marked the beginning of [[Middle East]]ern [[terrorism]] to South America. Following a [[Pact of Olivos|1993 agreement]], the [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine Constitution]] was amended to give Buenos Aires [[autonomy]] and rescinding, among other things, the president's right to appoint the city's mayor (as had been the case since 1880). On 30 June 1996, voters in Buenos Aires chose their first elected mayor (''[[List of mayors and chiefs of government of Buenos Aires|Jefe de Gobierno]]'').\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Microcentro, Buenos Aires (40774240522).jpg|thumb|left|217x217px|Aerial view of the city skyline.]]\n\nIn 1996, following the [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution]], the city held its first mayoral elections under the new statutes, with the mayor's title formally changed to \"Head of Government\". The winner was [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], who would later become President of Argentina from 1999 to 2001.\n\nDe la R\u00faa's successor, [[An\u00edbal Ibarra]], won two popular elections, but was [[impeachment|impeached]] (and ultimately deposed on 6 March 2006) as a result of the fire at the [[Rep\u00fablica Croma\u00f1\u00f3n nightclub fire|Rep\u00fablica Cromagnon]] nightclub. [[Jorge Telerman]], who had been the acting mayor, was invested with the office. In the 2007 elections, [[Mauricio Macri]] of the [[Republican Proposal]] (PRO) party won the [[Ballotage in Argentina|second-round]] of voting over [[Daniel Filmus]] of the [[Frente para la Victoria]] (FPV) party, taking office on 9 December 2007. In 2011, the elections went to a second round with 60.96% of the vote for PRO, compared to 39.04% for FPV, thus re-electing Macri as mayor of the city with [[Mar\u00eda Eugenia Vidal]] as deputy mayor.<ref>[http://especiales.perfil.com/elecciones-capital-2011/resultadosjefe.php Elecciones 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081711/http://especiales.perfil.com/elecciones-capital-2011/resultadosjefe.php |date=4 March 2016 }} \u2013 Perfil</ref>\n\nThe 2015 elections were the first to use an [[electronic voting]] system in the city, similar to the one used in [[Salta Province]].<ref>[http://www.informatesalta.com.ar/noticia.asp?q=79437 M\u00e1s de 300 mil porte\u00f1os probaron ayer el voto electr\u00f3nico] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622152210/http://informatesalta.com.ar/noticia.asp?q=79437 |date=22 June 2017 }} \u2013 InformateSalta, 27 April 2015</ref> In these elections held on 5 July 2015, Macri stepped down as mayor and pursue his [[Argentine general election, 2015|presidential bid]] and [[Horacio Rodr\u00edguez Larreta]] took his place as the mayoral candidate for PRO.

Polimodal is usually 3 years of schooling, although some schools have a fourth year. Before entering the first year of polimodal, students choose an orientation, among these five: ''Humanities and Social Sciences'', ''Economics and Management of Organizations'','' Art and Design'', ''Health and Sport'' and ''Biology and Natural Sciences''.\n\nNevertheless, in Buenos Aires, secondary education consists of 5 years, called from 1st year to 5th year, as opposed to primary education's 1st to 7th grade. Most schools do not require students to choose their orientation, as they study the basic such as maths, biology, art, history and technology, but there are schools that do, whether they are orientated to a certain profession or they have orientations to choose from when they reach a specific year.\n\nSome high schools depend on the [[University of Buenos Aires]], and these require an admission course when students are taking the last year of high school. These high schools are [[Instituto Libre de Segunda Ense\u00f1anza|ILSE]], [[CNBA]], [[Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini]] and Escuela de Educaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica Profesional en Producci\u00f3n Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria (School of Professional Technique Education in Agricultural and Agri-food Production). The last two do have a specific orientation.\n\nIn December 2006 the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] of the [[Argentine National Congress|Argentine Congress]] passed a new National Education Law restoring the old system of primary followed by secondary education, making secondary education obligatory and a right, and increasing the length of compulsory education to 13 years.

To the north, the ''[[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana]]'' which has stood in the same location since colonial times, and the [[Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina]] building, a parcel of land originally owned by [[Juan de Garay]]. Other important colonial institutions were [[Buenos Aires Cabildo|Cabildo]], to the west, which was renovated during the construction of [[Avenida de Mayo]] and Julio A. Roca.

The mansion, built in 1881, is currently the main building of the complex.\n*[[Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens]] Is the largest of its type in the World, outside Japan. Completed in 1967, the gardens were inaugurated on occasion of a State visit to Argentina by Crown Prince [[Akihito]] and Princess [[Empress Michiko|Michiko]] of Japan.\n*[[Plaza de Mayo]] Since being the scene of [[May Revolution|25 May 1810 revolution]] that led to independence, the plaza has been a hub of political life in Argentina.\n*[[Plaza San Mart\u00edn (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Mart\u00edn]] is a park located in the [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] neighbourhood of the city.

During the siege of Cagliari, the Catalans built a [[Shrine of Our Lady of Bonaria|sanctuary]] to the [[Virgin Mary]] on top of the hill. In 1335, King [[Alfonso IV of Aragon|Alfonso the Gentle]] donated the church to the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarians]], who built an [[abbey]] that stands to this day. In the years after that, a story circulated, claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously helped to calm a storm in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The statue was placed in the abbey. Spanish sailors, especially [[Andalusia]]ns, venerated this image and frequently invoked the \"Fair Winds\" to aid them in their [[navigation]] and prevent [[shipwreck]]s.

He dubbed the settlement \"Sant\u00edsima Trinidad\" and its port became \"Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda de los Buenos Aires.\"<ref name=\"provincia\"/>\n\nFrom its earliest days, Buenos Aires depended primarily on trade. During most of the 17th century, Spanish ships were menaced by pirates, so they developed a complex system where ships with military protection were dispatched to Central America in a convoy from Seville the only port allowed to trade with the colonies, to [[Lima|Lima, Peru]] and from it to the inner cities of the viceroyalty. Because of this, products took a very long time to arrive in Buenos Aires, and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive. This scheme frustrated the traders of Buenos Aires, and a thriving informal yet accepted by the authorities contraband industry developed inside the colonies and with the Portuguese. This also instilled a deep resentment among ''[[porte\u00f1o]]s'' towards the Spanish authorities.<ref name=\"Short history\"/>\n\nSensing these feelings, [[Charles III of Spain]] progressively eased the trade restrictions and finally declared Buenos Aires an open port in the late 18th century. The capture of [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Porto Bello]] by British forces also fueled the need to foster commerce via the Atlantic route, to the detriment of Lima-based trade. One of his rulings was to split a region from the Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa and create instead the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], with Buenos Aires as the capital. However, Charles's placating actions did not have the desired effect, and the ''porte\u00f1os'', some of them versed in the ideology of the [[French Revolution]], became even more convinced of the need for independence from Spain.\n\n===War of Independence===\n{{see also|Argentine War of Independence}}\n\n[[File:General view of Buenos Ayres from the Plaza de Toros - Emeric Essex Vidal - Picturesque illustrations of Buenos Ayres and Monte Video (1820).jpg|thumb|left|[[Emeric Essex Vidal]], ''General view of Buenos Ayres from the Plaza de Toros'', 1820. In this area now lies the [[Plaza San Mart\u00edn (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Mart\u00edn]].]]\n\nDuring the [[British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], British forces attacked Buenos Aires twice. In 1806 the British successfully invaded Buenos Aires, but an army from [[Montevideo]] led by [[Santiago de Liniers]] defeated them. In the brief period of British rule, the viceroy [[Rafael Sobremonte]] managed to escape to [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and designated this city as capital. Buenos Aires became the capital again after its liberation, but Sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy. Santiago de Liniers, chosen as new viceroy, prepared the city against a possible new British attack and repelled the attempted invasion of 1807. The militarization generated in society changed the balance of power favorably for the [[criollo people|criollo]]s (in contrast to [[peninsulars]]), as well as the development of the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain. An attempt by the peninsular merchant [[Mart\u00edn de \u00c1lzaga]] to remove Liniers and replace him with a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Junta]] was defeated by the criollo armies. However, by 1810 it would be those same armies who would support a new revolutionary attempt, successfully removing the new viceroy [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]]. This is known as the [[May Revolution]], which is now celebrated as a national holiday. This event started the [[Argentine War of Independence]], and many armies left Buenos Aires to fight the diverse strongholds of royalist resistance, with varying levels of success. The government was held first by two Juntas of many members, then by two [[triumvirate]]s, and finally by a unipersonal office, the [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Supreme Director]]. Formal independence from Spain was [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared]] in 1816, at the [[Congress of Tucum\u00e1n]]. Buenos Aires managed to endure the whole [[Spanish American wars of independence]] without falling again under royalist rule.\n[[File:Pellegrini Buenos Aires Catedral.jpg|thumb|Impression of the [[Buenos Aires Cathedral]] by ''Carlos Pellegrini'', 1829.]]\n\nHistorically, Buenos Aires has been Argentina's main venue of [[liberalism|liberal]], [[free trade|free-trading]] and foreign ideas, while many of the provinces, especially those to the north-west, advocated a more [[nationalism|nationalistic]] and [[Catholic]] approach to political and social issues. Much of the internal tension in Argentina's history, starting with the centralist-federalist conflicts of the 19th century, can be traced back to these contrasting views. In the months immediately following the 25 May Revolution, Buenos Aires sent a number of military envoys to the provinces with the intention of obtaining their approval. Many of these missions ended in violent clashes, and the enterprise fuelled tensions between the capital and the provinces.\n\nIn the 19th century the city was [[blockade]]d twice by naval forces: by the [[French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata|French]] from 1838 to 1840, and later by an [[Anglo-French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Anglo-French]] expedition from 1845 to 1848. Both blockades failed to force the city into submission, and the foreign powers eventually desisted from their demands.\n\n===19th and 20th century===\n\n[[File:Pabellon-argentino plazasmartin 1900.jpg|thumb|left|''Argentine Pavilion'' in [[Plaza San Mart\u00edn (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Mart\u00edn]] (1889).]]\n\nDuring most of the 19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject. It was already the capital of [[Buenos Aires Province]], and between 1853 and 1860 it was the capital of the seceded [[State of Buenos Aires]]. The issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally settled in 1880 when the city was [[Federalization of Buenos Aires|federalized]] and became the seat of government, with its mayor appointed by the president. The [[Casa Rosada]] became the seat of the [[President of Argentina|president]].<ref name=\"provincia\"/>\n\nHealth conditions in poor areas were negative, with high rates of tuberculosis.  Public-health physicians and politicians typically blamed both the poor themselves and their ramshackle tenement houses (conventillos) for the spread of the dreaded disease.  People ignored public-health campaigns to limit the spread of contagious diseases, such as the prohibition of spitting on the streets, the strict guidelines to care for infants and young children, and quarantines that separated families from ill loved ones.<ref>Diego Armus, ''The Ailing City: Health, Tuberculosis, and Culture in Buenos Aires, 1870\u20131950'' (2011)</ref> [[File:Museo del Bicentenario - \"La Casa Rosada\" por Della Valle.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Casa Rosada]] during the [[Argentina Centennial]], 1910.]]\n\nIn addition to the wealth generated by the [[Buenos Aires Customs]] and the fertile [[pampas]], [[Rail transport in Argentina|railroad development]] in the second half of the 19th century increased the economic power of Buenos Aires as raw materials flowed into its factories. A leading destination for immigrants from Europe, particularly Italy and Spain, from 1880 to 1930 Buenos Aires became a multicultural city that ranked itself with the major European capitals. The [[Teatro Col\u00f3n|Col\u00f3n Theater]] became one of the world's top opera venues, and the city became the regional capital of [[Radio in Argentina|radio]], [[Television in Argentina|television]], [[Argentine cinema|cinema]], and [[Culture of Argentina#Theatre|theatre]]. The city's main avenues were built during those years, and the dawn of the 20th century saw the construction of South America's tallest buildings and its first [[Buenos Aires Underground|underground]] system. A second construction boom, from 1945 to 1980, reshaped downtown and much of the city. [[File:Buenos Aires - San Nicol\u00e1s - Construcci\u00f3n del Obelisco.jpg|thumb|Construction of the [[Obelisk of Buenos Aires]] on the [[9 de Julio Avenue]], 1936.]] [[File:Buenos Aires, 1986.jpg|thumb|[[9 de Julio Avenue]], 1986.]]\n\nBuenos Aires also attracted migrants from Argentina's provinces and neighboring countries. [[Shanty town]]s (''[[villa miseria|villas miseria]]'') started growing around the city's industrial areas during the 1930s, leading to pervasive social problems and social contrasts with the largely upwardly-mobile Buenos Aires population. These laborers became the political base of [[Peronism]], which emerged in Buenos Aires during the [[Loyalty Day (Argentina)|pivotal demonstration]] of 17 October 1945, at the [[Plaza de Mayo]].<ref name=\"Clar\u00edn guide\">''Gu\u00eda visual de Buenos Aires centro hist\u00f3rico'', [[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|''Clar\u00edn'']] Viajes, 2001.</ref> Industrial workers of the Greater Buenos Aires industrial belt have been Peronism's main support base ever since, and Plaza de Mayo became the site for demonstrations and many of the country's political events; on 16 June 1955, however, a splinter faction of the Navy bombed the Plaza de Mayo area, killing 364 civilians (see ''[[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]]''). This was the only time the city was attacked from the air, and the event was followed by a military uprising which deposed President Per\u00f3n, three months later (see ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'').\n\nIn the 1970s the city suffered from the fighting between left-wing revolutionary movements ([[Montoneros]], [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|ERP]] and F.A.R.) and the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] paramilitary group [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Triple A]], supported by [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n|Isabel Per\u00f3n]], who became president of Argentina in 1974 after Juan Per\u00f3n's death.\n\nThe [[March 1976 coup]], led by General [[Jorge Videla]], only escalated this conflict; the \"[[Dirty War]]\" resulted in 30,000 ''[[Forced disappearance|desaparecidos]]'' (people kidnapped and killed by the military during the years of the junta).<ref name=\"Millions\">''We are Millions: Neo-liberalism and new forms of political action in Argentina'', Marcela L\u00f3p\u00e9z Levy, Latin America Bureau, London, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1899365630}}</ref> The silent marches of their mothers ([[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]]) are a well-known image of Argentines' suffering during those times. The [[National Reorganization Process|dictatorship]]'s appointed mayor, [[Osvaldo Cacciatore]], also drew up plans for a network of freeways intended to relieve the city's acute traffic gridlock. The plan, however, called for a seemingly indiscriminate razing of residential areas and, though only three of the eight planned were put up at the time, they were mostly obtrusive raised freeways that continue to blight a number of formerly comfortable neighborhoods to this day.\n\nThe city was visited by [[Pope John Paul II]] twice, firstly in 1982 and again in 1987; on these occasions gathered some of the largest crowds in the city's history. The return of democracy in 1983 coincided with a cultural revival, and the 1990s saw an economic revival, particularly in the construction and financial sectors.\n\nOn 17 March 1992 a bomb [[1992 Israeli Embassy attack in Buenos Aires|exploded in the Israeli Embassy]], killing 29 and injuring 242. Another explosion, on 18 July 1994, [[1994 AMIA bombing|destroyed a building]] housing several [[Jew]]ish organizations, killing 85 and injuring many more, these incidents marked the beginning of [[Middle East]]ern [[terrorism]] to South America. Following a [[Pact of Olivos|1993 agreement]], the [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine Constitution]] was amended to give Buenos Aires [[autonomy]] and rescinding, among other things, the president's right to appoint the city's mayor (as had been the case since 1880). On 30 June 1996, voters in Buenos Aires chose their first elected mayor (''[[List of mayors and chiefs of government of Buenos Aires|Jefe de Gobierno]]'').\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Microcentro, Buenos Aires (40774240522).jpg|thumb|left|217x217px|Aerial view of the city skyline.]]\n\nIn 1996, following the [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution]], the city held its first mayoral elections under the new statutes, with the mayor's title formally changed to \"Head of Government\". The winner was [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], who would later become President of Argentina from 1999 to 2001.\n\nDe la R\u00faa's successor, [[An\u00edbal Ibarra]], won two popular elections, but was [[impeachment|impeached]] (and ultimately deposed on 6 March 2006) as a result of the fire at the [[Rep\u00fablica Croma\u00f1\u00f3n nightclub fire|Rep\u00fablica Cromagnon]] nightclub. [[Jorge Telerman]], who had been the acting mayor, was invested with the office. In the 2007 elections, [[Mauricio Macri]] of the [[Republican Proposal]] (PRO) party won the [[Ballotage in Argentina|second-round]] of voting over [[Daniel Filmus]] of the [[Frente para la Victoria]] (FPV) party, taking office on 9 December 2007. In 2011, the elections went to a second round with 60.96% of the vote for PRO, compared to 39.04% for FPV, thus re-electing Macri as mayor of the city with [[Mar\u00eda Eugenia Vidal]] as deputy mayor.<ref>[http://especiales.perfil.com/elecciones-capital-2011/resultadosjefe.php Elecciones 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081711/http://especiales.perfil.com/elecciones-capital-2011/resultadosjefe.php |date=4 March 2016 }} \u2013 Perfil</ref>\n\nThe 2015 elections were the first to use an [[electronic voting]] system in the city, similar to the one used in [[Salta Province]].<ref>[http://www.informatesalta.com.ar/noticia.asp?q=79437 M\u00e1s de 300 mil porte\u00f1os probaron ayer el voto electr\u00f3nico] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622152210/http://informatesalta.com.ar/noticia.asp?q=79437 |date=22 June 2017 }} \u2013 InformateSalta, 27 April 2015</ref> In these elections held on 5 July 2015, Macri stepped down as mayor and pursue his [[Argentine general election, 2015|presidential bid]] and [[Horacio Rodr\u00edguez Larreta]] took his place as the mayoral candidate for PRO.

Polimodal is usually 3 years of schooling, although some schools have a fourth year. Before entering the first year of polimodal, students choose an orientation, among these five: ''Humanities and Social Sciences'', ''Economics and Management of Organizations'','' Art and Design'', ''Health and Sport'' and ''Biology and Natural Sciences''.\n\nNevertheless, in Buenos Aires, secondary education consists of 5 years, called from 1st year to 5th year, as opposed to primary education's 1st to 7th grade. Most schools do not require students to choose their orientation, as they study the basic such as maths, biology, art, history and technology, but there are schools that do, whether they are orientated to a certain profession or they have orientations to choose from when they reach a specific year.\n\nSome high schools depend on the [[University of Buenos Aires]], and these require an admission course when students are taking the last year of high school. These high schools are [[Instituto Libre de Segunda Ense\u00f1anza|ILSE]], [[CNBA]], [[Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini]] and Escuela de Educaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica Profesional en Producci\u00f3n Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria (School of Professional Technique Education in Agricultural and Agri-food Production). The last two do have a specific orientation.\n\nIn December 2006 the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] of the [[Argentine National Congress|Argentine Congress]] passed a new National Education Law restoring the old system of primary followed by secondary education, making secondary education obligatory and a right, and increasing the length of compulsory education to 13 years.

To the north, the ''[[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana]]'' which has stood in the same location since colonial times, and the [[Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina]] building, a parcel of land originally owned by [[Juan de Garay]]. Other important colonial institutions were [[Buenos Aires Cabildo|Cabildo]], to the west, which was renovated during the construction of [[Avenida de Mayo]] and Julio A. Roca.

The mansion, built in 1881, is currently the main building of the complex.\n*[[Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens]] Is the largest of its type in the World, outside Japan. Completed in 1967, the gardens were inaugurated on occasion of a State visit to Argentina by Crown Prince [[Akihito]] and Princess [[Empress Michiko|Michiko]] of Japan.\n*[[Plaza de Mayo]] Since being the scene of [[May Revolution|25 May 1810 revolution]] that led to independence, the plaza has been a hub of political life in Argentina.\n*[[Plaza San Mart\u00edn (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Mart\u00edn]] is a park located in the [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] neighbourhood of the city.
