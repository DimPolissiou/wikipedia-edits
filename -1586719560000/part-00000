According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the 2010 population was 36,705. The name is derived from an early land patent.<ref name=\"history\">Bits and Pieces of Saratoga County History by Richard Dorrough, Ballston Journal</ref> The town is in the south part of the county and is located approximately {{convert|12|mi|km}} north of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], {{convert|7|mi|km}} northeast of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of [[Saratoga Springs, New York|Saratoga Springs]].\n\n==History==\nThe first settlements in what is now Clifton Park were established in the 17th century.<ref name=\"book\" /> The town or area was named in 1707 by Nanning Harmansen.<ref name=\"history\" /> At that time Nanning Harmansen sent letters to [[Lord Cornbury]] requesting letters of Patent for Land he bought from the Indigenous Americans known as Shenendehowa.<ref>\"Bits and Pieces of Saratoga County History\" by Richard Dorrough published in the ''Ballston Journal''. Copies of the original documents in Dorrough's possession.</ref> He also stated in this correspondence that he wanted the patent to be known by \"Your name of Cliftons Park\", and the patent was named the Clifton Park Patent.\n\nBy 1723, the area had grown to twenty inhabitants, and was given the name of \"Canastigione\". The area along the [[Mohawk River]] was popular for ferries across the waterbed, with Eldert Vischer opening the crossing known as [[Vischer Ferry, New York|Vischer Ferry]] in 1783. To the northwest, Edward Rexford established [[Rexford, New York|Rexford Flats]], a small community on the riverbank at the northern end of what became [[New York State Route 146B|NY&nbsp;146B]].<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn 1828, the town of Clifton Park was created as \"Clifton\" from the town of [[Halfmoon, New York|Halfmoon]], but was renamed Clifton Park a year later.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book|year=1899|title=A Descriptive and Biographical Record of Saratoga County, New York|author=The Saratogian|publisher=The Boston History Publishers Company}}</ref> It was the last town created in [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]]. The town originally consisted of farmland with a small village of homes, churches and businesses on what is now [[U.S. Route 9 (New York)|U.S. Route&nbsp;9]], but saw a large demographic change when [[Interstate 87 (New York)|Interstate 87]] was built through the town in 1961.<ref name=\"1961map\">{{cite map |title = New York and Metropolitan New York |author1 = [[Sunoco]] |author2 = [[H.M.

[[Saratoga County, New York]], United States. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the 2010 population was 36,705. The name is derived from an early land patent.<ref name=\"history\">Bits and Pieces of Saratoga County History by Richard Dorrough, Ballston Journal</ref> The town is in the south part of the county and is located approximately {{convert|12|mi|km}} north of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], {{convert|7|mi|km}} northeast of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of [[Saratoga Springs, New York|Saratoga Springs]].\n\n==History==\nThe first settlements in what is now Clifton Park were established in the 17th century.<ref name=\"book\" /> The town or area was named in 1707 by Nanning Harmansen.<ref name=\"history\" /> At that time Nanning Harmansen sent letters to [[Lord Cornbury]] requesting letters of Patent for Land he bought from the Indigenous Americans known as Shenendehowa.<ref>\"Bits and Pieces of Saratoga County History\" by Richard Dorrough published in the ''Ballston Journal''. Copies of the original documents in Dorrough's possession.</ref> He also stated in this correspondence that he wanted the patent to be known by \"Your name of Cliftons Park\", and the patent was named the Clifton Park Patent.\n\nBy 1723, the area had grown to twenty inhabitants, and was given the name of \"Canastigione\". The area along the [[Mohawk River]] was popular for ferries across the waterbed, with Eldert Vischer opening the crossing known as [[Vischer Ferry, New York|Vischer Ferry]] in 1783. To the northwest, Edward Rexford established [[Rexford, New York|Rexford Flats]], a small community on the riverbank at the northern end of what became [[New York State Route 146B|NY&nbsp;146B]].<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn 1828, the town of Clifton Park was created as \"Clifton\" from the town of [[Halfmoon, New York|Halfmoon]], but was renamed Clifton Park a year later.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book|year=1899|title=A Descriptive and Biographical Record of Saratoga County, New York|author=The Saratogian|publisher=The Boston History Publishers Company}}</ref> It was the last town created in [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]].

About 1.4% of families and 2.9% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 2.9% of those under age 18 and 2.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Recreation==\nThere are many opportunities for youth involvement in typical sports teams such as football, baseball, softball, lacrosse, soccer, basketball, wrestling and hockey. Adults may participate as well. Every year Clifton Park Soccer Club hosts an international tournament called the Rose and Kiernan/Clifton Park Soccer International Soccer Classic.\n\nClifton Park also periodically hosts the Babe Ruth World Series for boys baseball. There are also other annual events, such as Winterfest.\n\nClifton Common which is located on Vischer Ferry Rd. is a central hub for recreation which features baseball/softball fields, soccer fields, outdoor basketball courts, two NHL-size ice rinks, playgrounds, and an outdoor stage for performing arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cliftonpark.com/hot-spots/clifton-commons|title=Explore Recreation & Entertainment at Clifton Common in Clifton Park}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Vischer Ferry Nature and Historic Preserve]], a 740-acre site in southern Clifton Park adjacent to the [[Mohawk River]], features a network of walking trails alongside an original section of the [[Erie Canal]] and towpath.\n\n==Schools==\nThe public school district covering most (the eastern two-thirds) of Clifton Park is the [[Shenendehowa Central School District]], located on NY Route 146.

When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29688355 Martin Gardner, puzzle master extraordinaire]'' by [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[BBC News Magazine]], 21 October 2014: \"The Game of Life appeared in Scientific American in 1970, and was by far the most successful of Gardner's columns, in terms of reader response.\"</ref><ref name=topten>Mulcahy (2014).</ref> Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.<ref>[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/2010/06/ha-conway-on-gardner/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] John H. Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W. H. Freeman & Co., 1989, {{ISBN|0-7167-1987-8}}, Chapter 4. A non-technical overview; reprint of the 1976 Scientific American article.</ref> \n\nConway was probably the most important member of[[Martin_Gardner#Martin_Gardner's_Mathematical_Grapevine| Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine]]. He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research.  In a 1976 visit Gardner pretty much held him prisoner for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced.\u00a0 Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], August 28, 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of Scientific American features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings. See Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2013[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research.

''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings. See Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2013[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

Kounotori 2 was then unberthed and separated from the ISS and burned up upon reentering the atmosphere on 30 March 2011.\n\n== Specifications==\nKounotori 2 is {{convert|4|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} long. It consists primarily of three parts: a Propulsion Module, an Avionics Module, and a Logistics Carrier.\n\nThe propulsion module is installed at the rear of the Kounotori and is composed of the main engines for orbit change, the Reaction Control System thrusters for positioning and attitude control, fuel and oxidizing reagent tanks, and high-pressure air tanks. The avionics module is installed in the center part of Kounotori, with electronic equipment for guidance control, power supply, and telecommunications data processing. The logistics carrier stores supplies.\n\n==Cargo items==\nKounotori 2 carried {{convert|5300|kg}} of cargo to ISS, consisting of {{convert|4000|kg}} in the Pressurized Logistics Carrier (PLC) and {{convert|1300|kg}} in the Unpressurized Logistics Carrier (ULC).<ref name=HTV2PressKit2011/> Cargo in the PLC consists of spare system components (51% of cargo weight), food (24%), science experiment materials (10%), crew commodities (8%), and water (7%) i.e. {{convert|280|kg}} of water.<ref name=HTV2PressKit2011/> It included the Kobairo (Gradient Heating Furnace) rack <ref>{{cite web|url=http://kibo.jaxa.jp/en/experiment/pm/ghf/|title=The Gradient Heating Furnace|author=JAXA|accessdate=14 November 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725093906/http://kibo.jaxa.jp/en/experiment/pm/ghf/|archivedate=25 July 2011}}</ref> and a Multipurpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR).\n\nThe Gradient Heating Furnace is a high-temperature electrical furnace that will be used to generate large scale, high-quality crystals from melting materials. The MSPR is a multipurpose rack that will be used for many different functions. The rack consists of three main components \u2013 a Work Volume, a Work Bench, and a Small Experiment Area. One experiment that is already planned for the Work Volume, to be launched on a later flight, is the Aquatic Habitat, which will be used to breed small fish in order to study their responses to microgravity and cosmic radiation.\n\nOnce Kounotori 2 was berthed to the ISS, both Kobairo and the MSPR were transferred into the [[Japanese Experiment Module|Japanese Pressurized Module]].<ref name=\"nasaspaceflight20101020\"/><ref name=jaxa20101027>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/10/20101027_sac_htv2_j.html|title=\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u88dc\u7d66\u6a5f2\u53f7\u6a5f\uff08HTV2\uff09\u306e\u6e96\u5099\u72b6\u6cc1\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066|publisher=JAXA|language=Japanese|date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}</ref> The installation and commissioning of these racks will initiate the 2nd phase of the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) utilization.\n\nKounotori 2's Unpressurized Logistics Carrier (ULC) carried an EP (Exposed Pallet) with two US ORUs (Orbital Replacement Units) attached: an FHRC (Flex Hose Rotary Coupler) and CTC-4 (Cargo Transportation Container-4).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/payloadtojapan.html|title=NASA Payloads Take First Trip to Station Aboard Japanese Rocket|author=NASA|accessdate=13 November 2010|date=3 September 2010}}</ref> Both the FHRC and CTC-4 were transferred from Kounotori 2's EP to the space station's [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier|ELC-4]] using the ISS's manipulator \"[[Dextre]]\".\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nImage:HTV 2 Gradient Heating Furnace.JPG|Gradient Heating Furnace\nImage:HTV 2 Multi-purpose Small Payload_Rack.JPG|Multi-purpose Small Payload Rack\nImage:HTV 2 Cargo Transport Container.JPG|Cargo Transport Container\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==Operation==\nScheduling of Kounotori 2 operation was affected by the Space Shuttle mission [[STS-133]]. STS-133 was originally planned to be launched in September 2010, well before Kounotori 2. After several delays, eventually, STS-133 was scheduled for February 2011. Since Kounotori 2 needed to depart the ISS after the Space Shuttle to carry away the wastes from the Shuttle's cargo, Kounotori 2's schedule was changed to stay attached to the ISS for two months, close to its design limit, from the initial plan of 40 days. Also, the [[Dextre]] robot hand had to keep holding the external payload and wait for the arrival of STS-133, since STS-133 was carrying the Logistics Carrier 4 stowage platform to install the external payload.\n\n[[File:H-IIB_F2_launching_HTV2.jpg|thumb|right|The H-IIB rocket carrying Kounotori 2 lifts off from the Tanegashima space center on 22 January 2011.]]\n\n===Launch and rendezvous with ISS===\n[[File:STS-133 International Space Station after undocking (closeup).jpg|left|thumb|A close-up view of Kounotori 2 photographed by an STS-133 crew member on the departing space shuttle ''Discovery''.]]\n[[File:HTV2 relocation on 10 March 2011.jpg|right|thumb|The Canadarm2 moves HTV-2 back to the nadir port of Harmony on 10 March 2011.]]\n\nKounotori 2 was initially scheduled to launch on 20 January 2011, but this was postponed for two days due to a bad weather forecast.

Kounotori 2 was loaded with waste material from ISS, including used experiment equipment and used clothes. Kounotori 2 was then unberthed and separated from the ISS and burned up upon reentering the atmosphere on 30 March 2011.\n\n== Specifications==\nKounotori 2 is {{convert|4|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} long. It consists primarily of three parts: a Propulsion Module, an Avionics Module, and a Logistics Carrier.\n\nThe propulsion module is installed at the rear of the Kounotori and is composed of the main engines for orbit change, the Reaction Control System thrusters for positioning and attitude control, fuel and oxidizing reagent tanks, and high-pressure air tanks. The avionics module is installed in the center part of Kounotori, with electronic equipment for guidance control, power supply, and telecommunications data processing. The logistics carrier stores supplies.\n\n==Cargo items==\nKounotori 2 carried {{convert|5300|kg}} of cargo to ISS, consisting of {{convert|4000|kg}} in the Pressurized Logistics Carrier (PLC) and {{convert|1300|kg}} in the Unpressurized Logistics Carrier (ULC).<ref name=HTV2PressKit2011/> Cargo in the PLC consists of spare system components (51% of cargo weight), food (24%), science experiment materials (10%), crew commodities (8%), and water (7%) i.e. {{convert|280|kg}} of water.<ref name=HTV2PressKit2011/> It included the Kobairo (Gradient Heating Furnace) rack <ref>{{cite web|url=http://kibo.jaxa.jp/en/experiment/pm/ghf/|title=The Gradient Heating Furnace|author=JAXA|accessdate=14 November 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725093906/http://kibo.jaxa.jp/en/experiment/pm/ghf/|archivedate=25 July 2011}}</ref> and a Multipurpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR).\n\nThe Gradient Heating Furnace is a high-temperature electrical furnace that will be used to generate a large scale, high-quality crystals from melting materials. The MSPR is a multipurpose rack that will be used for many different functions. The rack consists of three main components \u2013 a Work Volume, a Work Bench, and a Small Experiment Area. One experiment that is already planned for the Work Volume, to be launched on a later flight, is the Aquatic Habitat, which will be used to breed small fish in order to study their responses to microgravity and cosmic radiation.\n\nOnce Kounotori 2 was berthed to the ISS, both Kobairo and the MSPR were transferred into the [[Japanese Experiment Module|Japanese Pressurized Module]].<ref name=\"nasaspaceflight20101020\"/><ref name=jaxa20101027>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/10/20101027_sac_htv2_j.html|title=\u5b87\u5b99\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u88dc\u7d66\u6a5f2\u53f7\u6a5f\uff08HTV2\uff09\u306e\u6e96\u5099\u72b6\u6cc1\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066|publisher=JAXA|language=Japanese|date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}</ref> The installation and commissioning of these racks will initiate the 2nd phase of the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) utilization.\n\nKounotori 2's Unpressurized Logistics Carrier (ULC) carried an EP (Exposed Pallet) with two US ORUs (Orbital Replacement Units) attached: an FHRC (Flex Hose Rotary Coupler) and CTC-4 (Cargo Transportation Container-4).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/payloadtojapan.html|title=NASA Payloads Take First Trip to Station Aboard Japanese Rocket|author=NASA|accessdate=13 November 2010|date=3 September 2010}}</ref> Both the FHRC and CTC-4 were transferred from Kounotori 2's EP to the space station's [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier|ELC-4]] using the ISS's manipulator \"[[Dextre]]\".\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nImage:HTV 2 Gradient Heating Furnace.JPG|Gradient Heating Furnace\nImage:HTV 2 Multi-purpose Small Payload_Rack.JPG|Multi-purpose Small Payload Rack\nImage:HTV 2 Cargo Transport Container.JPG|Cargo Transport Container\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==Operation==\nScheduling of Kounotori 2 operation was affected by the Space Shuttle mission [[STS-133]]. STS-133 was originally planned to be launched in September 2010, well before Kounotori 2. After several delays, eventually, STS-133 was scheduled for February 2011. Since Kounotori 2 needed to depart the ISS after the Space Shuttle to carry away the wastes from the Shuttle's cargo, Kounotori 2's schedule was changed to stay attached to the ISS for two months, close to its design limit, from the initial plan of 40 days. Also, the [[Dextre]] robot hand had to keep holding the external payload and wait for the arrival of STS-133, since STS-133 was carrying the Logistics Carrier 4 stowage platform to install the external payload.\n\n[[File:H-IIB_F2_launching_HTV2.jpg|thumb|right|The H-IIB rocket carrying Kounotori 2 lifts off from the Tanegashima space center on 22 January 2011.]]\n\n===Launch and rendezvous with ISS===\n[[File:STS-133 International Space Station after undocking (closeup).jpg|left|thumb|A close-up view of Kounotori 2 photographed by an STS-133 crew member on the departing space shuttle ''Discovery''.]]\n[[File:HTV2 relocation on 10 March 2011.jpg|right|thumb|The Canadarm2 moves HTV-2 back to the nadir port of Harmony on 10 March 2011.]]\n\nKounotori 2 was initially scheduled to launch on 20 January 2011, but this was postponed for two days due to a bad weather forecast.

He loves to munch on lego and does so on a bi-daily basis... Lego munching paraffin lamp. \n\nBrown started his career with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], breaking into their first team in 2002. His only trophy with Hibs was the [[2006\u201307 Scottish League Cup]]; in that season he also won the [[SFWA Young Player of the Year]] award. In May 2007 he was transferred to Celtic for a fee of \u00a34.4 million, the highest transfer fee paid between two Scottish clubs.\n\nDuring Brown's time at Celtic, the club has won nine Scottish championships, five Scottish Cups, and six Scottish League Cups. He has captained the club to 8 consecutive championships since 2011\u201312, and successive [[Treble (association football)|trebles]] in 2016\u201317, 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319. He has been Celtic's captain since February 2010, and has made more European appearances for Celtic than any other player. He has won the [[PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year]] award twice, in 2008\u201309 and 2017\u201318, and the [[SFWA Footballer of the Year|Scottish Footballer of the Year]] award in 2017\u201318.\n\nBrown played for Scotland at [[Scotland national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[Scotland national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels before making his [[Scotland national football team|full international]] debut in November 2005, aged 20. He did not play for Scotland again until March 2007, but then became a regular in the squad. He scored his first goal for the senior team on 5 September 2009 in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] win against [[North Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]].

They also remain the only Super Bowl champion to win despite having been shut out in the second half of the game. The game was played on January 14, 1973 at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] in Los Angeles, the second time the Super Bowl was played in that city.

The Redskins were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting an 11\u20133 regular-season record and playoff victories over the [[1972 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] and [[1972 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]].

Instead of falling on the loose ball, the Dolphins kicker picked it up, attempted a forward pass, but batted it in the air, and Redskins cornerback [[Mike Bass]] (who was Garo's former teammate on the [[Detroit Lions]] years earlier) caught it and returned it 49 yards for a touchdown. This remains the longest period in a Super Bowl for one team to be shut out, as Washington was held scoreless until 2:07 remained in the fourth quarter.<ref group=\"note\">The previous Super Bowl with the longest period for being shut out was [[Super Bowl III|in 1969]], where the Jets held the Colts scoreless until 3:19 left in the game. Don Shula was head coach on the losing side that time, so he held the record for the longest period to be held under a shut out as well as the longest period to hold a shut out.</ref> Because of the turnover and score, what was a Miami-dominated game became close, and the Dolphins had to stop Washington's final drive for the tying touchdown as time expired. \n\nDolphins [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] [[Jake Scott]] was named [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player]]. He recorded two interceptions for 63 return yards, including a 55-yard return from the end zone during the fourth quarter. Scott became the second defensive player in Super Bowl history (after [[linebacker]] [[Chuck Howley]] in [[Super Bowl V]]) to earn a Super Bowl MVP award.\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 33 - Jim Kiick (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Jim Kiick]] (''center right'') rushing the ball for Miami in Super Bowl VII.]]\n\n==Background==\nThe NFL awarded Super Bowl VII to Los Angeles on March 21, 1972.\n\n===Miami Dolphins===\n{{main article|1972 Miami Dolphins season}}\n\nThe Dolphins went undefeated during the season, despite losing their starting quarterback. In the fifth game of the regular season, starter [[Bob Griese]] suffered a fractured right leg and dislocated ankle. In his place, 38-year-old [[Earl Morrall]], a 17-year veteran, led Miami to victory in their nine remaining regular-season games, and was the 1972 [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]]. Morrall had previously played for Dolphins head coach [[Don Shula]] when they were both with the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]], where Morrall backed up quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]] and started in [[Super Bowl III]].\n\nBut Miami also had the same core group of young players who had helped the team advance to the previous year's [[Super Bowl VI]]. (The only Dolphins starter in Super Bowl VII over the age of 30 was 32-year-old [[Nick Buoniconti]].) The Dolphins still had a powerful running attack, spearheaded by running backs [[Larry Csonka]], [[Jim Kiick]] and [[Mercury Morris|Eugene \"Mercury\" Morris]]. (Morris, who in previous seasons had been used primarily as a kick returner, took over the starting halfback position from Kiick, who had been the starter the previous four years. However, the more-experienced Kiick would start in Super Bowl VII.) Csonka led the team with 1,117 yards and six touchdowns. Kiick contributed 521 yards and five touchdowns, and also caught 21 passes for 147 yards and another touchdown. Morris, a breakaway runner, rushed for 1,000 yards, caught 15 passes for 168 yards, added another 334 yards returning kickoffs, and scored a league-leading 12 rushing touchdowns. Overall, Miami set a record with 2,960 total rushing yards during the regular season, and became the first team ever to have two players rush for 1,000 yards in one season. Miami led the NFL in points scored (385).\n\nReceiver [[Paul Warfield]] once again provided the run-based Dolphins with an effective deep-threat option, catching 29 passes for 606 yards, an average of 20.9 yards per catch. Miami's offensive line, led by future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Jim Langer]] and [[Larry Little]], was also a key factor in the Dolphins' offensive production. Miami's \"No-Name Defense\" (a nickname inspired by [[Dallas Cowboys]] head coach [[Tom Landry]] when he could not recall the names of any Dolphins defenders just before Super Bowl VI), led by future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] linebacker [[Nick Buoniconti]], allowed the fewest points in the league during the regular season (171), and ranked second in the NFL with 26 interceptions. Safety [[Jake Scott]] recorded five interceptions, while [[Lloyd Mumphord]] had four picks and safety [[Dick Anderson]] had three interceptions and led the NFL with five fumble recoveries. Because of injuries to defensive linemen (at the beginning of the season the Dolphins were down to four healthy players at the position), defensive coordinator [[Bill Arnsparger]] created what he called the \"53\" defense, in which the versatile [[Bob Matheson]] (number 53) would be used as either a defensive end in the standard [[American football strategy|4\u20133 defense]] or as a fourth linebacker in a [[American football strategy|3\u20134 defense]], with [[Manny Fernandez (American football)|Manny Fernandez]] at [[nose tackle]]. As a linebacker, Matheson would either rush or drop back into coverage. Said Nick Buoniconti, \"Teams would be totally confused.\"<ref name=Buoniconti>Nick Buoniconti, \"Super Bowl VII\", ''Super Bowl: The Game of Their Lives'', Danny Peary, editor. Macmillan, 1997. {{ISBN|0-02-860841-0}}</ref> Linebacker [[Doug Swift]] was also a playmaker with three interceptions and a fumble recovery.\n\nThe Dolphins' undefeated, untied regular season was the third in NFL history, and the first of the post-[[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] era. The previous two teams to do so, the 1934 and 1942 [[Chicago Bears]], both lost the NFL Championship game. The [[Cleveland Browns]] also completed a perfect season in 1948, including a league championship, while part of the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), but this feat is only recognized by the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] (the NFL does not officially recognize any AAFC records).\n\n===Washington Redskins===\n{{Main article|1972 Washington Redskins season}}\n\nFollowing the death of Redskins head coach [[Vince Lombardi]] 17 days prior to the start of the 1970 season, Washington finished 6\u20138 under interim coach [[Bill Austin (American football, born 1928)|Bill Austin]]. Shortly after the conclusion of the 1970 season, the Redskins hired [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] as their head coach, hoping he could turn the team's fortunes around. Allen's philosophy was that veteran players win games, so immediately after taking over the team, he traded away most of the younger team members and draft choices for older, more established players. His motto was \"The future is now.\" Washington quickly became the oldest team in the NFL and earned the nickname \"The Over-the-Hill Gang.\" The average age of starters was 31 years old.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect! The Untold Story of the 1972 Miami Dolphins'', p. 239. Dolphins/Curtis Publishing, 2002 {{ISBN|0-9702677-1-1}}</ref> However, Allen's strategy turned the Redskins around, as the team improved to a 9\u20134\u20131 record in 1971, and finished the 1972 season with an NFC-best 11\u20133 record.\n\nWashington was led by 33-year-old quarterback [[Billy Kilmer]], who completed 120 out of 225 passes for 1,648 yards and a league-leading 19 touchdowns during the regular season, with only 11 interceptions, giving him an NFL-best 84.8 [[passer rating]]. Kilmer had started the first three games of the season, was replaced in Game 4 by 38-year-old [[Sonny Jurgensen]], then replaced Jurgensen when he was lost for the season with an [[Achilles tendon]] injury. The Redskins' powerful rushing attack featured two backs. [[Larry Brown (running back)|Larry Brown]] gained 1,216 yards (first in the NFC and second in the NFL) on 285 carries during the regular season, caught 32 passes for 473 yards and scored 12 touchdowns, earning him both the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]] and the [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award]]. [[Charley Harraway]] ran for 567 yards on 148 carries. Future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] wide receiver [[Charley Taylor]] and wide receiver [[Roy Jefferson]] provided the team with a solid deep threat, combining for 84 receptions, 1,223 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns. Veteran tight end [[Jerry Smith (American football)|Jerry Smith]] added 21 receptions for 353 yards and 7 touchdowns.\n\nWashington also had a solid defense led by linebacker [[Chris Hanburger]] (four interceptions, 98 return yards, one touchdown) and cornerbacks [[Pat Fischer]] (four interceptions, 61 return yards) and [[Mike Bass]] (three interceptions, 53 return yards)\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{Details|1972\u201373 NFL playoffs}}\nMorrall led the Dolphins to a 20\u201314 playoff win over the [[Cleveland Browns]]. However, Griese started the second half of the AFC Championship Game to help rally the Dolphins to a 21\u201317 victory over the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. A fake punt by Miami's [[Larry Seiple]] made the difference.\n\nMeanwhile, the Redskins advanced to the Super Bowl without having allowed a touchdown in either their 16\u20133 playoff win over the [[Green Bay Packers]] or their 26\u20133 NFC Championship Game victory over the Cowboys.\n\n===Super Bowl pregame news and notes===\nMuch of the pregame hype surrounded the chances of the Dolphins completing a perfect, undefeated season, as well as their quarterback controversy between Griese and Morrall. Griese was eventually picked to start the Super Bowl because Shula felt more comfortable with Morrall as the backup just in case Griese was ineffective following his recent inactivity. Miami was also strongly motivated to win the Super Bowl after having been humiliated by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in [[Super Bowl VI]]. Wrote Nick Buoniconti, \"There was no way we were going to lose the Super Bowl; there was no way.\"<ref name=Buoniconti/> Head coach Don Shula, loser of Super Bowls [[Super Bowl III|III]] and [[Super Bowl VI|VI]], was also determined to win. Although Shula was relaxed and charming when dealing with the press, it was all an act; Dolphins players described him as \"neurotic\" and \"absolutely crazy.\" He was also sick during Super Bowl week with the flu, which he kept secret.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', p. 248.</ref>\n\nStill, many favored the Redskins to win the game because of their group of \"Over the Hill Gang\" veterans, and because Miami had what some considered an easy schedule (only two opponents, [[Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City]] and the [[New York Giants]], posted winning records, and both of those teams were 8\u20136) and had struggled in the playoffs. Also, while Washington had easily crushed both playoff opponents, Miami had narrowly defeated theirs. Most surprisingly, the Dolphins needed to mount a fourth-quarter comeback against the Browns, whom they were heavily favored to defeat.\n\nAllen had a reputation for spying on opponents. A school overlooked the Rams facility that the NFL designated as the Dolphins practice field, so the Dolphins found a more secure field at a local community college. Dolphins employees inspected the trees every day for spies.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', p. 239.</ref>\n\nMiami cornerback [[Tim Foley]], a future broadcaster who was injured and would not play in Super Bowl VII, was writing daily stories for a Miami newspaper and interviewed George Allen and his players, provoking charges from Allen that Foley was actually spying for Shula.<ref name=Strother>Shelby Strother, \"The Perfect Season\", ''NFL Top 40''. Viking, 1988. {{ISBN|0-670-82490-9}}</ref>\n\nAllen was extremely uptight and prickly dealing with the press Super Bowl week, and accused the press of ruining his team's preparation. Allen pushed the team so hard in practices that the players joked among themselves that they should have left Allen in Washington.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', p. 247.</ref>\n\nDuring practice the day before Super Bowl VII, the Dolphins' 5'7\" 150-pound kicker, [[Garo Yepremian]], relaxed by throwing 30-yard passes to [[Dave Shula]], Don Shula's son. During the pregame warmups, he consistently kicked low line drives and couldn't figure out why.<ref name=\"Dave Hyde p264\">Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', p. 264.</ref>\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl in which neither coach wore a tie. Shula wore a coat and tie for Super Bowl VI, but wore a white short-sleeved polo shirt for this game, as did Allen. For [[Super Bowl VIII]], Shula would wear a sportcoat, but with a shirt underneath that was similar to the one he wore in Super Bowl VII.\n\n==Broadcasting==\nThe game was broadcast in the United States by [[NBC]] with [[Play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[color commentator]] [[Al DeRogatis]].\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl to be televised live in the city in which it was being played. Despite unconditional [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules in the NFL that normally would have prohibited the live telecast from being shown locally, the NFL allowed the game to be telecast in the Los Angeles area on an experimental basis when all tickets for the game were sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1971-1980|title=NFL History by Decade|website=www.nfl.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1973/1973-01-01-BC.pdf | title=NFL won't play ball; Nixon may blow whistle | work=[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]] | date=January 1, 1973 | page=33 | accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref> The league then changed its blackout rules the following season to allow any game sold out at least 72 hours in advance to be televised in the host market.<ref>{{cite book | title=America's Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation | first=Michael | last=MacCambridge | author-link=Michael MacCambridge | year=2005 | page=301 | publisher=Anchor Books | isbn=978-0-375-72506-7}}</ref> No subsequent Super Bowl has ever been blacked out under this rule, as all have been sold out (owing to its status as the marquee event on the NFL schedule, meaning that tickets sell out quickly).\n\nThis game is featured on ''[[NFL's Greatest Games]]'' under the title \"17\u20130\".\n\n==Entertainment==\nThe pregame show was a tribute to [[Apollo 17]], the sixth and last mission to land on the [[Moon]] and the final one of [[Project Apollo]]. The show featured the [[Michigan Marching Band]] and the crew of Apollo 17 who exactly [[Apollo 17#Return to Earth|one month earlier]] had been the final humans to date to leave the Moon.\n\nLater, the Little Angels of Chicago's Angels Church from [[Chicago]] performed the national anthem.\n\nThe halftime show, featuring [[Woody Herman]] and the [[Michigan Marching Band]] along with The [[Citrus College]] Singers and [[Andy Williams]], was titled \"Happiness Is\".\n\n==Game summary==\nAccording to Shula, the Dolphins' priority on defense was to stop Larry Brown and force Billy Kilmer to pass. Buoniconti looked at Washington's offensive formation on each play and shifted the defense so it was strongest where he felt Brown would run.<ref name=Buoniconti/> This strategy proved successful. Washington's offensive line also had trouble handling Dolphins' defensive tackle/nose tackle [[Manny Fernandez (American football)|Manny Fernandez]], who was very quick. \"He beat their center [[Len Hauss]] like a drum\", wrote Buoniconti. Miami's defenders had also drilled in maintaining precise pursuit angles on sweeps to prevent the cut-back running that [[Duane Thomas]] had used to destroy the Dolphins in [[Super Bowl VI]].\n\nWashington's priority on defense was to disrupt Miami's ball-control offense by stopping Larry Csonka.<ref>Shelby Strother, \"Playing to Perfection\", ''The Super Bowl: Celebrating a Quarter-Century of America's Greatest Game''. Simon and Schuster, 1990 {{ISBN|0-671-72798-2}}</ref> They also intended to shut down Paul Warfield by [[double coverage|double-covering]] him.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', p. 256.</ref>\n\nWith a game-time kickoff temperature of {{convert|84|F}}, this is the warmest Super Bowl to date. It came the year after the coldest game in [[Super Bowl VI]] which registered a temperature at kickoff of {{convert|39|F}}.<ref name=\"Warmest SB ever\" />\n\n===First Quarter===\nAs they had in Super Bowl VI, Miami won the toss and elected to receive. Most of the first quarter was a defensive battle with each team punting on their first two possessions. The Dolphins would, however, get two key breaks. [[Howard Kindig]] appeared to mishandle the snap on their first punt from the Miami 27 and lose the ball to the Redskins' [[Harold McLinton]], but McLinton was called for slapping at the ball while it was being snapped, for a 5-yard penalty. On the replay of the down, [[Larry Seiple]] got the kick away safely. Later, after stopping Washington for the second time, safety [[Jake Scott]] did not call for a fair catch, as he had not been told to do so by [[Dick Anderson]]. He fumbled, but fortunately Anderson made the recovery.<ref name=\"Dolphs Upset Skins for 17-0 Record\">{{cite web | title=Dolphins Do It, Upset Skins for 17\u20130 Record | url=https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/super-bowl-vii-dolphs-upset-skins-17-0-record-article-1.1553595 | first=Larry | last=Fox | date=January 15, 1973 | work=[[New York Daily News|Daily News]] | location=New York | accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref> Miami then started this drive on its own 37-yard line with 2:55 left in the first quarter. Running back [[Jim Kiick]] started out the drive with two carries for eleven yards. Then quarterback [[Bob Griese]] completed an 18-yard pass to wide receiver [[Paul Warfield]] to reach the Washington 34-yard line. After two more running plays, on third and four Griese threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to receiver [[Howard Twilley]] for his only catch of the game. Twilley fooled [[Pat Fischer]] by faking a route to the inside, then broke to the outside and caught the ball at the five-yard line, dragging Fischer into the end zone. \"Griese read us real good all day\", said Fischer.<ref name=Strother/> Yepremian's extra point gave the Dolphins a 7\u20130 lead with one second remaining in the period. (Yepremian noticed that the kick was too low, just like his practice kicks).<ref name=\"Dave Hyde p264\"/>\n\n===Second Quarter===\nOn the third play of the Redskins' ensuing drive, Scott intercepted quarterback [[Billy Kilmer]]'s pass down the middle intended for Taylor and returned it eight yards to the Washington 47-yard line. However a 15-yard illegal man downfield penalty on left guard [[Bob Kuechenberg]] nullified a 20-yard pass completion to tight end [[Marv Fleming]] on the first play after the turnover, and the Dolphins were forced to punt after three more plays.\n\nAfter the Redskins were forced to punt again, Miami reached the 47-yard line with a 13-yard run by [[Larry Csonka]] and an 8-yard run by Kiick. But on the next play, Griese's 47-yard touchdown pass to Warfield was nullified by an illegal procedure penalty on receiver [[Marlin Briscoe]] (Briscoe's first, and only, play of the game). On third down, Redskins defensive tackle [[Diron Talbert]] sacked Griese for a 6-yard loss and the Dolphins had to punt.\n\nThe Redskins then advanced from their own 17-yard line to the Miami 48-yard line (their first incursion into Miami territory) with less than two minutes left in the half. But on third down and three yards to go, Dolphins linebacker [[Nick Buoniconti]] intercepted Kilmer's pass to tight end Jerry Smith at the Miami 41-yard line and returned it 32 yards to the Washington 27-yard line. From there, Kiick and Csonka each ran once for three yards, and then Griese completed a 19-yard pass (his sixth completion in six attempts) to tight end [[Jim Mandich]], who made a diving catch at the 2-yard line. Two plays later, Kiick scored on a 1-yard blast behind Little and Csonka with just 18 seconds left in the half, and Yepremian's extra point gave the Dolphins a lead of 14\u20130 before halftime (once again, Yepremian noticed the kick was too low).\n\nMiami's defense dominated the Redskins in the first half, limiting Washington to 49 yards rushing, 23 yards passing, and four first downs.\n\n===Third Quarter===\nThe Redskins had more success moving the ball in the second half. They took the second half kickoff and advanced across midfield for only the second time in the game, driving from their own 30-yard line to Miami's 17-yard line in a seven-play drive that featured just two runs. On first down at Miami's 17-yard line, Kilmer threw to wide receiver [[Charley Taylor]], who was open at the 2-yard line, but Taylor stumbled right before the ball arrived and the ball glanced off his fingertips. After a second-down screen pass to Harraway fell incomplete, defensive tackle [[Manny Fernandez (American football)|Manny Fernandez]] sacked Kilmer on third down for a loss of eight yards, and Washington's drive ended with no points after kicker [[Curt Knight]]'s ensuing 32-yard field goal attempt was wide right. \"That was an obvious turning point\", said Allen.<ref name=Strother/> Later in the period, the Dolphins drove 78 yards to Washington's 5-yard line, featuring a 49-yard run by Csonka, the second-longest run in Super Bowl history at the time. However, Redskins defensive back [[Brig Owens]] intercepted a pass intended for Fleming in the end zone for a touchback.\n\n===Fourth Quarter===\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Washington threatened to score by mounting its most impressive drive of the game, driving 79 yards from its own 11 to Miami's 10-yard line in twelve plays. On second down at the Miami 10-yard line, Kilmer threw to tight end [[Jerry Smith (American football)|Jerry Smith]] in the end zone. Smith was wide open, but the ball hit the crossbar of the goalpost and fell incomplete. Then on third down, Scott intercepted Kilmer's pass to Taylor in the end zone and returned it 55 yards to the Redskins 48-yard line.\n\nMiami moved the ball to the 34-yard line on their ensuing drive. Leading 14\u20130 on 4th down with 4 yards to go, Shula could have tried for [[Fourth down conversion#F|a conversion]], but thought \"What a hell of a way to remember this game\" if they could end a perfect 17\u20130 season with a 17\u20130 Super Bowl final score.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> He called on kicker [[Garo Yepremian]] to attempt a 42-yard field goal in what is now remembered as one of the most famous blunders in NFL lore: \"Garo's Gaffe\". As had been the case all day, Yepremian's kick was too low, and it was blocked by Washington defensive tackle [[Bill Brundige]]. The ball bounced to Yepremian's right and he reached it before holder Earl Morrall. But instead of falling on the ball, Yepremian picked it up and, with Brundige bearing down on him, made a frantic attempt to pass the ball to Csonka,<ref>Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick, with Dave Anderson, ''Always on the Run'', p. 218. Random House, 1973 {{OCLC|632348}}</ref> who blocked on field goals. Unfortunately for Miami, the ball slipped out of his hands and went straight up in the air. Yepremian attempted to bat the ball out of bounds,<ref name=\"Dave Hyde p264\"/> but instead batted it back up into the air, and it went right into the arms of Redskins cornerback [[Mike Bass]], who returned the fumble 49 yards for a touchdown, the first fumble recovery returned for a touchdown in Super Bowl history, to make the score 14\u20137 with 2:07 left in the game.\n\nTo the surprise of some, the Redskins did not try an onside kick, but instead kicked deep. The Redskins were forced to use up all of their timeouts on the Dolphins' ensuing five-play possession, but forced Miami to punt (nearly blocking the punt) from its own 36-yard line with 1:14 remaining in the game, giving themselves a chance to drive for the tying touchdown. However, Miami's defense forced two incompletions and a 4-yard loss on a swing pass, and then defensive end [[Vern Den Herder]]'s 9-yard sack on fourth down as time expired in the game.\n\nGriese finished the game having completed 8 out of 11 passes for 88 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Csonka was the game's leading rusher with 15 carries for 112 yards. Kiick had 38 rushing yards, two receptions for six yards, and a touchdown. Morris had 34 rushing yards. Manny Fernandez had 11 solo tackles and six assists. Kilmer completed six more passes than Griese, but finished the game with just 16 more total passing yards and was intercepted three times. Said Kilmer, \"I wasn't sharp at all. Good as their defense is, I still should have thrown better.\"<ref name=Strother/> Washington's Larry Brown rushed for 72 yards on 22 carries and also had five receptions for 26 yards.

Wrote Nick Buoniconti, \"It was the game of his life\u2013in fact, it was the most dominant game by a defensive lineman in the history of the game, and he would never be given much credit for it. They should have given out two game balls and made Manny Fernandez the co-MVP with Jake Scott.\"<ref name=Buoniconti/> Larry Csonka also said he thought Fernandez should have been the MVP.<ref>Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick, with Dave Anderson, ''Always on the Run'', p. 220.</ref> The MVP was selected by [[Dick Schaap]], the editor of ''[[Sport (US magazine)|SPORT]]'' magazine. Schaap admitted later that he had been out late the previous night, struggled to watch the defense-dominated game, and was not aware that Fernandez had 17 tackles.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', pp. 260\u2013261.</ref>\n\nWhen Garo Yepremian went back to the Dolphins' sideline after his botched field goal attempt, Nick Buoniconti told him that if they lost he would \"Hang you up by one of your ties.\"<ref name=\"Dave Hyde p264\"/> Yepremian would joke to reporters after the game, \"This is the first time the goat of the game is in the winner's locker room.\"<ref name=\"B\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=tfSmAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=Yepremian+coin+toss#v=onepage&q=Yepremian%20coin%20toss&f=false | title=Placekicking in the NFL: A History and Analysis | publisher=McFarland | author=Gonsalves, Rick | year=2013 | pages=157\u2013160| isbn=9781476600512 }}</ref> But Yepremian would be so traumatized by his botched attempt that he had to be helped from the post-game party by his brother because of a stress-induced stabbing pain down his right side. Depressed, he spent two weeks in seclusion until he was cheered up by a letter, apparently from Shula, praising him for his contributions to the team and urging him to ignore criticism. Yepremian kept the letter and mentioned it to Shula in 2000, but Shula had no knowledge of it. They concluded the letter was actually written by Shula's wife Dorothy, who died from [[breast cancer]] in 1991. She had signed her husband's name to it.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'' p.283.</ref> Nevertheless, \"Garo's Gaffe\" made Yepremian famous and led to a lucrative windfall of speaking engagements and endorsements. \"It's been a blessing\", said Yepremian, who passed away in 2015.<ref name=\"Dave Hyde p.268\"/>\n\nThe same teams met 10 years later in [[Super Bowl XVII]], which was also played in the Los Angeles area, at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. The Redskins won that game, 27\u201317. Two starters from Miami's undefeated team, guard Bob Kuechenberg and defensive end Vern Den Herder, were still active during the strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]]. The Redskins had no players remaining from Super Bowl VII on their Super Bowl XVII roster. The last member of the 1972 Redskins still active with the franchise, offensive tackle Terry Hermeling, retired after the 1980 season.\n\nRedskins linebacker and defensive captain Jack Pardee retired immediately following this game, ending a 16-year career. He coached the [[Chicago Bears]] for three seasons (1975\u201377) before succeeding Allen as Redskins coach in 1978. Pardee was fired following a 6\u201310 campaign in 1980 and was replaced by [[Joe Gibbs]], who led the Redskins to three Super Bowl championships ([[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]], [[Super Bowl XXII|XXII]], [[Super Bowl XXVI|XXVI]]) and 171 victories to earn induction into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]. After coaching the [[Houston Gamblers]] of the [[United States Football League]] in 1984 and '85, Pardee coached at the [[Houston Cougars football|University of Houston]] (1987\u201389) and the [[Houston Oilers]] (1990\u201394). \n\nThe Miami Dolphins became the second team to win the Super Bowl after losing it the previous year.

(AFC) champion [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) champion [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] to decide the [[National Football League]] (NFL) champion for the [[1972 NFL season|1972 season]]. The Dolphins defeated the Redskins by the score of 14\u20137, and became the first and still the only team in NFL history to complete a [[Perfect season|perfect undefeated season]]. They also remain the only Super Bowl champion to win despite having been shut out in the second half of the game. The game was played on January 14, 1973 at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] in Los Angeles, the second time the Super Bowl was played in that city. At kickoff, the temperature was {{convert|84|F}}, making the game the warmest Super Bowl.<ref name=\"Warmest SB ever\">{{cite web|title=Super Bowl Game-Time Temperatures|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/super-bowl-game-time-temperatures/|website=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|date=2017|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThis was the Dolphins' second Super Bowl appearance; they had lost [[Super Bowl VI]] to Dallas the previous year. The Dolphins posted an undefeated 14\u20130 regular season record before defeating the [[1972 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] and [[1972 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the playoffs. The Redskins were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting an 11\u20133 regular-season record and playoff victories over the [[1972 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] and [[1972 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. Despite being undefeated, the Dolphins were actually one-point underdogs,<ref name=linesmakers/> largely based on the weakness of their regular-season schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/football/teams/greatest.html|title=Greatest NFL teams of all time|publisher=ESPN.com}}. \"[T]he Dolphins played one of the easiest schedules in modern NFL history \u2013 the opposition had a combined winning percentage under .400\"</ref>\n\nSuper Bowl VII was largely dominated by the Dolphins, and is the second-lowest-scoring Super Bowl to date with a total of only 21 points (three touchdowns and three extra points), second only to the 13\u20133 score of [[Super Bowl LIII]]. The only real drama occurred during the final minutes of the game, in what was later known as \"Garo's Gaffe\".<ref>{{cite news | title=SUPER BOWL XXV; Garo's Gaffe, McGee's Hangover And More: The First 24 Years | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/27/sports/super-bowl-xxv-garo-s-gaffe-mcgee-s-hangover-and-more-the-first-24-years.html | newspaper=The New York Times | first=Gerald | last=Eskenazi | date=January 27, 1991 | accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref> Miami attempted to cap their 17\u20130 perfect season with a 17\u20130 shutout by means of a 42-yard field goal by [[Garo Yepremian]],<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4oLr-bJ8Ws&t=1m50s|title=Preparation is Key with 1972 Miami Dolphins' Coach Don Shula|first=|last=mouthpiecesports1|date=July 31, 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> but instead the game and the season was jeopardized when his kick was blocked. Instead of falling on the loose ball, the Dolphins kicker picked it up, attempted a forward pass, but batted it in the air, and Redskins cornerback [[Mike Bass]] (who was Garo's former teammate on the [[Detroit Lions]] years earlier) caught it and returned it 49 yards for a touchdown. This remains the longest period in a Super Bowl for one team to be shut out, as Washington was held scoreless until 2:07 remained in the fourth quarter.<ref group=\"note\">The previous Super Bowl with the longest period for being shut out was [[Super Bowl III|in 1969]], where the Jets held the Colts scoreless until 3:19 left in the game. Don Shula was head coach on the losing side that time, so he held the record for the longest period to be held under a shut out as well as the longest period to hold a shut out.</ref> Because of the turnover and score, what was a Miami-dominated game became close, and the Dolphins had to stop Washington's final drive for the tying touchdown as time expired. \n\nDolphins [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] [[Jake Scott]] was named [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player]]. He recorded two interceptions for 63 return yards, including a 55-yard return from the end zone during the fourth quarter. Scott became the second defensive player in Super Bowl history (after [[linebacker]] [[Chuck Howley]] in [[Super Bowl V]]) to earn a Super Bowl MVP award.\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 33 - Jim Kiick (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Jim Kiick]] (''center right'') rushing the ball for Miami in Super Bowl VII.]]\n\n==Background==\nThe NFL awarded Super Bowl VII to Los Angeles on March 21, 1972.\n\n===Miami Dolphins===\n{{main article|1972 Miami Dolphins season}}\n\nThe Dolphins went undefeated during the season, despite losing their starting quarterback. In the fifth game of the regular season, starter [[Bob Griese]] suffered a fractured right leg and dislocated ankle. In his place, 38-year-old [[Earl Morrall]], a 17-year veteran, led Miami to victory in their nine remaining regular-season games, and was the 1972 [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]]. Morrall had previously played for Dolphins head coach [[Don Shula]] when they were both with the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]], where Morrall backed up quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]] and started in [[Super Bowl III]].\n\nBut Miami also had the same core group of young players who had helped the team advance to the previous year's [[Super Bowl VI]]. (The only Dolphins starter in Super Bowl VII over the age of 30 was 32-year-old [[Nick Buoniconti]].) The Dolphins still had a powerful running attack, spearheaded by running backs [[Larry Csonka]], [[Jim Kiick]] and [[Mercury Morris|Eugene \"Mercury\" Morris]]. (Morris, who in previous seasons had been used primarily as a kick returner, took over the starting halfback position from Kiick, who had been the starter the previous four years. However, the more-experienced Kiick would start in Super Bowl VII.) Csonka led the team with 1,117 yards and six touchdowns. Kiick contributed 521 yards and five touchdowns, and also caught 21 passes for 147 yards and another touchdown. Morris, a breakaway runner, rushed for 1,000 yards, caught 15 passes for 168 yards, added another 334 yards returning kickoffs, and scored a league-leading 12 rushing touchdowns. Overall, Miami set a record with 2,960 total rushing yards during the regular season, and became the first team ever to have two players rush for 1,000 yards in one season. Miami led the NFL in points scored (385).\n\nReceiver [[Paul Warfield]] once again provided the run-based Dolphins with an effective deep-threat option, catching 29 passes for 606 yards, an average of 20.9 yards per catch. Miami's offensive line, led by future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Jim Langer]] and [[Larry Little]], was also a key factor in the Dolphins' offensive production. Miami's \"No-Name Defense\" (a nickname inspired by [[Dallas Cowboys]] head coach [[Tom Landry]] when he could not recall the names of any Dolphins defenders just before Super Bowl VI), led by future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] linebacker [[Nick Buoniconti]], allowed the fewest points in the league during the regular season (171), and ranked second in the NFL with 26 interceptions. Safety [[Jake Scott]] recorded five interceptions, while [[Lloyd Mumphord]] had four picks and safety [[Dick Anderson]] had three interceptions and led the NFL with five fumble recoveries. Because of injuries to defensive linemen (at the beginning of the season the Dolphins were down to four healthy players at the position), defensive coordinator [[Bill Arnsparger]] created what he called the \"53\" defense, in which the versatile [[Bob Matheson]] (number 53) would be used as either a defensive end in the standard [[American football strategy|4\u20133 defense]] or as a fourth linebacker in a [[American football strategy|3\u20134 defense]], with [[Manny Fernandez (American football)|Manny Fernandez]] at [[nose tackle]]. As a linebacker, Matheson would either rush or drop back into coverage. Said Nick Buoniconti, \"Teams would be totally confused.\"<ref name=Buoniconti>Nick Buoniconti, \"Super Bowl VII\", ''Super Bowl: The Game of Their Lives'', Danny Peary, editor. Macmillan, 1997. {{ISBN|0-02-860841-0}}</ref> Linebacker [[Doug Swift]] was also a playmaker with three interceptions and a fumble recovery.\n\nThe Dolphins' undefeated, untied regular season was the third in NFL history, and the first of the post-[[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] era. The previous two teams to do so, the 1934 and 1942 [[Chicago Bears]], both lost the NFL Championship game. The [[Cleveland Browns]] also completed a perfect season in 1948, including a league championship, while part of the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), but this feat is only recognized by the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] (the NFL does not officially recognize any AAFC records).\n\n===Washington Redskins===\n{{Main article|1972 Washington Redskins season}}\n\nFollowing the death of Redskins head coach [[Vince Lombardi]] 17 days prior to the start of the 1970 season, Washington finished 6\u20138 under interim coach [[Bill Austin (American football, born 1928)|Bill Austin]]. Shortly after the conclusion of the 1970 season, the Redskins hired [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] as their head coach, hoping he could turn the team's fortunes around. Allen's philosophy was that veteran players win games, so immediately after taking over the team, he traded away most of the younger team members and draft choices for older, more established players. His motto was \"The future is now.\" Washington quickly became the oldest team in the NFL and earned the nickname \"The Over-the-Hill Gang.\" The average age of starters was 31 years old.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect! The Untold Story of the 1972 Miami Dolphins'', p. 239. Dolphins/Curtis Publishing, 2002 {{ISBN|0-9702677-1-1}}</ref> However, Allen's strategy turned the Redskins around, as the team improved to a 9\u20134\u20131 record in 1971, and finished the 1972 season with an NFC-best 11\u20133 record.\n\nWashington was led by 33-year-old quarterback [[Billy Kilmer]], who completed 120 out of 225 passes for 1,648 yards and a league-leading 19 touchdowns during the regular season, with only 11 interceptions, giving him an NFL-best 84.8 [[passer rating]]. Kilmer had started the first three games of the season, was replaced in Game 4 by 38-year-old [[Sonny Jurgensen]], then replaced Jurgensen when he was lost for the season with an [[Achilles tendon]] injury. The Redskins' powerful rushing attack featured two backs. [[Larry Brown (running back)|Larry Brown]] gained 1,216 yards (first in the NFC and second in the NFL) on 285 carries during the regular season, caught 32 passes for 473 yards and scored 12 touchdowns, earning him both the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]] and the [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award]]. [[Charley Harraway]] ran for 567 yards on 148 carries. Future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] wide receiver [[Charley Taylor]] and wide receiver [[Roy Jefferson]] provided the team with a solid deep threat, combining for 84 receptions, 1,223 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns. Veteran tight end [[Jerry Smith (American football)|Jerry Smith]] added 21 receptions for 353 yards and 7 touchdowns.\n\nWashington also had a solid defense led by linebacker [[Chris Hanburger]] (four interceptions, 98 return yards, one touchdown) and cornerbacks [[Pat Fischer]] (four interceptions, 61 return yards) and [[Mike Bass]] (three interceptions, 53 return yards)\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{Details|1972\u201373 NFL playoffs}}\nMorrall led the Dolphins to a 20\u201314 playoff win over the [[Cleveland Browns]]. However, Griese started the second half of the AFC Championship Game to help rally the Dolphins to a 21\u201317 victory over the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. A fake punt by Miami's [[Larry Seiple]] made the difference.\n\nMeanwhile, the Redskins advanced to the Super Bowl without having allowed a touchdown in either their 16\u20133 playoff win over the [[Green Bay Packers]] or their 26\u20133 NFC Championship Game victory over the Cowboys.\n\n===Super Bowl pregame news and notes===\nMuch of the pregame hype surrounded the chances of the Dolphins completing a perfect, undefeated season, as well as their quarterback controversy between Griese and Morrall. Griese was eventually picked to start the Super Bowl because Shula felt more comfortable with Morrall as the backup just in case Griese was ineffective following his recent inactivity. Miami was also strongly motivated to win the Super Bowl after having been humiliated by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in [[Super Bowl VI]]. Wrote Nick Buoniconti, \"There was no way we were going to lose the Super Bowl; there was no way.\"<ref name=Buoniconti/> Head coach Don Shula, loser of Super Bowls [[Super Bowl III|III]] and [[Super Bowl VI|VI]], was also determined to win. Although Shula was relaxed and charming when dealing with the press, it was all an act; Dolphins players described him as \"neurotic\" and \"absolutely crazy.\" He was also sick during Super Bowl week with the flu, which he kept secret.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', p. 248.</ref>\n\nStill, many favored the Redskins to win the game because of their group of \"Over the Hill Gang\" veterans, and because Miami had what some considered an easy schedule (only two opponents, [[Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City]] and the [[New York Giants]], posted winning records, and both of those teams were 8\u20136) and had struggled in the playoffs. Also, while Washington had easily crushed both playoff opponents, Miami had narrowly defeated theirs. Most surprisingly, the Dolphins needed to mount a fourth-quarter comeback against the Browns, whom they were heavily favored to defeat.\n\nAllen had a reputation for spying on opponents. A school overlooked the Rams facility that the NFL designated as the Dolphins practice field, so the Dolphins found a more secure field at a local community college. Dolphins employees inspected the trees every day for spies.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', p. 239.</ref>\n\nMiami cornerback [[Tim Foley]], a future broadcaster who was injured and would not play in Super Bowl VII, was writing daily stories for a Miami newspaper and interviewed George Allen and his players, provoking charges from Allen that Foley was actually spying for Shula.<ref name=Strother>Shelby Strother, \"The Perfect Season\", ''NFL Top 40''. Viking, 1988. {{ISBN|0-670-82490-9}}</ref>\n\nAllen was extremely uptight and prickly dealing with the press Super Bowl week, and accused the press of ruining his team's preparation. Allen pushed the team so hard in practices that the players joked among themselves that they should have left Allen in Washington.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', p. 247.</ref>\n\nDuring practice the day before Super Bowl VII, the Dolphins' 5'7\" 150-pound kicker, [[Garo Yepremian]], relaxed by throwing 30-yard passes to [[Dave Shula]], Don Shula's son. During the pregame warmups, he consistently kicked low line drives and couldn't figure out why.<ref name=\"Dave Hyde p264\">Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', p. 264.</ref>\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl in which neither coach wore a tie. Shula wore a coat and tie for Super Bowl VI, but wore a white short-sleeved polo shirt for this game, as did Allen. For [[Super Bowl VIII]], Shula would wear a sportcoat, but with a shirt underneath that was similar to the one he wore in Super Bowl VII.\n\n==Broadcasting==\nThe game was broadcast in the United States by [[NBC]] with [[Play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[color commentator]] [[Al DeRogatis]].\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl to be televised live in the city in which it was being played. Despite unconditional [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules in the NFL that normally would have prohibited the live telecast from being shown locally, the NFL allowed the game to be telecast in the Los Angeles area on an experimental basis when all tickets for the game were sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1971-1980|title=NFL History by Decade|website=www.nfl.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1973/1973-01-01-BC.pdf | title=NFL won't play ball; Nixon may blow whistle | work=[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]] | date=January 1, 1973 | page=33 | accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref> The league then changed its blackout rules the following season to allow any game sold out at least 72 hours in advance to be televised in the host market.<ref>{{cite book | title=America's Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation | first=Michael | last=MacCambridge | author-link=Michael MacCambridge | year=2005 | page=301 | publisher=Anchor Books | isbn=978-0-375-72506-7}}</ref> No subsequent Super Bowl has ever been blacked out under this rule, as all have been sold out (owing to its status as the marquee event on the NFL schedule, meaning that tickets sell out quickly).\n\nThis game is featured on ''[[NFL's Greatest Games]]'' under the title \"17\u20130\".\n\n==Entertainment==\nThe pregame show was a tribute to [[Apollo 17]], the sixth and last mission to land on the [[Moon]] and the final one of [[Project Apollo]]. The show featured the [[Michigan Marching Band]] and the crew of Apollo 17 who exactly [[Apollo 17#Return to Earth|one month earlier]] had been the final humans to date to leave the Moon.\n\nLater, the Little Angels of Chicago's Angels Church from [[Chicago]] performed the national anthem.\n\nThe halftime show, featuring [[Woody Herman]] and the [[Michigan Marching Band]] along with The [[Citrus College]] Singers and [[Andy Williams]], was titled \"Happiness Is\".\n\n==Game summary==\nAccording to Shula, the Dolphins' priority on defense was to stop Larry Brown and force Billy Kilmer to pass. Buoniconti looked at Washington's offensive formation on each play and shifted the defense so it was strongest where he felt Brown would run.<ref name=Buoniconti/> This strategy proved successful. Washington's offensive line also had trouble handling Dolphins' defensive tackle/nose tackle [[Manny Fernandez (American football)|Manny Fernandez]], who was very quick. \"He beat their center [[Len Hauss]] like a drum\", wrote Buoniconti. Miami's defenders had also drilled in maintaining precise pursuit angles on sweeps to prevent the cut-back running that [[Duane Thomas]] had used to destroy the Dolphins in [[Super Bowl VI]].\n\nWashington's priority on defense was to disrupt Miami's ball-control offense by stopping Larry Csonka.<ref>Shelby Strother, \"Playing to Perfection\", ''The Super Bowl: Celebrating a Quarter-Century of America's Greatest Game''. Simon and Schuster, 1990 {{ISBN|0-671-72798-2}}</ref> They also intended to shut down Paul Warfield by [[double coverage|double-covering]] him.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', p. 256.</ref>\n\nWith a game-time kickoff temperature of {{convert|84|F}}, this is the warmest Super Bowl to date. It came the year after the coldest game in [[Super Bowl VI]] which registered a temperature at kickoff of {{convert|39|F}}.<ref name=\"Warmest SB ever\" />\n\n===First Quarter===\nAs they had in Super Bowl VI, Miami won the toss and elected to receive. Most of the first quarter was a defensive battle with each team punting on their first two possessions. The Dolphins would, however, get two key breaks. [[Howard Kindig]] appeared to mishandle the snap on their first punt from the Miami 27 and lose the ball to the Redskins' [[Harold McLinton]], but McLinton was called for slapping at the ball while it was being snapped, for a 5-yard penalty. On the replay of the down, [[Larry Seiple]] got the kick away safely. Later, after stopping Washington for the second time, safety [[Jake Scott]] did not call for a fair catch, as he had not been told to do so by [[Dick Anderson]]. He fumbled, but fortunately Anderson made the recovery.<ref name=\"Dolphs Upset Skins for 17-0 Record\">{{cite web | title=Dolphins Do It, Upset Skins for 17\u20130 Record | url=https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/super-bowl-vii-dolphs-upset-skins-17-0-record-article-1.1553595 | first=Larry | last=Fox | date=January 15, 1973 | work=[[New York Daily News|Daily News]] | location=New York | accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref> Miami then started this drive on its own 37-yard line with 2:55 left in the first quarter. Running back [[Jim Kiick]] started out the drive with two carries for eleven yards. Then quarterback [[Bob Griese]] completed an 18-yard pass to wide receiver [[Paul Warfield]] to reach the Washington 34-yard line. After two more running plays, on third and four Griese threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to receiver [[Howard Twilley]] for his only catch of the game. Twilley fooled [[Pat Fischer]] by faking a route to the inside, then broke to the outside and caught the ball at the five-yard line, dragging Fischer into the end zone. \"Griese read us real good all day\", said Fischer.<ref name=Strother/> Yepremian's extra point gave the Dolphins a 7\u20130 lead with one second remaining in the period. (Yepremian noticed that the kick was too low, just like his practice kicks).<ref name=\"Dave Hyde p264\"/>\n\n===Second Quarter===\nOn the third play of the Redskins' ensuing drive, Scott intercepted quarterback [[Billy Kilmer]]'s pass down the middle intended for Taylor and returned it eight yards to the Washington 47-yard line. However a 15-yard illegal man downfield penalty on left guard [[Bob Kuechenberg]] nullified a 20-yard pass completion to tight end [[Marv Fleming]] on the first play after the turnover, and the Dolphins were forced to punt after three more plays.\n\nAfter the Redskins were forced to punt again, Miami reached the 47-yard line with a 13-yard run by [[Larry Csonka]] and an 8-yard run by Kiick. But on the next play, Griese's 47-yard touchdown pass to Warfield was nullified by an illegal procedure penalty on receiver [[Marlin Briscoe]] (Briscoe's first, and only, play of the game). On third down, Redskins defensive tackle [[Diron Talbert]] sacked Griese for a 6-yard loss and the Dolphins had to punt.\n\nThe Redskins then advanced from their own 17-yard line to the Miami 48-yard line (their first incursion into Miami territory) with less than two minutes left in the half. But on third down and three yards to go, Dolphins linebacker [[Nick Buoniconti]] intercepted Kilmer's pass to tight end Jerry Smith at the Miami 41-yard line and returned it 32 yards to the Washington 27-yard line. From there, Kiick and Csonka each ran once for three yards, and then Griese completed a 19-yard pass (his sixth completion in six attempts) to tight end [[Jim Mandich]], who made a diving catch at the 2-yard line. Two plays later, Kiick scored on a 1-yard blast behind Little and Csonka with just 18 seconds left in the half, and Yepremian's extra point gave the Dolphins a lead of 14\u20130 before halftime (once again, Yepremian noticed the kick was too low).\n\nMiami's defense dominated the Redskins in the first half, limiting Washington to 49 yards rushing, 23 yards passing, and four first downs.\n\n===Third Quarter===\nThe Redskins had more success moving the ball in the second half. They took the second half kickoff and advanced across midfield for only the second time in the game, driving from their own 30-yard line to Miami's 17-yard line in a seven-play drive that featured just two runs. On first down at Miami's 17-yard line, Kilmer threw to wide receiver [[Charley Taylor]], who was open at the 2-yard line, but Taylor stumbled right before the ball arrived and the ball glanced off his fingertips. After a second-down screen pass to Harraway fell incomplete, defensive tackle [[Manny Fernandez (American football)|Manny Fernandez]] sacked Kilmer on third down for a loss of eight yards, and Washington's drive ended with no points after kicker [[Curt Knight]]'s ensuing 32-yard field goal attempt was wide right. \"That was an obvious turning point\", said Allen.<ref name=Strother/> Later in the period, the Dolphins drove 78 yards to Washington's 5-yard line, featuring a 49-yard run by Csonka, the second-longest run in Super Bowl history at the time. However, Redskins defensive back [[Brig Owens]] intercepted a pass intended for Fleming in the end zone for a touchback.\n\n===Fourth Quarter===\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Washington threatened to score by mounting its most impressive drive of the game, driving 79 yards from its own 11 to Miami's 10-yard line in twelve plays. On second down at the Miami 10-yard line, Kilmer threw to tight end [[Jerry Smith (American football)|Jerry Smith]] in the end zone. Smith was wide open, but the ball hit the crossbar of the goalpost and fell incomplete. Then on third down, Scott intercepted Kilmer's pass to Taylor in the end zone and returned it 55 yards to the Redskins 48-yard line.\n\nMiami moved the ball to the 34-yard line on their ensuing drive. Leading 14\u20130 on 4th down with 4 yards to go, Shula could have tried for [[Fourth down conversion#F|a conversion]], but thought \"What a hell of a way to remember this game\" if they could end a perfect 17\u20130 season with a 17\u20130 Super Bowl final score.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> He called on kicker [[Garo Yepremian]] to attempt a 42-yard field goal in what is now remembered as one of the most famous blunders in NFL lore: \"Garo's Gaffe\". As had been the case all day, Yepremian's kick was too low, and it was blocked by Washington defensive tackle [[Bill Brundige]]. The ball bounced to Yepremian's right and he reached it before holder Earl Morrall. But instead of falling on the ball, Yepremian picked it up and, with Brundige bearing down on him, made a frantic attempt to pass the ball to Csonka,<ref>Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick, with Dave Anderson, ''Always on the Run'', p. 218. Random House, 1973 {{OCLC|632348}}</ref> who blocked on field goals. Unfortunately for Miami, the ball slipped out of his hands and went straight up in the air. Yepremian attempted to bat the ball out of bounds,<ref name=\"Dave Hyde p264\"/> but instead batted it back up into the air, and it went right into the arms of Redskins cornerback [[Mike Bass]], who returned the fumble 49 yards for a touchdown, the first fumble recovery returned for a touchdown in Super Bowl history, to make the score 14\u20137 with 2:07 left in the game.\n\nTo the surprise of some, the Redskins did not try an onside kick, but instead kicked deep. The Redskins were forced to use up all of their timeouts on the Dolphins' ensuing five-play possession, but forced Miami to punt (nearly blocking the punt) from its own 36-yard line with 1:14 remaining in the game, giving themselves a chance to drive for the tying touchdown. However, Miami's defense forced two incompletions and a 4-yard loss on a swing pass, and then defensive end [[Vern Den Herder]]'s 9-yard sack on fourth down as time expired in the game.\n\nGriese finished the game having completed 8 out of 11 passes for 88 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. Csonka was the game's leading rusher with 15 carries for 112 yards. Kiick had 38 rushing yards, two receptions for six yards, and a touchdown. Morris had 34 rushing yards. Manny Fernandez had 11 solo tackles and six assists. Kilmer completed six more passes than Griese, but finished the game with just 16 more total passing yards and was intercepted three times. Said Kilmer, \"I wasn't sharp at all. Good as their defense is, I still should have thrown better.\"<ref name=Strother/> Washington's Larry Brown rushed for 72 yards on 22 carries and also had five receptions for 26 yards. Redskins receiver [[Roy Jefferson]] was the top receiver of the game, with five catches for 50 yards. Washington amassed almost as many total yards (228) as Miami (253), and actually more first downs (16 to Miami's 12).\n\n===Delayed White House visit===\nThe Dolphins never made the traditional post-game visit to the [[White House]] due to the [[Watergate scandal]], but in August 2013 finally made the trip at the behest of [[Barack Obama]], minus [[Manny Fernandez (American football)|Manny Fernandez]], [[Jim Langer]], and [[Bob Kuechenberg]], who did not attend due to their opposition to the Obama administration.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2013/08/20/president-obama-white-house-welcome-1972-miami-dolphins/ | title=1972 Miami Dolphins visit President Obama, White House | first=Cindy | last=Boren | date=August 20, 2013 | work=[[The Washington Post]] | accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref> [[Garo Yepremian]] was a longtime Republican supporter and friend of former Florida Governor [[Jeb Bush]] but made the trip anyway and had an amusing exchange with President Obama over his long-ago bumble in the game.\n\n===Box score===\n{{Americanfootballbox\n| bg = #eee\n| titlestyle = text-align:center; background-color:#000; color:#fff\n| title = Super Bowl VII: Miami Dolphins 14, Washington Redskins 7\n| Road = '''Dolphins (AFC)'''\n| R1 = 7\n| R2 = 7\n| R3 = 0\n| R4 = 0\n| Home = Redskins (NFC)\n| H1 = 0\n| H2 = 0\n| H3 = 0\n| H4 = 7\n| stadium = [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]\n| date = January 14, 1973\n| time = 12:49 p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]\n| weather = {{convert|84|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, sunny, hazy<ref>{{cite news|title=Super Bowl Game-Time Temperatures|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/news/super-bowl-game-time-temperatures/|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart | VisitorName=MIA | HomeName=WAS | state=expanded}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry | Quarter=1 | Time=0:01 | Team=MIA | DrivePlays=6 | DriveLength=63 | DriveTime=2:54 | Type=RecTD | Receiver=[[Howard Twilley]] | QB=[[Bob Griese]] | yards=28 | kickresult=good | Kicker=[[Garo Yepremian]] | Visitor=7 | Home=0}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry | Quarter=2 | Time=0:18 | Team=MIA | DrivePlays=5 | DriveLength=27 | DriveTime=1:33 | Type=RushTD | Runner=[[Jim Kiick]] | yards=1 | kickresult=good | Kicker=Yepremian | Visitor=14 | Home=0}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry | Quarter=4 | Time=2:07 | Team=WAS | DriveLength=\u2014 | DriveTime=\u2014 | Type=FumbleTD\n | Def=[[Mike Bass]] | yards=49 | kickresult=good | Kicker=[[Curt Knight]] | Visitor=14 | Home=7}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEnd|Visitor=14|Home=7}}\n\n==Final statistics==\nSources:''The NFL's Official Encyclopedic History of Professional Football'', (1973), p.&nbsp;153, Macmillan Publishing Co.

Back Judge and Field Judge swapped titles prior to the [[1998 NFL season|1998]].''\n\n==Super Bowl postgame news==\nAs Shula was being carried off the field after the end of the game, a kid who shook his hand stripped off his watch. Shula got down, chased after the kid, and retrieved his watch.<ref name=\"Dave Hyde p.268\">Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'' p. 268.</ref>\n\n[[Manny Fernandez (American football)|Manny Fernandez]] was a strong contender for MVP. Wrote Nick Buoniconti, \"It was the game of his life\u2013in fact, it was the most dominant game by a defensive lineman in the history of the game, and he would never be given much credit for it. They should have given out two game balls and made Manny Fernandez the co-MVP with Jake Scott.\"<ref name=Buoniconti/> Larry Csonka also said he thought Fernandez should have been the MVP.<ref>Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick, with Dave Anderson, ''Always on the Run'', p. 220.</ref> The MVP was selected by [[Dick Schaap]], the editor of ''[[Sport (US magazine)|SPORT]]'' magazine. Schaap admitted later that he had been out late the previous night, struggled to watch the defense-dominated game, and was not aware that Fernandez had 17 tackles.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'', pp. 260\u2013261.</ref>\n\nWhen Garo Yepremian went back to the Dolphins' sideline after his botched field goal attempt, Nick Buoniconti told him that if they lost he would \"Hang you up by one of your ties.\"<ref name=\"Dave Hyde p264\"/> Yepremian would joke to reporters after the game, \"This is the first time the goat of the game is in the winner's locker room.\"<ref name=\"B\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=tfSmAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=Yepremian+coin+toss#v=onepage&q=Yepremian%20coin%20toss&f=false | title=Placekicking in the NFL: A History and Analysis | publisher=McFarland | author=Gonsalves, Rick | year=2013 | pages=157\u2013160| isbn=9781476600512 }}</ref> But Yepremian would be so traumatized by his botched attempt that he had to be helped from the post-game party by his brother because of a stress-induced stabbing pain down his right side. Depressed, he spent two weeks in seclusion until he was cheered up by a letter, apparently from Shula, praising him for his contributions to the team and urging him to ignore criticism. Yepremian kept the letter and mentioned it to Shula in 2000, but Shula had no knowledge of it. They concluded the letter was actually written by Shula's wife Dorothy, who died from [[breast cancer]] in 1991. She had signed her husband's name to it.<ref>Dave Hyde, ''Still Perfect!'' p.283.</ref> Nevertheless, \"Garo's Gaffe\" made Yepremian famous and led to a lucrative windfall of speaking engagements and endorsements. \"It's been a blessing\", said Yepremian, who passed away in 2015.<ref name=\"Dave Hyde p.268\"/>\n\nThe same teams met 10 years later in [[Super Bowl XVII]], which was also played in the Los Angeles area, at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. The Redskins won that game, 27\u201317. Two starters from Miami's undefeated team, guard Bob Kuechenberg and defensive end Vern Den Herder, were still active during the strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]]. The Redskins had no players remaining from Super Bowl VII on their Super Bowl XVII roster. The last member of the 1972 Redskins still active with the franchise, offensive tackle Terry Hermeling, retired after the 1980 season.\n\nRedskins linebacker and defensive captain Jack Pardee retired immediately following this game, ending a 16-year career. He coached the [[Chicago Bears]] for three seasons (1975\u201377) before succeeding Allen as Redskins coach in 1978. Pardee was fired following a 6\u201310 campaign in 1980 and was replaced by [[Joe Gibbs]], who led the Redskins to three Super Bowl championships ([[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]], [[Super Bowl XXII|XXII]], [[Super Bowl XXVI|XXVI]]) and 171 victories to earn induction into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]. After coaching the [[Houston Gamblers]] of the [[United States Football League]] in 1984 and '85, Pardee coached at the [[Houston Cougars football|University of Houston]] (1987\u201389) and the [[Houston Oilers]] (1990\u201394). \n\nThe Miami Dolphins became the second team to win the Super Bowl after losing it the previous year. They are the last team to do so until the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl LIII]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References/Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://www.superbowl.com/ Super Bowl official website]\n*{{cite book | title=2006 NFL Record and Fact Book | publisher=Time Inc.
