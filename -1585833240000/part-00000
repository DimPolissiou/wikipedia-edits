He was forced flee to [[County of Castile|Castile]], but after a few months Fruela was assassinated and Alfonso returned to [[Oviedo]].\n\nHe defeated a [[Basque people|Basque]] rebellion in 867 and, much later, a Galician one as well. He conquered [[Oporto]] and [[Coimbra]] in 868 and 878 respectively. In about 869, he formed an alliance with the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]], and solidified this link by marrying Jimena, who is thought to have been daughter of king [[Garc\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1iguez of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1iguez]], or less likely, a member of the [[Jim\u00e9nez dynasty]], and also married his sister [[Leodegundia]] to a prince of Pamplona.\n\n===In the Reconquista===\nThe following year, 867, Alfonso had to attend to an uprising in the eastern part of the kingdom, in Alava, according to the Chronicle of Albeda. According to the Chronicle of Sampiro, the revolt was led by Count Eylo. Sampiro describes these events as follows:\n\n{{cita| A messenger arrived from \u00c1lava, announcing that their hearts had inflated against the king: hearing that, the monarch decided to march there.  Driven by the fear of their arrival, they quickly recognized their obligations and supplicants, lowered their heads before him and promised that they would remain faithful to his kingdom and authority, and that they would do what was commanded.  In this way he submitted to his power an Alava lying before him, and Eylo, who presented himself as his count, brought him to Oviedo loaded with iron. {{Harvp|Mart\u00ednez D\u00edez|2005|p=220}}}}\n\nHis father, Ordo\u00f1o, had begun the repopulation of the border territories and Alfonso continued with it.  His first successes were in Portuguese lands, where King Alfonso's troops succeeded in locating the southwestern frontier on the Mondego river.  Count [[Vimara Peres|Vimara Perez]] in 868 conquered Oporto and repopulated the district. In 878, the army of King Alfonso III, with Count Hermenegildo Guti\u00e9rrez in command, faced the Muslim forces led by the emir of Cordoba, Mohammad I, who had started an attack against Oporto. After defeating the emir's forces and expelling the Muslim inhabitants of Coimbra and Oporto, Guti\u00e9rrez' Christian troops occupied and repopulated other cities, such as Braga, Viseo and Lamego, with men taken from Galicia. Coimbra, Lamego and Viseo were conquered again in 987 by Almanzor and it was not until 1064 when they were finally reconquered by King Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n.\n\nAlfonso III had to face the offensive of the Umayyad prince al-Mundir, son of Mohamed I. Fighting occurred almost constantly between 875 and 883. The first Umayyad raids were aimed at Le\u00f3n and El Bierzo, but failed.  The Christian counteroffensive ended with the taking of Deza and Atienza.\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Marwan, the Galician, Lord of M\u00e9rida and rebel against the Emir of C\u00f3rdoba, sent him to ingratiate himself with him to the Minister of this, Hashim ibn Abd al-Aziz.{{clarify|date=March 2020}} Accordingly, in 878, Al-Mundir  directed his armies back to Leon and Astorga, while Salid ben Ganim reached the \u00d3rbigo.  Alfonso, to avoid the union of both armies, went out to meet the second he defeated in the battle of Polvoraria, at the confluence of the \u00d3rbigo and Esla rivers.  Al-Mundir then undertook the withdrawal, but Alfonso III intercepted him in the valley of Valdemora, where he defeated him.  Emir Mohamed was forced to pay ransom and sign a three-year truce.  It was the first time that C\u00f3rdoba asked for peace.\n\nBoth kings considered the truce as a pause while preparing for the next assault: Mohamed raised a fleet to attack Galicia, but it was destroyed by a storm. Alfonso and Ibn Marwan descended through the Tagus Valley and defeated the Cordovan army on Mount Oxifer, next to the Guadiana River.\n\nAs revenge, Mohamed attacked the kingdom of Zaragoza in 882, where Alfonso had sent his son Ordo\u00f1o to be educated with the Banu Qasi, sons of Musa, advancing through the ancient Roman road to Leon.  There was an exchange of prisoners and the Cordovans withdrew.  They repeated the campaign in 883 with the same result.  In 884 Mohamed I and Alfonso III signed a peace, since both began to have serious internal problems.  The great king was met with a rising led by his brothers Fruela, Odoario and Bermudo, who became strong in Astorga, supported by several counts, but were quickly defeated and executed.  In 901 the Umayyad rebel Ibn al-Qitt proclaimed Mahdi, preached holy war and attacked Zamora - \"rebuilt and repopulated by Mozarabic Toledo [...] the most important advanced square of the Asturian kingdom\" - which he was able to resist.  The messianic leader, abandoned by his own, was defeated and killed in battle on what is known as the Day of Zamora. In those years, the emirate of Cordoba, wracked by civil disorder, stopped disturbing the kingdom of Asturias. Alonso faced off against his former allies in M\u00e9rida and the Ebro valley: allied with the Count of Pallars, he instigated a coup that managed to defeat the Banu Qasi and install a Navarrese, Sancho Garc\u00e9s I, on the throne of Pamplona.\n\nHe ordered the creation of three chronicles which presented the theory that the kingdom of Asturias was the rightful successor of the old [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom. He was also a patron of the arts, like his grandfather before him. He built the [[church of Santo Adriano de Tu\u00f1\u00f3n]]. According to a letter of disputed authenticity dated to 906, the ''[[Epistola Adefonsi Hispaniae regis]]'', Alfonso arranged to purchase an \"imperial crown\" from the [[cathedral of Tours]].<ref>[[R. A. Fletcher]], ''Saint James's Catapult: The Life and Times of Diego Gelm\u00edrez of Santiago de Compostela'' (Oxford, 1984), 317\u201323.</ref>\n\nIn 909, Alfonso relocated the seat of his government to Oviedo.  According to [[Sampiro]], his sons ([[Garc\u00eda I of Le\u00f3n|Garc\u00eda]], [[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o]], Gonzalo, [[Fruela II of Le\u00f3n|Fruela]] and Ramiro) conspired against him, under the influence of Garc\u00eda's father-in-law.  Alfonso had Garc\u00eda imprisoned but they were able to eject him and he fled to Boiges.  However, he returned and convinced Garc\u00eda to join him in a campaign against the Moors.  Alfonso died in Zamora of natural causes in 910, having reigned for 44 years.  [[Ibn Hayyan]] likewise tells of an uprising, but says that Alfonso himself had been imprisoned.  Following his death there was a partition of his realm: his eldest son, Garc\u00eda, became king of Le\u00f3n. The second son, Ordo\u00f1o, reigned in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], while Fruela, received [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] with Oviedo as his capital. These lands would be reunited when Garc\u00eda died childless and Le\u00f3n passed to Ordo\u00f1o, while on his death the lands were reunited under Fruela. However, Fruela's death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century.\n\n==Culture==\n# He convened the second Oviedo Council in 893.\n# He ordered the elaboration of the Cross of Victory, which is included in the current flag of Asturias, which has become a symbol of the Principality.  The jewel was made by goldsmiths from the Frankish kingdom.  It ordered its elaboration at the beginning of the tenth century, as a donation to the Cathedral of San Salvador.  Today it is kept in the Holy Chamber of the Cathedral of Oviedo and a copy hangs on the bridge of Cangas de On\u00eds\n# The discovery of the sepulcher of Santiago makes Compostela the second apostolic seat after Rome, with authority over clerics from other Christian counties and counties.  Santiago becomes a destination for pilgrims, true transmitters of culture.\n# With respect to the Asturian art, during the reign of Alfonso III the Great is given the so-called \u00abpost-Tramuntana stage\u00bb of Asturian pre-Romanesque architecture, with buildings of the importance of San Salvador de Valdedi\u00f3s, Santo Adriano de Tu\u00f1\u00f3n and the basilica of Santiago de Compostela  .\n# He ordered the writing of three chronicles in which he remakes history presenting the kingdom of Asturias as the heir of the Visigothic kingdom:\n::* The Albeldense Chronicle (c.881).\n::* The prophetic Chronicle.  (c.883)\n::* The Chronicle of the Visigoth Kings or Chronicle of Alfonso III (c.911).\n\n==References==\n{{commonscat|Alfonso III of Asturias}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2017}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-bef|rows=2|before=[[Ordo\u00f1o I of Asturias|Ordo\u00f1o I]]}}\n{{S-ttl|rows=1|title=[[List of Asturian monarchs|King of Asturias]]|years=866\u2013910}}\n{{S-aft|rows=1|after=[[Fruela II of Le\u00f3n|Fruela II]]}}\n{{S-ttl|rows=1|title=[[King of Le\u00f3n]]|years=866\u2013910}}\n{{S-aft|rows=1|after=[[Garc\u00eda I of Le\u00f3n|Garc\u00eda I]]}}\n{{S-new}}\n{{S-ttl|title=[[King of Galicia]]|years=}}\n{{S-aft|after=[[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o II]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Monarchs of Asturias}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alfonso 03 Of Leon}}\n[[Category:840s births]]\n[[Category:910 deaths]]\n[[Category:Leonese monarchs]]\n[[Category:Galician monarchs]]\n[[Category:Asturian monarchs]]\n[[Category:Beni Alfons]]\n[[Category:9th-century monarchs in Europe]]\n[[Category:10th-century monarchs in Europe]]\n[[Category:9th-century Asturian people]]\n[[Category:10th-century people from the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]]\n", "text_old": "{{Expand Spanish|Alfonso III de Asturias|date=June 2012}}\n{{Infobox royalty\n| type         = monarch\n| name         = Alfonso III\n| image        = Testamento.jpg\n| caption      = Miniature (c. 1118) from  the archives of [[Oviedo Cathedral]]  showing Alfonso III flanked by his queen, Jimena (left), and  his bishop, [[Gomelo II]]  (right).\n| succession   = [[List of Asturian monarchs|King]] of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]]\n| reign        = 866&ndash;910\n| coronation   =\n| predecessor  = [[Ordo\u00f1o I of Asturias|Ordo\u00f1o I]]\n| successor    = [[Fruela II of Le\u00f3n|Fruela II]] ([[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]])<br />[[Garc\u00eda I of Le\u00f3n|Garc\u00eda I]] ([[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]])<br />[[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o II]] ([[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]])\n| spouse       = Jimena of Pamplona\n| issue        = [[Fruela II of Le\u00f3n]]<br />[[Garc\u00eda I of Le\u00f3n]]<br />[[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n]]\n| issue-link   = \n| issue-pipe   = \n| full name    =\n| house        = [[Astur-Leonese dynasty]]\n| house-type   = Dynasty\n| father       = [[Ordo\u00f1o I of Asturias]]\n| mother       = Nu\u00f1a\n| birth_date   = {{circa|848|lk=no}}\n| birth_place  =\n| death_date   = 20 December 910\n| death_place  = \n| burial_place = [[Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo]]\n| religion     = [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]\n| signature    = AlfonsoIII.png\n|}}\n\n'''Alfonso III''' ({{circa|848}}{{snd}}20 December 910), called '''the Great''' ({{lang-es|el Magno}}), was the king of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] and [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] from 866 until his death.

He was also a patron of the arts, like his grandfather before him. He built the [[church of Santo Adriano de Tu\u00f1\u00f3n]]. According to a letter of disputed authenticity dated to 906, the ''[[Epistola Adefonsi Hispaniae regis]]'', Alfonso arranged to purchase an \"imperial crown\" from the [[cathedral of Tours]].<ref>[[R. A. Fletcher]], ''Saint James's Catapult: The Life and Times of Diego Gelm\u00edrez of Santiago de Compostela'' (Oxford, 1984), 317\u201323.</ref>\n\nIn 909, Alfonso relocated the seat of his government to Oviedo.  According to [[Sampiro]], his sons ([[Garc\u00eda I of Le\u00f3n|Garc\u00eda]], [[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o]], Gonzalo, [[Fruela II of Le\u00f3n|Fruela]] and Ramiro) conspired against him, under the influence of Garc\u00eda's father-in-law.  Alfonso had Garc\u00eda imprisoned but they were able to eject him and he fled to Boiges.  However, he returned and convinced Garc\u00eda to join him in a campaign against the Moors.  Alfonso died in Zamora of natural causes in 910, having reigned for 44 years.  [[Ibn Hayyan]] likewise tells of an uprising, but says that Alfonso himself had been imprisoned.  Following his death there was a partition of his realm: his eldest son, Garc\u00eda, became king of Le\u00f3n. The second son, Ordo\u00f1o, reigned in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], while Fruela, received [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] with Oviedo as his capital. These lands would be reunited when Garc\u00eda died childless and Le\u00f3n passed to Ordo\u00f1o, while on his death the lands were reunited under Fruela. However, Fruela's death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century.\n\n==Culture==\n# He convened the second Oviedo Council in 893.\n# He ordered the elaboration of the Cross of Victory, which is included in the current flag of Asturias, which has become a symbol of the Principality.  The jewel was made by goldsmiths from the Frankish kingdom.  It ordered its elaboration at the beginning of the tenth century, as a donation to the Cathedral of San Salvador.  Today it is kept in the Holy Chamber of the Cathedral of Oviedo and a copy hangs on the bridge of Cangas de On\u00eds\n# The discovery of the sepulcher of Santiago makes Compostela the second apostolic seat after Rome, with authority over clerics from other Christian counties and counties.  Santiago becomes a destination for pilgrims, true transmitters of culture.\n# With respect to the Asturian art, during the reign of Alfonso III the Great is given the so-called \u00abpost-Tramuntana stage\u00bb of Asturian pre-Romanesque architecture, with buildings of the importance of San Salvador de Valdedi\u00f3s, Santo Adriano de Tu\u00f1\u00f3n and the basilica of Santiago de Compostela  .\n# He ordered the writing of three chronicles in which he remakes history presenting the kingdom of Asturias as the heir of the Visigothic kingdom:\n::* The Albeldense Chronicle (c.881).\n::* The prophetic Chronicle.

This interpretation has been opposed, referring to the diversity of individuals in both sex and age in the graves.

It has been claimed that the building continuity is a self-evident feature, since it is deriving from a particular set of foundation practices that can be explained in a functionalistic way.<ref>Esin, U., E.

Individual hearth sequences are often separated with 40&nbsp;cm of soil, and therefore there is no apparent reason (unlike the buildings) why the hearths should consistently be constructed in the same corner as in the successive buildings. In many cases neighbouring buildings do place their respective hearths in different corners. Micro-cosmological special codes or wind direction does not seem to be decisive for the positioning of the hearth.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\"/> The structural and material remains indicate that the buildings were continuous entities with some form of fixed special identity were the special organization could not be changed by the temporary occupant.\n<gallery>\nFile:Original Structures Asikli Hoyuk.JPG|Excavated buildings\nFile:Asikli_Hoyuk_sarah_c_murray_6176.jpg|Reconstructed buildings\nFile:Reconstructed Structures Asikli Hoyuk.JPG|Reconstructed buildings\n</gallery>\n\nStructural continuity was of great importance to the inhabitants of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck. The reason for this has partly been explained because they (the people) had a rigid adherence to traditions in terms of structural reproduction.<ref>\u00d6zdo\u011fan, M. 2002. \"Defining the Neolithic of Central Anatolia\".

In ''Understanding the Neolithic of north-western Europe'', edited by M. Edmonds and C. Richards. Glasgow: Cruithne Press. p. 89.</ref> The interpretation is that the walls are giving historical associations to the people living within them, giving a collective conscience lasting through time. The difference between this interpretation and the \"conservative approach\" is the potential explanation to why structural reproduction could have been important for the inhabitants of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck. The identities of the inhabitants were projected to the structural outcome of the buildings. The generality of this position is not meaningful on its own. It is not certain that the inhabitants of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck were aware of the total amount of building there was in the sequence in total. Perhaps the history of a building did not concern them in the same way as archaeologists like to think.\n[[File:Inisde Reconstructed Structure.JPG|thumb|Inside reconstructed building]]\n\nThe lack of change over time suggests that the inhabitants of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck had a view of the past as a precedent for the present: a vital part of society that was 'reborn' in each reproduction, manifested in its building continuity. The structural reconstruction is a regional feature for Central Anatolia. With the exception of [[Jericho]], most of the evidence from PPNB sites in the [[Levant]] indicates that structures were not reconstructed in the same loci, and some location structures differ in dates by several hundred years.\n\nThe buildings at A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck are clustered into what has been interpreted as neighbourhoods. As this is a vague perception of the structural outlay of the community it describes them as clustered single and multiroom houses forming compounds, apparently sharing courtyard space for production activities and practising joint cooking and food consumption.<ref name=\"anthropological2004\"/> Little can be said on the food storage, since there were no remains after storage bins, although storage rooms may be identified due to comparing structures on other sites (e.g. [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]]).<ref>Bogaard, A. 2009. \"Private pantries and celebrated surplus: storing and sharing food at Neolithic Catalhoyuk, Central Anatolia\". ''Antiquity'' 83:649\u2013668</ref>\n\nThe average room size is 12&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>, with from two or three up to five or six clustered dwelling forming a 'neighbourhood' or compound. The interpretation of the borders of these 'neighbourhoods' is problematic, since much of the site still lies under the baulks, is in situ or eroded. The distribution of single- and multi-room buildings does not seem to follow a pattern other than that the residential clusters seem to be divided by narrow alleys 0.5\u20131.0&nbsp;m wide,<ref>Esin, U., and S. Harmankaya. 1999. \"A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131\". In ''Neolithic in Turkey: the cradle of civilization'', edited by M. \u00d6zdo\u011fan and N. Ba\u015fgelen. Istanbul: Arkeoloji Ve Sanat Yayinlari. p. 125</ref> or open courtyard areas up to a diameter of 4&nbsp;m. The interior of multiroom buildings had openings in the partitioned walls, providing access to the individual rooms. Between the one building and the next there seems to be no communication, since there was no indication of doors in the exterior mudbrick walls. Since the buildings themselves do not have an entrance that can be traced archaeologically on the base of the walls, access had to be provided either through window-like openings high on the walls or from the flat roofs. Roof access is also known from [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]],<ref>Hodder, I. 2006. ''\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck: the leopard's tale \u2013 revealing the mysteries of Turkey's ancient \"town\"''. London: Thames & Hudson.</ref> making this entrance more plausible.\n\nA\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck does also have buildings that are bigger in size but without hearths. These are interpreted as public buildings or 'building complexes'. These are seen as some of the most enigmatic buildings found at the site, and diverge both in size and spatial organization. One of them (complex HV) being at up to 20 times larger than the largest loam buildings (i.e. 25 m{{sup|2}} x 20 = 500 m{{sup|2}}).<ref>D\u00fcring, B. S. 2006. \"Constructing communities: clustered neighbourhood settlements of the Central Anatolian Neolithic ca. 8500-5500 Cal. BC\", Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University, Leiden. p. 101</ref> They have a multitude of rooms and encompass elaborate and large internal courts; something that is not found in any other buildings. The walls are more robust and massive than other buildings, in some cases being referred to as \"monumental walls\", accompanied by parallel outer walls with relatively narrow space in between.\n\nThe interpretation of these buildings is difficult. The fact that they clearly differentiate from the domestic loam buildings indicates that they had special value in the society. They also do not incorporated into the clustered 'neighbourhoods', indicating that they served several neighbourhoods or the local community at large. With 500 m{{sup|2}} the range of activities that could have taken place in this space could easily incorporate several hundred people. Yet, given that the estimated population of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck may have run into the thousands, only a selected group in the total population could have used the building at a given occasion. There is a variety of hypotheses regarding the nature of these monumental structures. There are other examples of these restricted monumental spaces on other sites in the Levantine PPNB (such as [[Nevali \u00c7ori]], Behida, [[\u2018Ain Ghazal]]), suggesting that they were used by an elite or for practising different social initiation rites.<ref>Rollefson, G.

Other than this there is found one single animal figurine made of clay that can hardly tell us anything of the religious belief of the inhabitants. The limited amount of burials compared to the estimated population makes it very likely that there may have been a cemetery where the deceased were buried, but it has not been found. There is also an absence of storage bins, making the distinction on autonomous households difficult.\n\n==Relative chronology==\n<center>{{Near East Neolithic}}</center>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck}}\n* [[Neolithic Revolution]]\n* [[Neolithic architecture]]\n* [[List of largest cities throughout history]]\n* [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]]\n* [[G\u00f6bekli Tepe]]\n* [[Ancestral Puebloans]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck}}\n* [http://www.asiklihoyuk.org/ official '''A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck''' website]\n* [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=19533 The Megalithic Portal \u2014 A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck]\n\n{{Prehistoric technology|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Asikli Hoyuk}}\n[[Category:9th-millennium BC architecture]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites of prehistoric Anatolia]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Aksaray Province]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Aksaray Province]]\n[[Category:Neolithic settlements]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Neolithic archaeological site near Aksaray, Turkey}}\n{{Infobox ancient site\n  |name = A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck\n  |native_name = \n  |alternate_name = \n  |image = Asikli-hoyuk.jpg\n  |image_size=270\n  |alt = \n  |caption = A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck\n  |map_type = Near East#Turkey\n  |map_alt = \n  |map_size= 270\n  |relief=yes\n  |coordinates = {{coord|38|20|56|N|34|13|48|E|display=inline,title}}\n  |location = [[Aksaray Province]], [[Turkey]]\n  |region = \n  |type = Settlement\n  |part_of = \n  |length = \n  |width = \n  |area = \n  |height = \n  |builder = \n  |material = \n  |built = 8,200 BC\n  |abandoned = \n  |epochs = [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]]\n  |cultures = \n  |dependency_of = \n  |occupants = \n  |event = \n  |excavations = \n  |archaeologists = \n  |condition = \n  |ownership = \n  |management = \n  |public_access = \n  |website = <!-- {{URL|example.com}} -->\n  |notes = \n}}\n[[File:Asikli_Hoyuk_panorama.jpg|thumb|Panorama made from top of the mound, facing north-west]]\n'''A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck''' is a settlement [[mound]] located nearly 1&nbsp;km south of K\u0131z\u0131lkaya village on the bank of the [[Melendiz]] brook, and 25&nbsp;kilometers southeast of [[Aksaray]], [[Turkey]].\nA\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck is located in an area covered by the volcanic [[tuff]] of central [[Cappadocia]], in [[Aksaray Province]].

This estimate is based on partially damaged and eroded structures possibly giving a number lower than accurate. Based on a limited group of fully exposed buildings 54% of single room units contained a hearth, while only 29% of the multiple room units. The average percentage on base of these building units is 47%, probably a more realistic estimate for the site in total.<ref>D\u00fcring, B.

Still, multiple room units do have a substantial number of hearths. It has been suggested that the \"multiroom dwellings may have functioned as 'incomplete' houses for new families still heavily dependent on the larger extended group\".<ref>Steadman, S. R. 2004. \"Heading Home: The Architecture of Family and Society in Early Sedentary Communities on the Anatolian Plateau\". ''Journal of Anthropological Research'' 60 (4):515\u2013558. p. 539.</ref> The buildings containing the hearths do not show particular characteristics that distinguish them from structures without hearths; neither do they differ in size or special orientation. Even the hearth itself does not follow an apparent norm in terms of size or location. The position varies considerably, but it always has one side to the wall. The positioning of the hearth does not seem to be determined by general macro-ecological factors, such as prevailing wind directions, nor determined by cultural norms regarding spatial features within buildings.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\"/>\n\nThe hearth does not seem to be subject to a random placement inside the buildings: it is consistently located at the same spot throughout a very long building sequence. This indicates that their positions were not chosen arbitrarily. When a location for the hearth was chosen it was important that the placement did not change in later rebuilding sequences of the structure (see picture: Deep sounding). There is no evidence for ladderpost scars due to the assumed use of freestanding ladders, making the location of the entrance uncertain. A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck does not seem to have any evidence for ovens.\n\n==Buildings==\nA\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck had a tradition to reconstruct or rebuild earlier structures. It followed a pattern where the structures were built \"exactly on the same spot and with the same alignment as earlier buildings, using older walls as a foundation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">D\u00fcring, B.

Cambridge University Press. p. 64</ref> If this assumption correct; the deep sounding 4H/G from phases 2I up to 2B (eight layers in total) show that the time span of a structure could be from 240 to 480 years. Looking outside of Central Anatolian Neolithic, this type of building continuity is unparalleled both in ethnography and archaeology.<ref>Hodder, I. 1998. \"The domus, some problems reconsidered\". In ''Understanding the Neolithic of north-western Europe'', edited by M. Edmonds and C. Richards. Glasgow: Cruithne Press.</ref> This remarkable structural continuity may suggest a social system in which buildings where not privately owned, since one would expect them to be modified on a regular basis. It can be assumed that the rooms were distributed amongst the community members according to the change in both needs and statuses.<ref>D\u00fcring, B. S., and A. Marciniak. 2006. \"Households and communities in the central Anatolian Neolithic\". ''Archaeological Dialogues'' 12 (02):165\u2013187.</ref>\n\nThe building practises maintained their characteristics throughout the centuries. It has been claimed that the building continuity is a self-evident feature, since it is deriving from a particular set of foundation practices that can be explained in a functionalistic way.<ref>Esin, U., E.  B\u0131\u00e7ak\u00e7\u0131, M. \u00d6zba\u015faran, N. Nalkan-Atl\u0131, D. Berker, I. Ya\u011fmur, and A.

''Anatolica'' 17:123\u2013174. p. 130</ref> It has otherwise been argued that the extreme degree of continuity is inadequately explained by functionalism alone, since the structures located adjacent to open spaces could easily expanded or shrunk according to the specific needs, but instead remained identical.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/> These functionalist parameters can also not explain the continued rebuilding of the hearths, which are always built on the same spot. Individual hearth sequences are often separated with 40&nbsp;cm of soil, and therefore there is no apparent reason (unlike the buildings) why the hearths should consistently be constructed in the same corner as in the successive buildings. In many cases neighbouring buildings do place their respective hearths in different corners. Micro-cosmological special codes or wind direction does not seem to be decisive for the positioning of the hearth.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\"/> The structural and material remains indicate that the buildings were continuous entities with some form of fixed special identity were the special organization could not be changed by the temporary occupant.\n<gallery>\nFile:Original Structures Asikli Hoyuk.JPG|Excavated buildings\nFile:Asikli_Hoyuk_sarah_c_murray_6176.jpg|Reconstructed buildings\nFile:Reconstructed Structures Asikli Hoyuk.JPG|Reconstructed buildings\n</gallery>\n\nStructural continuity was of great importance to the inhabitants of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck. The reason for this has partly been explained because they (the people) had a rigid adherence to traditions in terms of structural reproduction.<ref>\u00d6zdo\u011fan, M. 2002. \"Defining the Neolithic of Central Anatolia\". In \"Proposal for a regional terminology for Central Anatolia\". In \"The Neolithic of Central Anatolia. Internal developments and external relations during the 9th\u20136th millennia cal BC\", Proc.

Istanbul: Ege Yay\u0131nlar\u0131.</ref> The \"traditional view\" has been resented because \"[In short,] labelling a society as conservative does not answer the question why the people under consideration were conservative\".<ref>D\u00fcring, B. S. 2006. \"Constructing communities: clustered neighbourhood settlements of the Central Anatolian Neolithic ca. 8500-5500 Cal. BC\", Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University, Leiden. p. 96</ref> As an alternative approach, refers to a historical dimension of the building to be of such great importance that \"people came to be bound between walls, metaphorically domesticated\".<ref>Hodder, I. 1998. \"The domus, some problems reconsidered\". In ''Understanding the Neolithic of north-western Europe'', edited by M. Edmonds and C. Richards. Glasgow: Cruithne Press. p. 89.</ref> The interpretation is that the walls are giving historical associations to the people living within them, giving a collective conscience lasting through time. The difference between this interpretation and the \"conservative approach\" is the potential explanation to why structural reproduction could have been important for the inhabitants of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck. The identities of the inhabitants were projected to the structural outcome of the buildings. The generality of this position is not meaningful on its own. It is not certain that the inhabitants of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck were aware of the total amount of building there was in the sequence in total. Perhaps the history of a building did not concern them in the same way as archaeologists like to think.\n[[File:Inisde Reconstructed Structure.JPG|thumb|Inside reconstructed building]]\n\nThe lack of change over time suggests that the inhabitants of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck had a view of the past as a precedent for the present: a vital part of society that was 'reborn' in each reproduction, manifested in its building continuity. The structural reconstruction is a regional feature for Central Anatolia. With the exception of [[Jericho]], most of the evidence from PPNB sites in the [[Levant]] indicates that structures were not reconstructed in the same loci, and some location structures differ in dates by several hundred years.\n\nThe buildings at A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck are clustered into what has been interpreted as neighbourhoods. As this is a vague perception of the structural outlay of the community it describes them as clustered single and multiroom houses forming compounds, apparently sharing courtyard space for production activities and practising joint cooking and food consumption.<ref name=\"anthropological2004\"/> Little can be said on the food storage, since there were no remains after storage bins, although storage rooms may be identified due to comparing structures on other sites (e.g. [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]]).<ref>Bogaard, A. 2009. \"Private pantries and celebrated surplus: storing and sharing food at Neolithic Catalhoyuk, Central Anatolia\". ''Antiquity'' 83:649\u2013668</ref>\n\nThe average room size is 12&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>, with from two or three up to five or six clustered dwelling forming a 'neighbourhood' or compound. The interpretation of the borders of these 'neighbourhoods' is problematic, since much of the site still lies under the baulks, is in situ or eroded. The distribution of single- and multi-room buildings does not seem to follow a pattern other than that the residential clusters seem to be divided by narrow alleys 0.5\u20131.0&nbsp;m wide,<ref>Esin, U., and S. Harmankaya. 1999. \"A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131\". In ''Neolithic in Turkey: the cradle of civilization'', edited by M. \u00d6zdo\u011fan and N. Ba\u015fgelen. Istanbul: Arkeoloji Ve Sanat Yayinlari. p. 125</ref> or open courtyard areas up to a diameter of 4&nbsp;m. The interior of multiroom buildings had openings in the partitioned walls, providing access to the individual rooms. Between the one building and the next there seems to be no communication, since there was no indication of doors in the exterior mudbrick walls. Since the buildings themselves do not have an entrance that can be traced archaeologically on the base of the walls, access had to be provided either through window-like openings high on the walls or from the flat roofs. Roof access is also known from [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]],<ref>Hodder, I. 2006. ''\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck: the leopard's tale \u2013 revealing the mysteries of Turkey's ancient \"town\"''. London: Thames & Hudson.</ref> making this entrance more plausible.\n\nA\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck does also have buildings that are bigger in size but without hearths. These are interpreted as public buildings or 'building complexes'. These are seen as some of the most enigmatic buildings found at the site, and diverge both in size and spatial organization. One of them (complex HV) being at up to 20 times larger than the largest loam buildings (i.e. 25 m{{sup|2}} x 20 = 500 m{{sup|2}}).<ref>D\u00fcring, B. S. 2006. \"Constructing communities: clustered neighbourhood settlements of the Central Anatolian Neolithic ca. 8500-5500 Cal. BC\", Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University, Leiden. p. 101</ref> They have a multitude of rooms and encompass elaborate and large internal courts; something that is not found in any other buildings. The walls are more robust and massive than other buildings, in some cases being referred to as \"monumental walls\", accompanied by parallel outer walls with relatively narrow space in between.\n\nThe interpretation of these buildings is difficult. The fact that they clearly differentiate from the domestic loam buildings indicates that they had special value in the society. They also do not incorporated into the clustered 'neighbourhoods', indicating that they served several neighbourhoods or the local community at large. With 500 m{{sup|2}} the range of activities that could have taken place in this space could easily incorporate several hundred people. Yet, given that the estimated population of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck may have run into the thousands, only a selected group in the total population could have used the building at a given occasion. There is a variety of hypotheses regarding the nature of these monumental structures. There are other examples of these restricted monumental spaces on other sites in the Levantine PPNB (such as [[Nevali \u00c7ori]], Behida, [[\u2018Ain Ghazal]]), suggesting that they were used by an elite or for practising different social initiation rites.<ref>Rollefson, G.

Other than this there is found one single animal figurine made of clay that can hardly tell us anything of the religious belief of the inhabitants. The limited amount of burials compared to the estimated population makes it very likely that there may have been a cemetery where the deceased were buried, but it has not been found. There is also an absence of storage bins, making the distinction on autonomous households difficult.\n\n==Relative chronology==\n<center>{{Near East Neolithic}}</center>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck}}\n* [[Neolithic Revolution]]\n* [[Neolithic architecture]]\n* [[List of largest cities throughout history]]\n* [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]]\n* [[G\u00f6bekli Tepe]]\n* [[Ancestral Puebloans]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck}}\n* [http://www.asiklihoyuk.org/ official '''A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck''' website]\n* [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=19533 The Megalithic Portal \u2014 A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck]\n\n{{Prehistoric technology|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Asikli Hoyuk}}\n[[Category:9th-millennium BC architecture]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites of prehistoric Anatolia]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Aksaray Province]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Aksaray Province]]\n[[Category:Neolithic settlements]]\n", "name_user": "JCJC777", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBurials", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C5%9F%C4%B1kl%C4%B1_H%C3%B6y%C3%BCk"}

Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches.

Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

As with most London squares the central garden was originally for the private use of the residents of the surrounding houses, but it now belongs to the [[University of London]] and is open to the public. The square is named after the second wife of the [[6th Duke of Bedford]], Lady Georgiana Gordon,  daughter of [[Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon]]. The university owns many of the buildings in the square and in early 2005 it submitted an application for a refurbishment of the square, including the reinstatement of railings similar to the originals. The work was completed in 2007. The west side of the square is dominated by the listed church of ''[[Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury|Christ the King]]'' and next to it the home of [[Dr Williams's Library]].\n\nThe [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]], a department of [[University College London]], is on the north side of the square. The [[Campaign for Science and Engineering]] and [[UCL Urban Laboratory]] resides in Gordon House, at the square's north-west corner. Gordon Street leads from the north-west corner with the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]] close by. The [[Warburg Institute]] (part of the [[School of Advanced Study]]) is located on the south-west corner of the square, across Tavistock Place.\n\nNos. 16\u201326, on the western side of the Square, were not completed until 1855, and they represent some of the last buildings created by [[Thomas Cubitt]].
