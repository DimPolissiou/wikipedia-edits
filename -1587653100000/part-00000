The first child (unnamed in that account), a son conceived adulterously during Uriah's lifetime, had died as a punishment on account of the death of Uriah by David's order. Solomon had three named full brothers born to Bathsheba: [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], Shammua, and Shobab,<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Chronicles|3:5}}</ref> besides six known older half-brothers born of as many mothers.<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Chronicles|3:1\u20134}}</ref> \n\nThe biblical narrative shows that Solomon served as a peace offering between God and David, due to his adulterous relationship with Bathsheba. In an effort to hide this sin, for example, he sent the woman's husband to battle, hoping that he would be killed there. After he died, David was finally able to marry his wife.

He founded numerous colonies, some of which doubled as trading posts and military outposts.\n\nTrade relationships were a focus of his administration. In particular he continued his father's very profitable relationship with the Phoenician king [[Hiram I]] of Tyre (see 'wealth' below); they sent out joint expeditions to the lands of [[Tarshish]] and [[Ophir]] to engage in the trade of luxury products, importing gold, silver, sandalwood, pearls, ivory, apes and peacocks. Solomon is considered the most wealthy of the Israelite kings named in the Bible.\n\n===Wisdom===\n\n[[File:Luca Giordano - Dream of Solomon - WGA09004.jpg|thumbnail|[[Luca Giordano]]: The ''Dream of Solomon'': God promises Solomon wisdom]]\n\nSolomon was the biblical king most famous for his [[wisdom]]. In 1{{nbsp}}Kings he sacrificed to God, and God later appeared to him in a dream,<ref>1 Kings 3:3\u201315</ref> asking what Solomon wanted from God. Solomon asked for wisdom. Pleased, God personally answered Solomon's prayer, promising him great wisdom because he did not ask for self-serving rewards like long life or the death of his enemies.\n[[File:Plaque Castelli Salomon Mus\u00e9e de Lille 130108.jpg|thumb|''The Judgment of Solomon'', painting on ceramic, Castelli, 18th century, Lille Museum of Fine Arts]]\n\nPerhaps the best known story of his wisdom is the [[Judgment of Solomon]]; two women each lay claim to being the mother of the same child. Solomon easily resolved the dispute by commanding the child to be cut in half and shared between the two. One woman promptly renounced her claim, proving that she would rather give the child up than see it killed. Solomon declared the woman who showed [[compassion]] to be the true mother, entitled to the whole child.<ref>1 Kings 3:16\u201328</ref>\n\nSolomon was traditionally considered the author of several biblical books, \"including not only the collections of [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], but also of [[Ecclesiastes]] and the [[Song of Solomon]] and the later apocryphal book the [[Wisdom of solomon|Wisdom of Solomon.]]\"{{Sfn|Coogan|2009|p=375}}\n\n===Wealth===\n\n{{See also|Solomon's Temple}}\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the [[United Monarchy|Israelite monarchy]] gained its highest splendour and wealth during Solomon's reign of 40 years. In a single year, according to {{bibleverse|1|Kings|10:14|HE}}, Solomon collected [[tribute]] amounting to 666 [[talent (weight)|talents]] (18,125 kilograms) of gold. Solomon is described as surrounding himself with all the luxuries and the grandeur of an [[Eastern world|Eastern]] monarch, and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with [[Hiram I]], king of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings.\n\n===Construction projects===\n[[File:Solomon and the Plan for the Temple.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Solomon plans the building of the temple|Solomon and the plan for the [[First Temple]]. Illustration from a Bible card published by the Providence Lithograph Co.]]\n\nFor some years before his death, David was engaged in collecting materials for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent home for [[Yahweh]] and the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Solomon is described as undertaking the construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|temple]], with the help of an architect, also named [[Hiram Abiff|Hiram]], and other materials, sent from King Hiram of Tyre.\n\nAfter the completion of the temple, Solomon is described in the biblical narrative as erecting many other buildings of importance in [[Jerusalem]]. For 13 years, he was engaged in the building of a royal palace on [[Ophel]] (a hilly promontory in central Jerusalem). This complex included buildings referred to as:\n:The House (or Hall) of the Forest of Lebanon <ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|10:17|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|9:20|NKJV}}: \"House\" in the [[King James Version]] and [[Revised Standard Version]], \"Hall\" in the [[Jerusalem Bible]] and [[Good News Translation]]</ref>\n:The Hall or Porch of Pillars\n:The Hall of the Throne or the Hall of Justice\nas well as his own residence and a residence for his wife, Pharaoh's daughter.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|7:1-8|NKJV}}</ref>\n[[File:SolomonsTemple.png|thumb|220px|A sketch of [[Solomon's Temple]], based on descriptions in the Scriptures.]]\n\n[[Solomon's Throne|Solomon's throne]] is said to have been a spectacle, seeing that it was one of the earliest mechanical devices built by man. Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply of water for the city, and the [[Millo]] ([[Septuagint]], ''Acra'') for the defense of the city. However, excavations of Jerusalem have shown a distinct lack of monumental architecture from the era, and no remains of either the Temple or Solomon's palace have been found.\n\nSolomon is also described as rebuilding cities elsewhere in Israel, creating the port of [[Ezion-Geber]], and constructing [[Palmyra]] in the wilderness as a commercial depot and military outpost. Although the location of the port of Ezion-Geber is known, no remains have ever been found. More archaeological success has been achieved with the major cities Solomon is said to have strengthened or rebuilt, for example, [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] and [[Gezer]].<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|9:15|HE}}</ref> These all have substantial ancient remains, including impressive six-chambered gates, and [[ashlar]] palaces; however it is no longer the scholarly consensus that these structures date to the time, according to the Bible, when Solomon ruled.<ref name=Finkelstein />\n\nAccording to the Bible, during Solomon's reign, Israel enjoyed great commercial prosperity, with extensive traffic being carried on by land with [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Egypt]], and [[Arabia]], and by sea with [[Tarshish]], [[Ophir]], and [[South India]].\n\n===Wives and concubines===\n[[File:Giovanni Venanzi di Pesaro K\u00f6nig Salomons G\u00f6tzendienst.jpg|thumb|275x275px|King Solomon with his wives.

Oil on canvas painting by Edward Poynter, 1890.]]\n\nIn a brief, unelaborated, and enigmatic passage, the Hebrew Bible describes how the fame of Solomon's wisdom and wealth spread far and wide, so much so that the queen of [[Sheba]] decided that she should meet him. The queen is described as visiting with a number of gifts including gold, spices and precious stones. When Solomon gave her \"all her desire, whatsoever she asked\", she left satisfied ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+10%3A10&version=NIV 1 Kings 10:10]).\n\nWhether the passage is simply to provide a brief token, foreign witness of Solomon's wealth and wisdom, or whether there is meant to be something more significant to the queen's visit is unknown; nevertheless the visit of the Queen of Sheba has become the subject of numerous stories.\n\n[[Sheba]] is typically identified as [[Sabaeans|Saba]], a nation once spanning the [[Red Sea]] on the coasts of what are now [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Yemen]], in [[Arabia Felix]]; although other sources place it in the area of what is now northern Ethiopia and Eritrea.<ref>Stuart Munro-Hay, ''The Quest for the Ark of the Covenant: The True History of the Tablets of Moses''.</ref><ref>[[Donald N. Levine]], ''Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopia Culture'' (Chicago: University Press, 1972).</ref> In a Rabbinical account (e.g. [[Targum Sheni]]), Solomon was accustomed to ordering the living creatures of the world to dance before him (Rabbinical accounts say that Solomon had been given control over all living things by Yahweh), but one day upon discovering that the mountain-cock or [[hoopoe]] (Aramaic name: ''nagar tura'') was absent, he summoned it to him, and the bird told him that it had been searching for somewhere new (see: [[s:Translation:Colloquy of the Queen of Sheba|Colloquy of the Queen of Sheba]]).\n[[File:Saabaghiberti.jpg|thumb|200px|Renaissance relief of the Queen of Sheba meeting Solomon\u2014[[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]]'s Gates of Paradise at the [[Florence Baptistry]]]]\n\nThe bird had discovered a land in the east, exceedingly rich in gold, silver, and plants, whose capital was called ''Kitor'' and whose ruler was the Queen of Sheba, and the bird, on its own advice, was sent by Solomon to request the queen's immediate attendance at Solomon's court.\n\nAn Ethiopian account from the 14th century (''[[Kebra Nagast]]'') maintains that the Queen of Sheba had sexual relations with King Solomon and gave birth by the Mai Bella stream in the province of [[Hamasien]], [[Eritrea]]. The Ethiopian tradition has a [[Queen of Sheba#Ethiopian accounts|detailed account of the affair]]. The child was a son who went on to become [[Menelik I]], King of [[Kingdom of Axum|Axum]], and founded a [[Solomonic dynasty|dynasty]] that would reign as the first Jewish, then Christian [[Empire of Ethiopia]] for 2,900+ years (less one [[Zagwe dynasty|usurpation episode]], an interval of about 133 years until a legitimate male heir regained the crown) until [[Haile Selassie]] was overthrown in 1974. Menelik was said to be a practicing Jew who was given a replica of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] by King Solomon; and, moreover, that the original was switched and went to [[Axum]] with him and his mother, and is still there, guarded by a single priest charged with caring for the artifact as his life's task.\n\nThe claim of such a lineage and of possession of the Ark has been an important source of legitimacy and prestige for the Ethiopian monarchy throughout the many centuries of its existence, and had important and lasting effects on [[Culture of Ethiopia|Ethiopian culture]] as a whole. The Ethiopian government and church deny all requests to view the alleged ark.{{Efn|Recent History Channel promotional production about ''Indiana Jones's''{{citation needed|date=June 2008|reason=Title needed, IMDB search on Indiana Jones user:fabartus}} positive impact on archaeology (released Mid-May 2008, the week before the 22 May 2008 US release of [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]); History Channel producers were shown interviewing the guardian priest, and expert discussions about the Ark were part of the fare.}}\n\nSome classical-era Rabbis, attacking Solomon's moral character, have claimed instead that the child was an ancestor of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], who destroyed [[Solomon's temple]] some 300 years later.<ref name=\"JewishEncyclopedia\"/>\n\n===Sins and punishment===\n\n[[File:Isaak Asknaziy 02.jpeg|thumb|left |\"[[Ecclesiastes|Vanity of vanities; all is vanity\"]].

In {{bibleverse ||Deuteronomy|17:16\u201317|HE}}, a king is commanded not to multiply horses or wives, neither greatly multiply to himself gold or silver. Solomon sins in all three of these areas. Solomon collects [[666 (number)|666]] [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of gold each year ({{bibleverse |1|Kings|10:14|HE}}), a huge amount of money for a small nation like Israel. Solomon gathers a large number of horses and chariots and even brings in horses from Egypt. Just as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|17|HE}} warns, collecting horses and chariots takes Israel back to Egypt. Finally, Solomon marries foreign women, and these women turn Solomon to other gods.\n[[File:De afgoderij van koning Salomo Rijksmuseum SK-A-757.jpeg|thumbnail|Solomon was said to have \"sinned\" by acquiring many foreign wives.

He dies of natural causes<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Kings.html |title=The Kingdom of Israel |encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> at around 60 years of age. Upon Solomon's death, his son, [[Rehoboam]], succeeds him. However, ten of the [[Tribes of Israel]] refuse to accept him as king, splitting the [[United Monarchy]] in the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] under [[Jeroboam]], while Rehoboam continues to reign over the much smaller southern [[Kingdom of Judah]]. Henceforth the two kingdoms are never again united.\n\n==Jewish scripture==\n\nKing Solomon is one of the central biblical figures in [[Judaism|Jewish heritage]] that have lasting religious, national and political aspects. As the builder of the [[First Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] and last ruler of the united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] before its division into the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], Solomon is associated with the peak \"golden age\" of the independent Kingdom of Israel as well as a source of judicial and religious wisdom. According to Jewish tradition, King Solomon wrote three [[books of the Bible]]:\n* ''Mishlei'' ([[Book of Proverbs]]), a collection of fables and wisdom of life\n* ''Kohelet'' ([[Ecclesiastes]]), a book of contemplation and his self-reflection.\n* ''Shir ha-Shirim'' ([[Song of Songs]]), an unusual collection of poetry interspersed with verse, whose interpretation is either literal (i.e., a romantic and sexual relationship between a man and a woman) or metaphorical (a relationship between God and his people).\n\nThe Hebrew word \"To Solomon\" (which can also be translated as \"by Solomon\") appears in the title of two hymns, 72 and 127, in the book of [[Psalms]] (''Tehillim''), suggesting to some that Solomon wrote them.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Apocryphal or Deuterocanonical texts==\n\nRabbinical tradition attributes the ''[[Wisdom of Solomon]]'' (included within the [[Septuagint]]) to Solomon, although this book was probably written in the 2nd century BCE. In this work, Solomon is portrayed as an [[astronomer]]. Other books of [[wisdom poetry]] such as the ''[[Odes of Solomon]]'' and the ''[[Psalms of Solomon]]'' also bear his name. The Jewish historian [[Eupolemus]], who wrote about 157 BCE, included copies of [[apocryphal]] letters exchanged between Solomon and the kings of [[Egypt]] and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]].\n\nThe [[Gnostic]] ''[[Apocalypse of Adam]]'', which may date to the 1st or 2nd century, refers to a legend in which Solomon sends out an army of [[demon]]s to seek a virgin who had fled from him, perhaps the earliest surviving mention of the later common tale that Solomon controlled demons and made them his slaves. This tradition of Solomon's control over demons appears fully elaborated in the early [[pseudographical]] work called the ''[[Testament of Solomon]]'' with its elaborate and grotesque [[demonology]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=897&letter=S |title= Solomon, Testament of | website =Jewish Encyclopedia | accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref>\n\n==Historicity==\n\n{{see also|David#David_in_history.2C_archeology_and_literature|l1=David: Historicity|Kingdom_of_Israel_(united_monarchy)#Archaeological_record|l2=United Monarchy: Historicity|Jeroboam%27s_Revolt#Historicity|l3=Jeroboam's Revolt: Historicity}}\n\nAs with most biblical personages in the middle era of Israelite society, the historicity of Solomon is hotly debated. Current consensus states that regardless of whether or not a man named Solomon truly reigned as king over the Judean hills in the 10th century BCE, the biblical descriptions of his apparent empire's lavishness is almost surely an anachronistic invention.{{Sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2006|page=20}} \n\nAs for Solomon himself, scholars on both the maximalist and minimalist sides of the spectrum of biblical archeology generally agree Solomon himself probably existed,{{Sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2006|page=20}} however, a historically accurate picture of the Davidic king is difficult to construct. The ''de facto'' accepted position based on these assumptions is that Solomon could have only been the monarch or [[chieftain]] of Judah, which was likely small, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development.

Engraving by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], 19th century.]]\n\nHistorical evidence of King Solomon other than the biblical accounts has been so minimal that some scholars have understood the period of his reign as a 'Dark Age' (Muhly 1998). The first-century [[Roman Jews|Romano-Jewish]] scholar [[Josephus]] in ''[[Against Apion]]'', citing [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] court records and [[Menander]], gives a specific year during which [[King Hiram I]] of Tyre sent materials to Solomon for the construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]].<ref>''[[Against Apion]]'' i:17, 18.</ref> However, no material evidence indisputably of Solomon's reign has been found. [[Yigael Yadin]]'s excavations at [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Beit Shean]] and [[Gezer]] uncovered structures that he and others have argued date from Solomon's reign,{{Sfn|Dever|2001}} but others, such as [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Silberman]], argue that they should be dated to the [[Omrides|Omride]] period, more than a century after Solomon.<ref name=Finkelstein>{{Harvnb|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|pages=186\u2013195}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Finkelstein and Silberman, authors of ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts'',{{Sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|page=133}} at the time of the kingdoms of David and Solomon, Jerusalem was populated by only a few hundred residents or less, which is insufficient for an empire stretching from the [[Euphrates]] to [[Eilath#Biblical references|Eilath]]. According to ''The Bible Unearthed'', archaeological evidence suggests that the kingdom of Israel at the time of Solomon was little more than a small city state, and so it is implausible that Solomon received tribute as large as 666 [[talent (weight)|talents]] of gold per year. Although both Finkelstein and Silberman accept that David and Solomon were real inhabitants of Judah about the 10th century BCE,{{Sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2006|page=20}} they claim that the earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel is about 890 BCE, and for Judah about 750 BCE. They suggest that because of religious prejudice, the authors of the Bible suppressed the achievements of the [[Omrides]] (whom the Hebrew Bible describes as being [[polytheist]]), and instead pushed them back to a supposed golden age of Judaism and monotheists, and devotees of Yahweh. Some [[biblical minimalism|Biblical minimalists]] like [[Thomas L. Thompson]] go further, arguing that Jerusalem became a city and capable of being a state capital only in the mid-7th century.<ref>Thompson, Thomas L., 1999, ''The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past'', Jonathan Cape, London, {{ISBN|978-0-224-03977-2}} p. 207</ref> Likewise, Finkelstein and others consider the claimed size of Solomon's temple implausible.\n\n===Arguments in favour of biblical description===\n\n[[File:Solomon's Wealth and Wisdom.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Solomon's Wealth and Wisdom, as in 1{{nbsp}}Kings 3:12\u201313.

The metals from Tarshish were reportedly obtained by Solomon in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships that sailed in their service, and the silver-hoards provide the first recognized material evidence that agrees with the ancient texts concerning Solomon's kingdom and his wealth (see 'wealth' below).\n\nPossible evidence for the described wealth of Solomon and his kingdom was discovered in ancient silver-hoards, which were found in Israel and Phoenicia and recognized for their importance in 2003. The evidence from the hoards shows that the Levant was a center of wealth in precious metals during the reign of Solomon and Hiram, and matches the texts that say the trade extended from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = King Solomon's Silver?

Since the bottle was sealed with Solomon's seal, the genie was helpless to free himself, until freed many centuries later by a fisherman who discovered the bottle.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/16/201.html \"The Story of the Fisherman\", ''Stories from the Thousand and One Nights'', The Harvard Classics, 1909\u201314]</ref> In other stories from the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', protagonists who had to leave their homeland and travel to the unknown places of the world saw signs which proved that Solomon had already been there. Sometimes, protagonists discovered words of Solomon that were intended to help those who were lost and had unluckily reached those forbidden and deserted places.\n\n===Angels and magic===\n\nAccording to the [[Rabbinical literature]], on account of his modest request for wisdom only, Solomon was rewarded with riches and an unprecedented glorious realm, which extended over the upper world inhabited by the angels and over the whole of the terrestrial globe with all its inhabitants, including all the beasts, fowl, and reptiles, as well as the demons and spirits. His control over the demons, spirits, and animals augmented his splendor, the demons bringing him precious stones, besides water from distant countries to irrigate his exotic plants. The beasts and fowl of their own accord entered the kitchen of Solomon's palace, so that they might be used as food for him, and extravagant meals for him were prepared daily by each of his 700 wives and 300 concubines, with the thought that perhaps the king would feast that day in her house.\n\n====Seal of Solomon====\n\nA [[magic ring]] called the \"[[Seal of Solomon]]\" was supposedly given to Solomon and gave him power over demons or [[Jinn]]. The magical symbol said to have been on the Seal of Solomon which made it efficacious is often considered to be the ''[[Star of David]]''{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} though this emblem (also known as the Shield of David) is known to have been associated with Judaism only as recently as the 11th century CE while the five pointed star (pentagram) can be found on jars and other artifacts from Jerusalem dating back to at least the 2nd and 4th centuries BCE and is more likely to have been the emblem found on the ring purportedly used by King Solomon to control the Jinn or demons. [[Asmodai|Asmodeus]], king of demons, was one day, according to the classical Rabbis, captured by [[Benaiah]] using the ring, and was forced to remain in Solomon's service. In one tale, Asmodeus brought a man with two heads from under the earth to show Solomon; the man, unable to return, married a woman from Jerusalem and had seven sons, six of whom resembled the mother, while one resembled the father in having two heads. After their father's death, the son with two heads claimed two shares of the inheritance, arguing that he was two men; Solomon decided that the son with two heads was only one man. The Seal of Solomon, in some legends known as the Ring of Aandaleeb, was a highly sought after symbol of power. In several legends, different groups or individuals attempted to steal it or attain it in some manner.\n\n====Solomon and Asmodeus====\n\nOne legend concerning [[Asmodeus]] (see: [[s:Translation:The Story of King Solomon and Ashmedai|The Story of King Solomon and Ashmedai]]) goes on to state that Solomon one day asked Asmodeus what could make demons powerful over man, and Asmodeus asked to be freed and given the ring so that he could demonstrate; Solomon agreed but Asmodeus threw the ring into the sea and it was swallowed by a fish. Asmodeus then swallowed the king, stood up fully with one wing touching heaven and the other earth, and spat out Solomon to a distance of 400 miles. The Rabbis claim this was a divine punishment for Solomon's having failed to follow three divine commands, and Solomon was forced to wander from city to city, until he eventually arrived in an Ammonite city where he was forced to work in the king's kitchens. Solomon gained a chance to prepare a meal for the Ammonite king, which the king found so impressive that the previous cook was sacked and Solomon put in his place; the king's daughter, [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]], subsequently fell in love with Solomon, but the family (thinking Solomon a commoner) disapproved, so the king decided to kill them both by sending them into the desert. Solomon and the king's daughter wandered the desert until they reached a coastal city, where they bought a fish to eat, which just happened to be the one which had swallowed the magic ring. Solomon was then able to regain his throne and expel Asmodeus. The element of a ring thrown into the sea and found back in a fish's belly also appeared in [[Herodotus]]' account of [[Polycrates]], the [[tyrant]] of [[Samos]] (c. 538\u2013522 BCE).\n\nIn another familiar version of the legend of the Seal of Solomon, Asmodeus disguises himself. In some myths, he's disguised as King Solomon himself, while in more frequently heard versions he's disguised as a falcon, calling himself Gavyn (Gavinn or Gavin), one of King Solomon's trusted friends. The concealed Asmodeus tells travelers who have ventured up to King Solomon's grand lofty palace that the Seal of Solomon was thrown into the sea. He then convinces them to plunge in and attempt to retrieve it, for if they do they would take the throne as king.\n\n====Artifacts====\n\nOther magical items attributed to Solomon are [[key of Solomon|his key]] and his Table. The latter was said to be held in [[Toledo, Spain]] during [[Visigoth]] rule and was part of the loot taken by [[Tarik ibn Ziyad]] during the [[Umayyad Conquest of Iberia]], according to [[Ibn Abd-el-Hakem]]'s ''History of the Conquest of Spain''. The former appears in the title of the [[Lesser Key of Solomon]], a [[grimoire]] whose [[Frame story|framing story]] is Solomon capturing demons using his ring, and forcing them to explain themselves to him. In ''The Book of Deadly Names'', purportedly translated from Arabic manuscripts found hidden in a building in Spain, the \"King of the Jinn\" Fiqitush brings 72 Jinn before King Solomon to confess their corruptions and places of residence. Fiqitush tells King Solomon the recipes for curing such corruptions as each evil Jinn confesses.\n\n====Angels====\n\nAngels also helped Solomon in building the Temple; though not by choice. The edifice was, according to rabbinical legend, miraculously constructed throughout, the large heavy stones rising and settling in their respective places of themselves. The general opinion of the Rabbis is that Solomon hewed the stones by means of a ''[[Solomon's Shamir|shamir]]'', a mythical worm whose mere touch cleft rocks. According to [[Midrash Tehillim]], the shamir was brought from paradise by Solomon's eagle; but most of the rabbis state that Solomon was informed of the worm's haunts by Asmodeus. The shamir had been entrusted by the prince of the sea to the mountain rooster alone, and the rooster had sworn to guard it well, but Solomon's men found the bird's nest, and covered it with glass. When the bird returned, it used the shamir to break the glass, whereupon the men scared the bird, causing it to drop the worm, which the men could then bring to Solomon.\n\n====In the Kabbalah====\n\nEarly adherents of the [[Kabbalah]] portray Solomon as having sailed through the air on a throne of light placed on an eagle, which brought him near the heavenly gates as well as to the dark mountains behind which the fallen angels ''Uzza'' and ''Azzazel'' were chained; the eagle would rest on the chains, and Solomon, using the magic ring, would compel the two angels to reveal every mystery he desired to know.\n\n====The palace without entrance====\n\nAccording to one legend, while traveling magically, Solomon noticed a magnificent palace to which there appeared to be no entrance. He ordered the demons to climb to the roof and see if they could discover any living being within the building but they found only an eagle, which said that it was 700 years old, but that it had never seen an entrance. An elder brother of the eagle, 900 years old, was then found, but it also did not know the entrance. The eldest brother of these two birds, which was 1,300 years old, then declared it had been informed by its father that the door was on the west side, but that it had become hidden by sand drifted by the wind. Having discovered the entrance, Solomon found an idol inside that had in its mouth a silver tablet saying in Greek (a language not thought by modern scholars to have existed 1000 years before the time of Solomon) that the statue was of ''Shaddad, the son of 'Ad'', and that it had ''reigned over a million cities, rode on a million horses, had under it a million vassals and slew a million warriors'', yet it could not resist the [[death (personification)|angel of death]].<ref name=JE />\n\n===Throne===\n\n[[File:Wurzach Pfarrkirche Decke Westteil.jpg|thumb|''Solomon at his throne'', painting by Andreas Brugger, 1777]]\n\nSolomon's throne is described at length in [[Targum Sheni]], which is compiled from three different sources, and in two later [[Midrash]]. According to these, there were on the steps of the throne twelve golden lions, each facing a golden eagle. There were six steps to the throne, on which animals, all of gold, were arranged in the following order: on the first step a lion opposite an ox; on the second, a wolf opposite a sheep; on the third, a tiger opposite a camel; on the fourth, an eagle opposite a peacock, on the fifth, a cat opposite a cock; on the sixth, a sparrow-hawk opposite a dove. On the top of the throne was a dove holding a sparrow-hawk in its claws, symbolizing the dominion of Israel over the Gentiles. The first midrash claims that six steps were constructed because Solomon foresaw that six kings would sit on the throne, namely, Solomon, [[Rehoboam]], [[Hezekiah]], [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], [[Amon of Judah|Amon]], and [[Josiah]]. There was also on the top of the throne a golden [[candelabrum]], on the seven branches of the one side of which were engraved the names of the seven patriarchs Adam, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Job, and on the seven of the other the names of Levi, Kohath, Amram, Moses, Aaron, Eldad, Medad, and, in addition, Hur (another version has Haggai). Above the candelabrum was a golden jar filled with olive oil and beneath it a golden basin which supplied the jar with oil and on which the names of Nadab, Abihu, and Eli and his two sons were engraved. Over the throne, twenty-four vines were fixed to cast a shadow on the king's head.<ref name=JE />\n\nBy a mechanical contrivance the throne followed Solomon wherever he wished to go. Supposedly, due to another mechanical trick, when the king reached the first step, the ox stretched forth its leg, on which Solomon leaned, a similar action taking place in the case of the animals on each of the six steps. From the sixth step the eagles raised the king and placed him in his seat, near which a golden serpent lay coiled. When the king was seated the large eagle placed the crown on his head, the serpent uncoiled itself, and the lions and eagles moved upward to form a shade over him. The dove then descended, took the scroll of the Law from the Ark, and placed it on Solomon's knees. When the king sat, surrounded by the [[Sanhedrin]], to judge the people, the wheels began to turn, and the beasts and fowls began to utter their respective cries, which frightened those who had intended to bear false testimony. Moreover, while Solomon was ascending the throne, the lions scattered all kinds of fragrant spices. After Solomon's death, Pharaoh [[Shishak]], when taking away the treasures of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] (I Kings xiv. 26), carried off the throne, which remained in Egypt until [[Sennacherib]] conquered that country. After Sennacherib's fall Hezekiah gained possession of it, but when Josiah was slain by Pharaoh [[Necho II|Necho]], the latter took it away. However, according to [[rabbinical]] accounts, Necho did not know how the mechanism worked and so accidentally struck himself with one of the lions causing him to become lame; Nebuchadnezzar, into whose possession the throne subsequently came, shared a similar fate. The throne then passed to the Persians, whose king [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] was the first to sit successfully on Solomon's throne after his death; subsequently the throne came into the possession of the Greeks and [[Ahasuerus]].<ref name=JE />\n\n==Freemasonry==\n\n[[Masonic ritual and symbolism|Masonic ritual]]s refer to King Solomon and the building of his Temple.<ref name=\"lodgechelmsford\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lodgechelmsford.com/|title=Index of /|publisher=lodgechelmsford.com|accessdate=2014-08-29}}</ref> [[Masonic Temple]]s, where a [[Masonic Lodge]] meets, are an [[allegory|allegorical]] reference to King Solomon's Temple.<ref name=\"masons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.masons.org.au/index.php|title=Freemasons NSW ACT\u2014Home|publisher=masons.org.au|accessdate=2014-08-29}}</ref>\n\n==In literature, art, and music==\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Literature===\n\n* In [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' (1885) the protagonists discover multiple settings said to belong to, or having been built at the request of King Solomon, such as 'Solomon's Great Road' and the mines themselves. Also, the two mountains which form the entrance to Kukuana Land (where the mines are located in the novel) are referred to as 'Sheba's Breasts' which could well be an allusion to the Queen of Sheba, with whom King Solomon had a relationship; or alternatively Solomon's mother, who was named Bathsheba. When in the mines the characters also contemplate what must have occurred to prevent King Solomon from ever returning to retrieve the massive amounts of diamonds, gold and ivory tusks that were found buried in his great 'Treasure Chamber'.\n* In ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' the spirit of Solomon appears to [[Dante Alighieri]] in the Heaven of the Sun with other exemplars of inspired wisdom.\n* In [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s ''[[Die Physiker]]'', the physicist M\u00f6bius claims that Solomon appears to him and dictates the \"theory of all possible inventions\" (based on ''[[Unified Field Theory]]'').\n* Solomon appears in Kipling's ''[[Just So Stories]]''.\n* In [[Neal Stephenson]]'s three-volume ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]'', 17th-century alchemists like [[Isaac Newton]] believe that Solomon created a kind of \"heavier\" gold with mystical properties and that it was cached in the [[Solomon Islands]] where it was accidentally discovered by the crew of a wayward Spanish galleon. In the third volume of ''The Baroque Cycle, The System of the World'', a mysterious member of the entourage of Czar [[Peter I of Russia]], named \"Solomon [[Kohen|Kohan]]\" appears in early 18th-century London. The czar, traveling incognito to purchase English-made ships for [[Imperial Russian Navy#Russian Navy during the reign of Peter the Great|his navy]], explains that he added him to his court after the [[Azov campaigns#The second Azov campaign|Sack of Azov]], where Kohan had been a guest of the [[Pasha]]. Solomon Kohan is later revealed as one of the extremely long-lived \"Wise,\" such as [[Enoch Root]], and compares a courtyard full of inventors' workstations to \"an operation I used to have in Jerusalem a long time ago\", denominating either facility as \"a temple\". Stephenson's sequel to ''[[Reamde]]'', 2019's ''[[Fall; or, Dodge in Hell]]'' was also a surprise sequel to the Baroque Cycle novels and ''[[Cryptonomicon]]''. In the mid- to late-21st century span of ''Fall'', Solomon Kohan has joined the faculty of Princeton University, going by ''Solly Pesador,'' and is described by a student as \"one of those guys who had ''been around forever'' and played roles in tech companies going at least as far back as [[Hewlett-Packard]]\" and as an \"old-school tech geek turned neuro-hacker.\"\n* In ''[[The Ring of Solomon|Bartimaeus: The Ring of Solomon]]'', both King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba are featured prominently.\n* Solomon, King of Urushalim, is a significant character in ''[[The Shadow Prince]]'',<ref>{{Cite book |isbn = 978-1533673503|title = The Shadow Prince|last1 = Armstrong|first1 = Philip|date = 2016-07-17}}</ref> the first novel of [[Philip Armstrong]]'s epic [[historical fantasy]], ''[[The Chronicles of Tupiluliuma]]''. His Ring is an Atalanta\u00ebn Relic, by which is he able to command daemons. He uses it to summon a daemon army, thereafter called the Cohort of Free Daemons, to oppose the forces of the Chaos God, [[Sutekh]], thus allowing the young Hittite musician, Lisarwa, to repair the Veil that separates the physical world from the dangerous wild energies of the Netherworld, using another of the relics, the Harp of Daud, once owned by his father (King David). Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]] also appears in a minor capacity.\n* In the Japanese manga series ''[[Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic]]'', Solomon was a powerful magician who united all of the world under his peaceful rule. However, when this world was destroyed by a calamity, he created the world ''Magi'' is set in and saved mankind by sending them there. A special power originated from him, the \"Wisdom of Solomon\", allows the main character Aladdin to talk directly with the soul of a person, alive or dead.\n* In ''[[Makai Ouji: Devils and Realist]]'', Solomon is a friend of Lucifer and is the \"Elector\"\u2014the one who can choose the interim ruler over Hell as its emperor rests to regain his strength and had powers over demons known as his seventy-two pillars.

He is described as king of the United Monarchy, which broke apart into the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] shortly after his death. Following the split, his [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] descendants ruled over Judah alone.\n\nAccording to the [[Talmud]], Solomon is one of the 48 [[Prophets in Judaism|prophet]]s.<ref>{{Citation |last=[[Rashi]] |title=''to'' Megillah |at=14a}}</ref> In the Quran, he is considered a major [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]], and [[Muslim]]s generally refer to him by the Arabic variant [[Solomon in Islam|Sulayman]], son of [[David in Islam|David]].\n\nThe Hebrew Bible identifies him as the builder of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] in Jerusalem,<ref name='JewEnc'/> beginning in the fourth year of his reign, using the vast wealth he and his father had accumulated. He dedicated the temple to [[Yahweh]], the God of Israel.<ref>1 Kings 5:3; 8:20</ref> He is portrayed as great in [[Wisdom#Judaism|wisdom]], wealth and power beyond either of the previous kings of the country, but also as a king who sinned. His sins included [[idolatry]], marrying foreign women and, ultimately, turning away from Yahweh, and they led to the kingdom's being torn in two during the reign of his son [[Rehoboam]].\n\nSolomon is the subject of many other later references and legends, most notably in the 1st century [[apocryphal]] work known as the [[Testament of Solomon]]. In the [[New Testament]], he is portrayed as a teacher of wisdom excelled by [[Jesus]],<ref>Matthew 12:42; Luke 11:31</ref> and as arrayed in glory, but excelled by \"the [[Lilium|lilies]] of the field\".<ref>Matthew 6:28\u201329; Luke 12:27</ref> In later years, in mostly non-biblical circles, Solomon also came to be known as a [[Magic (paranormal)|magician]] and an [[exorcist]], with numerous [[amulet]]s and medallion seals dating from the [[Hellenistic]] period invoking his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmc-terrasanta.org/en/archaeology-culture-and-other-religions.html?vid=3586 |title=Archaeology, Culture, and other Religions |publisher=FMC terra santa |accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref>\n\n==Biblical account==\nThe life of Solomon is primarily described in 2{{nbsp}}[[Book of Samuel]], and in 2{{nbsp}}[[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] and 1{{nbsp}}[[Books of Kings|Kings]].

Thiele]], the death of Solomon and the division of his kingdom would have occurred in the spring of 931 BCE.{{Sfn|Thiele|1983|p=78}}\n\n===Childhood===\n\nSolomon was born in [[Jerusalem]],<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Chronicles|14:4}}</ref> the second born child of [[David]] and his wife [[Bathsheba]], widow of [[Uriah the Hittite]]. The first child (unnamed in that account), a son conceived adulterously during Uriah's lifetime, had died as a punishment on account of the death of Uriah by David's order. Solomon had three named full brothers born to Bathsheba: [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], Shammua, and Shobab,<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Chronicles|3:5}}</ref> besides six known older half-brothers born of as many mothers.<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Chronicles|3:1\u20134}}</ref> \n\nThe biblical narrative shows that Solomon served as a peace offering between God and David, due to his adulterous relationship with Bathsheba. In an effort to hide this sin, for example, he sent the woman's husband to battle, hoping that he would be killed there. After he died, David was finally able to marry his wife. As punishment, the first child, who was conceived during the adulterous relationship, died.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Solomon|last=Vance|first=Jennifer|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2015|isbn=9781681461182|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Solomon was born after David was forgiven.

He founded numerous colonies, some of which doubled as trading posts and military outposts.\n\nTrade relationships were a focus of his administration. In particular he continued his father's very profitable relationship with the Phoenician king [[Hiram I]] of Tyre (see 'wealth' below); they sent out joint expeditions to the lands of [[Tarshish]] and [[Ophir]] to engage in the trade of luxury products, importing gold, silver, sandalwood, pearls, ivory, apes and peacocks. Solomon is considered the most wealthy of the Israelite kings named in the Bible.\n\n===Wisdom===\n\n[[File:Luca Giordano - Dream of Solomon - WGA09004.jpg|thumbnail|[[Luca Giordano]]: The ''Dream of Solomon'': God promises Solomon wisdom]]\n\nSolomon was the biblical king most famous for his [[wisdom]]. In 1{{nbsp}}Kings he sacrificed to God, and God later appeared to him in a dream,<ref>1 Kings 3:3\u201315</ref> asking what Solomon wanted from God. Solomon asked for wisdom. Pleased, God personally answered Solomon's prayer, promising him great wisdom because he did not ask for self-serving rewards like long life or the death of his enemies.\n[[File:Plaque Castelli Salomon Mus\u00e9e de Lille 130108.jpg|thumb|''The Judgment of Solomon'', painting on ceramic, Castelli, 18th century, Lille Museum of Fine Arts]]\n\nPerhaps the best known story of his wisdom is the [[Judgment of Solomon]]; two women each lay claim to being the mother of the same child. Solomon easily resolved the dispute by commanding the child to be cut in half and shared between the two. One woman promptly renounced her claim, proving that she would rather give the child up than see it killed. Solomon declared the woman who showed [[compassion]] to be the true mother, entitled to the whole child.<ref>1 Kings 3:16\u201328</ref>\n\nSolomon was traditionally considered the author of several biblical books, \"including not only the collections of [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], but also of [[Ecclesiastes]] and the [[Song of Solomon]] and the later apocryphal book the [[Wisdom of solomon|Wisdom of Solomon.]]\"{{Sfn|Coogan|2009|p=375}}\n\n===Wealth===\n\n{{See also|Solomon's Temple}}\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the [[United Monarchy|Israelite monarchy]] gained its highest splendour and wealth during Solomon's reign of 40 years. In a single year, according to {{bibleverse|1|Kings|10:14|HE}}, Solomon collected [[tribute]] amounting to 666 [[talent (weight)|talents]] (18,125 kilograms) of gold. Solomon is described as surrounding himself with all the luxuries and the grandeur of an [[Eastern world|Eastern]] monarch, and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with [[Hiram I]], king of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings.\n\n===Construction projects===\n[[File:Solomon and the Plan for the Temple.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Solomon plans the building of the temple|Solomon and the plan for the [[First Temple]]. Illustration from a Bible card published by the Providence Lithograph Co.]]\n\nFor some years before his death, David was engaged in collecting materials for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent home for [[Yahweh]] and the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Solomon is described as undertaking the construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|temple]], with the help of an architect, also named [[Hiram Abiff|Hiram]], and other materials, sent from King Hiram of Tyre.\n\nAfter the completion of the temple, Solomon is described in the biblical narrative as erecting many other buildings of importance in [[Jerusalem]]. For 13 years, he was engaged in the building of a royal palace on [[Ophel]] (a hilly promontory in central Jerusalem). This complex included buildings referred to as:\n:The House (or Hall) of the Forest of Lebanon <ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|10:17|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|9:20|NKJV}}: \"House\" in the [[King James Version]] and [[Revised Standard Version]], \"Hall\" in the [[Jerusalem Bible]] and [[Good News Translation]]</ref>\n:The Hall or Porch of Pillars\n:The Hall of the Throne or the Hall of Justice\nas well as his own residence and a residence for his wife, Pharaoh's daughter.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|7:1-8|NKJV}}</ref>\n[[File:SolomonsTemple.png|thumb|220px|A sketch of [[Solomon's Temple]], based on descriptions in the Scriptures.]]\n\n[[Solomon's Throne|Solomon's throne]] is said to have been a spectacle, seeing that it was one of the earliest mechanical devices built by man. Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply of water for the city, and the [[Millo]] ([[Septuagint]], ''Acra'') for the defense of the city. However, excavations of Jerusalem have shown a distinct lack of monumental architecture from the era, and no remains of either the Temple or Solomon's palace have been found.\n\nSolomon is also described as rebuilding cities elsewhere in Israel, creating the port of [[Ezion-Geber]], and constructing [[Palmyra]] in the wilderness as a commercial depot and military outpost. Although the location of the port of Ezion-Geber is known, no remains have ever been found. More archaeological success has been achieved with the major cities Solomon is said to have strengthened or rebuilt, for example, [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] and [[Gezer]].<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|9:15|HE}}</ref> These all have substantial ancient remains, including impressive six-chambered gates, and [[ashlar]] palaces; however it is no longer the scholarly consensus that these structures date to the time, according to the Bible, when Solomon ruled.<ref name=Finkelstein />\n\nAccording to the Bible, during Solomon's reign, Israel enjoyed great commercial prosperity, with extensive traffic being carried on by land with [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Egypt]], and [[Arabia]], and by sea with [[Tarshish]], [[Ophir]], and [[South India]].\n\n===Wives and concubines===\n[[File:Giovanni Venanzi di Pesaro K\u00f6nig Salomons G\u00f6tzendienst.jpg|thumb|275x275px|King Solomon with his wives.

The biblical narrative notes with disapproval that Solomon permitted his foreign wives to import their national deities, building temples to [[Ashtoreth]] and [[Milcom]].\n\nIn the branch of literary analysis that examines the Bible, called [[higher criticism]], the story of Solomon falling into idolatry by the influence of [[Pharaoh's daughter (wife of Solomon)|Pharaoh's daughter]] and his other foreign wives is \"customarily seen as the handiwork of the [[Documentary hypothesis|'deuteronomistic historian(s)']]\", who are held to have written, compiled, or edited texts to legitimize the reforms of [[Hezekiah]]'s great-grandson, King [[Josiah]] who reigned from about 641 to 609 BCE (over 280 years after Solomon's death according to Bible scholars).<ref name=\"HC\">{{cite web|title=Loving too well: The negative portrayal of Solomon and the composition of the Kings history|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=13777356}} Retrieved on Jan. 17, 2007</ref> Scholarly consensus in this field holds that \"Solomon's wives/women were introduced in the 'Josianic' (customarily Dtr) edition of Kings as a theological construct to blame the schism [between Judah and the Northern Kingdom of Israel] on his misdeeds\".<ref name=\"HC\" />\n\n===Relationship with Queen of Sheba===\n\n{{Main article|Queen of Sheba}}\n{{See also|Kebra Nagast}}\n[[File:'The Visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon', oil on canvas painting by Edward Poynter, 1890, Art Gallery of New South Wales.jpg|thumb|''The Visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon''.

The queen is described as visiting with a number of gifts including gold, spices and precious stones. When Solomon gave her \"all her desire, whatsoever she asked\", she left satisfied ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+10%3A10&version=NIV 1 Kings 10:10]).\n\nWhether the passage is simply to provide a brief token, foreign witness of Solomon's wealth and wisdom, or whether there is meant to be something more significant to the queen's visit is unknown; nevertheless the visit of the Queen of Sheba has become the subject of numerous stories.\n\n[[Sheba]] is typically identified as [[Sabaeans|Saba]], a nation once spanning the [[Red Sea]] on the coasts of what are now [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Yemen]], in [[Arabia Felix]]; although other sources place it in the area of what is now northern Ethiopia and Eritrea.<ref>Stuart Munro-Hay, ''The Quest for the Ark of the Covenant: The True History of the Tablets of Moses''.</ref><ref>[[Donald N. Levine]], ''Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopia Culture'' (Chicago: University Press, 1972).</ref> In a Rabbinical account (e.g. [[Targum Sheni]]), Solomon was accustomed to ordering the living creatures of the world to dance before him (Rabbinical accounts say that Solomon had been given control over all living things by Yahweh), but one day upon discovering that the mountain-cock or [[hoopoe]] (Aramaic name: ''nagar tura'') was absent, he summoned it to him, and the bird told him that it had been searching for somewhere new (see: [[s:Translation:Colloquy of the Queen of Sheba|Colloquy of the Queen of Sheba]]).\n[[File:Saabaghiberti.jpg|thumb|200px|Renaissance relief of the Queen of Sheba meeting Solomon\u2014[[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]]'s Gates of Paradise at the [[Florence Baptistry]]]]\n\nThe bird had discovered a land in the east, exceedingly rich in gold, silver, and plants, whose capital was called ''Kitor'' and whose ruler was the Queen of Sheba, and the bird, on its own advice, was sent by Solomon to request the queen's immediate attendance at Solomon's court.\n\nAn Ethiopian account from the 14th century (''[[Kebra Nagast]]'') maintains that the Queen of Sheba had sexual relations with King Solomon and gave birth by the Mai Bella stream in the province of [[Hamasien]], [[Eritrea]]. The Ethiopian tradition has a [[Queen of Sheba#Ethiopian accounts|detailed account of the affair]]. The child was a son who went on to become [[Menelik I]], King of [[Kingdom of Axum|Axum]], and founded a [[Solomonic dynasty|dynasty]] that would reign as the first Jewish, then Christian [[Empire of Ethiopia]] for 2,900+ years (less one [[Zagwe dynasty|usurpation episode]], an interval of about 133 years until a legitimate male heir regained the crown) until [[Haile Selassie]] was overthrown in 1974. Menelik was said to be a practicing Jew who was given a replica of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] by King Solomon; and, moreover, that the original was switched and went to [[Axum]] with him and his mother, and is still there, guarded by a single priest charged with caring for the artifact as his life's task.\n\nThe claim of such a lineage and of possession of the Ark has been an important source of legitimacy and prestige for the Ethiopian monarchy throughout the many centuries of its existence, and had important and lasting effects on [[Culture of Ethiopia|Ethiopian culture]] as a whole.

In {{bibleverse ||Deuteronomy|17:16\u201317|HE}}, a king is commanded not to multiply horses or wives, neither greatly multiply to himself gold or silver. Solomon sins in all three of these areas. Solomon collects [[666 (number)|666]] [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of gold each year ({{bibleverse |1|Kings|10:14|HE}}), a huge amount of money for a small nation like Israel. Solomon gathers a large number of horses and chariots and even brings in horses from Egypt. Just as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|17|HE}} warns, collecting horses and chariots takes Israel back to Egypt.

Upon Solomon's death, his son, [[Rehoboam]], succeeds him. However, ten of the [[Tribes of Israel]] refuse to accept him as king, splitting the [[United Monarchy]] in the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] under [[Jeroboam]], while Rehoboam continues to reign over the much smaller southern [[Kingdom of Judah]]. Henceforth the two kingdoms are never again united.\n\n==Jewish scripture==\n\nKing Solomon is one of the central biblical figures in [[Judaism|Jewish heritage]] that have lasting religious, national and political aspects. As the builder of the [[First Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] and last ruler of the united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] before its division into the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], Solomon is associated with the peak \"golden age\" of the independent Kingdom of Israel as well as a source of judicial and religious wisdom. According to Jewish tradition, King Solomon wrote three [[books of the Bible]]:\n* ''Mishlei'' ([[Book of Proverbs]]), a collection of fables and wisdom of life\n* ''Kohelet'' ([[Ecclesiastes]]), a book of contemplation and his self-reflection.\n* ''Shir ha-Shirim'' ([[Song of Songs]]), an unusual collection of poetry interspersed with verse, whose interpretation is either literal (i.e., a romantic and sexual relationship between a man and a woman) or metaphorical (a relationship between God and his people).\n\nThe Hebrew word \"To Solomon\" (which can also be translated as \"by Solomon\") appears in the title of two hymns, 72 and 127, in the book of [[Psalms]] (''Tehillim''), suggesting to some that Solomon wrote them.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Apocryphal or Deuterocanonical texts==\n\nRabbinical tradition attributes the ''[[Wisdom of Solomon]]'' (included within the [[Septuagint]]) to Solomon, although this book was probably written in the 2nd century BCE. In this work, Solomon is portrayed as an [[astronomer]]. Other books of [[wisdom poetry]] such as the ''[[Odes of Solomon]]'' and the ''[[Psalms of Solomon]]'' also bear his name. The Jewish historian [[Eupolemus]], who wrote about 157 BCE, included copies of [[apocryphal]] letters exchanged between Solomon and the kings of [[Egypt]] and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]].\n\nThe [[Gnostic]] ''[[Apocalypse of Adam]]'', which may date to the 1st or 2nd century, refers to a legend in which Solomon sends out an army of [[demon]]s to seek a virgin who had fled from him, perhaps the earliest surviving mention of the later common tale that Solomon controlled demons and made them his slaves. This tradition of Solomon's control over demons appears fully elaborated in the early [[pseudographical]] work called the ''[[Testament of Solomon]]'' with its elaborate and grotesque [[demonology]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=897&letter=S |title= Solomon, Testament of | website =Jewish Encyclopedia | accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref>\n\n==Historicity==\n\n{{see also|David#David_in_history.2C_archeology_and_literature|l1=David: Historicity|Kingdom_of_Israel_(united_monarchy)#Archaeological_record|l2=United Monarchy: Historicity|Jeroboam%27s_Revolt#Historicity|l3=Jeroboam's Revolt: Historicity}}\n\nAs with most biblical personages in the middle era of Israelite society, the historicity of Solomon is hotly debated. Current consensus states that regardless of whether or not a man named Solomon truly reigned as king over the Judean hills in the 10th century BCE, the biblical descriptions of his apparent empire's lavishness is almost surely an anachronistic invention.{{Sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2006|page=20}} \n\nAs for Solomon himself, scholars on both the maximalist and minimalist sides of the spectrum of biblical archeology generally agree Solomon himself probably existed,{{Sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2006|page=20}} however, a historically accurate picture of the Davidic king is difficult to construct. The ''de facto'' accepted position based on these assumptions is that Solomon could have only been the monarch or [[chieftain]] of Judah, which was likely small, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development.

The first-century [[Roman Jews|Romano-Jewish]] scholar [[Josephus]] in ''[[Against Apion]]'', citing [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] court records and [[Menander]], gives a specific year during which [[King Hiram I]] of Tyre sent materials to Solomon for the construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]].<ref>''[[Against Apion]]'' i:17, 18.</ref> However, no material evidence indisputably of Solomon's reign has been found.

According to ''The Bible Unearthed'', archaeological evidence suggests that the kingdom of Israel at the time of Solomon was little more than a small city state, and so it is implausible that Solomon received tribute as large as 666 [[talent (weight)|talents]] of gold per year. Although both Finkelstein and Silberman accept that David and Solomon were real inhabitants of Judah about the 10th century BCE,{{Sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2006|page=20}} they claim that the earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel is about 890 BCE, and for Judah about 750 BCE. They suggest that because of religious prejudice, the authors of the Bible suppressed the achievements of the [[Omrides]] (whom the Hebrew Bible describes as being [[polytheist]]), and instead pushed them back to a supposed golden age of Judaism and monotheists, and devotees of Yahweh. Some [[biblical minimalism|Biblical minimalists]] like [[Thomas L.

The metals from Tarshish were reportedly obtained by Solomon in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships that sailed in their service, and the silver-hoards provide the first recognized material evidence that agrees with the ancient texts concerning Solomon's kingdom and his wealth (see 'wealth' below).\n\nPossible evidence for the described wealth of Solomon and his kingdom was discovered in ancient silver-hoards, which were found in Israel and Phoenicia and recognized for their importance in 2003.

Some commentators see this as an issue that can be reconciled while others disagree. For instance, it has been suggested that Matthew is using Joseph's genealogy and Luke is using Mary's, but [[Darrell Bock]] states that this would be unprecedented, \"especially when no other single woman appears in the line\". Other suggestions include the use by one of the royal and the other of the natural line, one using the legal line and the other the physical line, or that Joseph was adopted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bock |first=Darell|title=Luke |series=The NIV Application Commentary |year=1996|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-49330-3|page=124}}</ref>\n\nJesus makes reference to Solomon, using him for comparison purposes in his admonition against worrying about your life. This account is recorded in Matthew 6:29 and the parallel passage in Luke 12:27\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Solomon is commemorated as a [[saint]], with the title of \"Righteous Prophet and King\". His [[feast day]] is celebrated on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before the [[Great Feast]] of the [[Christmas|Nativity of the Lord]]).\n\nThe staunchly Catholic King [[Philip II of Spain]] sought to model himself after King Solomon. Statues of [[King David]] and Solomon stand on either side of the entrance to the [[basilica]] of [[El Escorial]], Philip's palace, and Solomon is also depicted in a great fresco at the center of El Escorial's library. Philip identified the warrior-king David with his own father [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], and himself sought to emulate the thoughtful and logical character which he perceived in Solomon. Moreover, the structure of the Escorial was inspired by that of Solomon's Temple.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ren\u00e9 |last=Taylor |language=Spanish|title=Arquitectura y Magia.

Since the bottle was sealed with Solomon's seal, the genie was helpless to free himself, until freed many centuries later by a fisherman who discovered the bottle.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/16/201.html \"The Story of the Fisherman\", ''Stories from the Thousand and One Nights'', The Harvard Classics, 1909\u201314]</ref> In other stories from the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', protagonists who had to leave their homeland and travel to the unknown places of the world saw signs which proved that Solomon had already been there. Sometimes, protagonists discovered words of Solomon that were intended to help those who were lost and had unluckily reached those forbidden and deserted places.\n\n===Angels and magic===\n\nAccording to the [[Rabbinical literature]], on account of his modest request for wisdom only, Solomon was rewarded with riches and an unprecedented glorious realm, which extended over the upper world inhabited by the angels and over the whole of the terrestrial globe with all its inhabitants, including all the beasts, fowl, and reptiles, as well as the demons and spirits. His control over the demons, spirits, and animals augmented his splendor, the demons bringing him precious stones, besides water from distant countries to irrigate his exotic plants. The beasts and fowl of their own accord entered the kitchen of Solomon's palace, so that they might be used as food for him, and extravagant meals for him were prepared daily by each of his 700 wives and 300 concubines, with the thought that perhaps the king would feast that day in her house.\n\n====Seal of Solomon====\n\nA [[magic ring]] called the \"[[Seal of Solomon]]\" was supposedly given to Solomon and gave him power over demons or [[Jinn]]. The magical symbol said to have been on the Seal of Solomon which made it efficacious is often considered to be the ''[[Star of David]]''{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} though this emblem (also known as the Shield of David) is known to have been associated with Judaism only as recently as the 11th century CE while the five pointed star (pentagram) can be found on jars and other artifacts from Jerusalem dating back to at least the 2nd and 4th centuries BCE and is more likely to have been the emblem found on the ring purportedly used by King Solomon to control the Jinn or demons. [[Asmodai|Asmodeus]], king of demons, was one day, according to the classical Rabbis, captured by [[Benaiah]] using the ring, and was forced to remain in Solomon's service. In one tale, Asmodeus brought a man with two heads from under the earth to show Solomon; the man, unable to return, married a woman from Jerusalem and had seven sons, six of whom resembled the mother, while one resembled the father in having two heads. After their father's death, the son with two heads claimed two shares of the inheritance, arguing that he was two men; Solomon decided that the son with two heads was only one man. The Seal of Solomon, in some legends known as the Ring of Aandaleeb, was a highly sought after symbol of power. In several legends, different groups or individuals attempted to steal it or attain it in some manner.\n\n====Solomon and Asmodeus====\n\nOne legend concerning [[Asmodeus]] (see: [[s:Translation:The Story of King Solomon and Ashmedai|The Story of King Solomon and Ashmedai]]) goes on to state that Solomon one day asked Asmodeus what could make demons powerful over man, and Asmodeus asked to be freed and given the ring so that he could demonstrate; Solomon agreed but Asmodeus threw the ring into the sea and it was swallowed by a fish. Asmodeus then swallowed the king, stood up fully with one wing touching heaven and the other earth, and spat out Solomon to a distance of 400 miles. The Rabbis claim this was a divine punishment for Solomon's having failed to follow three divine commands, and Solomon was forced to wander from city to city, until he eventually arrived in an Ammonite city where he was forced to work in the king's kitchens. Solomon gained a chance to prepare a meal for the Ammonite king, which the king found so impressive that the previous cook was sacked and Solomon put in his place; the king's daughter, [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]], subsequently fell in love with Solomon, but the family (thinking Solomon a commoner) disapproved, so the king decided to kill them both by sending them into the desert. Solomon and the king's daughter wandered the desert until they reached a coastal city, where they bought a fish to eat, which just happened to be the one which had swallowed the magic ring. Solomon was then able to regain his throne and expel Asmodeus. The element of a ring thrown into the sea and found back in a fish's belly also appeared in [[Herodotus]]' account of [[Polycrates]], the [[tyrant]] of [[Samos]] (c. 538\u2013522 BCE).\n\nIn another familiar version of the legend of the Seal of Solomon, Asmodeus disguises himself. In some myths, he's disguised as King Solomon himself, while in more frequently heard versions he's disguised as a falcon, calling himself Gavyn (Gavinn or Gavin), one of King Solomon's trusted friends. The concealed Asmodeus tells travelers who have ventured up to King Solomon's grand lofty palace that the Seal of Solomon was thrown into the sea. He then convinces them to plunge in and attempt to retrieve it, for if they do they would take the throne as king.\n\n====Artifacts====\n\nOther magical items attributed to Solomon are [[key of Solomon|his key]] and his Table. The latter was said to be held in [[Toledo, Spain]] during [[Visigoth]] rule and was part of the loot taken by [[Tarik ibn Ziyad]] during the [[Umayyad Conquest of Iberia]], according to [[Ibn Abd-el-Hakem]]'s ''History of the Conquest of Spain''. The former appears in the title of the [[Lesser Key of Solomon]], a [[grimoire]] whose [[Frame story|framing story]] is Solomon capturing demons using his ring, and forcing them to explain themselves to him. In ''The Book of Deadly Names'', purportedly translated from Arabic manuscripts found hidden in a building in Spain, the \"King of the Jinn\" Fiqitush brings 72 Jinn before King Solomon to confess their corruptions and places of residence. Fiqitush tells King Solomon the recipes for curing such corruptions as each evil Jinn confesses.\n\n====Angels====\n\nAngels also helped Solomon in building the Temple; though not by choice. The edifice was, according to rabbinical legend, miraculously constructed throughout, the large heavy stones rising and settling in their respective places of themselves. The general opinion of the Rabbis is that Solomon hewed the stones by means of a ''[[Solomon's Shamir|shamir]]'', a mythical worm whose mere touch cleft rocks. According to [[Midrash Tehillim]], the shamir was brought from paradise by Solomon's eagle; but most of the rabbis state that Solomon was informed of the worm's haunts by Asmodeus. The shamir had been entrusted by the prince of the sea to the mountain rooster alone, and the rooster had sworn to guard it well, but Solomon's men found the bird's nest, and covered it with glass. When the bird returned, it used the shamir to break the glass, whereupon the men scared the bird, causing it to drop the worm, which the men could then bring to Solomon.\n\n====In the Kabbalah====\n\nEarly adherents of the [[Kabbalah]] portray Solomon as having sailed through the air on a throne of light placed on an eagle, which brought him near the heavenly gates as well as to the dark mountains behind which the fallen angels ''Uzza'' and ''Azzazel'' were chained; the eagle would rest on the chains, and Solomon, using the magic ring, would compel the two angels to reveal every mystery he desired to know.\n\n====The palace without entrance====\n\nAccording to one legend, while traveling magically, Solomon noticed a magnificent palace to which there appeared to be no entrance. He ordered the demons to climb to the roof and see if they could discover any living being within the building but they found only an eagle, which said that it was 700 years old, but that it had never seen an entrance. An elder brother of the eagle, 900 years old, was then found, but it also did not know the entrance. The eldest brother of these two birds, which was 1,300 years old, then declared it had been informed by its father that the door was on the west side, but that it had become hidden by sand drifted by the wind. Having discovered the entrance, Solomon found an idol inside that had in its mouth a silver tablet saying in Greek (a language not thought by modern scholars to have existed 1000 years before the time of Solomon) that the statue was of ''Shaddad, the son of 'Ad'', and that it had ''reigned over a million cities, rode on a million horses, had under it a million vassals and slew a million warriors'', yet it could not resist the [[death (personification)|angel of death]].<ref name=JE />\n\n===Throne===\n\n[[File:Wurzach Pfarrkirche Decke Westteil.jpg|thumb|''Solomon at his throne'', painting by Andreas Brugger, 1777]]\n\nSolomon's throne is described at length in [[Targum Sheni]], which is compiled from three different sources, and in two later [[Midrash]]. According to these, there were on the steps of the throne twelve golden lions, each facing a golden eagle. There were six steps to the throne, on which animals, all of gold, were arranged in the following order: on the first step a lion opposite an ox; on the second, a wolf opposite a sheep; on the third, a tiger opposite a camel; on the fourth, an eagle opposite a peacock, on the fifth, a cat opposite a cock; on the sixth, a sparrow-hawk opposite a dove. On the top of the throne was a dove holding a sparrow-hawk in its claws, symbolizing the dominion of Israel over the Gentiles. The first midrash claims that six steps were constructed because Solomon foresaw that six kings would sit on the throne, namely, Solomon, [[Rehoboam]], [[Hezekiah]], [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], [[Amon of Judah|Amon]], and [[Josiah]]. There was also on the top of the throne a golden [[candelabrum]], on the seven branches of the one side of which were engraved the names of the seven patriarchs Adam, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Job, and on the seven of the other the names of Levi, Kohath, Amram, Moses, Aaron, Eldad, Medad, and, in addition, Hur (another version has Haggai). Above the candelabrum was a golden jar filled with olive oil and beneath it a golden basin which supplied the jar with oil and on which the names of Nadab, Abihu, and Eli and his two sons were engraved. Over the throne, twenty-four vines were fixed to cast a shadow on the king's head.<ref name=JE />\n\nBy a mechanical contrivance the throne followed Solomon wherever he wished to go. Supposedly, due to another mechanical trick, when the king reached the first step, the ox stretched forth its leg, on which Solomon leaned, a similar action taking place in the case of the animals on each of the six steps. From the sixth step the eagles raised the king and placed him in his seat, near which a golden serpent lay coiled. When the king was seated the large eagle placed the crown on his head, the serpent uncoiled itself, and the lions and eagles moved upward to form a shade over him. The dove then descended, took the scroll of the Law from the Ark, and placed it on Solomon's knees. When the king sat, surrounded by the [[Sanhedrin]], to judge the people, the wheels began to turn, and the beasts and fowls began to utter their respective cries, which frightened those who had intended to bear false testimony. Moreover, while Solomon was ascending the throne, the lions scattered all kinds of fragrant spices. After Solomon's death, Pharaoh [[Shishak]], when taking away the treasures of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] (I Kings xiv. 26), carried off the throne, which remained in Egypt until [[Sennacherib]] conquered that country. After Sennacherib's fall Hezekiah gained possession of it, but when Josiah was slain by Pharaoh [[Necho II|Necho]], the latter took it away. However, according to [[rabbinical]] accounts, Necho did not know how the mechanism worked and so accidentally struck himself with one of the lions causing him to become lame; Nebuchadnezzar, into whose possession the throne subsequently came, shared a similar fate. The throne then passed to the Persians, whose king [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] was the first to sit successfully on Solomon's throne after his death; subsequently the throne came into the possession of the Greeks and [[Ahasuerus]].<ref name=JE />\n\n==Freemasonry==\n\n[[Masonic ritual and symbolism|Masonic ritual]]s refer to King Solomon and the building of his Temple.<ref name=\"lodgechelmsford\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lodgechelmsford.com/|title=Index of /|publisher=lodgechelmsford.com|accessdate=2014-08-29}}</ref> [[Masonic Temple]]s, where a [[Masonic Lodge]] meets, are an [[allegory|allegorical]] reference to King Solomon's Temple.<ref name=\"masons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.masons.org.au/index.php|title=Freemasons NSW ACT\u2014Home|publisher=masons.org.au|accessdate=2014-08-29}}</ref>\n\n==In literature, art, and music==\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Literature===\n\n* In [[H.

Also, the two mountains which form the entrance to Kukuana Land (where the mines are located in the novel) are referred to as 'Sheba's Breasts' which could well be an allusion to the Queen of Sheba, with whom King Solomon had a relationship; or alternatively Solomon's mother, who was named Bathsheba. When in the mines the characters also contemplate what must have occurred to prevent King Solomon from ever returning to retrieve the massive amounts of diamonds, gold and ivory tusks that were found buried in his great 'Treasure Chamber'.\n* In ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' the spirit of Solomon appears to [[Dante Alighieri]] in the Heaven of the Sun with other exemplars of inspired wisdom.\n* In [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s ''[[Die Physiker]]'', the physicist M\u00f6bius claims that Solomon appears to him and dictates the \"theory of all possible inventions\" (based on ''[[Unified Field Theory]]'').\n* Solomon appears in Kipling's ''[[Just So Stories]]''.\n* In [[Neal Stephenson]]'s three-volume ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]'', 17th-century alchemists like [[Isaac Newton]] believe that Solomon created a kind of \"heavier\" gold with mystical properties and that it was cached in the [[Solomon Islands]] where it was accidentally discovered by the crew of a wayward Spanish galleon. In the third volume of ''The Baroque Cycle, The System of the World'', a mysterious member of the entourage of Czar [[Peter I of Russia]], named \"Solomon [[Kohen|Kohan]]\" appears in early 18th-century London. The czar, traveling incognito to purchase English-made ships for [[Imperial Russian Navy#Russian Navy during the reign of Peter the Great|his navy]], explains that he added him to his court after the [[Azov campaigns#The second Azov campaign|Sack of Azov]], where Kohan had been a guest of the [[Pasha]]. Solomon Kohan is later revealed as one of the extremely long-lived \"Wise,\" such as [[Enoch Root]], and compares a courtyard full of inventors' workstations to \"an operation I used to have in Jerusalem a long time ago\", denominating either facility as \"a temple\". Stephenson's sequel to ''[[Reamde]]'', 2019's ''[[Fall; or, Dodge in Hell]]'' was also a surprise sequel to the Baroque Cycle novels and ''[[Cryptonomicon]]''. In the mid- to late-21st century span of ''Fall'', Solomon Kohan has joined the faculty of Princeton University, going by ''Solly Pesador,'' and is described by a student as \"one of those guys who had ''been around forever'' and played roles in tech companies going at least as far back as [[Hewlett-Packard]]\" and as an \"old-school tech geek turned neuro-hacker.\"\n* In ''[[The Ring of Solomon|Bartimaeus: The Ring of Solomon]]'', both King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba are featured prominently.\n* Solomon, King of Urushalim, is a significant character in ''[[The Shadow Prince]]'',<ref>{{Cite book |isbn = 978-1533673503|title = The Shadow Prince|last1 = Armstrong|first1 = Philip|date = 2016-07-17}}</ref> the first novel of [[Philip Armstrong]]'s epic [[historical fantasy]], ''[[The Chronicles of Tupiluliuma]]''.

These studies showed that specific, high (hard) goals lead to a higher level of task performance than do easy goals or vague, abstract goals such as the exhortation to 'do one's best'. So long as a person is committed to the goal, has the requisite ability to attain it, and does not have conflicting goals, there is a positive, linear relationship between goal difficulty and task performance. Because goals refer to future valued outcomes, the setting of goals is first and foremost a discrepancy-creating process. It implies discontent with one's present condition and the desire to attain an object or outcome. |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237602737|citeseerx=10.1.1.553.1396 }}</ref>\n\nThe theory states that the simplest most direct motivational explanation of why some people perform better than others is because they have different performance goals. The essence of the theory is fourfold. First, difficult specific goals lead to significantly higher performance than easy goals, no goals, or even the setting of an abstract goal such as urging people to do their best. Second, holding ability constant, as this is a theory of motivation, and given that there is goal commitment, the higher the goal the higher the performance. Third, variables such as praise, feedback, or the involvement of people in decision-making only influences behavior to the extent that it leads to the setting of and commitment to a specific difficult goal. Fourth, goal-setting, in addition to affecting the three mechanisms of motivation, namely, choice, effort, and persistence, can also have a cognitive benefit. It can influence choice, effort, and persistence to discover ways to attain the goal.<ref>Latham, G. P. (2012). \"Motivate employee performance through goal-setting\". In Locke, E. Ed.

Through an understanding of the effect of goal setting on individual performance, organizations are able to use goal setting to benefit organizational performance. <ref name=\"lockeandlatham2002\"/> In addition, another aspect that goes with goal commitment is also goal acceptance. This is an individuals willingness to pursue their specific goal. <ref name=\":0\" /> Locke and Latham (2002) have indicated three moderators that indicate goal setting success:\n\n{{numbered list\n|\nThe importance of the expected outcomes of goal attainment,\n|\nSelf-efficacy: one's belief that they are able to achieve the goals,\n|\nCommitment to others: promises or engagements to others can strongly improve commitment.\n}}\n\nExpanding the three from above, the level of commitment is influenced by external factors. Such as the person assigning the goal, setting the standard for the person to achieve/perform. This influences the level of commitment by how compliant the individual is with the one assigning the goal. An external factor can also be the role models of the individual. For example, say an individual looks up to their manager and cares about his or her opinion, the individual is more likely to listen to goal-setting strategies from that individual, and ultimately become more committed to their desired goal. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nInternal factors can derive from their participation level in the work to achieve the goal. What they expect from themselves can either flourish their success, or destroy it. Also, the individual may want to appear superior to their peers or competitors. They want to achieve the goal the best and be known for it. The self-reward of accomplishing a goal, is usually one of the main keys that keep individuals committed. For example, if an individual was working toward becoming the president of their company, if they achieve their goal, they could reward themselves with something of importance to them. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother route individuals can take to set their goals is to follow (STD) that is, setting their goals to be Specific, Time-bound, and difficult.  Specifically, an individuals goal should be set at the 90th percentile of difficulty. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Goal\u2013performance relationship===\n\nLocke and colleagues (1981) examined the behavioral effects of goal-setting, concluding that 90% of laboratory and field studies involving specific and challenging goals led to higher performance than did easy or no goals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Locke |first1=Edwin A. |last2=Shaw |first2=Karyll N. |last3=Saari |first3=Lise M. |last4=Latham |first4=Gary P. |date=1981 |title=Goal setting and task performance: 1969\u20131980 |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=125\u2013152 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.90.1.125}}</ref> This is because if an individual is intrinsically motivated by a goal, he or she will want to conquer the goal to receive internal rewards, and will be satisfied because of it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLocke and Latham (2006) argue that it is not sufficient to urge employees to \"do their best\". \"Doing one's best\" has no external referent, which makes it useless in eliciting specific behavior. To elicit some specific form of behavior from another person, it is important that this person has a clear view of what is expected from him/her. A goal is thereby of vital importance because it helps an individual to focus his or her efforts in a specified direction. In other words, goals canalize behavior.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> (However, when faced with complex tasks and directions that are difficult to specify, telling someone to \"do their best\", with a focus on learning, can sometimes lead to the discovery of better strategies whereby specific goals can then be set.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/>{{rp|707}})\n\n===Feedback===\n\nGoal setting can lead to creation of [[feedback]] loops, either negative or positive comparison of the output to the goal. Negative feedback loops lead to increasing the input associated with goal attainment to improve output in the next loop cycle. Positive feedback loops if not sufficiently reinforced can lead to subsequent setting of goals at a less difficult level.\n\nWithout proper feedback channels it is impossible for employees to adapt or adjust to the required behavior. Managers should keep track of performance to allow employees to see how effective they have been in attaining their goals.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Skinner |editor1-first=Natalie |editor2-last=Roche |editor2-first=Ann M. |editor3-last=O'Connor |editor3-first=John |editor4-last=Pollard |editor4-first=Yvette |editor5-last=Todd |editor5-first=Chelsea |title=Workforce development TIPS (theory into practice strategies): a resource kit for the alcohol and other drugs field |chapter=Goal setting |location=Adelaide |publisher=Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation (AER); National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction (Australia) |year=2005 |pages=8\u20139 |isbn=978-1876897062 |oclc=156766716 |chapterurl=http://nceta.flinders.edu.au/index.php/download_file/-/view/58 |url=http://nceta.flinders.edu.au/workforce/publications_and_resources/nceta-workforce-development-resources/workforce_developemt_tips/}}</ref> Providing feedback on short-term objectives helps to sustain motivation and commitment to the goal.

These success factors are interdependent. For example, the expected outcomes of goals are positively influenced when employees are involved in the goal setting process. Not only does participation increase commitment in attaining the goals that are set, participation influences self-efficacy as well. Additionally, feedback is necessary to monitor one's progress. When feedback is not present, an employee might think they are not making enough progress. This can reduce [[self-efficacy]] and thereby harm the performance outcomes in the long run.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bandura |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Bandura |date=March 1993 |title=Perceived self-efficacy in cognitive development and functioning |journal=Educational Psychologist |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=117\u2013148 |doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2802_3 |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/bandura/pajares/Bandura1993EP.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{unordered list\n|\nGoal-commitment, the most influential moderator,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} becomes especially important when dealing with difficult or complex goals.

If they think no chance exists of reaching a goal, they may not even try.\n|\n[[Self-efficacy]]: the higher someone's self-efficacy regarding a certain task, the more likely they will set higher goals, and the more persistence they will show in achieving them.<ref>Goal-setting theory might define ''self-efficacy'' as an impression that one has the capability of performing in a certain manner or of attaining certain goals. Or one could define self-efficacy as a belief that one has the capabilities to execute the courses of actions required to [[Management|manage]] prospective situations. Unlike [[efficacy]] (defined as the power to produce an effect\u2014in essence, [[Skill|competence]]), self-efficacy consists of the belief (whether or not accurate) that one has the [[Power (sociology)|power]] to produce that effect. For example, a person with high self-efficacy may engage in more health-related activity when an illness occurs, whereas a person with low self efficacy may succumb to feelings of hopelessness. (Compare: {{cite book |last1=Sue |first1=David |last2=Sue |first2=Derald Wing |last3=Sue |first3=Stanley |last4=Sue |first4=Diane |title=Understanding abnormal behavior |year=2015 |edition=11th |page=194 |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning |isbn=9781305537606 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6CaBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT224}}) Note the distinction between [[self-esteem]] and self-efficacy. Self-esteem in this context relates to a person's sense of [[self-worth]], whereas self-efficacy relates to a person's perception of their ability to reach a goal. For example, take the case of an incompetent rock-climber. Though probably afflicted with poor self-efficacy in regard to rock climbing, this hypothetical person could retain their self-esteem unaffected.</ref>\n}}\n\n==In business==\nIn business, goal setting encourages participants to put in substantial effort. Also, because every member has defined expectations for their role, little room is left for inadequate, marginal effort to go unnoticed.\n\nManagers cannot constantly drive [[motivation]], or keep track of an employee's work on a continuous basis. Goals are therefore an important tool for managers, since goals have the ability to function as a self-regulatory mechanism that helps employees prioritize tasks.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2002\">{{cite journal |last1=Locke |first1=Edwin A. |authorlink1=Edwin A.

An example of a learning goal in executive or workplace coaching might be 'learn how to be the best lawyer in my area of practice'. Learning goals tend to be associated with a range of positive cognitive and emotional processes including perception of a complex task as a positive challenge rather than a threat, greater absorption in the actual task performance (Deci & Ryan, 2002), and enhanced memory and well-being (Linnenbrink, Ryan & Pintrich, 1999). Furthermore, individual performance can be enhanced in highly complex or challenging situations when team goals are primarily framed as being learning goals, and the use of team-level learning goals can foster enhanced co-operation between team members (Kristof-Brown & Stevens, 2001). One benefit of setting learning goals is that they tend to be associated with higher levels of intrinsic motivation which in turn is associated with performance (Sarrazin et al., 2002). |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129080651/http://coachingconsultinginternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/An-integrated-model-of-goal-focused-coaching-Grant-ICPR-2012.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}</ref><ref name=\"KeganLearningGoals\">{{cite book |last1=Kegan |first1=Robert |authorlink1=Robert Kegan |last2=Congleton |first2=Christina |last3=David |first3=Susan A |year=2013 |chapter=The goals behind the goals: pursuing adult development in the coaching enterprise |editor1-last=David |editor1-first=Susan A |editor2-last=Clutterbuck |editor2-first=David |editor3-last=Megginson |editor3-first=David |title=Beyond goals: effective strategies for coaching and mentoring |location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Gower Publishing Limited |pages=229\u2013244 |isbn=9781409418511 |oclc=828416668}}</ref>\n\n==Developments in theory==\n===Goal choice===\nSelf-efficacy, past performance, and various other social factors influence goal setting.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> Failure to meet previous goals often leads to setting lower (and more likely achievable) goals.\n\n===Learning goals===\nThere are times when having specific goals is not a best option; this is the case when the goal requires new skills or knowledge. [[Tunnel vision]] is a consequence of specific goals; if a person is too focused on attaining a specific goal, he or she may ignore the need to learn new skills or acquire new information. This concept is illustrated well by the \"basketball game task\" study in which observers watched a video of a group of people wearing white shirts and black shirts who are passing a basketball back and forth, and the observers were instructed to count the number of times a basketball is passed between only the players wearing white shirts. During the video, a woman carrying an open umbrella walks across the screen. Of 28 observers who were focused on counting the number of passes between only the players wearing white shirts, only 6 reported noticing the woman carrying the umbrella. When observers watched the video without focusing on a specific task, all of the observers noticed the umbrella woman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drjoebio.com/uploads/1/8/1/3/1813500/gorrila_in_our_midst.pdf|title=Gorillas in our Midst|last=Simons & Chabris|date=1999|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref> In situations where the risk of tunnel vision is high, the best option is to set a ''learning goal''.

Although jobs typically have set goals, individual goals and achievement can benefit from metacognition.\n\n===Framing===\n[[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]], or how goals are viewed, influences performance.

These studies showed that specific, high (hard) goals lead to a higher level of task performance than do easy goals or vague, abstract goals such as the exhortation to 'do one's best'. So long as a person is committed to the goal, has the requisite ability to attain it, and does not have conflicting goals, there is a positive, linear relationship between goal difficulty and task performance. Because goals refer to future valued outcomes, the setting of goals is first and foremost a discrepancy-creating process. It implies discontent with one's present condition and the desire to attain an object or outcome. |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237602737|citeseerx=10.1.1.553.1396 }}</ref>\n\nThe theory states that the simplest most direct motivational explanation of why some people perform better than others is because they have different performance goals. The essence of the theory is fourfold. First, difficult specific goals lead to significantly higher performance than easy goals, no goals, or even the setting of an abstract goal such as urging people to do their best. Second, holding ability constant, as this is a theory of motivation, and given that there is goal commitment, the higher the goal the higher the performance. Third, variables such as praise, feedback, or the involvement of people in decision-making only influences behavior to the extent that it leads to the setting of and commitment to a specific difficult goal. Fourth, goal-setting, in addition to affecting the three mechanisms of motivation, namely, choice, effort, and persistence, can also have a cognitive benefit. It can influence choice, effort, and persistence to discover ways to attain the goal.<ref>Latham, G. P. (2012). \"Motivate employee performance through goal-setting\". In Locke, E. Ed.

Through an understanding of the effect of goal setting on individual performance, organizations are able to use goal setting to benefit organizational performance. <ref name=\"lockeandlatham2002\"/> In addition, another aspect that goes with goal commitment is also goal acceptance. This is an individuals willingness to pursue their specific goal. <ref name=\":0\" /> Locke and Latham (2002) have indicated three moderators that indicate goal setting success:\n\n{{numbered list\n|\nThe importance of the expected outcomes of goal attainment,\n|\nSelf-efficacy: one's belief that they are able to achieve the goals,\n|\nCommitment to others: promises or engagements to others can strongly improve commitment.\n}}\n\nExpanding the three from above, the level of commitment is influenced by external factors. Such as the person assigning the goal, setting the standard for the person to achieve/perform. This influences the level of commitment by how compliant the individual is with the one assigning the goal. An external factor can also be the role models of the individual. For example, say an individual looks up to their manager and cares about his or her opinion, the individual is more likely to listen to goal-setting strategies from that individual, and ultimately become more committed to their desired goal. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nInternal factors can derive from their participation level in the work to achieve the goal. What they expect from themselves can either flourish their success, or destroy it. Also, the individual may want to appear superior to their peers or competitors. They want to achieve the goal the best and be known for it. The self-reward of accomplishing a goal, is usually one of the main keys that keep individuals committed. For example, if an individual was working toward becoming the president of their company, if they achieve their goal, they could reward themselves with something of importance to them. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother route individuals can take to set their goals is to follow (STD) that is, setting their goals to be Specific, Time-bound, and difficult.  Specifically, an individuals goal should be set at the 90th percentile of difficulty. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Goal\u2013performance relationship===\n\nLocke and colleagues (1981) examined the behavioral effects of goal-setting, concluding that 90% of laboratory and field studies involving specific and challenging goals led to higher performance than did easy or no goals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Locke |first1=Edwin A. |last2=Shaw |first2=Karyll N. |last3=Saari |first3=Lise M. |last4=Latham |first4=Gary P. |date=1981 |title=Goal setting and task performance: 1969\u20131980 |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=125\u2013152 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.90.1.125}}</ref> This is because if an individual is intrinsically motivated by a goal, he or she will want to conquer the goal to receive internal rewards, and will be satisfied because of it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLocke and Latham (2006) argue that it is not sufficient to urge employees to \"do their best\". \"Doing one's best\" has no external referent, which makes it useless in eliciting specific behavior. To elicit some specific form of behavior from another person, it is important that this person has a clear view of what is expected from him/her. A goal is thereby of vital importance because it helps an individual to focus his or her efforts in a specified direction. In other words, goals canalize behavior.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> (However, when faced with complex tasks and directions that are difficult to specify, telling someone to \"do their best\", with a focus on learning, can sometimes lead to the discovery of better strategies whereby specific goals can then be set.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/>{{rp|707}})\n\n===Feedback===\n\nGoal setting can lead to creation of [[feedback]] loops, either negative or positive comparison of the output to the goal. Negative feedback loops lead to increasing the input associated with goal attainment to improve output in the next loop cycle. Positive feedback loops if not sufficiently reinforced can lead to subsequent setting of goals at a less difficult level.\n\nWithout proper feedback channels it is impossible for employees to adapt or adjust to the required behavior. Managers should keep track of performance to allow employees to see how effective they have been in attaining their goals.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Skinner |editor1-first=Natalie |editor2-last=Roche |editor2-first=Ann M. |editor3-last=O'Connor |editor3-first=John |editor4-last=Pollard |editor4-first=Yvette |editor5-last=Todd |editor5-first=Chelsea |title=Workforce development TIPS (theory into practice strategies): a resource kit for the alcohol and other drugs field |chapter=Goal setting |location=Adelaide |publisher=Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation (AER); National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction (Australia) |year=2005 |pages=8\u20139 |isbn=978-1876897062 |oclc=156766716 |chapterurl=http://nceta.flinders.edu.au/index.php/download_file/-/view/58 |url=http://nceta.flinders.edu.au/workforce/publications_and_resources/nceta-workforce-development-resources/workforce_developemt_tips/}}</ref> Providing feedback on short-term objectives helps to sustain motivation and commitment to the goal.

These success factors are interdependent. For example, the expected outcomes of goals are positively influenced when employees are involved in the goal setting process. Not only does participation increase commitment in attaining the goals that are set, participation influences self-efficacy as well. Additionally, feedback is necessary to monitor one's progress. When feedback is not present, an employee might think (s)he is not making enough progress. This can reduce [[self-efficacy]] and thereby harm the performance outcomes in the long run.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bandura |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Bandura |date=March 1993 |title=Perceived self-efficacy in cognitive development and functioning |journal=Educational Psychologist |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=117\u2013148 |doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2802_3 |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/bandura/pajares/Bandura1993EP.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{unordered list\n|\nGoal-commitment, the most influential moderator,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} becomes especially important when dealing with difficult or complex goals. If people lack [[Personal commitment|commitment]] to goals, they lack motivation to reach them. To commit to a goal, one must believe in its importance or significance.\n|\nAttainability: individuals must also believe that they can attain\u2014or at least partially reach\u2014a defined goal. If they think no chance exists of reaching a goal, they may not even try.\n|\n[[Self-efficacy]]: the higher someone's self-efficacy regarding a certain task, the more likely they will set higher goals, and the more persistence they will show in achieving them.<ref>Goal-setting theory might define ''self-efficacy'' as an impression that one has the capability of performing in a certain manner or of attaining certain goals. Or one could define self-efficacy as a belief that one has the capabilities to execute the courses of actions required to [[Management|manage]] prospective situations. Unlike [[efficacy]] (defined as the power to produce an effect\u2014in essence, [[Skill|competence]]), self-efficacy consists of the belief (whether or not accurate) that one has the [[Power (sociology)|power]] to produce that effect. For example, a person with high self-efficacy may engage in more health-related activity when an illness occurs, whereas a person with low self efficacy may succumb to feelings of hopelessness. (Compare: {{cite book |last1=Sue |first1=David |last2=Sue |first2=Derald Wing |last3=Sue |first3=Stanley |last4=Sue |first4=Diane |title=Understanding abnormal behavior |year=2015 |edition=11th |page=194 |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning |isbn=9781305537606 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6CaBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT224}}) Note the distinction between [[self-esteem]] and self-efficacy. Self-esteem in this context relates to a person's sense of [[self-worth]], whereas self-efficacy relates to a person's perception of their ability to reach a goal. For example, take the case of an incompetent rock-climber. Though probably afflicted with poor self-efficacy in regard to rock climbing, this hypothetical person could retain their self-esteem unaffected.</ref>\n}}\n\n==In business==\nIn business, goal setting encourages participants to put in substantial effort. Also, because every member has defined expectations for their role, little room is left for inadequate, marginal effort to go unnoticed.\n\nManagers cannot constantly drive [[motivation]], or keep track of an employee's work on a continuous basis. Goals are therefore an important tool for managers, since goals have the ability to function as a self-regulatory mechanism that helps employees prioritize tasks.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2002\">{{cite journal |last1=Locke |first1=Edwin A. |authorlink1=Edwin A.

An example of a learning goal in executive or workplace coaching might be 'learn how to be the best lawyer in my area of practice'. Learning goals tend to be associated with a range of positive cognitive and emotional processes including perception of a complex task as a positive challenge rather than a threat, greater absorption in the actual task performance (Deci & Ryan, 2002), and enhanced memory and well-being (Linnenbrink, Ryan & Pintrich, 1999). Furthermore, individual performance can be enhanced in highly complex or challenging situations when team goals are primarily framed as being learning goals, and the use of team-level learning goals can foster enhanced co-operation between team members (Kristof-Brown & Stevens, 2001). One benefit of setting learning goals is that they tend to be associated with higher levels of intrinsic motivation which in turn is associated with performance (Sarrazin et al., 2002). |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129080651/http://coachingconsultinginternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/An-integrated-model-of-goal-focused-coaching-Grant-ICPR-2012.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}</ref><ref name=\"KeganLearningGoals\">{{cite book |last1=Kegan |first1=Robert |authorlink1=Robert Kegan |last2=Congleton |first2=Christina |last3=David |first3=Susan A |year=2013 |chapter=The goals behind the goals: pursuing adult development in the coaching enterprise |editor1-last=David |editor1-first=Susan A |editor2-last=Clutterbuck |editor2-first=David |editor3-last=Megginson |editor3-first=David |title=Beyond goals: effective strategies for coaching and mentoring |location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Gower Publishing Limited |pages=229\u2013244 |isbn=9781409418511 |oclc=828416668}}</ref>\n\n==Developments in theory==\n===Goal choice===\nSelf-efficacy, past performance, and various other social factors influence goal setting.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> Failure to meet previous goals often leads to setting lower (and more likely achievable) goals.\n\n===Learning goals===\nThere are times when having specific goals is not a best option; this is the case when the goal requires new skills or knowledge. [[Tunnel vision]] is a consequence of specific goals; if a person is too focused on attaining a specific goal, he or she may ignore the need to learn new skills or acquire new information. This concept is illustrated well by the \"basketball game task\" study in which observers watched a video of a group of people wearing white shirts and black shirts who are passing a basketball back and forth, and the observers were instructed to count the number of times a basketball is passed between only the players wearing white shirts. During the video, a woman carrying an open umbrella walks across the screen. Of 28 observers who were focused on counting the number of passes between only the players wearing white shirts, only 6 reported noticing the woman carrying the umbrella. When observers watched the video without focusing on a specific task, all of the observers noticed the umbrella woman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drjoebio.com/uploads/1/8/1/3/1813500/gorrila_in_our_midst.pdf|title=Gorillas in our Midst|last=Simons & Chabris|date=1999|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref> In situations where the risk of tunnel vision is high, the best option is to set a ''learning goal''. A learning goal is a generalized goal to achieve knowledge in a certain topic or field, but it can ultimately lead to better performance in specific goals related to the learning goals.<ref name=\"GrantLearningGoals\"/><ref name=\"KeganLearningGoals\"/>\n\nLocke and Latham (2006) attribute this response to [[metacognition]]. They believe that \"a learning goal facilitates or enhances metacognition\u2014namely, planning, monitoring, and evaluating progress toward goal attainment\".<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> This is necessary in environments with little or no guidance and structure. Although jobs typically have set goals, individual goals and achievement can benefit from metacognition.\n\n===Framing===\n[[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]], or how goals are viewed, influences performance. When one feels threatened and or intimidated by a high goal they perform poorer than those who view the goal as a challenge.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> The framing of a goal as a gain or a loss influences one's eventual performance.\n\n===Affect===\nRealization of goals has an effect on [[Affect (psychology)|affect]]\u2014that is, feelings of success and satisfaction. Achieving goals has a positive effect, and failing to meet goals has negative consequences.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> However, the effect of goals is not exclusive to one realm. Success in one's job can compensate for feelings of failure in one's personal life.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/>\n\n===Group goals===\nThe relationship between group goals and individual goals influences group performance; when goals are compatible there is a positive effect, but when goals are incompatible the effects can be detrimental to the group's performance.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> There is another factor at work in groups, and that is the sharing factor; a positive correlation exists between sharing information within the group and group performance.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/> In the case of group goals, feedback needs to be related to the group, not individuals, in order for it to improve the group's performance.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/>\n\nGoal concordance (agreement) among members of groups as well as concordance across hierarchies in organizations has positive performance impacts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vancouver|first=Jeffrey B.|last2=Schmitt|first2=Neal W.|date=2006-12-07|title=An exploratory examination of person\u2013organization fit: organizational goal congruence|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=44|issue=2|pages=333\u2013352|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1991.tb00962.x|issn=0031-5826}}</ref> Research evaluating affects of goals on employee commitment found an indirect relationship mediated by employee perception of organizational support, suggesting that leaders to directly support goal setting by individual employees.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hutchison|first=Steven|last2=Garstka|first2=Mary L.|date=August 1996|title=Sources of perceived organizational support: goal setting and feedback|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|volume=26|issue=15|pages=1351\u20131366|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1996.tb00075.x|issn=0021-9029}}</ref>\n\n===Goals and traits===\nOn a basic level, the two types of goals are ''learning goals'' and ''performance goals''; each possesses different traits associated with the selected goal.<ref name=\"lockeandlatham2006\"/><ref name=\"GrantLearningGoals\"/>\n\n''Learning goals'' involve tasks where skills and knowledge can be acquired, whereas ''performance goals'' involve easy-to-accomplish tasks that will make one appear successful (thus tasks where error and judgment may be possible are avoided).\n\nA more complex trait-mediation study is the one conducted by Lee, Sheldon, and Turban (2003),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Felissa K. |last2=Sheldon |first2=Kennon M. |last3=Turban |first3=Daniel B. |title=Personality and the goal-striving process: the influence of achievement goal patterns, goal level, and mental focus on performance and enjoyment |journal=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |date=April 2003 |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=256\u2013265 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.256 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10773182 |pmid=12731709}}</ref> which yielded the following results:\n\n*''Amotivated orientation'' (low confidence in one's capabilities) is associated with goal-avoidance motivation, and more generally, associated with lower goals levels and lower performance.\n*''Control orientation'' (extrinsic motivation) is associated with both avoidance and approach goals. Approach goals are associated with higher goal levels and higher performance.\n*''Autonomy goals'' (intrinsic motivation) leads to mastery goals, enhanced focus, and therefore enhanced performance.\n\n===Macro-level goals===\n''Macro-level goals'' refer to goal setting that is applied to the company as a whole.

[[snooker]] player.\n\n==Career==\n===Amateur career===\nPrior to entering the [[PIOS]] tour in 2009, Figueiredo had only played on 10-foot tables in his home country. Despite this, his results were impressive, allowing him to finish 12th on the year-end ranking list.<ref>{{cite web|title=2009\u201310 PIOS Rankings|url=http://www.global-snooker.com/PIOS-Rankings-2009-to-10.asp|publisher=Global Snooker|accessdate=6 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083353/http://www.global-snooker.com/PIOS-Rankings-2009-to-10.asp|archivedate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Figueiredo's most significant achievement however came at the 2009 [[IBSF World Snooker Championship|IBSF World Championship]], as he enjoyed a spectacular run to the final. Although he lost 10\u20138 to experienced [[Alfie Burden]], he was given a wild card by [[WPBSA]] onto the main tour for [[2010/2011 snooker season|2010/2011]].<ref name=\"T-Igor, T-Igor, burning bright in Hyderabad\">{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.global-snooker.com/241109-GS-news-IBSF-Snooker.asp\n |title       = T-Igor, T-Igor, burning bright in Hyderabad\n |publisher   = Global Snooker\n |accessdate  = 2010-06-30\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609231309/http://www.global-snooker.com/241109-GS-news-IBSF-Snooker.asp\n |archivedate = 2012-06-09\n}}</ref>\n\n===2010\u20132012===\nIn his first professional tournament, the minor-ranking [[Players Tour Championship 2010/2011 \u2013 Event 1|PTC Event 1]], Figueiredo won two matches to reach the last 32. He went further in the [[Players Tour Championship 2010/2011 \u2013 Event 3|Event 3]], losing a decider to [[Barry Hawkins]] in the last 16. At the [[2010 Shanghai Masters|Shanghai Masters]], Figueiredo beat [[Jamie O'Neill (snooker player)|Jamie O'Neill]] 5\u20134 and [[David Gilbert (snooker player)|David Gilbert]] 5\u20134 (despite being docked a frame for forgetting his cue).<ref name=\"Better late than never for Igor\">{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.foulfour.com/foul4com-news/professional-news/310-better-late-than-never-for-igor.html\n| title = Better late than never for Igor \n| publisher = Foul4.com\n| date = \n| accessdate = 2010-08-04\n}}</ref> His run ended in the last 64 losing 5\u20131 to [[Fergal O'Brien]].

From this point however, Figueiredo started to struggle for form, losing all his opening matches at the major tournaments. Thanks to his strong performances at the PTC events he was able to retain his tour card for the 2011/12 season, despite finishing only 80th in the world rankings.\n\nDue to the lack of sponsorship Figueiredo only entered qualifying for one ranking event of the next season, the [[2012 World Snooker Championship|2012 World Championship]], where he won three matches, before losing 7\u201310 to [[Shailesh Jogia|Joe Jogia]].<ref name=\"fig11/12\">{{cite web | url=http://snooker.org/res/index.asp?player=18&season=2011 | title=Igor Figueiredo 2011/2012 | publisher=Snooker.org | accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> He also participated in the inaugural [[2011 Brazil Masters|Brazil Masters]] and defeated world number 17 Jamie Cope in the first round 4\u20132,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/17092011/58/cope-stunned-brazil-masters.html | title=Cope stunned at Brazil Masters | publisher=[[Eurosport]] | date=16 September 2011 | accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> but then lost by the same scoreline to [[Graeme Dott]] in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"fig11/12\"/>\n\n===2013\u20132017===\nIn 2013, Figueiredo returned to Main Tour after receiving the nomination from the Americas region, but the lack of sponsorship again forced him to sit out the whole season until the [[2014 World Snooker Championship|2014 World Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/55/bd/0,,13165~179541,00.pdf |title=Tour Players 2013/2014 |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|World Snooker]] |accessdate=3 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017122812/http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/55/bd/0%2C%2C13165~179541%2C00.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2013 }}</ref> He repeated his last 64 run of 2012 as he beat [[Adam Duffy]] 10\u20134 in the first qualifying round, and followed it with 10\u20138 win against [[Gerard Greene]], but suffered a heavy 10\u20131 defeat to [[Martin Gould]] in the penultimate round.<ref name=\"2013/14\">{{cite web|title=Igor Figueiredo 2013/2014|url=http://www.snooker.org/res/index.asp?season=2013&player=18|publisher=Snooker.org|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>\nFigueiredo also took part in the snooker tournament at the [[Snooker at the World Games 2013 \u2013 men's singles|2013 World Games]], where he lost 3\u20132 to [[Dechawat Poomjaeng]] in the bronze medal match.<ref name=\"2013/14\"/>\n\nFigueiredo finally managed to gain sponsorship before the [[2014 UK Championship (snooker)|2014 UK Championship]], and was able to enter all the remaining tournaments of the [[Snooker season 2014/2015|2014/2015 season]]. At the UK Championship he defeated [[Fergal O'Brien]] 6\u20134 to reach the last 64, where he lost 6\u20134 to [[Anthony McGill (snooker player)|Anthony McGill]].
